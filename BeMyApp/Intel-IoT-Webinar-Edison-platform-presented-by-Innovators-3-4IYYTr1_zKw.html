third and last Intel IOT webinar so I am
Beatrice from BMI app we organized this
series of for dinner with Intel so I am
here with uric and dark from Intel and
the diabetes help her team who will
present to you enough units their device
so for those who have not attended the
body now before how does it work well
you can ask all of your questions yep
chat and we will answer them immediately
before giving in the hand through your
week will present the entire design and
IOT in general I will I would like to
ask you a question by Paul to know you
better and so we can make more
personalized webinars ever even more
personalized webinars next time so let
me launch the poll now
you
you just gives you can't even more to
answer the question
so I will close the full mouth and give
the handler to deloitte
Thank You Beatrice and I'm assuming you
can all see my screen by now if you
can't be at risk just up just shout if I
need to do something different um so Hey
hi everyone and now what welcomed as
Beatrice said this is our first IOT
innovation webinar so my name is your
excedrin i worked at Intel and I'm in
trouble orders on our IOT inventor and
makeup platforms for Vinny immaculate um
in the webinar today some of me some of
you may have attended previous webinar
so so you start to know some of the
structure the idea is really to give the
floor to some of the inventors out there
but before that I'll give this quick
introduction on IOT innovation generally
speaking and what what Intel does in
this area and then we'll have the team
based in Israel are that has developed a
diabetes helper solution and they've
actually one hour make it pro challenge
are you for this year so that they'll
take most of this webinar actually to go
through the solution that they have
developed and then we'll wrap up at the
end of this so I UT innovation um so
before we we talk about IOT on the
innovation part obviously there's the
internet of thing opportunity which is
which is massive and we have a couple of
numbers out there from analysts this one
comes from IDC but it identifies about
50 billion connected devices by 2020
which is a huge potential and these
devices planned from home automation
device to healthcare the industrial
sector things around the small cities or
transportation
so there's really multiple sector of the
industry and of our lives that the dark
touch paya but by this I LT now to me be
more interesting part to look into is
what word the innovation is coming from
when you look at the Internet of Things
and a lot of the innovation is it is
actually coming from entrepreneurs and
startups inventors who get really
creative about solving some of these
issues that we have in our daily lives
or in some of these industry verticals
and come up really really fast with some
prototyping and be able to go to market
and privatize their solution there very
quickly so a lot of the innovation is
coming from there and I think there's a
couple of elements that's underpin this
strength but I think the one word that
summarizes the the reasons for this
trends is is the word accessibility and
you have accessibility at all levels
from think of it from a sales
perspective with online sales and a much
easier access to to online store and
sometimes even physical stores link to
online stores from a crowdfunding
perspective if you look at the financing
part the the software tools or getting
easier to use but then the last bit to
this which probably came a little later
is the access to very easy to use
Hardware prototype and development
boards and this actually complements the
other areas and provides a very good mix
for startups and innovators to go and
and really get from idea to prototype to
production and go to market so the other
thing I wanted to cover briefly in this
introduction is what is until doing
about
about this and how we are supporting
this trend and the industry around the
Internet of Things and I want you to
touch on two elements specifically what
one is from a product perspective and
then on the next slide I'll talk a
little bit about some of the programs
and support that we have for today's
ecosystem so for a product perspective
there's been a couple of products in the
past but i think that the latest product
that really fit in into this space is
the Intel Edison development platform
and this platform is is really developed
to know the barrier to entry for
developing hardware devices it's it's a
sort of full computer in something that
is just about the size of the nest d
cards so that gives you the sense of how
small this is but but it packs a lot of
Technology in there it has dual core
atom it has a microcontroller in
addition to that to go and listen to all
the sensors that can be connected
through 40 GD iOS it has one gig of ram
for gigs of storage on the board itself
and then it has all the connectivity you
need with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth low-energy
and all of the suspect in a very small
form factor which essentially means that
you can use this with some expansion
board for early prototyping but but you
can then move from the the first sort of
ideation quick prototype to a more
evolved prototype and eventually to a
production-ready platform that allows
you to go to market so from a product
perspective this allows you to go are
from ideation to production was a single
platform I'll since so that's one of the
area I wanted to touch on more on the
product size the other piece I wanted to
cover on what Intel is doing around IOT
is in terms of these supporting programs
and there's two things I mentioned here
one is the internet of thing ignition
labs we have a couple of these labs five
and expanding to seven and nine in the
next few months in various cities so we
have one in the UK we have one in
Germany one in Israel one in Sweden to
name a few Russia is also coming on
board with with Moscow and and these are
spaces where you get access to engineers
and some equipments it's available for
large enterprise but also for startups
if you want to come over and optimize us
and some of your projects so that that's
one element the other one is called
challenge up and Challenger is it's
essentially an IOT accelerator program
and this is a joint initiative by Intel
along with cisco and deutsche telekom
and we're still in the recruiting face
so if you google challenge up you'll get
to the page where you can sign up submit
your ideas and these will be evaluated
and if there is the best ideas will
actually be selected to get into this I
OT accelerated program for the next
couple of the next couple of months so
there's many other things we do besides
these but I think these were two very
important initiative that that show a
little bit how Intel is are supporting
dr the vehicle system so with that I
will close on this introduction and I
will leave it up to the team in Israel
to go and talk about their diabetes
helper solution on and I'll give the
floor to uh Marie will talk about their
solution hi can you see misc I hope you
can see my screen and just a second ok
so my name is a me and I will talk to
you in this lecture about the
trying to trying to make an idea in a
product too often papers with
algorithmic solutions to medical
problems remain in just a paper in an
engineering journal because they there
is a lot of intimidation from the move
where to real time systems platforms
such as the Edison or the Guerrero they
provide engineers a smooth transition
from simulation to invent tension and
processes signal processing engineers
and we try to solve the problem that day
when taken out of the medical context is
familiar into any signal processing
engineer we were trying to estimate the
transfer function in with the medical
context the engineering problem may
became an emotional girl providing 100
million diabetics in third world
countries in an affordable way to
control their blood glucose levels
without any needles with their the sun
and this challenge was no longer with
just a computer simulation for us mmm
we'll be talking about how when
engineers how an engineer perceives this
kind of problems i'm about to move where
throats a real time and they from the
lab trot reality hey we'll talk about
real problems in that we are trying to
solve and then we'll talk about a real
solution for these problems and so an
engineer looks at everything as a system
in the human body for us is a system a
system is an input a transfer function
that they changes this input somehow and
then output this input could be sound
waves light waves it could be radio
waves and the body will react in a
certain way in there when a is sampling
this say where
as it comes out from the body and things
change as the body changes so does the
transfer function and so if we met the
transfer function in the change any of
the transfer function to body changes a
we are able to estimate make the
different parameters we can every
instance a estimated the blood oxygen
levels and we can estimate the glucose
levels we can maybe even estimate if
there is a disease if there is cancer
it's all in the waves as we channel them
through the body and it all depends on
how accurate we are able to map the body
changes in to the transfer function some
waves say you want a show us the
information we need but some waves say
might might as well do a little bit
about machine learning in machine
learning in NJ for engineers allows us
to outsource a lot of the difficulty
scientifical questions in to the machine
to the computer i am not a chemist and
my friends aren't biologist or
physicians and we do not really know how
a different a light waves interact with
different molecules but s as engineers
we can input all of the data into some
algorithm that receives lots of data
that we have no way idea about the
connections between a different data
points in different things and we can
loop and we can give the algorithm a
sudden a timing some a grand truths and
let it find out the connections and so
after the computer it looks at the data
during the lady during the learning
stage it can create a model that can
then be used in order to classify things
and it different a a part of the
learning stage aim for example here we
can see a different kind of a learning
in sometimes we do not even have a
ground to you for instance saying for a
glucose meter brewing if we would like
to learn about the way the way body
changes SI s in relations today in a
different air wave outcomes we can look
at there as you can see here there
unsupervised learning and let the
Machine find out the different clusters
and say for instance that this cluster
means say means low way glucose levels
and another cluster means I'm late
because levels we can name me if we can
use a supervised learning if we have
lots of ground roof and we measured and
people say the blood glucose levels say
prior today experiment and checked the
wave outcome we can tell the computer
what a different data means and let the
computer make the connection after the
computer makes the connection we can
then give the a model to people that
were interested and we didn't have a
data about the glucose levels and the
computer will they be able to use the
model in the wave input in order to
understand water is there a blood
glucose levels without any testing with
needles a semi-supervised learning is a
even a better technique because they
sometimes
you don't have a lot of ground truth and
you don't want to invest a lot of money
in testing using the needles or stuff
like that and you can give the computer
just a little bit of ground troops and
let it they understand for itself the
different clusters so the movement rods
real time in is a very difficult one for
a engineers in the lab you have all of
your web settings and you don't have to
start dealing with a performance with a
a power consumption you don't have to
deal with the different statistical
outliers you just stay in using your
matlab or another way a program that you
can use in the web and check out the
result but in real life you people want
to get the result very quickly they want
a product that do not a waste a lot of
electricity or do not waste the battery
in it too much and they we have to deal
with a lot of pace statistical outliers
here for instance a people are very
different from one another and some may
people may fit the model perfectly but
some may be very different in the
product is such as ours cannot afford to
fail because they someone is just a
little different because they after all
we are all in just a little different so
what we were trying to solve in diabetes
is not some rare disease that they is
unknown to the world lots of people
around the world according to the
International Diabetes Federation in
more than 300 million people fa diabetes
it's not a disease that they exist only
on
only in the Western world diabetes
affect the people all over the world but
they the problem is that day while in
the Western countries in stuff like a
diabetes meter and testing strips are a
subsidized in in the developing world in
glucose meters and testing strips I
ranae aren't a subsidized and so a
thousands of millions of people cannot
afford him in when they when in diabetes
at when a diabetic care is monitoring
the his or her a blood glucose level he
is using a one-time testing strips these
strips are a very cheap but can amount
to a lots of their dollars each month
because they are one time and you are
doing lots of and lots of a tests and so
this is the problem we were trying to
solve how to reduce this price way of
monitoring in solo and we would like to
allow millions of people need to effort
the glucose meter and they be able to
monitor their blood glucose levels our
solution does not involve any needles
using the machine learning and transfer
function estimation that they mentioned
earlier in we are able to use infrared
infrared light and estimate the transfer
function in the after creating the model
in during a production we are able to
now estimate the blood glucose levels of
a person that wasn't everywhere they
tested the during the model construction
there is no needles involve known
testing strips and so where things are
much more cheaper and we have the
trade-off
you see it here in each word price and
the our goal was to give a solution to
people that currently have none and so
in anything and we checked with medical
personnel what is the what is the
threshold for us to be helpful towards
people and so that we can make a as much
as it a chip chip device as much as we
can and that will be accurate enough for
these people to have a better solution
than none in we have created something
that is just a plug and play a baby
users can receive they can receive the
glucose meter and our glucose meter that
does not important any needles they can
input their finger and get the result
and since we knew that the people in
developing countries may not have a
access to batteries or electrical
sources we decided to make it a
solar-powered rain mechanically a
powered so that they wouldn't have to
change batteries often or use their
outside electrically sources and then
the whole thing does use a battery but
they charge a precharge just say every
time me there is a light blue aim so
Lucas monitoring is just one problem and
then many more can be solved using the
same technique that i was talking about
a transfer for estimating a transfer
fraction and names in learning you don't
have to really understand the chemistry
you just have to understand the general
to have a general notion of a highway
stuff away in different waves interact
with the body interest
son can help solve many problems because
as much of GPU gpios because it has low
power consumption and the very good day
performance and then we are hoping that
the other groups would use the same
technology and help save lives and help
a fine solution to find solutions to
other problems in this is the end of a
in my presentation so we will be happy
to answer any questions you might have
and I see I see here there is a question
and there is an emphasis on helping
others does this mean the schematics and
source code will be made available open
source and currently we are trying to
understand how we can make a key thing
available to as many people as we can we
were even thinking about them making the
3d model a available to pretend to
people so they could purchase say a
little a electronic aids and they may
even a printed another location the
product and just stay in insert today
electronic parts and we are discussing
in these possibilities with different
people of course there are way
reliability issues and the stuff like
that we don't want the people to use a
to use the code and then a and then tell
us say it doesn't work because it
because they your code they didn't work
I in no way I got a errors in my day in
my glucose a monitoring it and may even
may affect lives and so where we have to
consider a our way
the implications say of giving the code
to people a but we are trying to find
out how we can really give us many
people they access to this product and
in the cheapest way and let's see if
there is a there are more questions and
i canít yeah and does it mean any setup
or standardization before use and so
when our goal is in to make it as i said
before we just plug and play aim we are
working on the model is so what you you
don't have to make any calibration
source stuff like that just a input the
finger and then in watched a you watch
the glucose levels mmm we are currently
at the very very early stage you we just
had the competition a few months ago a
few months ago but our goal is to make
it as i said just plug and play no need
a reni standardization of setup and let
me check for a molar questions and how
much that i did you crunchy to get the
transfer function well we use in array
of sensors in order to get a as much
accurate results as we can we are a
sampling the data for a period of time
of course there is the price issue we
are trying to sample as much data as we
can on the other hand in the most sense
riyals we have in day
the higher the price and that the users
have to pay and we're trying to trade
off these there two issues so we could
day so we could give the users as a
stripper a product as we can hey butter
on the same time have a better result in
even accurate results for them and so
they could really monitor their blood
glucose levels in an effective way and
what programming language did you use a
well we have a an electrical engineer we
are electrical engineers and so away
when we started this project we were
using the matlab hey sensei for us it's
the easiest way to in programming and
use in the test different algorithms and
it was signal processing you play the
Edison we have the you know wrote in a
sea so when we could program the Edison
but that's about it and let's see what
wavelength do you use well we use a a
both visible and infrared a light we are
talking infrared easy and can be divided
into new infrared mid-infrared in the
higher M de higher than the frequency
the higher day a wavelength the more in
the murder price they go with the price
goals are and so again there with the
trade-offs a pro us we've tested the
different wavelengths and we will win
the eye
we can but now in begins the process to
reduce the number of wavelengths and
then given the frequency so where the
main product itself would be cheaper the
second and how do i how do i type 1
diabetic and try your device well where
we are to an IC unit on me answer this
question but i will answer again we are
at a very early stage we are currently
working on the on the product as soon as
we can we will start a a providing it to
the world and then may we could J start
the testing with a alpha beta versions
and I hope we'll get to a point where we
can say that the device is now when
complete and they can be used for people
and let's see the second about the core
ideas so you use an infrared beam that
is being transferred through the finger
a deep and the output things being
sampled right yeah exactly there and we
are trying to see maybe the finger isn't
the best organ to be tested and there
are other points in the body that we can
test but for now we are using the finger
when we get a quite good results we are
trying to see if we can may may be other
body parts
can give the better results but again a
different trade-offs a crime to mind in
like a price and the user interface and
a the easel in which users can use the
device and have you added the approval
from any medical authorities well well
the accuracies reliable enough to be
used in hospitals aim where we have
talked to many doctors and we are
currently talking to them and as I said
before in we are trying to make it as
cheap as possible and the s it becomes
paper the accuracy goes down but we are
talking to an ethical personnel and in
order to understand the how low can we
go so we could make it the strip as
possible and again let's say look at the
more questions do you measure the
glucose levels in blood or into in
special lately well as I said before we
are nothing medically where we have no
medical training will not take chemists
or a biologist we see it as a transfer
function in we test our results he based
on a blood glucose a in moniker that
does use needles and we checked our way
our results stand up to the results from
me the devices to do use needles and as
I said you can get an accuracy that is
quite good day in relations to these
devices that
problem again is to make it cheap as
possible I have no in reference to day
operations I have no idea exactly what
I'm a testing I just look at it as a
transfer function and maybe I'm testing
in the blog maybe something else but I'm
comparing my results to a blood glucose
a monitor hey it will read give you one
last question if there's two questions
okay and have you thought about me on
using the data to assess the amount of
insulin vial between shots and well I
think it's a too early to say might come
in a much more way at the bench stage
again we are not the physicians and I
don't have the amount of knowledge
required to answer this question right
now but I guess is the project as the
project moves along we would behave very
we would talk more and more with
physicians and maybe try to improve the
devices such as we can yeah for now our
only aim is to a measure the blood
glucose levels hey hey thanks very much
for this presentation and all those all
those questions and answers we're a
little bit behind the half hour odd that
was set so I just wanted to wrap this up
by leaving you is a 22 additional links
that are again more on on the product
side and then obviously we'll send you
an email where you can find replays of
this whole presentation was the content
from arm from for this team as well
so the first thing I want you to leave
with you is maker intercom and this is
really where you will find what most of
the product related information and how
to get started with these products the
second one I wanted to leave with you is
software intel.com / io t and this is
where you will find more of the
community help software libraries and
development kit to help you develop and
find examples of code and samples of
things that have already been developed
with something like Edison so with that
thank you for attending I do believe
that Beatrice had a last hole that you
wanted to run the Beatrice yes
absolutely just to wrap up there's a
last question that we wanted to ask you
well about what you thought about this
webinar I'll just do G 30 seconds to 20
back
you
ok so i will just close the the full now
you
I can see some last questions on the
chat do you want to answer the last ones
Aubrey or should we answer them yeah
email and tried to answer some of the
mayor and now but they would be better
just to over there you know but the
question is going to people time yes
well will we call this this question
perfect and will enter them directly by
you by email okay so thanks everyone I
think thank you remember Thank You
Beatrice Thank You Omri and the team
over there and thanks everyone for
attending thank you very end of day bye
everyone bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
