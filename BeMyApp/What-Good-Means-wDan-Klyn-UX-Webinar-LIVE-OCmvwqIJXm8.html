another be my webinar will be starting
shortly once again will be starting very
shortly
you
you
hey folks once again we'll be starting
very shortly
you
hi ladies and gentlemen welcome to
another be my webinars as always I'm
Fernando and it's awesome having all of
you here and today's webinar we're gonna
have Dan Klein from grandpa Quran Rapids
Michigan and also the co-founder of the
understanding group he's going over us
what actually good means and the user
experience and we'll offer to do and
we'll let the man gentlemen speak for
himself so Dan you have the stage and
right before anybody else keep going
just a quick reminder folks if you have
any questions at the end you can just
have them in the comments section where
we're checking them out so Dan you have
the mic thank you fernando thank
everybody for joining i'm going to be
sharing my screen here so if you hang on
for just a moment okay it says ice cream
sharing and you should correct okay um
well the the question of what good means
is a pretty personal question I think
and so you are going to have to endure a
little bit of contextualizing just who I
am in order for me to be effective in
talking with you about this exceedingly
important question of what good means
especially for the kinds of work that we
do making digital products and services
so to introduce myself my name is Dan
Klein I am an information architect and
I live in West Michigan and this is a
graphic from a t-shirt that was made by
some friends of mine as a joke because
West Michigan where we live it turns out
it is not the epicenter of progressive
culture it is the epicenter of Dutch
immigrant culture and a very particular
kind of dutch immigrant culture so where
I live here in West Michigan there is a
city called Holland and in the
seventeenth and eighteenth and a little
bit in the nineteenth centuries people
from the Netherlands who had
very severe religious beliefs uh who
didn't like the freedom of expression
and ideas in Europe they left the
Netherlands to come to the the frontier
at that time in this new country of
America where they could have their
backward beliefs be just fine so they
all moved to this place where is near
where I live and the belief system that
these people were basically kicked out
of the Netherlands for adopting is
called calvinism and you can say what
you like about Calvinism it's the
tradition that I was raised in and i
have since rejected most of the
teachings of this way of practicing
religion but one of the things that
Calvinism offers and I believe one of
the reasons that people who live where I
live are so attracted to this way of
thinking and this philosophy is because
it offers certainty um very
black-and-white kind of certainty to
know for sure who is in and who is out
when it comes to after you die do you
get to go to heaven this religion
provided absolute certainty for some of
the biggest questions in life and I
couldn't still make a lot of the other
things that come along with this
religion but I sure did miss certainty
as I left the region and I went to
college I left this Calvinism behind and
I traded in the church for the library
and this is a picture of the library in
Detroit which is one of the places where
I did mice
I do it in graduate study and the topic
that I focused on when I went off to
college was not information architecture
it was
as a literature and I was
was the book by James Joyce his famous
novel which is called Ulysses and in
retro found some of the
focus of my studies as a youngster
leaving West Michigan is because this is
another kind of certainty at the time
that I was studying literature there was
no other work of literature in english
that was accorded higher praise or more
universally accepted as being good than
this book and and so i started studying
this book in earnest and perhaps what i
was looking for in studying this was
certainty that i was spending my time on
something good and valuable uh but the
more that i dug into it the more that I
discovered that certainty is not part of
the study of this book and while it
might be pretty stable as a something
that would be in a syllabus in schools
that are teaching English novels the
novel itself is famously full of
instability in 1922 when James Joyce
tried to publish this novel its content
was considered pornography and nobody
was willing to print this book because
they would have been colluding in
pornography and so the story of how this
book came to be published and just how
unreliable it is as a text that started
to turn me on to the ideas of
information architecture and this book
and I didn't have the word information
architecture at this time I had no idea
what information architecture was this
is around 1996 but what this book was
doing was information architecture um by
any today we would look back at this and
say yeah for sure one of the reasons why
Ulysses is such a great work is because
of the way it has been architected
across all of these kinds of different
layers it is not simply a novel it is a
highly complex series of information
structures that operate across all of
these different layers where humans are
is and and it beguiled me it completely
fascinated me and so I started losing uh
what I lost in certainty that you could
know anything for sure about this book I
was gaining in appreciation for
complexity and how something could
operate across many many different
levels and layers and so I had I had
been planning on becoming this guy and
the book that I would be holding if this
were a picture of me in my sense of what
my future would be would be Ulysses and
I would be an academic and I would study
this book forever and it would be great
but I didn't turn out to be this guy
instead I turned out to be this guy this
is a picture of me from circa nineteen
ninety nine maybe 2000 actually and as a
library science student and literature
student focused on Ulysses when the
internet and the world wide web became a
really big deal it turned out that I had
all of these skills that were wanted by
technology businesses who were making
the first generation of websites so I
didn't turn out to be a literature
student I shifted my focus and started
working on websites and you can see
behind me that there are there's a
dreamweaver box there's a couple of
boxes with flash software in it a
javascript book an HTML for book um I
became very good at producing web pages
and especially using this technology um
which is all but uh removed from our
lives today on the web many would
applaud that's the case but back in the
year 2000 2001 in the early aughts if
you could make things using flash you
had a skill that was in very high demand
and so I got to work on a lot of really
cool websites and cd-roms and things
because I was good at the tools and so
the first sort of step on this journey
I'm taking you through this afternoon or
this evening depending on where you're
tuning in from what does good mean the
first sort of stop that I took on this
journey after leaving a religion that
provided
framework for what it means I left that
behind and what I learned out in the
business world working on the web was
that what good means is being able to
make something be pixel perfect the
designers that I worked with were
unaccustomed to technologists being able
to make their Photoshop layouts show up
in a web browser exactly the way that
they designed it again this is 2001-2002
but I new ways especially using 3,000
nested tables and or flash to make it
look exactly how they designed it and
one of the mediums that we used were
these little business card size cd-roms
where we could have complete control
over everything motion typography fonts
kerning letting high-resolution
photography at least for the time by
completely controlling the environment
and putting it burning it onto a disk
every aspect of what was presented to
users was under my control and I was
highly valued for this as a young
professional and so if what good means
is pixel perfect the tactic that you
could use to achieve achieve that kind
of perfection what I was doing was
mastery of a medium so if it was HTML or
flash I could completely totally do I
could make it be good um as soon as CSS
and other types of things started to
come onto the scene I started to lose
this ability to be a master of the
medium for a while by mastering the
medium that I was working in I I could
make it be good it could be exactly like
the layout and maybe another way to talk
about this tactic would be to say we
could make things better and that's why
people valued us webmasters and web
producers sort of the first generation
of people who are building the web um we
could make it be better for example we
pioneered in one of the companies that I
work for a wonderful company that still
exists today called fry back in 2003 we
worked with a company to pioneer the use
of flash
in the checkout and what and that may
sound like a terrible idea to you all
but back then this technology allowed us
to make the check out via rich Internet
application and what that meant for our
users we tested the checkout process
with users and we found that if they
became confused or they lost confidence
in the HTML check out they would just
close the browser and go away and so
what we were positing and we proved out
through iterative design and user
testing is when users are able to go a
synchronous ly through the checkout so
if this check out has four steps what
flash allowed us to do that HTML 3
couldn't do was let the user go back and
forth and check out without refreshing
the screen to confidently see everything
that they had entered into the checkout
process and what this did was it
outperformed the HTML version of the
checkout hugely and the client loved it
we had made check out way better and the
people who checked out using our flash
based check out uh the company made more
money off of them and conversion went up
by double digits so through our user
experience design through our
information architecture work through
iterative user testing user centered
design we absolutely made this better
there's no doubt we won awards for the
work um problem is we didn't make it
good um the client bought this software
platform that was not compatible with
the system's underneath the website it
turns out that there is a huge ecosystem
of information systems and technology
not necessarily directly connected to
the website but that affect the ability
of the website to be a successful part
of the overall information ecology and
we were not working in terms of
information ecology we were working in
terms of making this one website butter
and we had made it better and in the
process uh we didn't make it good and
the store went out of business
so we made it better but in the process
we made it bad we designed an excellent
award-winning user experience but
because we were not thinking in terms of
ecosystem the websites success was not
aligned with the rest of the ecosystem
and it all fell apart and the customer
ended up wasting a couple million
dollars and just shutting the whole
thing down a year after they launched it
so that was bad and that left me
scratching my head I had a way of
knowing what good means which is making
it pixel perfect and making it better in
iteratively incrementally better through
user testing and a/b comparison testing
but we hadn't made it good so I was
looking for something else at this point
in my career also CSS was coming in and
I was losing my expertise and so as a
producer so I started looking for advice
I started looking for somebody who could
help me navigate this and this is a
picture of two a really important
American architects denise scott brown
and robert venturi and what ms scott
brown said i started reading about
architects and and what she said is
architects in particular look to gurus
to help them understand what good means
and she likened it to what people did
with putting a figurehead on the front
of a ship which is a there is an
uncharted place that we need to go into
and we don't know what is over there
there be dragons out there and so let's
put something magic on the front of the
ship and we can navigate this by magic
and Miss Scott Brown cautioned us from
doing that with in this case architects
some sort of really smart awesome
architect that we could well we'll just
put them on the front of our ship and do
what they do she warns against this
actually and instead she and her husband
robert venturi rather than trying to
figure out what good means
um and and finding a guru to put on the
front of your ship to tell you what that
means they suggested that we back away
from using the standard of goodness all
together and in a kind of ironic way
adopt a different standard which is
almost all right they looked at Main
Street USA as architects and said the
things that people make in the built
environment like a restaurant here or a
bar this is a picture I took in austin
texas for I'm sorry I think this might
be Athens Georgia but any case it's a
plane building with a sign jammed on the
front with a big arrow pointing inside
it says this is it and they liked this
better than fancy architecture they like
basically a undifferentiated box like
this building with a fake front on it to
give it more presence on the street and
a really clear sign on the front that
helps people know what it is and if
today this is a restaurant or a bar the
same structure could be repurposed with
a different sign that sign could say
library and all of a sudden it's a
library or the sign could say a user
experience design consultancy and then
it's a user experience design
consultancy so they backed away from
talking about good all together and the
attitude that they adopted so tactically
on the tactic for doing it almost all
right is to adopt an attitude that they
call deadpan so not really taking it too
seriously and almost all right being the
criteria for what good means so this is
a picture of a website that I worked on
this website still exists it's a
wonderful resource called the all music
guide or allmusic com um the art
director that I worked with when i did
the production work to make this website
and the screenshot here is a couple
maybe four years after we worked on it
the design direction here i think is a
lot like what's venturi and scott brown
were talking about with doing it deadpan
the art director knew that the people
who worked on this
site they were going to put all kinds of
stuff on here they were going to screw
up the typefaces from time to time so it
was a really loose grid that would allow
all kinds of adaptations to happen and
if the colors were a little bit off for
the Indians were a little bit wonky on
some browser that's okay the attitude
here is to make a mitten instead of a
glove if the best music site in the
world would fit a music lover like a
glove doing a deadpan is to say well we
aren't going to shoot for doing it good
we're just going to try to accommodate
any number of things so you pull a
mitten on your hand what the fingers do
inside of their fingers can do any
number of things you pull a glove arm
you're locked into a certain kind of way
of using that structure of the of the
gloss versus the mitten so so I kind of
like this approach uh but it felt like
giving up too much it felt like if you
needed to make a glove and all you can
really come up with is mittens that
that's not going to make the customer
happy eh and I've colored this slide
yellow because it's also at least in
English there's this this expression a
jaundiced eye sort of a yellow film over
what you look at that makes it sort of
that spoils it and I really couldn't
adopt this as my methodology I couldn't
make it be pixel perfect all the time
anymore so that I couldn't do that I
considered a way of working where you
would loosely accommodate things and not
try to make it be good and that didn't
fit me either so um what I found was
somebody else may be more like the mode
of putting a figurehead on the front of
the ship but this is where it really
started to get interesting for me as an
information architect and as a designer
encountering the work of Richard Saul
Wurman who invented the ted conference
he also invented information
architecture for all intents and
purposes but he did it back in the 1970s
and 80s so the digital people in the
early aughts who I was taking my cues
from as
as a web designer web producer most of
those kinds of people had never heard of
this guy he was trained as an architect
and what he said good means was really
clear and he talked about it in those
terms he said that making things be good
is making the complex clear and that
this isn't necessarily making things
look good but this is absolutely about
making things be good and those are
that's a direct quote here at last was a
designer who was talking in the language
that I was uh that was resonating for me
which is I want to know what good means
mr. woman has a really clear way of
talking about what it means which is
making the complex clear and he
positions his ideas as being different
from designers he was trained as an
architect this is a picture of him
sitting on the steps of a house that he
designed and built on Long Beach Island
in New Jersey he said that designers
have a problem that designers have a
classic pervasive seduction that they
are subject to which is finding a
solution instead of the truth and if the
truth is that you have a hand with five
fingers and you need to do stuff when
it's cold and not have your hands freeze
off uh actually the truth is you need a
mitten George I'm sorry you need a glove
not a mitten and so talking about the
truth and talking about making complex
things clear in terms of honesty and
truth all of this was really really
resonating with me as a young designer
and the more I studied mr. Worman the
more i found out that all his ideas come
from his teacher which was the great
American architect Louis Kahn who died
in 1974 mr. woman worked for Luke on for
two years in the early 60s they were
dear friends and the influence of Luke
on on mr. Worman and this kind of
thinking about information architecture
it'd be hard to overstate so what mr.
Khan told mr. women
is that architects work differently than
other professionals and I and I would
say differently than a designer what the
architect does is try to find out what's
the truth and that might not be the same
thing as what the client says they want
Luke on said an architect should not
take the program which in in
architecture means the list of the
things that the building is supposed to
do as far as the client is concerned he
said that architects don't just take
that list of requirements and give it to
the client as if you're filling a
doctor's prescription architects are not
pharmacists um what architects do is try
to figure out what good means and what's
the truth and not starting with solving
the problem starting with going backward
from the problem to ask what's true this
is a picture of mr. Gorman at his
graduation from Penn with his beloved
teacher Luo calm and that attitude um
what Luke on said was that the client
has all of these requirements and the
client wants things to be just so um but
that a good architecture doesn't only
address the immediate need of the client
and I have a very short video clip here
I hope that it delivers over this Google
hangout that we're using but a little
bit of Luke on ennis own words talking
about what good means and how you
respond to what the client is asking for
its deep human agreement it turns out so
here's here's motivating plan as against
a room is a society of rooms the rooms
must talk to each other how much the
plan society of room is talking two
rooms can we come alive if you make that
which is a good place to live in a good
place to sleep in a good place to study
in a house is only
when it's great for the next man not
only the client who was of just so bad
for burning in my considerations of
things I said that the greatest act in
building a house yesterday the house no
I'm a house which is specific and of
course it's what you've ever for the
house is what you consider it what that
didn't really play back all that long
i'm sorry i had some interruptions from
notifications but long story short is a
a good work of architecture Lucan says
is good not just for the initial client
who wants it just so it's 50 years
forward in the future the next man who
has to use that structure that it would
be good for him or her also so the
tactic here to make things be good in
this sense is to go backward from the
problem of client wants you to build
them a specific house and you go
backward into what Luke on called a sort
of a deep place of human agreement where
you would be addressing the problem of
house not the specific house that the
customer wants you to make them of
course you end up building that
eventually but in order to make things
good you go backward from that problem
of the specific house for the client and
you take on the question of what is
house really and that to me is a
difference between architecture and
design is going backward from the
problem and figuring out how that
problem is situated inside of deeper
more vast structures in society in the
environment that is the mode of
architecture and that is different than
the mode of design at least for Luke on
and for Richard Saul Wurman you can go
to visit Luke ons buildings and you get
this sentence at least I do this is a
picture of the kimball Museum in Fort
Worth Texas
that this does result in buildings and
experiences in space that people agree
people from all sorts of different
backgrounds all sorts of different
preferences personal preferences for
buildings somehow all of these people
can agree that what Luke on mate is good
and that's the kind of goodness that I
would love for us to be able to get at
in our work in digital here's a picture
of the Salk Institute no other building
has produced more Nobel prizes in
science than this building and the
people who work here will tell you that
the building helps them create better
science Luke on did not build a research
laboratory for Jonas Salk what he did
was he asked the question went backward
from that question to what is space for
discovery for science and came up with
something really wonderful and what
makes following this way of goodness
trying to adopt these kinds of ideas as
the guard rails for the kinds of
practice that we all do with digital
products and services uh being given the
permission to go backward from what the
client says they want you to work on
that is not always easy and additionally
this statement from mr. Khan is really
if you let this work on you for a while
um that you could make it be very good
um but that could be less than good you
could solve the problem really awesomely
you could make something insanely great
my example for this would be the apple
watch edition a Apple redesigned the way
that molecules sit next to each other
because they thought there was a more
pleasing visual presentation of those
molecules if somebody put their gold
watch under a electron microscope this
watch is very good
but I would contend that it is not good
and that we could use Luis Cohn and mr.
women's ways of working and thinking to
explain to the designers and producers
who made this why it is that they were
able to get to this super height of
attainment of very good and yet this
isn't actually good and that's hard to
talk about and hard to explain here's
one example of why it may be very good
but it's not good apples ecosystem has
these incoherence a--'s in it that I
think comes from being really distracted
by rearranging the molecules of gold and
not concentrating on the overall
ecosystem the holes in this ecosystem to
me belie a way of working where they're
making it insanely great and they're
making it very good isn't good though so
um what Luke on did in order to get to
this goodness another one of his tactics
was to ask the material what it wanted
which sounds like a really romantic
notion but he would say you ask brick
what it wants and that that's part of
how you make things be good is honoring
the material and this romantic belief
that some of you may not be able to sort
of go there with me but I'm going to put
it out there for you that the material
wants to be used in some ways and will
fight against you and doesn't want to
work in other ways that there's
something inherent in the situating of
material in space where you could be
doing it right doing it good by being
tuned into the material and what the
material likes to do um and that sounds
a little bit crazy I realize and and
perhaps
you should buckle your seat belts right
now because it's about to get crazier so
very good being less than good and
asking the material what it wants the
closest example to a really good not
really good just good digital product
and service for a long time I thought it
was this um which is a new york times
story called snowfall and when you're
telling a story that has verticality to
it with these mountains and people going
down mountains and a story that moves
linearly through time uh you can arrange
the content here so words pictures space
all of these things have been brought
together to make this snowfall story um
and the experience of consuming it as a
news consumer it's magic i encourage you
do a google search further word snow and
then space and then fall and the new
york times and go check this out uh when
this was launched I thought perhaps
finally here is something we could all
point to in digital and say we have a
lot of different ways of thinking and
working but let's let's all agree that
this one holy how this one is is good
and and in the time since snowfall was
published there was a report that the
New York Times did internally that has
since been leaked and this report on
digital talks about snowfall in
particular and the editors and producers
who made snowfall in this report talk
about how awful it was that they made
snowfall they created they the bar for
what digital storytelling and
interactive journalism was supposed to
be sort of the new normal in the wake of
snowfall in the news industry I have a
lot of friends who work in the news
industry the snowfall became a verb and
all of the people who did fancy news
stories
wanted to hit their news story with the
snowfall stick and do it like that and
what it turns out uh when you read this
digit this report on how the New York
Times was talking about its future as
digital publisher they concluded that
snowfall was a success but a failure
because snowfall couldn't be made using
their normal content management system
the story couldn't be produced using the
resources and tools and techniques that
constitute the ordinary way of running
the business the superhuman effort that
had to be applied to do snowfall was the
extraordinary way and and so I have
since retracted my many statements about
the goodness of snowfall as a digital
product and service and experience
because after the insiders who made it
published that there this report they
did leaked it became clear to me that uh
you can't do this all the time and what
I'm looking for as a practitioner and I
don't know about you all but I'm looking
for a way to know what good means every
day because I make decisions about
design and architecture and any number
of things on the clients behave behalf
all the time so is there an ordinary way
you can get to good and maybe we could
use Luke on to say snowfall was very
good but very good is less than good so
what is an ordinary way and this is the
sort of the third step on the path that
I've been walking toward what good means
in trying to find an ordinary way and
wanting to jump off from and sort of
take forward with me all of these things
from mr. Khan mr. Worman that I think
are really valuable I landed on the
teachings of an architect called
Christopher Alexander
and there may be no other architect
whose work has been attempted to be
mapped into digital more than
Christopher Alexander Alexander has been
working on architecture in the built
environment for more than 50 years he's
quite old now and is not an active not
active in the field but he has this body
of teachings that people like us in
digital have been trying to understand
for a long time and the more I dug into
this body of work the more I'm convinced
that an ordinary way of making things
good the secrets to figuring that out
are in the work of this man for sure I'm
sorry I'm so he's the same Richard Saul
Wurman in the work of prescribes and ER
and what Christopher Alexander
discovered or worked hard to understand
is the basis for beauty in buildings or
in anything really and in order to study
he was a mathematician as an
undergraduate at Cambridge and dual
degree in architecture then went on to
take a PhD in architecture from Harvard
and what he discovered through his work
and this is in sympathy with what Luke
on was doing when he was asking the
brick what it liked and respecting the
materiality of his craft and believing
that the material wants to be situated
in space in a certain way these are the
same ideas that Christopher Alexander
was fascinated by so the picture that
I'm showing right now is a picture of
what happens to metal shavings in the
presence of a magnet and what happens to
these metal shavings in the presence of
the magnet is they rearrange themselves
into complex beautiful structures and
Christopher Alexander spent 50 or more
years of practice trying to reverse
engineer or understand from nature
nature wants material in space to be
situate
did a certain way and that certain way
results in beauty and wholeness and life
and he won't he wants to be able to make
things buildings paintings a tea tray a
piece of tile any work of our hands he
believes we can make things according to
the same universal principles in the
environment that caused these metal
shavings to make a beautiful flower that
we can understand those and apply those
to our work he knows and many
researchers from fields outside of
architecture have tested these theories
and if you apply these theories or look
for evidence of them in the natural
world there is abundant evidence that
the structures that make living things
thrive so this picture of the way that
cells are structured that these same
properties are the ones that govern
anything that we make and the reason
that this plant or this organism is able
to stay alive and thrive is because
these structures are not just any old
set of structures there's a exceedingly
specific way that these structures want
to be set up in order to be alive and
healthy and thriving in the ecosystem
and that further when these good
structures are able to be in a healthy
environment what they do is they become
more complex and that complexity
correlates with beauty and wholeness and
life and rather than trying to simplify
in the work that we do as architects and
designers what we ought to be doing is
embracing and growing and fostering this
kind of complexity good complexity and
and he says some awfully romantic things
about working this way and what he
believes and what I've come to use as
the focus of all of my research right
now in trying to understand this way of
working better he believes that
everything that we need in order to
work in this way is already inside of us
and we have not recognized it but it's
there he says that the seeming chaos
which is in us this rich rolling
swelling dying lilting singing laughing
shouting crying sleeping order is a
system that we can understand if we
would let this order guide our acts of
making what we make will be the forests
and meadows of the human heart and that
sounds awfully romantic and it may sound
uh unattainable um but here is a way of
talking about what good means and the
supposition is that all of us have this
way inside of us already and that space
is just space and this is what's
exciting for me as an information
architect I don't make buildings but I
do work on concepts and ideas and
digital products and services and these
ideas about the nature of order
Alexander would have them apply equally
well to something like a music
composition is there a kind of order
that describes why a music composition
would be beautiful um and that same
ordering principle we could apply that
to you if we're an organizational
designer we're designing the org chart
for organization that organizing people
and ideas on a piece of paper is the
same kind of process as organizing
bricks in space to make a building that
it's all subject to the same order the
reason that this interface from Spotify
isn't good is because the elements here
in this space are not arranged and
situated with a mindfulness to the way
that they want to come together is the
theory this is a picture of mr.
Alexander he says that there is a single
solid objective basis for the difference
between good and bad and and and that
what goodness means ultimately is a
concept that resists earlier in his work
he called it the quality without a name
at this point in the maturity of his
work after spending 27 years writing a
book called the nature of order now he's
willing to give it a name and the name
is wholeness Beauty life and when you're
talking about any one of these you're
talking about the other two and that the
way that you do this is to just play
along with how everything already wants
to come together he believes that
something within space and matter can be
awoken by the presence of the proper
configurations that the way that we
situate material or ideas or concepts or
CSS classes or any anything that is
situated in space that there are some
ways that are good ways to put it
together and that we know how to do that
instinctively and inherently by
continuously asking the question if I do
it this way or some other way would this
way or that other way result in and
bring more wholeness beauty and life and
that at any point a designer can make
that decision and always be choosing a
way to work which is more about
wholeness beauty in life than less and
if we can train our feelings that's one
of the reasons why people don't work
this way is because his theory is that
the instruments that we can use to tune
ourselves to understand how to work in
this way that's our emotions and I don't
know about you all but as I was trained
as a professional bringing my emotions
into it and using them as the first
place that you would look to to help
make a decision that is the opposite of
how how I was trained that by using my
feelings
asking myself as a designer this choice
or that choice which one will make more
Beauty wholeness in life if you do that
as a practice that you can figure it out
and you can always be making choices
that make things be good and I was a
little bit skeptical of this and I
taught this in my class I get to teach
an information architect architecture
class at the University of Michigan I
would teach out of Xander's work in a
cursory way she's sort of making sure
that my students were aware of it but I
did not base all of the instruction on
this not even close because it sounds
crazy that you would use your feelings
to figure out how to make things whole
and that experts are wrong and that
there's an ordinary way of doing this
stuff that's available to everyone it's
the same way that's been operative for
hundreds if not thousands if not
millions of years I was skeptical this
until I went to a place in Tokyo called
the ession school uh about a 20 acre or
I'm sorry a 80-acre site completely
built by this way of thinking and I was
completely persuaded that this works the
ways that these spaces made me feel and
the evidence of them being good for
people we talked with the vice principal
of this school and she said that there
are students who come to the school who
have behavior problems and a few weeks
after they start living and working at
the school the behavior problems go away
but the space is set up for wholeness
and beauty and life and then it changes
the people who live and work in this
space and that sounds a like a load of
 pardon my french but I went to this
place and I felt it myself Shh not too
long after that the opportunity to go to
that school in Japan I got to go to
Venice in Italy and I felt the same
thing Venice is a built environment that
every choice that people made to put
something in the environment here was a
choice that they made carefully
love and with the idea of permanence and
I was completely persuaded by my
experience of going to the school in
Japan the feeling was reinforced by
going to Venice I have since been to
many other buildings that have been
built in this way and what I'm now
interested in what I'm suggesting to you
all is that we can apply these ideas in
digital places people spend as much time
in digital places as in physical places
we know about these physical places that
are good we can study them and apply the
ideas that generated them in our work in
digital is what I believe but what it
requires is a shift in how we see it
requires a shift in cosmology to see
homeless to be catering to the whole
this is kind of a not good pictures it's
a picture of a floodlight to be looking
at the hole through flooding the space
that we're looking at looking at
everything that mode is not the mode of
how we make digital products and
services how we make digital products
and services is more like the mode of a
spotlight or a flashlight where whatever
is in the we point the beam at some part
of the space that we're working in and
we pay attention to that we fix that
part and then we move the beam to some
other part and then we work in terms of
parts thinking that we could get to
something holistic ultimately and this
way of working that I'm proposing where
we would know what good means and be
able to make good things the way that it
works is to change the way that you see
and to shift your cosmology even to
start with wholeness to take on all of
the environment as a whole rather than
focusing fetishizing on on individual
parts and if you'll remember the story I
told about the flash based check out
that bankrupt did the client we use this
little flashlight to spotlight the
problem check out
and we made that check out so good that
it was twenty percent better than the
other kind of check out but had we been
working in terms of the flood light we
would have known that affecting the
check out wasn't what we should be
working on that we should have been
fixing the whole enterprise information
system in order to support e-commerce we
think about interchangeable parts all
the time in digital and I think that
might be why the products and services
that we depend on our so bad that a we
just throw them together on the basis of
a kit of parts and the products and
services that we depend on why are they
not good uh I think it gets down to the
inability to take on ecosystems and
wholeness and instead working in parts
and partners these services are not good
and I think we can make them good if we
change fundamentally the way that we see
them and so a little bit backward from
the way of making things be good that
Richard Saul Wurman taught us to make
the complex clear I still believe in
that and that's very important ah but I
think what a design systems like
material design i believe is what i'm
showing the picture here these are
making uh these are simplifications
these aren't dealing with the true
complexity of what these products and
services need to be in order to be good
we're simplifying them through genera
sizing the visual presentation and the
people who asked us to do this it's not
that they're stupid or asking for the
wrong thing I think what they're asking
for his coherence but what we're giving
them through these through the
application of these design systems
these bags of parts that we just sort of
grabbed in and oh there's a song i'll
use the song player oh there's an image
i'll drop in the image tyler by
assembling everything through parts
rather than taking on holes uh what we
end up with is simplification and
whenever simplification is happening
there is a loss of value and so the
counterintuitive advice that i will give
you based on the work that I've done and
continue to do studying Christopher
Alexander is to make the clear the quote
unquote clear complex that in your
environment where you were when you see
simplification happening that is at odds
with making it be good and rather than
creating the aesthetic idea of
everything looks the same and sort of
fits in the design style to be taking
that on more from a complexity
standpoint to say what are the unique
aspects of what I'm working on and how
can I make what's unique about this a
part of the design I have seen these
principles in action not just in
buildings and it interfaces but in films
and in photographs or interactive
experiences why are the ones that are
good good um I think it's because they
are embracing complexity uh where things
have been simplified they've become more
complex and uh and that were okay with
complexity a lot of people thought that
Kanye West's recent album launch was a
mess and in many ways it was a mess um
where can you get this album it's on
streaming services oh it's also
available for download there's a live
event that you can go to after the
release of the album he continued to
change it and work on it I think that
this piece of music this work of his art
is alive and beautiful because it has
all this complexity to it where you
can't just go and consume it in one
place easily that there's this richness
of complexity around it that makes it
good I think that that's how we ought to
be working in digital and
the students that I have exposed to
these ideas once you start to respond to
the idea of wholeness and if you
entertain the idea that there's a
timeless way of building that all of us
know that we could do and that could be
the ordinary way it becomes pretty
infectious and it seems to apply to
everything from folding the laundry to
finding your keys to making a meal um
and so I think that these are important
ideas and I'm really curious to know
what you all might think of them or do
with them so in summary principles for
making things be good you can start out
with mr. Worman looking good is not
necessarily being good but if you can
make the complex clear not simple that
is not simplification that is
clarification that that is always going
to be good that the value of your effort
will be incontrovertible when your
effort is to make the complex clear the
way that you do that is to work more in
terms of architecture than design
initially rather than being seduced by
solving the problem going backward from
the problem and asking what's true and
that may not be a comfortable process
but that's how you get there according
to Luke on and Richard Saul Wurman
remembering that very good is less than
good that there is an amount of effort
and a way of working where we can be
improving it we made the flash-based
check out very good and then the company
went out of business so recognizing that
fetishizing anyone part of what you're
looking on to make it be insanely great
that that's probably at odds with the
goodness of the other things in the
ecosystem and then lastly um maybe a
play with this that there is this idea
of wholeness and
beauty in life um but that's a real
structure that you can be trying to make
things be aligned with and each choice
that you make as a designer asking what
is the choice that makes it more whole
more beautiful more alive and working
your butt off to make that choice be the
one that and ends up in the product and
lastly how do you think about this
whenever you see somebody simplifying
something or asking for a really simple
way to do XY and z that's probably doing
it wrong a complexity is where all the
life and beauty and wholeness is as far
as I'm concerned this is really
important people spend 40 hours a month
in these digital places most people a
hundred and fifty times a day looking at
a smartphone making these kinds of
places be good for people I think that
there is a rich trove of information for
how to do that and it just takes reading
thousands and thousands of pages of
books about architecture so if you're
interested in any of these ideas um I've
got a list of works cited at the end of
this deck will make the deck available
and here is the rationale for why you do
this what would it be like to live in a
world where the reasons that you have
for making something functionally and
the reasons that you have for making
something a certain shape or in a
certain way are coming from precisely
the same place and it's not a mystery
it's coming from in you and you know how
to make it good thank you and if you are
interested in the things that I've
talked about there's that list of works
there's also a an organization that you
can join for free or they're a
professional and student an
enterprise-level memberships that you
can pay for but the information
architecture Institute is an
organization where if any of the things
that I've talked about today are
interesting to you you can find other
people and resources through the eye
institute ions to org and then for those
of you
who can be an Amsterdam I'm the 21st of
September i'm giving a all day workshop
for the benefit of the eye institute the
morning session is devoted to learning
from the works of Richard Saul Wurman
and the afternoon session is devoted to
learning from the works of Christopher
Alexander and I would love to see you
there if you can make it and that is all
i have for you today if you'd like to
send me questioned you can do so through
twitter i'm dan klein on twitter and
Fernando also has a way I believed to
have you send in questions that I can
hopefully answer for you after after the
fact yep thank you very much then it was
definitely philosophical and uh almost
enlightenment side alignment um folks
that was Dan Klein thank you very much
so the people that are joining in later
on and the day or watching the video
sometime from the present if you have
any questions just make sure again type
them in the comments section we do get
notifications when there's a new
question so it's easy for me just a copy
and paste it and send it to Dan and as
he said as well as well you can also
reach out directly to him to that I want
to say thank you to everyone for coming
and a big thank you to Dan Klein and his
organization for coming down here and
actually speaking to us it was
definitely eye-opening extremely
informative in it actually um mamie
thing goin question a lot of these basic
subtleties then thank you very much for
coming and it was a pleasure it was my
delight thank you for the invitation was
always ladies and gentlemen thank line
cheers everyone have an awesome day hi
