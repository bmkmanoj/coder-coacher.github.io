him
so okay so we we measure the market as
you know or maybe don't know but you do
now we test things also make sure that
the vendors are telling the truth and we
write reports about it the organizer of
this who is a fella by name of Bobby o
who was standing here LOL earlier asked
me if I would come and give a brief
presentation which is based on this book
that I most recently wrote and I did
this in a semi private session at GDC so
if any of you attended that this is
going to be a little repetitious but
it's an interesting story and I'd like
to tell it and it's the story of how did
we get here how did computer graphics
get to where it is today basically TV
was the prime movement if you will for
getting the costs down on CRTs and CRTs
as the biggest element at the time and
its subsequent LCD panels but it was
this is where we could actually see
images and until TV came around and mass
production started these were just
laboratory experiments so we got TV we
got pictures coming through the air
magic and and then we had a little
problem and that problem was called
World War two and right after World War
two where the United States was the sole
possessor of atomic weaponry the
Russians through various means it's
another story we talk about obtained the
ability to build their own nuclear
weapon and when they did that it
frightened the hell out of most of the
world especially the United States
because at the same time Russia
developed a long-range bomber which was
pretty much a copy of the US as
long-range bomber the b-29 but
nonetheless this thing had large enough
fuel tanks and big enough engines that
it could fly from Russia over the top of
the world and down into North America
and that made a lot of people nervous so
to counteract that the United States and
Canada installed the sage system
and I can't remember what that acronym
stands for something about ground
something but what was interesting about
sage is and I don't know if this picture
shows you're not but that's now we're
doing graphics this is not a scanline
representation like we had on TV so he's
doing real graphics and what he's
holding is a light pen and the light pen
can pick up the light from the screen
and know where it is in time for the
coordinates and he can use that as an
identification and that's what they did
is they pointed to radar images of
aircraft and said who is this do we know
who this is and if not we got to do
something about it now the interesting
thing about this aside from the large
graphic screen is this guy sitting in
Massachusetts and the data he was
getting was coming from a ring of radar
stations right at the Arctic Circle
which was called the dew line and the
data from them was sent down to
Massachusetts on phone lines so this was
the beginning of the internet also so we
started computer graphics we started the
internet we started interactivity all
this because we were afraid that the
Russians would come in bham North
America and and and they had the means
to do that so that's where it got
started and when I tell the story people
go now I really and and that is in the
late 50s there's one thats get started
this is John's reading test anybody can
read this gets a special star on their
badge buh and hopefully Intel will let
you have a copy of these slides but
basically wants trying to show you is
that there's shading math art computer
technology display etc etc a lot of
parts go into making computer graphics
and they went in at a synchronous rate
and from all types of different sources
part of this book I keep referring to
talks about how we got the math to do
computer graphics the thing about
computer graphics is it's mostly math
and and and and if you don't like math
then your other choice is to build
hardware or to be an artist if you wanna
be a game developer don't laugh a week
and what kind of games will we have we
didn't have an artist
so here's another I test thank you no no
extra charge for the eye test but
basically this is trying to show the
route and and the development over time
of the various major developments in
algorithms now there's a parallel chart
that goes like this and this is showing
a hardware path and then where's
Kathleen's quote that's my favorite
quote and it's true because one of the
first things that was done with computer
graphics in the early 60s was to build a
game and and we kept on building games
now it turns out but nobody really
thought this ahead of time but it turns
out games are an excellent way to build
simulations and also to test the
performance of a computer turns out that
when you run a game against the computer
the game taxes everything in that
machine and this was just a you know
lucky happenstance it came about because
in order to get realism we had to ask
for more and more and more from the
computer and as a result of that I came
up with this little phrase I like to use
that in computer graphics too much is
not enough and I offer that statement
because someone not someone everyone
says to me from one time to another well
when are we going to have enough
computer power don't we have enough
computer power now and and the answer is
no and the reason I can say no so
emphatically is until we get to the
point whether it's VR or on a screen or
where that we absolutely totally suspend
disbelief and forget that we're looking
at or involved with a computer till we
get to that exact moment then we don't
have enough computer power and that
exact moment by my reckoning is so far
out in the future I hope I live to see
it
but look at where we've done this is
1996 and at the risk of being a sexist
pig I'm going to tell you that the big
controversy and discussion at this time
was how many triangles how many polygons
can we get and I remember talking with
some of the people who developed this
and their quest was to give Laura better
boobs they wanted more polygons for that
so look where we are now this is two
years old every strand of hair is
rendered and is physically movable look
at her skin tone her eyes move her eyes
blink she smiles she cries she makes
noises while she's running this is such
an extraordinary simulation it's a two
year old game that and the other thing
you have to keep in mind is this is
going to run and is running at HD or
better at 30 frames a second or better
this is a real-time simulation
physically correct of a human
interaction and and it's still not good
enough so you guys are developers what's
your opportunity what's your TM and so
forth first of all look at your choices
well here's your choices down here and
here's your obstacles in between and the
reason there are obstacles is because
theres no straight line there's no clear
path you have to know all the api's you
have to know all the os's you have to
know the entry is sync it trio sinks I
can't say the word but the differences
between the platforms because if you
build a game you wanted to run on all
those platforms if you want to get to
the 270 million people that he was just
talking about so there's there's the
there's the universe as we see it
now this is a slightly controversial
chart because as he said that
everybody's got their own view of what
this market is and what it really comes
down to is how do you measure it what's
your methodology for measuring it and
and the methodology can vary from day to
day can vary from hour to hour and one
of the points to make here is that when
you talk about PC gaming it's difficult
to be specific about I can be very
specific about consoles because when we
measure the console market we know that
the consoles are used for gaming one
hundred percent of the time it's a
single function device even though you
can play movies and do other things on a
console people don't buy them for that
reason they buy them only for playing
games a PC is different a PC can be used
for multitudes of things and play games
and so what we've tried to do in another
report that we have is to measure the
purchasing influence of games on PCs now
this chart doesn't represent that that's
that's a report that we offer that talks
about the market size and dollars what
this chart represents our units and the
units in this case are based on discrete
graphics boards in the category of
enthusiasts and mainstream and discrete
GPUs that are in similar laptops so this
is a hardware per unit measurement
you're going to hear other measurements
today expressed in dollars and it's not
going to line up properly so I don't
want you to be confused about the reason
I'm mentioning it
the next phase of computer gaming is in
immersive reality and the Holy Grail and
immersive reality is the holodeck I just
give you a little quick historical
sketch on that the holodeck was first
mentioned by a science fiction writer by
name of asthma who had this thing called
a magic room and this magic room was
where children could go and play and
they could play in a very simulated
environment and in this particular story
the environment was a jungle or a zoo
and the parents got annoyed with their
kids spending so much time there minus
was written in the 60s and the parents
got annoyed with the kids playing so
much time in there so they went in there
to correct the situation and the Lions
ate the parents that's how we all was
then guys name just jumped out of my
head the guys started a Star Trek rod
Barry thank you thank you he he also
came up with the idea in a animation
that he did first which was called Star
Trek and then brought the idea into the
star trek series now a lot of people
think that caves which are three to six
sided rooms that you can walk into and
get immersed in stereo vision glasses
and and happy feet banks of where people
thought the caves were the Genesis for
holodeck was just the other way around
the holodeck caught the imagination some
people University Illinois and they said
hey we could do that and they built the
six-sided projector back projector
systems for it so that was the beginning
of immersive reality and then we I'm
taking big jumps here because I've limit
amount of time but we moved forward and
kind of plateaued and you've all seen
the picture of Donald Sutherland I Ivan
Sutherland with the glasses hanging from
the ceiling and he's looking out at it
and that was probably the firs the first
actual headset and that was done back in
the 60s also and it kind of you know
didn't go anywhere for a long long time
the primary market for
our virtual reality headset head-mounted
displays has been a little bit of
scientific for surgery training some
industrial applications one that I like
to talk about its welding and the
military the military being the big
funder of it and these HMDs for those
applications typically start at ten
thousand dollars so when lucky started
putting his notion of a head-mounted
display and trying to drive down the
cost because of his fascination with it
we started to hear about you know
consumer based pricing now when oculus
was bought by Facebook at the outrageous
amount of two billion dollars that
inflamed everybody's imagination and
anybody who had ever heard about VR who
had any desire to be NVR took that as
being the turning point the catalyst
that the market was now going to explode
and one measurement of that is that last
year we had one consumer hmd and six
industrials and today we have over 40
and more coming so this is an explosive
situation we've seen this before it
can't last you can't have that many
suppliers into a market that doesn't
have any content to support it it's just
it's just you know it's going to be a
lot of heart breaks out there and a lot
of disappointed investors and so I
encourage you not to get too
enthusiastic about this so then I want
to do a quick update on what's going on
in the future what we think is coming in
the future surely you've heard about
Vulcan Vulcan is the I won't say
replacement but let's say the next
evolution in the Cronus family of AP is
there well known for OpenGL and OpenGL
ES Vulcan comes with a new construct and
the construct doesn't oblige you to use
the library that is associated with say
OpenGL you can use the library that's
with the game engine and all the game
engines now have very extensive
libraries
so it's it's it's a no-brainer almost to
do that but Balkan has one other thing
with it which I didn't put up there I'm
sorry I think called spear as PIR and
what spirit is going to do for you is
it's going to allow you to easily
heterogeneous Lee blend graphics and
compute using opencl and that's a really
really big breakthrough the second
breakthrough on Vulcan and DirectX 12 is
going to have the same characteristics
by the way and is that you'll be able to
run as synchronously shaders which means
that you can do real parallel processing
and it means that you can you're almost
approaching a Mindy situation when you
can do that because now you can have
multiple kernels running simultaneously
and completing at different times and
then picking up the next one and those
kernels can be either graphics and or
they can be physics and possibly even a
I at the AI can be constructed properly
so that's this is big news this is going
to speed things up in terms of
processing time significantly and it's
going to allow you to scale your games
to the function or the level of the
shaders in the GPU so more shaders game
goes faster or conversely more shaders
the game is more beautiful that reminds
one table with it there's a fella by
name of Jim blin who's a father of a lot
of graphics features that we take in
fact and there's a thing called Blinn's
law and blends law says that the
rendering time for his model was a
cinema the rendering time for a movie
doesn't change regardless of the
increase in processing time and you
think about you said well that's that's
counterintuitive how could that be if
the processing time is reduced in the
movie time should be faster it isn't
it's because in computer graphics too
much is not enough the people who are
making movies and the people were making
games want the most beautiful picture
that they the most realistic image that
they can possibly get so you give them
more processors they're just going to
use those processors it's still going to
take just as long to create the damn
game or the movie because it's just but
it's going to be much much more pretty
boom so global illumination and ray
tracing these are things that we keep
talking about we keep hoping about
there's been some really interesting
work done in global illumination arm
bought a company last over a year ago
that's got a terrific global
illumination model in it I encourage you
to look at that if you're doing anything
that is associated with arm and in ray
tracing there's been three or more
breakthrough developments in the last
couple years that will be realizable by
developers like yourselves probably as
early as the end of this year we're
finally able to find tricks to allow us
to use a GPU for ray tracing GPU is not
well constructed for ray tracing because
of the unpredictable branching that goes
on a ray tracing model but the Nvidia
just put out a paper where they found a
nifty way to do it kind of impost
there's some new algorithms that have a
different approach to how they plot and
there's a couple companies too in fact
that are going to build hardware
accelerators for dedicated ray tracing
so all that's coming and my prediction
is that by 2016 we will have in the
Triple A games will have ray tracing as
a major component now that's not to say
that the entire scene is going to be ray
traced it won't be it'll be what's
called zonal or hybrid ray tracing where
you'll retrace the elements that need it
things that needed our automobiles for
example there's not a straight line on
an automobile it's just a whole big
bunch of curves and those curves all
reflect light and the better you can
render that the better looking it is
just a sidebar to let you know about
cars for a minute is that automobiles
are no longer photographed when you see
an ad for an automobile on TV or in a
magazine or someplace that's a computer
constructed ray-traced image and it's
been like that now for about a year it's
almost a hundred percent now
and and so that's an example how we're
using computer graphics in a consumer
situation now mind you that doesn't get
generated at 30 frames a second so
that's reason you have to use zone or
hybrid techniques and then a VR and n AR
are the other leading edge things that
we're talking about everybody is excited
about VR my view is that and you heard
it expressed by the previous speaker
that my view is that as wonderful as
it's going to be and it's it's pretty
wonderful already you're just not going
to wear that headset all day it will get
heavy it'll get tired it's it's a little
impractical so we need another model we
also need higher resolution the screens
just aren't high enough resolution yet
because you put it hmd on you see the
pixels and that's not the way life looks
so we're willing to put up with that our
brain is amazing television would never
have worked if it wasn't for our brain
compensating for the for the poor
quality of the image and we'll do the
same thing in VR for a long time
especially if the content is good enough
and the content is probably the weakest
link in the chain well as the second
weakest link the feedback loop or
latency is the weakest link but the
content is really really critical and
this is where the game developers really
have a strong role to play because BR
should not be treated as a image gimmick
like 3d was in the old times where you
know things jut out at you from the
screen the recent conference I just
attended in germany called fmx they had
a dozen VR demonstrations there and
fifty percent of the demonstrators who
are people who should have known better
made the demonstration of things like
roller coasters and bad airplane flying
and the point being is that they kept
moving the horizon back and forth so the
net result was everybody walked out of
there but uh I got to go because they
just felt lousy because the latency and
the disorientation with the moving
horizon it's just too much for our
brains to handle that's one thing we
have difficulty with but think about a
racing game where you're just going back
and forth you're not tilting the horizon
that's a game that could be really
exciting in VR and so if you use a
little common sense and don't try and be
exploitive of the technology to
and-and-and make a story out of the VR
aspect of it then you have a better shot
of getting happy customers now the risk
here is that if you don't do that and if
other content developers don't do that
and the experience of VR is just one
that is disgusting because we don't feel
good after a while guess what that's
going to do to the market that's going
to put a bad taste in everybody's mouth
and you know I used to tell my kids when
I was raising him be careful of your
reputation whether it's good or bad it's
damn hard to lose once you get well
that's what's going to happen to VR if
we're not careful if VR gets tagged as
being the sickness game guess what's
going to happen to VR as a market it's
going to disappear so my advice to you
and I realize I'm lecturing now I
apologize but my because I've seen this
movie before and they all have bad
endings I hope this one doesn't use some
common sense in your game development
and I think that's it for me alright so
just to wrap up you can read this I'll
need to read it to you yeah and then
just a shameful plug shameful plugs
coming stay tuned
you mentioned del volcán was going to
change the way that communication is
done between compute and graphics how is
that going to be different from the way
we do interrupt currently with opengl
but this thing called spear SP ir and i
encourage you to go to Cronus website
and look it up spear allows you to write
code in a different fashion so that you
can write one line of code which will
engage opencl calls as well as drawing
calls and so it's a more efficient it
also has a certain risk with it if you
write bad code things are going to go to
hell real fast and and the debuggers are
going to have a hard time tracking the
compilers you're just going to break
completely so it's the good news is
you're going to have more flexibility
you're going to be able to write tighter
relationships between graphics and
compute but at the same time you're
going to have to be a serious law
abiding programmer and and follow all
the constructs that come anywhere close
to answering your question okay any
others I got one the question I have is
you made really good points about when
VR doesn't work and how not to exploit
it what have you seen in your travels
that is an example of a paradigm of how
to do VR right if you could name names
or platforms anything give us a clue is
what you admire the well okay so I have
a certain advantage in that I get
invited to see things early and the work
that I've seen being done at AMD doing a
thing that AMD has a SDK they're calling
liquid vr + n video has a similar
approach but I can't remember what
they're calling it but the point is that
they've come up with this anticipation
of frame rendering so that they can get
a frame generated much sooner than you
normally would through the typical
graphics pipeline and in VR every
millisecond counts so by this what is
next frame generation technique and by
the way you have to use a
lot of GPU horsepower for this you know
to two GPUs or the recommended one for
each eye that's not a joke and that's
not a sales pitch for it for these guys
either it's just what it takes but
advanced rendering is is the real trick
in it and the closer you can get to the
feedback loop we used to refer to this
as the pilots neck because the pilot
would get out of sync with the simulator
that's what that's the trick so the good
stuff I've seen has all been
unfortunately experimental I can't say
you can go out and get this game and put
on this headset and and run that machine
it's not quite there yet but the
foundations for it have been laid and
are getting better and and so if you
guys decide to design for VR you have to
learn about milliseconds you have to
learn about the feedback loop between
the action reaction the worst thing that
can happen and you've seen this you've
done this with your mobile phones for
example you push a button and nothing
happens for whatever reason so what do
you do push the button again and again
and again and again and guess what
you've just done you've just queued up
20 commands well that's the kind of
thing that would kill a VR situation if
you press the mouse button with the
anticipation of firing a weapon let's
say are doing something and nothing
happens because of that millisecond loop
multi millisecond loop then you're going
to push the button again and if you keep
doing that you're going to just
basically going to break the game games
going to crash because it can't deal
with all that input so I can't answer
your question to the degree that you
asked it other than to tell you there is
light at the end of the tunnel my
question is for you know for in terms of
that input loop i think the head mount i
mean the the head tracking is more
important than like a button or action
push i was curious what sort of frame
rate i've heard like 90 is a good one to
sort of shoot for in terms of to get
that feeling of immersion because if you
don't have the head tracking good head
tracking you don't feel like you're
there and that's the that's the first
checkbox you need to get to get somebody
feel like they're really having a VR
experience 90 is a good goal I've heard
120 and in the model there is is you
know think about 60 / I for example is
one way to think about it
but it's it's again back to computer
graphics axiom too much is not enough to
her point until you can not notice that
you're in a VR hardware experience when
you can lose the consciousness of the
artifacts of the hardware and get
engrossed with the story with the
content the game that's when we have
good VR and so to her point if i turn my
head assuming the horizontal the
horizons going to stay stable so i don't
get sick by turn my head I know I've
turned my head I want this machinery on
me to also know I turned my head and now
I do I wanted to know I turned my head I
wanted to know precisely how many
degrees in fact tenths of a degree I've
turned my head was wondering if you know
anything about WebGL and what you think
the state of WebGL is compared to you
know today's graphics I know a fair
amount about WebGL I've been a proponent
of for quite some time I'm going to
answer your question but I want to
inject this before I forget there is
another element that you all should be
aware of which is called web VR fella by
name at Tony Parisi who is promoting
that and web VR is similar to WebGL and
so now get back to what WebGL is and
then somebody if I forget remind me to
come back to web PR so WebGL is
basically browser-based compute and we
have in the technical of the Scientifics
converse commercial side of the other
market cad companies for example are now
doing web based or browser based
applications which means that the burden
of software load on your machine and the
necessity for super high performance
graphics is being reduced to the level
of how well you can drive a browser but
the code execution is done elsewhere and
the browser is basically becoming a
window it's almost a throwback to
something we had years ago called x
windows so with that model excuse me
with that model you can do
things like remote graphics and there's
a company called frame which used to be
called mainframe too and they are
offering a delivery system that's very
fast through a browser using opengl for
the delivery of I'm sorry using WebGL
for the delivery of games and or other
types of content so web VR is the same
model of using a browser for your web
experience and if you go to the web PR
web page and I think it might be web the
org or something like that you can find
some really interesting code examples
there and if this is something that
really interests you and you can't get a
good link to it send me an email John at
Jon Peddie calm and I'll put you in
touch with Tony and he'll give you the
he'll give you the real stuff yeah
another one yeah a quick follow-up
question that is do you think WebGL is
actually going to become like a first
class citizen with the native graphics
I'm laughing because I think that's a
political question and and the reason
it's a political question is because
there is such legacy software and such
an incredibly large installed base and
such vested interests that there's going
to be some very large companies who I'm
not going to name but you'll figure them
out soon enough who are going to push
back on web G WebGL because it doesn't
suit their purposes I think it's an
elegant solution I think it has its
place I don't think it's you know the
total and only solution but it but it
certainly does give us another channel
another mechanism for delivering content
it won't become Universal I guess is the
answer to your question well not for a
long time anyway time for lunch nope one
more where do you see SVG evolving to
support some of the advanced concepts
and thought about that for a while sit
the questions about scale over scalable
vector graphics
that derived from 2d and then evolved
into 3d it's primarily used in
scientific applications there's a few
games that i can think of that have used
it to some degree of success i think
it's going to be around but it brings a
computational load that some people
don't like it's it's difficult to get
adequate rendering so I I think it's
just going to kind of hang out there on
the side said okay with you the new
standards for browser html5 css3 they
are pushing SVG as the core component
for doing vector graphics and to that
point back to the guy was talking about
a WebGL so that's that's the same idea
and one of the reasons you have to do
that is because you've got to get the
load off of the of the client side of
the other process and and and going to
vector graphics is one way to do that is
you can reduce yourself to just shipping
coordinates and then just drawing simple
lines I don't know if it's too
futuristic bottom when you were talking
about Laura Croft I was thinking about
like the emotions and my first I thought
about AI like artificial intelligence
have you seen anything where you can
like see response and create emotions
yeah there's there's two things I want
to say about emotions your permission to
keep talking number one got a chem name
of the company now it's a Japanese
company they just ran some tests on
emotive characters and in this
particular test this is not in a game
yet these are like say just test test
Wiggins but in this game the character
is confronted with a an emotional
rendering scene and the character cries
now that's interesting for a whole bunch
of reasons think about what happens to
your face when you cry think about how
your face you know crunches up and
strange and unusual ways it's not a
normal appearance
your eyes change water emits from your
eyes maybe something moisture comes from
your nose as well I mean all kinds of
things are going on now that weren't
normally there and the rendering of that
just the rendering of it is extremely
challenging but the physics all the
little ends of motors that we have in
our face now really become important
because now we have to put more of them
in the face to do that kind of emotion
so it's it's probably the next major
breakthrough in computer games and in
special effects for movies is to get the
emotive content of the other character
the flip side of that is your emotions
and I hope today you're going to hear
about a game that takes advantage of
Intel's real sense the game is called
never mind it's put up by a company
called flying mul escs and without being
too much of a spoiler I'll just tell you
that this game using the intel realsense
measures your emotion and if you get
really caught up in this game to the
point where your heart rate is going up
and maybe you just need to take a break
the game fuzz is out and I I can't
remember if a message comes up I one of
the demos I saw a message comes up and
it says perhaps you should take a break
calm down a little bit so stay tuned for
that I hope someone from Intel or flying
mouse because they're here to talk about
that because it's really it's a good
game by the way also it's a very
intriguing game and and it's got this
aspect of it it's just the first one of
many that's going to show up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
