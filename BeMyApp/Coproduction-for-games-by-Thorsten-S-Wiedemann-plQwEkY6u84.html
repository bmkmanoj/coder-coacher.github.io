it's it's great that intelius here and
making this bass Groucho and also that
they invited us to be on stage and
especially before this topic is kind of
always in my head since over a few years
and because in film co-production is
working pretty well especially my my
ex-wife is working this kind of
co-production thing and I know a lot how
it is working and I'm just wondering if
this is something what co-production in
games if this is possible as well so i'm
very happy to to have you both in stage
you know couldn't make it as you know
and what you already wrote me something
maybe a yeah I think I don't read it now
I think it makes no sense but it's also
a panel what is kind of open for
discussion that means we have definitely
we have a microphone here what is in the
audience and if you have something what
you experience or maybe you have
something to add please join this
conversation because I mean it's a new
topic and also ena told me nobody really
came to her and said something like that
hey I want to do co-production between
different countries or between different
countries in Germany and I think this is
probably a good possibility for game
developers especially for indie game
developers to go this way just one
question before whoever made an
application for funding institution in
Berlin or elsewhere just raise your hand
so there's not many people so why you'll
have projects or is it something you
don't know that institutions like
meeting but meeting bought but in
Brandenburg is giving money for projects
how is this or is that you're a little
bit lazy so you're going to do the next
project as a indie game developer and
you're definitely going to ask for
funding cool maybe another question who
have you as a game developer then just
just to see raise your hands ok what is
the rest doing a regular apps
or something like that students okay
lots of students great and all of you
are from Berlin or are some from other
parts of Germany or a prod who's from
Berlin okay so just to know you're
better thanks Laura sorry to us yeah um
yeah please welcome my guest Alexander
and Andre mmm some of you know them
already so you fit spin please tell me
what do you think about co-production
okay so co-production is actually a very
important topic for us because you know
there are a lot of game developers thing
right here and you should know that
making games is pretty hard I mean club
of course it's like a lot of work but it
also causes a lot of money and there are
a lot of cool funding institutions
throughout the whole Germany and the
medium board we should s studio fizzbin
is originally from baden-württemberg so
there there's also a big funning a hot
where you we're not that part yeah but
then there's Bavaria they have also the
FFF has also a big funding budget for
games and the thing is that of course if
you look at these funding things as a
single thing it's it's not as much money
as you need to make games obviously but
so then the question is why not combine
them and that's something I mean we
talked about 10 minutes ago and it's
like yeah of course movie business is
doing this for years but why not games
and they should be doing it because you
know it's not also not only about the
money but also different regions have
different you know powers and our best
known for different things for example
we now know how many game developers is
sitting right here but how many of you
are actual coders ends up please okay
and how much of you are artists okay so
you see so we have way more coders here
than artists and if we would extrapolate
that for Berlin for example you know I
don't know maybe in Berlin is like
a city of coders of coding I don't know
but for us for example
baden-württemberg is or the city where
studio 15 comes from has a lot of people
that do animations I mean hand-drawn
animations and I don't know do you know
phys bins first game in a world who has
hurt or played the inner world yay so
less people that's why I'm not rich yet
and yeah this the game is full of
hand-drawn animations and that's why it
was all so cool to be in bad mood in
back because they are all the animators
are ya so yeah that's why co-production
is very important for us so we have
diversity also you know not only
diversity and means of what people do
but you have a lot of people coming from
different regions and also you can use
the different funding opportunity
opportunities that you have so do you
know already an example what is working
out and so we don't know if it will work
out yet but for example if it's been
applied for the funding in bandon back
and here in berlin brandenburg so for
how much money you were asking the
funding institutions and how is this
kind of process working yeah so
basically the the different funding
institutions have different budgets for
somebody made belly button book you can
apply for a max about 60k i guess it was
something very odd you know it's 60 k
right so that's the max here but the
maximum amount for example but nutmeg is
100,000 k so the chances are quite low I
think in regular or an average in
developer in Berlin gets about thirty to
sixty thousand euros and funding and I
think this year it was 25 projects or
something like that who got funded said
that inna can't be here because she
knows the number in detail our course is
taking care of that every day yeah
exactly so basically you you when you
want to get funding for your game you
start working out the budget you need
and then you
up in the institutions that they are and
and yeah so in our case we started
writing the application and we went to
both to ena and back then it was Steffi
from the msg bun wooden mac and talk to
them and we're like hey we wanted to
apply to Berlin but also here view
because of course we want to combine the
force and yeah obviously it's the
financial force but also the the
expertise force of these both states in
Germany and you know was like o.o quick
pull let's never never never someone has
come up in games and done that and we
were like why not you know because it's
a very cool opportunity you have of
course it comes with you no hassle
because if you want to apply for funding
in the different state of course you
have to there are a lot of rules that
apply like example the money you get
eighty percent or even more you have to
spend in that region which you get the
money from is anyone familiar with the
term regional effect that the thing has
to be spent in the same country where
you raise the money has anyone heard of
that before regional effect or it cannot
affect no one okay yeah baby then you
should explain it no that's it hahahaha
may just a few words of Who I am or what
I do I'm a freelancer right now working
together with Indies consulting them for
roughly three years beginning of this
year found my first company which is
called target games together with Dawson
owner was not yet in the audience but
we'll arrived some time today I guess
and our plan is to raise venture capital
and to build up a portfolio of smaller
tablets and then invest the Inventure
the the capital from venture or the
venture money into several small
projects you had to make it easier for
smaller developers to talk to venture
capitalist Oh to venture to get venture
money actually now to come back to the
thing of the the regional effect you
know in Germany we have federalism so
every country of Germany behaves
differently and as different things or
rules and laws regarding funding in some
countries we have funding like
yeah ban rutenberg bavaria vineland
files now as well he in Berlin actually
in some country there is no funding any
more like handbook for example and now
if you raise some money through public
funding project there's a certain they
want to know about the regional effect
which means how much of the money that
you get from the government will also be
spent in the same country and this has
to be as high as possible because you
don't want to the people from Berlin
don't want to fund projects that then
spend all the money in Bavaria for
example so most of the time if you want
to apply for several fundings it could
be or must be important for you to have
an office in different countries so you
are able to spend the money there where
you raise the money actually I mean
that's a special situation about power
fist bin then exactly there because we
have their the office but I mean Dawson
you can talk about that the web how
movie does it you know they and yeah the
meaning of co-production I mean in
co-production in film is it that you
actually you not as a director you're
not applying for funds so you have a
producer so you have a producer markets
oil and this is something what I also
want to ask you so if you think of
producing also a game developers that
means that you are trying to get the
money for them so not from vc's but
especially to write application because
I think that game developers should not
write applications they should do of
games right and but if they don't do it
someone has to do it I mean otherwise
someone else gets the money so we
definitely have to spend the money
otherwise we have the next year's we
have less money so I mean this is
something we're also going to tell ask
at the funding institutions how much
money is left over so probably you get
the rest of the money end of the year
kidding it's not true I'm it but it
could be a try out in film is it like
that that you have especially when we
talk about co-production between
different countries i'm not talking
about german countries and talking about
making whatever co-production with
poland so you have a polish
director he goes now to the production
office or to producer in Poland and the
producer raised some money from the from
the film fund in Poland so but it's not
enough money and they say think okay to
make this title we need maybe two or
four more producers we need two more
funds from 44 funds from from different
countries so next we go to Germany oh we
needs we can make the post maybe the
post for finishing the film we can make
completely in Germany so we need
whatever 150,000 or even more to make
the post happening so if you're looking
for a producer the producer is the
co-producer and he is applying for the
fund that means he also has a share on
how much money he gets from the fund on
the film so it's something what is
probably a little bit complicated
because you don't have shares really in
in in in in games of course you have
shares with the disputer and with the
publisher but probably it looks like the
same and then you're collecting money
with all the producer that at the end
you have maybe 1 million euro and then
you can start making the movie so this
is how the co-production is working in
film so my question is this is something
what you think is also fitting as well
for you only because I mean you want to
do something with target games right to
ya right be a producer agency um yeah to
be honest at first of all maybe we
should shoot describe the difference
between a producer in the movie industry
and in the games industry because when I
talk about a producer that's that's the
project manager actually was taking care
of that the project is done right and
that all the milestones will be in time
and everything in quality and Patchett
and so on and and in the movie industry
as far as I got it it's more about
someone who just raises the money and
supports the the movie and the
production but it's not taking care of
the of the extra production itself then
but just about the money right ok it's
like it's similar because the producer
movie is the guy that says I want to get
 done by bringing in money and the
producing games is the guy says I want
you to get done because we run out
of money either so what was your
position then uh yeah I mean
getting getting public funding is is a
lot of hassle I mean you have to spend a
lot of time filling out forms and apply
to rules that are different in every
country and this is really complicated
regarding the amount of money that you
can get then I mean you can't get a game
done with okay depends on but even
nowadays with a budget of 30,000 that
really that really isn't that much to to
finish a bigger title or even small even
the production values for smaller titles
getting higher and higher so I guess you
Alex you wouldn't be able to finish a
game with 30,000 definitely nothing
about one so my question is who thinks
he can get his game done with 30,000
okay cool because usually when I talk to
people some are like Oh 30,000 that's a
shitload of money i can live a year with
that so of course yes but try to pay ah
there's an interesting thing so there
are many game developers here right
who's working with a team under five
people ends up ok who's working with a
people yeah two people back there iono
who's working with the team bigger than
five people ok and now who's working
with the team bigger than ten still holy
cow ok yeah black forest of course yeah
but the thing is that these little
amounts of money easily ran out when you
have to pay salaries and I mean of
course everyone wants to try to live
with making games or to make games for a
living so yeah it's not that much at all
so of course you don't do usually games
with so little money yeah so if you try
to collect out of all German countries
all those small amounts of money it's a
lot of our work to get things done like
this so I would I wouldn't recommend
this to everyone I mean if you can get
your game done with 30,000 or with
hundred thousand Bavaria I don't know
150,000 and then it's great then it's
the best way to apply for this because
ok you have to do it once but once you
know how to apply for all those two
print for for for funding then you don't
have to learn it again and you can apply
maybe every year as long as you finish
your game and have good relations to the
people who spend the money over there
but just to focus on on public funding
for bigger project is a it's not that
easy so maybe it's easier than to talk
to investors and try to raise the money
over there I mean there's also another
funding opportunity is the creative desk
or creative Europe funding who's
familiar with that creative desk anyone
heard of that okay one that's so
incredible because I mean creative
Europe is doing a lot of you know yeah
apply here apply that and still I yeah
they're so less people knowing it
strange I mean but but but that could
also be a good opportunity to try to
work together with different countries
and say okay you have a partner's to you
in I don't know Ireland or France or
wherever and if you want to do get a
project done together with someone from
another country that even gives you
better opportunities to get the money
from the creative test gear because they
have certain guidelines that that where
they want to see the European ideas of
the idea of Europe to be fulfilled but
people from different countries are
working together so let's make it does
it also make it easier for you to to get
some money if you have some partners in
different countries but well yeah I'm
it's quite sad that not so many people
know about this funding opportunity
because they are very very often the
people from creative desk Europe the
only job and they are they have an
office and nearly every country in
Europe the only job is to promote these
opportunities that are there to get this
funding and it's sad to see that this
year are less people actually or less
studios from Germany actually applied
then than the year before um properties
also the point is you need to have fifty
percent own listen I can't oh yeah you
have to if you apply for 100,000 you
have to have fifty percent by yourself
so yeah your own share basically so
probably most of the people don't have
it yeah but I mean that's with every
funding you have a certain you need to
double the part that comes from there
from the government with your own money
and then it's theirs
difference between the amount of money
that has to be in cash on your account
and the things that you can bring up in
by saying okay I work on this project
for four I don't know 10 people for 10
hours every week and this equals the
amount of some X and this is this the
part that I tributing to the project
next to the amount of cash that I had
off my air then that is on my account
but that that really depends from
country to country so I mean always if
you get some some public money you
always have to or most of the time you
have to double that with your own
expenses with your own work time or with
the amount of cash they present to them
um so she said um co-production in games
is definitely possible not a lot of
people were asking for something like
that so she has not a reference project
what was successful in this way she also
said that the nature of working in games
or the workflow it's more like that you
sit on a computer and it's more or less
important that you sit together in a
studio it's just something what you can
as well yeah I mean the of course the
nature of working in games makes it
possible I know a lot of friend teams
that work like that but it's nothing
that I would like to do for you know a
lot of time I I like to when when we
work in games we like to have the people
together we like to see them and
interact with them not only through
skype but of course games working on
games SEOs makes it totally possible
because you don't have to be at the
production line you don't have to
inspect materials yeah you know so but
because our material with with which we
do games is our brain and and artistic
stuff we do with hands so it makes it
possible but not for me I mean yeah I
mean everybody knows about it's quite
common that you that you can outsource a
lot of things you don't have to do
everything by yourself in your studio I
mean it's a it's a bit complicated
because we have to take care that every
material you receives its this level of
quality that you need in your game but
definitely you don't have to do every
in your studio by yourself I mean Noah
or most of the people that I know that
developed games don't do the music by
themselves they hire someone who's
sitting somewhere and it's doing the
music froze em and puts it together and
then he's only part of the project for a
few am for a short amount of time but I
mean it's possible to to work on games
distributed but at least the core team
should maybe to get should be together
at one place I mean was quite common
also some years ago that development
studios also opened up offices in
different countries of Germany to
receive additional funding and then they
just place the QA over there to get the
funds there's also on one point you know
just wrote me in film the film directors
wanted to make not anymore studio work
so they wanted to go outside and make of
worlds or how you say outside shootings
it at original places so that terrorism
is a kind of content and necessarily so
I mean it's kind of it's it's it's part
of the story that we have to go how to
to Poland and whatever and we have to
have this tower so this is something
what we're square could be the the
content necessary in games yeah there I
guess it's something that what I stated
in the beginning is that maybe you have
an awesome school for example of
animators somewhere or you want to have
a specific art style that comes I mean
of course now nowadays everything is
international you can get especially in
the digital age like Andre said you can
have teams aboard whatever but maybe
this is something in games that would
also be cool to think a little bit like
in movies you know because as yeah as
you said if I want to have a shot of a
specific region then I have to
go there I cannot build it in Maya or
whatever and maybe it's it's an
interesting thought about that win games
too so if you want to make a big I don't
know whatever game and you think hey for
this game this specific style would fit
best and maybe it's
then you go talk to studios that and
they are of course situated elsewhere I
mean games like machinarium or as are
most on whatever i have a very specific
style that is kind of at least for me I
mean maybe I'm wrong but you know has
something of the Polish culture where
how many today is from so I think this
could work in games as well but it's not
enough when there is a kind of a
cultural exchange oh sorry if it's not
already content enough when we talking
about cultural its cultural exchange
yeah it is also of course I mean we that
one cool thing and when you are doing
games and you're going to a lot of
conferences you have a lot of
international people and you always get
to know the different cultures and stuff
like that and i think there's also
something that's what I kind of meant
with the odd side because of course your
own culture always influences that what
you do so yeah this is also something
that could gains could enjoy learn and
could benefit from a lot yes I mean it
could also be a risk because if you out
saw something like graphics to China and
you don't brief them in the air I mean
if they are so cheap and then you want
to do it over there then you ask them to
draw some trees for your medieval
role-playing game in Europe and the
style trees are looking different in
China you don't brief them in detail you
get something totally different become
that you actually need within your game
so casualisation it's also a challenge
for you because you have to really take
care if we are all talking about the
same topic I mean even if we have
problem already by talking living in the
same country and then talking about
producers in film and games you can
think about that it's that this
difficult is multiplied if you talk to
people from other countries worldwide
with their definition of I don't know
trees or producers or whatever but just
to reach a little bit out I mean
everybody knows about runs meteor stuff
and maybe this could be as well
possibility to whatever extent your your
whole storytelling or your interaction
with the medium so that you really make
a game and there is also a story going
further in episodes or whatever this
could be maybe a model of coke
as well and because I mean you know also
wrote something like let me see is it oh
yeah it says her ending conclusions
always about co-production on games as
possible what he said at the beginning
but mostly not necessary all right yeah
thanks for having us guys what's awesome
no but but I definitely oh that's what
you said yeah thank you you know if you
bring the money nothing is necessary at
all you can do whatever you want if you
get the money but if you don't have the
money you have to think about ways to
acquire the money and I think
co-production definitely is an
opportunity to get it and I mean that's
also an opportunity right now for for
development studios in the I'm sorry in
the in the times before now some ancient
times I mean there was the the the model
like you as a developer work together
with the publisher who gave you the
money and that was the deal and then he
popped aim and then you moved over to
the next game but nowadays the classical
360 publisher who does take care of
everything it's a little bit bro and so
there's not that one partner that you
need to look for that does everything
for you I mean they're much more
opportunities now because you could
simply look out for other development
studios and pop then to raise additional
money for example why not look for for
on foreign for another developments to
you in a different Germany or in Europe
and try to find a studio that does
something that you can't do they're good
by yourself I don't know animations or
whatever or different part of the game
or whatever and partner up with them and
try to pull up a co-production team
overall studio I don't know I'm just a
base on the project you want to receive
and then so opportunity for both and
because you only have to do the
paperwork once and then you get one
project done basically this case what I
wanted to add is that of course it's not
an necessity necessity yeah it's not
necessary
it's unnecessary now I got it um but I
mean it was not necessary to go to the
moon and we did it of course we can yeah
drop them on so true no but it's an
opportunity I mean other guys do it as
well they don't label it as much but
look at Vlambeer there are four
luftrausers they pick other musicians
they are all over the world and I think
thinking you know out of your production
box way of thinking like okay we have a
studio and we are 10 people here and we
have to do it here thinking outside of
it and thinking of I don't know there's
so much cool stuff going on in Germany
alone and more in whole Europe how could
we work together I think this is
something that is a great opportunity to
produce even more awesome games than two
I mean games a cultural medium for me so
there's a lot of culture and games and
as well as with culture itself it can
even greater if you combine things if
you combine Spanish cuisine top US with
Japanese food it's awesome if you do
this with games it's also awesome so
that's my conclusion so you like fusion
yes a lot me yeah there's another
example of dec13 who have done lots of
the phone for example who partnered up
with the studio in Poland I'm not quite
sure was it CD Projekt or does someone
know who's the other developer of lots
of the phone okay but they are partnered
up with the team in Poland to be able to
raise the quality part of their of the
protection that they did because they
were not able to this alone because this
to you was not big enough so they looked
for partner there wasn't a different
country in a work of work out well
regarding the quality of the title but
as far as I know there's some legal
issues right now so you have to be very
very careful than by partnering up to
partner up with the right people yeah of
course I mean this yeah but this is a
problem the major problem because we are
not really knowing exactly how to share
yeah they're seen because when it's not
existing right now so we have to make a
plan maybe as well with the funding
institutions that there is whatever a
little bit of regulation how much the
producer or the team is in another
country you can get out of the when when
the when we are talking always about
revenue at the end so and everybody
wants to have money back as well the
institutions also want to have money
back they don't give it for free and
forever so it's a lot of money talking
definitely and makes probably everything
more complicated at the beginning yeah
it's it's it's as Andre said it's very
hard and of course well very hard that's
relative but of course you have to put a
lot of work into something like that and
but I'm totally convinced that it's
worth the effort and what you talked
about the differences cultural
differences and stuff like that and of
course they are the problems you know
cultural communication whatnot but I
think if you if you go with that
thinking into your project and your
project is exactly fitted to do that
then it mmm there won't be that problems
you know there ah there but then you
underline that we have to talk about
content only right yeah of course yeah
and this is the base why co-production
is needed exactly go as I saw Andreas is
here from Black Forest games is he still
there somewhere hitter the behind
circular here hey maybe some some
examples from the audience then have you
done any co-production yet with black
forest games that you work together with
another team is there Mike somewhere so
everyone can hear yeah we can open up
for open discussion what's what you guys
so we have 10 minutes for this sorry
okay yeah yeah hello
hello it's me that layers from Lake
Forest games yeah um outsourcing shin of
commutes help the him karthik kovai
headphone starvation continued english
please Oh career switch to English yeah
I'm address with Lake Forest games we
used outsourcing for past products that
we did mostly its pebble time since
still so for a Kenya aquatic for for
example we did a lot of the mass
production at assets out sourced so we
did the quality references in house and
with requirement documents and so on and
a lot of the mass production then was
also Stu Stu choose in different
countries I was more sutures mainly so
or even three lenses single person's but
not no no no not for co-founding was
babe basically only we never had a
project where it was suitable yeah but
did you blend apply for public funding
at all for some reason we applied for
MFG public fund yeah and we got it for
giana sisters twist the 440 our sisters
successor of twisted dreams yeah yeah
but just then you didn't apply for for
money from Europe from the creation
Europe from Buttonville bank yeah okay
great thanks share his thoughts
experience with funding or even working
together overseas or different countries
and teens or studios I mean could be an
opportunity as well if you think about
crowdfunding platforms I mean if you
want to go and kick starter for example
it's always a crucial that you have a
large audience that you can address I'd
receive some money because if you don't
generate any bus in the beginning no one
most of the time Noah will take care of
your project and you won't won't receive
the money that you're looking for but
could also be a good idea I don't know
for you to look for development teams
with with in different countries to
partner up with them to double the
audience that you can
get to raise awareness on Kickstarter
I'm not quite sure if there was anyone
who did that before but maybe this is
something where you can also generate
some press attention out of it I mean
opportunities are there you just have to
think about how to use them and I mean
not only care about making your game I
mean you still have to make a great game
but beside of that you have to take care
of somehow that you get the money to get
it really well done because the
competition is quite fierce right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
