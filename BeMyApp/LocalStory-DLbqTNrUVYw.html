story so local story is pretty simple
and straightforward app and primarily
what we're doing here is we're kind of
taking a technology and moving it into a
public benefit situation for improving
curriculum in schools so local story
empowers teachers and their classes to
wake up the built environment in their
community they by creating tours of
factories courthouses firehouses could
be bowling alleys could be anything of
interest and basically what it does is
it allows them to create tours kind of
like the ones you've all experienced in
museums with the headsets and whatnot
except that it can deliver a much
cheaper it's much more flexible it's a
much easier to create you can produce
audio photos videos and text all tried
to beacons now the way this thing would
be would work the components here are a
curriculum guide for each teacher each
class a web interface to manage the
content a set of beacons and those can
be available in groups like half a dozen
or you can get an additional module if
you want to do more Eakins and the
mobile app which currently we have
running on android and we would expect
to roll this out to iOS as well and here
we're showing you just a Minimum Viable
Product there's kind of a roadmap of
other things that could be developed
along the way this is running live now
so so there's a home screen there's a
home screen and now once you get into to
the environment and you turn on your app
it shows you the tours because you can
have multiple tours associated with the
beacons a since okay so we choose the
gate of branding tour and now we get to
so tell us a little bit about what the
tour's about we start the tour so now we
have a map of the location and since we
are tethered here to our machine instead
of walking to the beacon we're having a
beacon walk to us there's our beacon who
has a kingdom crown so as you can see
that just popped up on the screen as he
walked into range of the beacon and at
that point we get some content about the
geekdom crown which missing a photo okay
so we have an image also but it's
missing right now so that's basically
our application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
