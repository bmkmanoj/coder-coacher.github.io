talk about realsense camera
and why it actually matters for game
developers and how you could use it so
first who actually knows what is
realsense camera until people don't you
know okay one most 10 okay actually
that's that's not bad that's not bad
just to prove you this works and i'm a
very adventurous guy i'm gonna you know
actually use it to plasma slides so
you're going to understand why I'm doing
it it's my lil fail because it's a
prototype laptop so but don't worry it
actually works sorry trips so what is
Wilson's you know couple of years ago we
worked with OEMs so with you know pc
manufacturers to integrate it touch into
the laptops and so that's why now you
can see you know like really nice design
like this one or this one when you can
touch you know touch the screen play wit
you know move it into a tablet mode etc
so that's the work of Intel we've done
since what three or four years now and a
couple of years ago the VP that in CL
said okay touch it's done what can we do
next to interact with your laptop and
like the real sense actually appear so
real sense is just not cameras so i will
introduce you to cameras and what you
can do but it also about voice so you
know for your laptop to understand you
better but the whole concept of it so
only the idea is how to interact more
naturally we shall laptop which
everything so we'll sees you whether he
understands you you listen to you but so
that's really important one thing we
really want to target is feel more
natural we don't want you to do really
with gestures in front of your laptop
and looks like an idiot you know is just
have to feel natural and because you
would like to do it for example the
presentation stuff i made like you know
the swipe stuff we put it five percent
in front of the laptop and we said okay
if you would just pass a slide the next
site what you would you do and we all
these the same gesture like this you
know i wanna okay anything else oh no
and i have to blame myself because I
could have it myself so I can just by
myself anyway it works sometimes yeah so
basically so they did all the same
gesture and that's what we want
implemented because it's natural
it needs to understand you better
understand who you are what you feel and
you know what you want to do so that's
very very important and the last point
it you know a pre and the world better
lots of companies are doing 3d cameras
to scan your world etc because it needs
to understand where you are what you
want to do in your world better so
that's what we're going to talk about
also what it's not so thanks to the
light I can't you can't really see it
but its minority report and first my
English accent I don't think you
understood the title right but it's a
the movie with you know Tom Cruise who
is doing like you know gestures in front
of his laptop or big screen actually so
you know I think actually to be honest
the guy is a vp behind real sense so
this movie and set up we have to do it
do it guys yeah the thing is that we
don't still have the same technology
when Tom Cruise wear so we struggle a
bit but you know for for now we want to
raise expectation right so for now it's
not going to be used you in front of a
big screen doing really weird gestures
and you know guessing what crime is
going to be next I'm sorry you can't do
that for now maybe in 10 years but not
now so what it is now and what you can
have actually available right now it's a
so real sense right now is about two
cameras and this is really different one
camera is a user facing camera so it's
the camera that i have in my laptop
right now for example so it's going to
replace all your web cams etc in your
laptop so for you is going to look the
same but for you know for the developer
is very different because instead of
having one lgb webcam you have depth
sensor so you can actually calculate the
depth and you have 3d sensor that's very
very important the target of this camera
is the nut books and the all-in-one so
pretty big you know designing designs so
because it's it has to fit in the design
so it has to be like a laptop so this
one for example is 13 inch and he has a
camera integrated the usages you know
it's a user facing because its feisty
user so are quite different from Java
its first between 30 and 1 meter range
so it's when you're basically in front
of your laptop and just next to it so
this is what we want to target in terms
of usages and it's multiple things first
is just a control so if my
powerpoint controller would work you
will see me in a min gestures and
control / conduit we also have the free
reconstruction model so basically you
have an object and you want to sell it
on ebay just let's say your shoes you
put in front of camera you turn it and
it creates a 3d model of your shoes so
it's actually easier to interact or you
want to scan an object and put it in a
video game for example so this is in
this camera the face you know it also
needs to understand who you are and the
face analysis is very very important so
I don't know if you saw it but microsoft
announced with windows 10 the future
called windows Aero which basically is a
login and you don't need any password
for it just scan with the AR your eyes
and become you know and actually guess
who you are so in I think i dial it in
the office and the last one that one
that was a second it recognizes you so
you just in front of your pc and it logs
in automatically at the beginning it's
very weird because you don't have to
type any password but it works perfectly
and to be honest but the future i love
the most about Windows 10 it works quite
well so that's quite impressive and the
last usages is a 3d face capture and we
are going to talk about a bit later but
basically what it can do is that scan
complete your face and put it somewhere
else like in a video game or something
else it can also scan your face and
apply emotions to another top for
example so it creates a lot of
wide-ranging of usages and we really
think it's going to change the way we
interact with laptop but as I said
before we don't want to replace
completely touch or keyboard and mouse
etc I said before that I was you know
video game player quite heavy one I'm
not gonna play a triple a game just
doing just using sort of my laptop it
doesn't make any sense because it's not
precise it's not for now it's you know
it's just not going to do it so for now
we're going to focus on usages which
makes sense and that's what I'm going to
show you after so just for the the names
here so we like we at Intel we love to
fro big names so the OEMs which has a pc
manufacturer we signed up for this
camera are all listed here and actually
there is some but i can't locate here
but basically all the biggest
constructor will have this camera inside
in the laptop and actually if you go to
thinking
new front country like France or Germany
you can already buy this kind of laptop
with this camera since more than three
months so it's already available in the
market and before the end of the year
you're going to have a huge market for
this and it's going to be the biggest
priority of Intel visual the end of the
year look at the realsense camera so
it's going to we will see at marketing
everywhere with this camera oh by the
way do we somebody know the big bang
theory yeah okay so Jim Parsons like you
know Sheldon Cooper is actually the
marketing guy for intel realsense camera
so we have a lot of ads with shoe
Sheldon doing crappy stuff your camera
it's actually really funny so let's yeah
just what people who know it quite fun
so in my talk it was a title was why it
matters to you video game developer and
so I adapted all the usages for you so
one stuff and we really want Mac to make
this happen and we are a bit ascetic
about it and really want to make this
happen is emotion tracking and face
tracking your wire loop guys gaming so
you can imagine like inaugural game
really really really really scared in
front of your laptop what we want to do
is understand that you're scared and
make you even more scared so actually so
that's one of my goal before the end of
the year to actually do a game like this
and it's going to be really funny to see
the reaction of the guy you're scared oh
yeah leave the most gear it's going to
be really funny the second usage is
which you will see in the demo just
after is faced with construction as I
said basically we scanned of is a face
and we integrate yourself in a video
game so if you want to be the next
flower craft or something like that in
couple of years is going to be possible
one thing which is actually done now is
a webcam background removal so I don't
know if somebody here use twitch for
example or self kind of you know
streaming video game stuff with this
camera we can remove the background and
transform yourself into an avatar so we
can imagine you know playing your video
game and instead of showcasing you is
your big helmet etc and you do Mike we
could showcase an avatar of you from the
video game you're playing so it's
actually kind of cool to say you know
I'm the hero and you can see still see
the emotions that are you know I have
right now so this is kind of a really
really cool usage to
the free avatar is also very cool i'm
going to if you are interested by the
video but i'm not going to showcase it
here i'm going to showcase it at 5pm if
you want to see how well it works this
is the technologies which are used by
studio and you know animator animators
to like you know face tracking the
people to apply it to movies and it
works really well with the camera
already and the motion I'd head tracking
so you will understand a bit better in
30 seconds but the goal is here to track
your your head tracking and also the
motion and to apply it into a game so it
sounds a bit we like foggy right now but
let me just show you a video No ok ok so
just let me explain a bit so what you
see here is that so it's a dirt 2 and
basically the rails and cameras came the
face of the user and actually you can
see that the field of view is changing
because of the camera so if you turn to
the left actually you player will turn
to the left so it really did you know
it's really put you even more in the
game because you can react really like
like to drive you know like a hook up an
oculus rift would do but here is just
with your laptop and your camera and
right now exactly how many games do we
have enabled with that 55 hun yeah ok
almost 500 went games are already
enabled with that so mostly driving car
driving in etc but if you buy this kind
of laptop and you do this kind of either
you should put this kind of plugins you
can actually play with 500 games and
really feel like you're into it you try
to be completely honest when you play at
it you look a bit weird but it's
actually quite cool so now is a tricky
part I'm going to do demo live so I'm
going to start with your studio release
the camera I was talking about you know
scanning your face and and put it into a
game so we work with a partner called 3d
systems who actually do 3d printers and
they did an application so you could
scan yourself and actually if your mega
man yet you could print yourself in 3d
you should love it it's up to you or you
can let it not send it to your worst
enemy I have no clue oh you could
actually also scan your face can you see
me now you got large account i think
with a color so I'm going to try new
scan just cut my face with the mic on it
I have never tried it I don't know if it
works it's going to be fun so basically
just to explain you know how it works
it's very blue okay so okay so you just
have to put your head in the middle so
you can see that actually my face is
building 3d so I'm the worst customer
ever because they have a big bird and so
as you can see what I miss some of my
birthday that's okay and then you
actually accept and it's going to apply
it on a 3d model already built so you
just take the head and apply to a free
model so right now is just gonna I'm
just gonna do snowboard stuff so yeah I
don't do I don't do snowballs on lipid
come on so it's gonna take 10 seconds
more I guess to apply it dude ok so now
other words you know I'm a snowball VI
and now I can actually show off with my
snowboard ok so right now it's not very
useful as you see it because it's just
an animation up a really really you know
I've rigged avatar but in the couple of
months you will be able to take exactly
the same scam and put it into a video
game with a laptop but you have at home
so it's actually kind of cool you don't
need a 2000 piece of equipment to make
it work so so my first demo work that's
actually impressive nobody on stage with
all this light it doesn't so that's good
the other stuff I wanted to showcase
actually is a warrior wave so it's a
game we design at Intel and it's just to
explain you how we see the hands with
the camera
so it's just not about the face it's
also you can track the you know the
movement so basically you can see you
know a part of my 11-4 is actually quite
involved so you know my hand actually
interruptus a game you know I can take
that I can kill them if I want because
I'm a really really bad bad guy I can
make the one you know okay so you know
you can see the shape of my hand and
actually plays it again and I've only
have one star when all the training I do
i'm not i'm not sure i'm a really good
video game gamer anymore but so i think
you get it so the ID you know you can't
do it like this all the funny stuff is
that you can do it with anything so hand
or like if you do to the magic stick or
anything it works so the whole idea is
just to take you know like the shape and
make it okay hi so let's add for ok this
was crashed Ophelia me crushed that's
normal okay so so we see so this was a
demo and we have a lot of them coming so
all the laptops are coming most of them
are for holiday be here we are going to
get you're gonna see a lot of these
laptops very very soon on the market so
yeah the second one is actually a bit
different it's about the world facing
camera so it's a tablet the it's a
camera will put into phones and into
tablets and here it's not about
recognising yourself it's about
recognizing the world you're into the
usages is very different it's from one
meter to 3.5 meter range so you can for
example imagine to scan room most can
anything more to it with it it's can
people also an object the same as the
one before but you have a tablet to it
to be easier to move your tablet around
an object when moving a pc around an
object it's even easier one of the cool
usages i love is augmented reality and
mixed reality you know Alexander before
talked about virtual reality and how it
going to do the things the thing is that
right now with this kind of stuff we can
do it on a tablet so
I'm going to showcase a demo also to you
but it's very fun to actually scan your
room and play with it so your room
becomes the you know the play the play
game actually that's kind of fun you can
also do I am photography with it so you
can refocus etc take pictures and apply
a lot of Instagram stuff with it like
you know if you like effects I hate it
but if you only really like burger
effects of white and black and white
it's actually way better with this
because you can you know you have to
depth data in it and the last sorry and
the last one is measurement so if you
want to redo your pigeon or something
like that you take a picture and you can
miss your like you know how actually big
it is so that's really really nice when
you want to redo everything or you just
won't take measurements of your home and
that's works really really well so as
I'm not a liar this is my own hand and
with the phone we are integrated in the
camera into it so this is not miss
camera and I can talk is here he's
already integrated in VN visas are
searching six-inch phone sorry and these
boots this works quite well and all the
eulogies at I talked before work with
you can do it with that and it's really
small so how does it works actually and
the question why do we do that come just
after so basically it's stereoscopic
vision so you have to you know infrared
projector in the camera which actually
will see an object from two different
point of view we can scan for example
this table and integrate it into your 2d
game and just blow the you know blow the
table of free like no virtual virtual
reality it's actually very fun and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
