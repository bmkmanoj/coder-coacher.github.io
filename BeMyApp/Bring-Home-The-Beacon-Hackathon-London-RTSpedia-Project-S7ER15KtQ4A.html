painter and technologists I've been
working with with an app to joann's use
for my for myself with my exhibitions as
a gallery guy who did a version of it
last year which was using image
recognition so image matching from our
database and then when you were in front
of a painting you could take a picture
my office with the app to take a picture
of it and then matches in the division
it would give you content based on that
since only a measurement but painting
and there's also audio file and you play
we've been made it so you could do it
different languages as well but the
issue with that was that doing that kind
of recognition in galleries or not
always satisfactory and because one is
the lighting condition you can't control
that people's phone can be of different
qualities it doesn't always match
properly and then then they wouldn't
have always internet connections there
where whereas with the beacon looking at
it shows quite a lot of those problems
so you get just by being in their
proximity of some money some objects if
we can actually activate the gallery
guides to play so you can you can even
be like somebody with some disabilities
perhaps they can't use their fingers
even they can have the app running in
your phone okay with the headphone and
you could play the gallery guide as you
walk around for you to be partially
sighted it can give you information but
about two Subway's I think this was
secured quite a good way of doing that
and then we wanted to add alex another
game you find another layer that is I
thought to do for blacks on can get it
done is to get points for every
paintings that you pass by right so
Spencer didn't know or maybe if you
spent more time in front of the
paintings with more part lemon you
collect all these points maybe people
with drink or something when you got any
other kind of coffee dispenser we're
going to be doing some of my vice city
couples machine Great Scott Brooks
energy for that yes yeah we things like
that I've got another idea been looking
and got a heated pad and is another
thing that we give you vibration and
that goes to be used for ok if you
attach these to yourself and then we can
we be together with the proximity thing
you're not a hot and cold game another
oh yeah when you get close we get closer
you get yeah i agree there's kind of fun
thing because what could be done dunning
we're going to
time but that's another idea thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
