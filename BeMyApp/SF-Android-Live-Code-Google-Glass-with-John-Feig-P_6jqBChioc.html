most cool down thing okay here we go so
here's my here's my dumb little thing so
right off the bat like you can see this
is an Android application this is not
what you would normally expect to see on
glass like there's an action bar here we
have like hello world is if notice like
the status bar up there really weird um
so the next thing we're going to do is
we're going to get rid of that stuff and
we do that by setting the theme so we're
going to do two things we're going to
set the theme I copy that over goes on
the application level delete the old one
I'm also going to make this an immersion
actually I think I'll change the theme
first and show you show you the output
and then I'll turn it into an immersion
it'll break so we'll do it one step at a
time or it won't break it just it won't
do anything special because we don't
have cradles not configured correctly
yet there we go that's most cool down
this is one of the fun things about
glass is it overheats pretty easily all
right oh so we're gonna go there we go
my module there we go ok so now got rid
of the action bar so that's good making
progress now I'm going to turn this into
an immersion and it's the one all right
so now since we added this immersive
thing this
is like a this is a glass a GD k but in
it basically just tells class that like
we're in an immersion it allows the
activity to like grab a certain events
and handle those correctly virtually not
going to use any of those but it's just
you know kind of the right thing to do
and we need this see over here how it
says compile SDK version 15 it's not
right it should be the GDK and I'm
actually just going to make sure that
the module has this as well it does not
so we're going to change that right now
as well so just for those who are not
familiar with IntelliJ there are like
kind of module settings you press f4 and
get into them so this like Gigi dash
test is the module that we're building
right now and I just want to make sure
that that's set to the correct SDK API
level ok so that's all we need for now
there ok so I've done that I've set the
immersive mode true ok next we're going
to add a voice trigger so right now the
only way to launch this thing is either
have glass on and run it from your IDE
or or a DB so from the command line or
like I have this glass launched were
installed which is you know some project
that somebody built to make life easier
for developers but really the thing to
do oh it's called blast launcher yeah
there's there are other ones too there's
like lon chi but lon chi kind of does
it's it's weird it like overrides
settings and it tends to break stuff on
every release a class launcher is done
with a live card so it's it's kind of
like a right way to do it
anyways we ran out a voice trigger now
so I got that line phone projects so
this is just you know voice trigger
pretty obvious what that's so that's in
our intent filter selection meaning that
like this activity is going to listen
for any any intents to come in with you
know with this and then the metadata
tells us like where this is defined
we're going to need to create a
directory here an Android resource
directory that is going to be called XML
and within that we're going to create a
voice launch xml file okay and this is
completely wrong so I'm just going to
copy in from example that I have yeah we
go and I do not have this string yet it
doesn't exist but that's the name of it
so that's one sec that was the wrong
long strings okay that's the one I want
to create and there's consigo file
declaration to go to because it does not
exist yet this strings there we go
how should I launch this what do you
what's a good voice command for this one
that's taken media what's up you know
gallop okay gallop works all right um ok
so now I think this should be enough to
run out
ok so now I should be able to say ok
glass gallop yeah I worked all right
that's actually all we need for the
voice launch and i'm pretty sure that
we're done screwing around with the
manifest as well so here's slide saying
the same stuff I already said yeah we're
done with all this stuff there's one
more thing in the Gradle that I'm just
going to pull over now to like not have
to touch Gradle again it's this
dependency so this is a library that I'm
writing to just like you know a bunch of
reusable code I'm just like you know
shove it in that library so i can not
need to copy it over every project and
we're going to need it because i'm
cheating and putting a bunch of stuff in
the library ok so next we need to create
a surface view but we need to create a
fragment alright so um this thing has a
fragment it's just placeholder fragment
it's like what you know the thing
generates when it auto generates code
for you and get rid of the menu
selections we don't use that and this
we're going to refactor out into its own
file and we'll call it a image grab I
think that's what I called it before ok
okay that might need to be imported aha
you to extend fragment here we go okay
now we're all happy um okay i'm going to
add some layout stuff here it's going to
be this of course the presentation won't
let me click that so yeah we just need
this surface view that's okay so now we
have a preview all right it's not really
worth running yet because it wouldn't do
anything so yeah now it's telling me to
add this dependency that i re added
which is the reusable android utils so
just a quick note like things that I've
put into this library there's some
helper code for dealing with cameras
like typically you'll need to implement
photo handler so I've implemented a
generic photo handler in here I have see
file details that help like you know
saving to file and on the SD card you
know what creates a directory that I
specified and just you know push this
stuff there it's going to look gift code
that I pulled off of a stack overflow
answer you know so there's a bunch of
good stuff in there but we've already
done this we've done the updating Gradle
and now we have to pull in code from
other projects thinking this might be
good to get from my guests yeah so so I
also kind of created these guests on
github to you know at the actual point
where I'm where I'm doing this stuff so
I don't go to the the real thing and
screw up a bunch of stuff nope here okay
all right let's just make this big again
okay sometimes got import stuff we're
need the hardware camera not the
graphics camera that's a dependency on
module yeah that should have been done
already but ok ok we blog report blog
getting close ok I never remember the
key to oh yeah auto import stuff on a
how to import like everything on
IntelliJ be useful remember so the other
thing that I forgot to grab is a like I
need to implement photo callback which
is the helper that I had mentioned ok
now everything's green and i'm pretty
sure
that I can try and run yeah okay so well
as compiling again what I did was just I
created this new fragments I got rid of
the default fragment from the main
activity and replaced it with this
fragment that I've created I gave it a
layout with a surface surface view I'm
implementing photocall back which is the
helper code that i mentioned and i'm
going to walk through the rest of the
code well how do we do that now ok
that's fine ok so yeah forgot to update
the manifest um of course it's going to
crash so what we're doing uh first we
got a grab a reference to to the surface
view we need that for the camera on
Android you cannot use the camera like
in your app without first like you know
showing a preview of it it just it won't
work it'll crash like or it won't give
you access to the camera to take a
picture so that's why we need to have
the surface view there and then we say
add a call back to the surface view and
what this does is a the surface view
takes a little bit to initialize itself
and so we're waiting until after we have
a surfaceview a surface created to
initialize the camera if we didn't do
this we'd have a race condition and like
most the time it wouldn't work so yeah
so from uncreate we like add this
callback for the surface creation the
surface creation does the unit camera
calls that so let's take a look at in a
camera ok first do we have a camera some
you know not all phones have cameras
class does so that's good then we're
going to just call camera open we like
have a
review we're going to stop the you know
set the camera Oh camera preview is this
this is in pretty sure that I included
this um it's like an example that
somebody from google had done I don't
remember exactly what was different but
they had done something to make it not
awful um that sort of helps you control
control that okay so this is the
definition Slyke all that the
interfacing I they just two things
what's it called gift flow control and
going to implement methods okay alright
so now we're ready to create oh yeah we
gotta in the image grabber on honest
hatch okay so in the unattach we want to
grab a reference to this and for those
of you who aren't familiar with a the
life cycle on Android for fragments the
very very first thing that happens in a
fragment life cycle is bomb attached and
that's basically the activity is you
know first starting to build the
fragment and it passes a reference to
itself to the fragment and we can use
this to you know to keep hold a
reference to that activity if
um you know if there's something else
the other way that you can do it
anywhere else is just to say you know
get activity so we could have you know
we could have done it like this we're
like we could have said you know casket
activity but it's it's kind of nice to
have it done like very explicitly a non
attached it's a good place for it and
then the other thing instead of instead
of finishing the activity here we're
going to say start guild which goes here
okay sue the same thing there and yeah
and then that's basically all we need to
do for image grabbing the images we're
going to have a layout for the Builder
fragments just going to copy that whole
thing okay all right in here reason
framelayout because we want to have
things on top of each other without sort
of respect to where the other piece is
we don't care about that is where
everything is just going to be centered
and the image so the image view is going
to be a preview which will kind of make
it a little bit nicer as we process
images every time we move to the next
image it's going to replace that image
view and a progress bar which just sits
in the middle so just spin around and
look pretty until us that you know tell
us that there's some work being done
that you know we haven't lost all
control
that's important and now I'm going to
add a builder fragment and this is a
decent chunk of code but it it's not
really you know it's not really too bad
what's called gift builder frag go
through and put stuff see while I'm
doing this uh basically as you can see
the only things that really in the view
we are inflating builder and then in on
resume we just kick off this background
task the background task just basically
it steps through that list of files that
we created which is file name yeah right
here we're creating a list of bitmaps
and then I have this this thing that
that I did a you know it's just a simple
bitmap manipulation thing at pull you
know it kind of grabs a file name gets
the bitmap out of the file if it's a
it's a bitmap file yeah so let's okay um
so the other thing is you jump back to
the integer second so I'm going to tell
you the secret to how to build a gift
find a good library so that's what I did
um it's a it's really really easy if you
find a good library so the library code
um is just generate like I like step
through I create this array list of
bitmaps and then I you know I set a one
or two parameters on that and then it
just goes it's done so it's this is in
this stack overflow yeah I included a
comment there and i kind of like i
pulled this out because it was a big
long file and you know it's a package in
my my library I give credit everything
for this but uh yeah that's where it
comes from works well so yeah so I again
have an array list of bitmaps we have an
array list of files each file gets
pulled into a bitmap stored in the array
list we pass that arraylist to this
library that you know steps through that
and builds a gift which is a byte array
for us and then I use my my file
manipulation stuff to to basically
persist that to the file system as a
gift and then we're done like that's
that's really the only thing here and
then we go to a you know start display
and i'm just going to stub that out for
now ok so that's going to be finished
and we need we need a fragment
transaction here to start running so we
called that about this and we're not
going to add it we're going to replace
it because something already exists
there we want to get rid of the
defragment that's on there so that's the
sort of you know pretty basic fragment
transaction we get the fragment manager
you get a transaction we replace the
container is I think it's actually
defined yeah it's the frame layout ID
the idea of the frame layout the
top-level component in that activity so
we replaced that with this new fragment
and then we're done so we added the new
fragment transaction in the main
activity keep the screen on while we're
running yeah so let's do this before we
before we try and run act if I don't do
this the screen will turn off and then
we'll be in this like weird state where
if I turn the screen back on it'll go
through on resume again and it'll try
and build the fragment again so we
actually just want to set this set the
screen to just stay on while we're
running this thing and this is just an
Android thing like you can do this on
any Android app in an activity you can
do a bunch of stuff with with window
layout parameters it's like kind of the
direction the Android was moving to help
reduce the use of wakelocks they added
these kind of nice things like this one
keeps the screen on it used to be you
needed to grab a wakelock to keep the
screen on and that caused a whole bunch
of you know power issues like apps not
releasing that way Clark properly you
know running down people's batteries
like turn the screen on when it
shouldn't have been so you know this is
this is the right way to do it um okay
uh we um not sure should we put the eye
candy in now or should we run it what
you guys think do you want you want to
see more stuff or do you want to just
like look at the output in the terminal
votes anybody know I'll just run it's
been a little
yeah alright so we're just going to run
because it's been a while since we've
tried to run and it may break shouldn't
but it might okay so yeah ok glass
gallop gallop gallop I real that's
what's running um oh yeah so sorry I
didn't change it but you can see I want
to show you guys the the output here so
we paused on that one I wonder did I not
put any logs here
okay so yeah this generate image
generated image like memories being
chewed up so tell tale sign that you're
doing something and there's our there's
our guest this one let's do this see you
want to call this pull that okay and
that's that's the gift that we just
grabbed all right so doing stuff that's
good but that screen world was building
like it was really not obvious that we
were that we were really doing much so
the next thing is we're going to add uh
we're going to add some eye candy and
again I'm just going to like copy this
whole thing in here because there's a
lot of like little changes along the way
there keep changing the names of things
so that this is okay all right so
basically all this is a that I added I
have this little progress updater thing
that updates that the progress bar
dialogue and when you pause it it will
kill it which is really really important
to do because it's an asic task and if
you go to on pause and like you don't
kill this thing you might kind of just
stick around for a while and async tasks
execute see really unless you tell them
do otherwise which we're not doing here
so that causes problems when you have an
async task that never finishes any other
thing that we're doing is we added this
on progress update to our background
gift builder async task and this is just
going to update remember the layout
where we had the image this just updates
that so each time we each time we step
through a bitmap I say publish progress
and I pass it the bitmap you know we
already have a reference to bitmap it's
really easy to set an image with a
bitmap so should be able to
and this time we'll watch the output ok
let's can see sort take pictures ok now
it should be doing a fragment
transaction should be yeah there we go
so it's through those pretty quickly and
then you see that the progress in the
middle is just going and again we're you
know building this nothing special
happens at the end it's going to just do
the same thing where it tells us the
name so I'm just gonna you know keep
going here yeah finishes the activity
after that so now the next thing is
starting to think about like how we're
going to get this content off of glass
like you know I had some ideas about
like initially what what I might want
for the flow and one of the you know
relatively obvious things like well I'm
building this gif it would be cool if I
could share that so my first thought was
okay there are these static cards they
create cards in your timeline so let me
show you so this is the timeline
together like you know random stuff i
took a picture earlier emails this is
from i think this is one of the ones
that i did from the finished version of
this okay so like the timeline is just
all of these all these cards right and
with a mirror API card its grab one of
those ok so the news ok so this is a
this is called Winkfield it's an RSS
reader for for glass you tap on it and I
can save it or I can view a website and
a lot of glassware has like maybe the
picture has it that's a ok so that's
Google+ but a lot of us where has this
share thing where you can share too
glassware that accepts whatever mime
type so if we're just sending texts as
long as the glassware says I can receive
text you can send a you know something
from my class were to say pocket which
is what I want them does or you can send
it to a contact the email or like
whatever you know as long as it says I
allow you to send me text you can share
to that back glass for which is really
cool like Evernote you can share text or
images or whatever so I was think I'm
like okay create a card and put some
menus on it and share stuff out from
that card can't do that yet that is just
not implemented it's apparently
something that the team wants to do they
just haven't gotten around to it yet so
um I'm going to show you how to create a
card but it just it's not going to be
very useful yet so let's look at that so
this is on onpostexecute before we start
the display and I'm not really sure this
is the right place for it but it's where
I put it so whatever okay oh yeah this
is another thing I wanted to point out
real quick I wrote this platform utils
helper and I have this um is glass
method and basically like there's a
really really easy way to test if you're
running on glass since I'm building this
is an android APK you could install this
AAP kya phone what this means is you can
have one thing that you're distributing
running on both class and Android
devices you don't need a whole separate
app if you're running on glass like you
can have all your background stuff do
the same and just surface different
things to the user so I did this with my
works app I have a version of a
walkie-talkie that we did tickle that
runs on glass like you can just tap it
and you start a walkie-talkie thing with
somebody it's like hard code right now
to talk to my coworker so I'm not going
to demo it but anyways like it's that's
what we do like it's the same it's the
same code base I just have this check up
front that says are we glass then we do
a different UI so thing that I haven't
done yet is grab a reference to the gif
file that we've created so I'm going to
do that and this is just a static string
ok and then yeah so okay we are back at
a the last part of building a gift like
I just inserted this with on post
execute sort of assuming we need to be
running on the main thread here to build
static cards and like you know insert
things into the timeline not sure I
didn't test it but it seemed right to me
so that's why I put it there so yeah the
first thing is the params is the file
name of the gif I created so we want to
keep that and the main activity as a
static member so that we can get it in
the image display section and the next
the next chunk is how we create cards
credit cards luckily is about as easy it
is
mirror but they're even fewer things you
can do with it right now so all we do is
we create a new card add an image to it
we say it's going to be full screen
there are a couple different layouts you
can have it like where the image is kind
of shrunk on one third of the screen and
then you have text for two-thirds or you
can have the image be full screen and
then the text just gets but wherever
they feel like putting it and we set
text to be the the file name if we fail
to get an image you are I we say that we
can't put anything there then we just
insert into the timeline really simple
and you guys saw like I showed an
example of what that looks like right
there so this is what you end up with
but again I can't do anything with us
like there's no way to add menus right
now but like I said that's coming
hopefully soon um alright so just have
seen what that does i'm not going to
bother running that right now so the
viewer now we're on to the last part we
want to be able to display what we've
done i want to be able to see it in
glass um help if i spelt things
correctly sometimes we go
okay so yeah this is our final final
fragment transaction and I will explain
the first show after I finish the rest
of it is it's sort of a after thing and
this is the entirety of the code for our
viewer it's really short
okay so I pounded my head against the
wall for hours trying to get like a
movie view to play this gift I kept
getting divided by zero errors for the
for the length of it there's something
weird with either weird with the library
that i'm using or I'm not setting
something properly in there but after
like three hours I gave up and I was
like okay I know I know what you will
work so that's what I did so i created
this like gift web view again I put it
in my library just to like you know cut
down on the amount of code show but this
is it's also very simple you know we
want to grab the file and then I have
like some HTML here you know it's it's a
little web page that we have an image
and I said aight i tried to set the
height in the width but I think I showed
up front if that doesn't doesn't care
it's just like nope I'm going to do
whatever I want so um and then you load
it with the base URL so that so that
when you add the big if you are I in
here it won't just load something blank
um you'll get like origin issues if you
don't do it this way um but it's a
pretty straightforward um so with that
should be able to run yeah alright so
let's run this this actually I think
we're done with code at this point
okay so it's taking pictures first first
fragment okay should be done taking
pictures and do our private transaction
yep it goes ok now it's building and
this always takes a minute or something
there's another reason to cut down the
size of each image like this would take
a really long time if I had a larger
images actually was getting out of
memory areas when I was taking a full
size I'm sure there's smarter stuff that
I could have done around memory
management but not going to happen over
the weekend it should be pretty close
let's look at what says okay we go all
right now it's so this is what I was
talking about it like it's all the way
with lies in a ship you know it should
actually be kind of in the center and
it's cutting off the bottom right now ok
and now depending on ok good dad didn't
do that yet um ok that's enough it's not
showing so I'm going back over here I'm
gonna unplug it's been overheated so
getting the gift off class I mentioned
before about the static cards and how
static cards are really like how I
wanted to do it I wanted to have a card
go into the timeline that I could like
click a menu and say share to whoever
that would be really nice like okay I
can't do that there's no there no hooks
right now and the GDK so easily push
stuff off like yeah I could have written
a you know code to push it up to a
server and I have to write server code
to to handle that and I really didn't
want to do that it's going very lazy so
um you know basically like this stuff
the glass team knows that these issues
exist they you know like we're going to
have stuff for that but not yet so we
just kind of have to wait the thing that
I'm doing right now is I say like okay I
found this really stupid hack that works
where you can download and install the
Google Drive ATK arm and then just call
this a this share intense oh I know why
this doing okay so we have this intense
oh no that's not the thing
another bit okay sorry there is one more
code bit um here we go so it's a there's
new this share compat thing is
relatively new in a compatibility
library what it does is it allows you to
specify some particular application that
you're going to share directly to so
I've done this for for some stuff in in
talk ray like so I actually had some
familiarity with this I just didn't
realize it worked on glass 4dr um in it
it kind of doesn't it kind of doesn't
actually I should I should demo that
part because I showed it like at the
beginning is really hacky ok glass grab
a gif ok so this one's going to run
longer because it's 10 pictures instead
of five so again like typically if you
were going to do sharing with Android
you'd say like ok I'm just going to do a
generic share intent and that gives you
a list of all the apps that like except
the you know whatever type of content
you're sharing and then you pick one you
can't do that on glass but with this
share compat thing you can specify
specifically the thing you want to share
too and it gives you like a nice a nice
way to do that instead of you know kind
of writing stuff that like kind of hopes
that the package name stays the same
it's a little bit nicer in a little
cleaner and you get these kind of nicer
views out of it and drive happens to
work ok with class luckily like I didn't
have to log in or anything when I when I
set up drive like I just dropped the APK
in and I had my account
so that was that was nice and then just
taking forever here so in the final
version what does is it will display
hopefully soon and then after five
seconds it just comes up with the share
thing and then it shares and then it's
done so like I said super hacky but it
does work the other way that Jenny had
mentioned was you can you can do some a
lot stuff like if you're going to do it
just for yourself just like I'm
developing this thing I'm using it you
can hardcode a token and so that you can
so that you can push stuff too like
Google+ or something with the with the
Android Google Plus client or you
there's like this really hacky work
around with with mirror it's very
complicated like I don't even remember
what the what the mirror thing was it
was this kind of us I think like you
push a thing down oh no you have to you
have to send out a mirror thing back to
yourself that has the share that like
knows the file name and then you can get
it and share it out this is crazy or you
can do embed it off like the Lawford
devices but that also is like not to
closing so I just used rod remember this
feels like building um it now would be a
good time for questions though a
simulator um no but you can you can do
most of this stuff with the Android
simulator like like I said most of us
will work on Android you just can't do
the the live cards and you can't do the
class specific stuff so yeah I think
that's probably something that they're
well aware that needs to exist people
have built you know like simulators for
mirror and I know there's a guy that's
working
on doing something on the design side is
a simulator but no I don't through
cellular gigi is not yet know so it's
english only for now it's only you can
only get it in the u.s. they're only
supporting english right now i think
probably because that's a hard problem
to like make sure that it's like
consistently working well and it is
supposed to adapt to your voice over
time although i've heard you know from
some people who have like accents things
like that that it it still is kind of
like you have to be very clear and
concise like you know kind of speak well
when you're talking to glass um other
other GDK glassware can actually use its
own voice recognition stuff so you could
put like a different voice recognition
library and if you wanted to okay a few
so yeah we we finally have to build and
get to the drive so this is what happens
with the share compact thing like i said
it's really hacky like but you can you
can just kind of swipe through to get to
the ok button like i could maybe I'm
afraid to do this maybe change the
folder but not going to I just ok number
done so uh olea you had a question no I
think she have a question with which I
think she's just waiting oh alright
sounds like okay he'll be else yes have
you tried having to communicate with
your
mm-hmm I mean what I have in mind is
maybe your phone is more powerful than
your glass and offloading some of the
work to in something nearby yeah that's
interesting so I actually have an app
that pushes notifications from glass to
or from my phone to class so that's one
that I'm working on I'm like getting
close to ready to release it there's a
waiting for Google to approve it what
you're talking about is a little
different though I guess you could push
data over bluetooth I've heard that you
can hack the myglass app and
reverse-engineer the bluetooth
communication that's going on obviously
that's a fair amount of work it's um
already have native libraries but the
other thing is like you know what about
you could you could go over bluetooth to
your phone but you could also just do
that on a server right way you can push
up the stuff to a server that's what a
lot of people do for like there are
projects around you know taking photo
with glass doing image pressing on the
server and then giving the data back to
glass I originally thought yeah but if
your internet connection isn't that
isn't that great right you you're you
know I mean you're kind of limited if if
you're going off of glass for processing
anyway so I completes his connections
can you get low level side yeah all
right that's what we do for um oh no
bluetooth with Bluetooth snow with Wi-Fi
you can okay um you could try to connect
to my phone eat your icon yeah you click
then on my phone I have to make a server
something like that you put android
supports that you can do a web server
van Berg like three there are ways to
get active and yeah we actually use like
you know sockets for the walkie-talkie
app it just does not work over bluetooth
okay so your walkie-talkie app is over
like yeah right now I mean we'll
probably figure something out for okay
we want to release it well it works i
mean you develop that if you
yeah yeah that's what this one does yeah
why can't just ignore that yeah you add
the file and then you put a couple
parameters against the activity in the
manifest you tell it like you have the
intent for voice for voice launch and
then you have the metadata that says
okay here's the voice launch and then
here's the here's the xml file that
defines what that is yeah yeah no it'll
be fine it'll just look and riddled
ignore it see no no it won't do a voice
launch on Android it will Android it'll
just ignore it you can use the launcher
to watch it but his question was more
like is this going to cause problems if
you want to have the same at both yeah
right that also wasn't it's not
scrollable you have to implement that I
think I wonder if it saved this I always
thought of course it's very last
my left so you see there's the Google
education
