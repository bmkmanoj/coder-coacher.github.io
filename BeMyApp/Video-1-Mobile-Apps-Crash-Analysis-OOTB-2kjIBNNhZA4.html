look at HP at post mobile for android
app post Mobile is a mobile application
monitoring tool that of course gives you
information about crashes but it gives
you much more for instance information
about how the end user experiences your
app it shows you what screens are slow
or the amount of battery it uses and it
captures what steps the user takes
before a crash occurs with the great
help for debugging your app so let me
show you how to use the app pulse SDK
first you create your app in the
dashboard each app has a unique key that
you will need for the integration of the
SDK so you first build your Android app
the normal way after this you wrap your
apk with the SDK by running a single
command this will create a new apk that
you could upload to Google Play for
distribution to your end users
so we have distributed the app people
are using it but unfortunately crashes
have occurred so let's look in at post
mobile and see what happened so here we
have the overview of the crashes they
are grouped around certain actions users
take let's look at this one now we can
see that these crashes were caused by an
illegal argument exception below here we
get information about the device so we
can see what orientation the device was
in operating system version and app
version and on the bottom here we have
crash logs in crash trail the crash log
gives you the full stack tricks
including the exact line in which the
exception occurred the crash trail shows
you what steps the user took before the
actual crash happened so in this case we
can see that the user navigated back and
tap the yes button and then the crash
happened so showing here are the
activities in the buttons as they are
coded for that app
you can enhance the crash trail with
information internal to the app by using
breadcrumbs i will show you this in the
next video another nice feature of app
pulse mobile is that you can integrate
it with a bug tracking system so I've
integrated this app with JIRA so now I
can take all this information about this
crash and create a bug report of this so
I hit submit that was successful and now
if i go to giro we can see that a new
bug report has been created with all the
information that we just saw in at pulse
mobile thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
