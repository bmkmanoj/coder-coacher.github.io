about baggage claim so I have been
pushed shoved jostle and manhandled at
baggage claim many a times so there's
got to be a better way of doing this
it's got of your more efficient process
where you don't lose all your respect so
Edgar team Baghdad and we are exactly
solving for that so what exactly are we
doing we are using ble vicens where
passengers put these vegans in your
baggage and we provide location and
tracking services right to the point
where you collect your baggage from the
carrusel man is our wonderful it would
be if someone who to notify you while
you're taking a bathroom break that your
luggage is actually on the carrusel so
how exactly do we do this it's over to
our people okay so with PEG peg we
wanted to do a couple of things
everybody has felt you know the anxiety
and the fear that you feel when you
check your bags in you don't know if
it's going to appear on the other side
so we wanted me to make it simple to
take your luggage with any of the
beacons out there so meet Jackie she can
buy any of the Deacons available in the
market and she can pair it with her
phone and just toss it in the luggage
that she has to put one in the box and
she'll put one in her luggage the red
bag and when she's about to go to LA
she's going from LA to SF l so when
she's about to get on a flight group she
checks in her bags at Nellie Ruggles LA
right now we detect where the bags are
she picks her flight let's say she's
going with virgin america and underneath
you'll see that there's a reliability
rating and this reading just indicates
how many times this company has lost
plugging in the past saturday's grateful
she loses virgin and she
she selects the red bag and the garlic
box right there says let's fly and
passively cook we collect a timeline of
what's happening where the days we know
when she checks in LA where you know
when her luggage is on the plane with
her we know when she leaves LA Airport
name head over to SFO right now in all
this information is strike one luggage
arrived at SFO she knows the luggage is
on the carousel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
