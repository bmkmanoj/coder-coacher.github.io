Subterra cognita and the purpose is to
prevent accidents and save light ok so i
guess the app itself derives from terra
incognita so I've known land and this is
mostly to do with subterranean services
so it's subterra cognitive and we're
using this to map with a series of a
series of beacons that are all placed
throughout the actual cavern like
structures in this case we're actually
using something that one of the other
guy has helped us brainstorm we're using
a mineshaft so in a mine chef you've got
a bunch of things that can go wrong
probably one of the things is the risk
of collapse or with light leaks org any
other stuff that any of the leaders that
can that will signal off different leaks
or anything else that you probably want
to trigger the system itself you kind of
call it the hive mind so each signal
will send the signal to another vegan
which will send to another vegan which
will eventually set it to your to your
device so whenever you can actually move
around you will be able to you'll be
able to see the real life map so you'll
be able to see exactly where you're
going through system of 3d scans so
consider India we've got a bunch of
software that's coming out that actually
lets us map the entire surface with with
actual textures and this is currently a
reality of of the actual or the actual
movement around so upon seeing this you
can also see where you're off to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
