you how to code the node.js server you
can download the files from github using
the link in the description once you've
downloaded the zip folder under the
source folder you will find the server
jas file
at the beginning will call the library's
we need HTTP because it's a web-based
server and Cylon because it is a silent
object that will interact with the gpios
then the three variables below are the
pins where you plug your RGB s here we
use pins 14 20 and 0 you can plug your
LEDs differently but you'll have to
change those values here as well so we
create the HTTP server and we parse the
requested page so if we access the 4 /
change page it means we will change
values if we change the red color will
need to make sure it's between 0 and 255
will then create an object called Cylon
robot will tell it that we're on a Intel
Edison board on an LED and give it a pen
that we defined earlier that's called
red GPIO then we'll call it function
that will control the LEDs brightness
between 0 and 255 after well type start
and apply this to the gpios same thing
applies for the other colors with the
blue and green parameters otherwise if
we don't access the change page this
means we are using a web browser and we
will load the index dot HTML page this
page is composed of three sliders one
for each color it works thanks to the
socket i/o so created another function
that interacts with the socket i/o in
order to change the brightness of our
LEDs apart from that everything works
exactly as I presented previously on the
change page finally at the end wall
launched the server using the port 8080
the regular port 80 is already used by
the Intel Edison so this code is an
example of how you can code your own no
Jas server you are free to call your own
see you in the last part to see how the
product works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
