game using the sprouts capture and Matt
features
the sprouts capture features can be used
to capture a snapshot of any items that
are placed on the map this program uses
the sprout to capture a moment and uses
that moment as a race track for a little
racing game
you
i'm going to set up the racetrack with a
few items here these will be the
boundaries of the track
the way this program works is by
capturing a moment using the sprout API
once the moment is captured it extracts
an image and then an outline from the
moment the image is used to form the
background image of the game
now the moment is captured and displayed
and as I remove the actual items you can
see the picture of them displayed on the
map in this game one car uses the arrow
keys to move and the other used the WASD
keys the program does a little bit more
than just capture a moment it also
extracts the outline of the objects and
treats them as solid walls within the
game logic this means that if your car
hits one of the objects it will stop
you
this program source code will be
available for download below one version
will be the full ready to play game and
the other will have tasks for you to
complete on your own in order to finish
the game since building a game engine is
beyond this tutorial the tasks you will
perform will only be sprout related
things such as capturing a moment
extracting an outline and so on to
finish the game you will only have to
edit the main window dot CPP file and
you will only have to use things related
to the sprout SDK
this video showed an application of
capturing a moment extracting a picture
and extracting an outline to make a
small quick game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
