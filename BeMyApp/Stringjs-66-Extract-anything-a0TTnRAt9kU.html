be very hard especially when the
original string is weird strange need
help us with that and more precisely
with a really powerful between methods
before using between methods will check
out the prefixes and suffixes so let's
start with the prefix going to create a
new string containing coder power here I
will you the message chomp left in order
to get the word after my prefix here are
prefix is coder so let's check the
results and we do get power as a result
and of course you can do the same with
Chomp right which will remove the suffix
and send us the prefix let's check it
out and now we get coder and now I will
have a string with some returns
I can use the method called lines which
extracts a new string into an array on
our ray will have three entries hello
how are you today and best regards as
you can see in the results we have three
strings in the array let's finish with
between to get the value from the inside
HTML tags for instance you can use the
method between we have to specify the
tag from which we need the string
here we'll put the tag a now let's see
if it works we do get a value from the
tags between works with anything let's
try to get the value from between these
parentheses
one more thing we can use between to get
the text out there specific word to hear
we're using the word note
awesome can you see this server side
guys are sending us really weird string
there are some 12 scores and dashes we
totally don't care about could you be
kind and remove it try it out and
hopefully you'll be ready for the
challenge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
