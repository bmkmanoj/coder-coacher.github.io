there's really two parts to our demo
I've got one piece of it here as you can
see this a little bit of tidying up
around the graphics but this shows you
the wallet where the merchant would keep
all of his cards it's just good um so
much and can have a number of different
hoppers that they have for consumers but
it's let's pretend that he's just got
this coffee today a customer comes in
and wants to buy one of these offers so
maybe they want to buy ten coffees for
the price of seven so much it goes on
his phone enters the number of of
coffees bought by the customer in that
cell and then click send gets a
confirmation button want to make sure
that entered the right number you please
confirm take them back here you would
have an event Rihanna and then to the
customer
so I think the most difficult issue
we've faced has been around presentation
because our app really goes from mobile
to mobile we've had to put some
workarounds in the app to simulate like
cutting from from one app to the other
and then we've done that really two ways
the first is we've used the graphics to
clearly indicate when we're in the
merchant app and we've got different
color graphics to illustrate when were
in the consumer and then we've got a
button I think that that's the fake bet
we've got a button that you press that
allows you to switch back and forth
between the different views
I think any everything finished and then
getting the pitch and story nailed so
that it's within five minutes I think
we're feeling comfortable on track you
know we've we've we've cut down and
focused a lot on the feature set and to
make sure that we've got someone get me
represent in under five minutes but you
as you can see we're pretty much there
we've just got to lock in a few more the
graphics and then spend a bit of time
giving the story
seven seven hours good what a night
before yeah we went we went earlier than
we did the doctor for I think we made a
mistake staying too late the first night
I think and we decided that it would be
better to have everyone strong and on
good energy today so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
