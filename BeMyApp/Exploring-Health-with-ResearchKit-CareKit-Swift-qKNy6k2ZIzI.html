webinar we'll be starting in a few
minutes we'll be starting a few minutes
folks
you
sorry ladies and gentlemen welcome to
another be my webinar once again I'm
Fernando and it's a pleasure having all
of you here we are with Mattel creeper
this webinar we have he's an iOS
developer and as was note and he's going
to be showing us all the cool potentials
behind Apple's health kit such as health
and research kit and with that I'll give
the man of the hour the screen so my
tale you have the honors okay thank you
okay
thank you everyone thank you for another
for introduction and welcome to the
attendees of this webinar about I have
to say to you some framework by Apple
care kit and research kit before
starting I would like to say that if you
want to continue the conversation feel
free to use this hashtag on Twitter so
we can monitor this this tag and provide
you reply about these two posts on
topics conversation folks if you have
any questions for material leave them in
the comment section on the YouTube
channel
at the end we'll moderate them okay okay
thank you and let me introduce myself
I'm Mateo I'm senior develop I guess
developer since the early release of iOS
so they - doc - and in the last few year
I became a research kit and care kit
advocate I'm also the founder of a group
of developer of freenas developer called
boost code and if you want to get in
touch with me feel free to use Twitter
or LinkedIn I would like to start to
speak about these tools on framework but
for sure I have to tell you something
more we have to go back to the 2014 to
the WWC one Apple decide to release air
kit I remember that I was there in that
everyday and in the list of the scale
the events I managed to see a new a new
topic ELQ it and it was so curious to
know and learn about that and decided to
attend that talk real kid is for sure
something not so new as I said is is a
variable since 214 but what is it it's a
framework is a system that allows you to
collect information and store them sell
your devices since that very moment all
the people on the developer decided to
use the your day or own own system so
developer from fitb and decide to store
the data inside their storage under
developer store the information inside
that other storage so you know Apple
apps are developed in a sandbox way so
this information can be collected from
an application from another one so Apple
decided to put all this information in
one place and this is happening too with
homekit with the latest release of iOS
10 then after a year a year in 2015 on
April Apple decide released research kit
research kit is a tool is a framework on
open source framework that allow the
researcher and developer to to join to
develop application and the talu people
to collect information in anyway you
know the work of a researcher is pretty
hard
yeah to generate to create a study
collect information and Apple say you
know all the people have in their pocket
a mobile phone so why not start to use
that in order to collect information
instead of using a piece of paper so
this is the basic idea behind research
kit and in 2016 so a few months ago on
Apple Apple released care kit
akira-kun has passions caregiver and
physician so it's a system more focused
to the to the patient and in research it
is more focused on the research but able
to say that he'll get research kit and
here we provide a full cycle about the
health and enable to say the mobile
health
in order to proceed I would like to
spend a little more words about
healthkit so Hill kid probably is well
known by the health app that the one
with the hurt they read hurt on your
springboard and also he look it is able
to provide your medical ID so if you are
on the lock screen of your device and
you swipe from the right from the left
to your right you will be able to see
your medical ID so for example in u.s.
paramedics are able to collect
information about you contact numbers
your blood type and going on and for
sure as we said his kit is a data
storage and encrypt data storage that is
able to provide a PA API to all the
application that are inside your device
so application can ask you to provide
the trust to collect information stored
inside and start used that data to
manage them to provide statistics inside
and going on let's now have a look at
the first real important framework
research kit the circuit as I said aims
to provide something new to the
developer from one point of view and to
researcher from the other point of view
you know since the since the beginning
of research II and since that very
moment research were driven by a piece
of paper put probably on on the door so
you have to stay close to that piece of
paper in order to know that a medical
trial was going on so if you put this
kind of tool on a mobile phone the only
limit is the Apple Store itself so you
have a wider reach for sure
the data are driven so you have not
anymore to collect information and write
them on a piece of paper or cross or
provide this information on the paper
but is avoid the system that the device
provides you and that ask you
information in the right manner at the
right time so connected to the other
point that this is a continuous stream
of data so the the system is able to ask
you then for me
using no local notification push
notifications to get in touch with you
more than once and a really interesting
thing is to provide the patient
real-time feedback about the formation
that is providing so with the previous
method I have to say the people are
meted you are able to provide
information you have to send this piece
of paper and nothing attends anymore
this time you are able to collect
information and see what happens
directly on your mobile phone I would
like to spend a couple of slide about
the number of the research it you know
research it was released as I said as
open source and the early beginning five
application were released fully open so
you can go to to get up and check for
the the code of is that these five
application and this fact application we
were able to collect more than 80
thousand passions or subscriber in the
seven month and in particular one of
these is my account by Stanford
University this information is really
awesome for me
you know Stefan University was able to
collect more than 10,000 subscriber in
less than 24 hours with an application
the researcher of Stanford said that we
were they were able to reach a similar
goal during a full year and having more
than fun for study at the same time so
an application was able to reach up
whether as we say the wider reach and in
in a very short time and probably it's
really interesting to check also the
drop of the user you know if you are a
developer of consumer application you
your worst nightmare is for sure they
they one drop so a user downloaded your
app from the App Store and then in less
than 24 hours it delete it from your
from this device and with receive
 we we know that this will not
happen and Apple release on his blog
about research get some information some
insight about asthma health asthma
asthma up and as you can notice the
white bar are the SI are the inter
period the time the day when a push
notification is has been pushed so the
system is able to keep the user to
patient in touch and we have more that
the fifty percent of the initial
subscribers still continue using the
application after one month or so it's a
really cool song goal mmm I have to say
that for sure you can ever look at the
code so if you go to the github page of
the research kit you can have a full
review of the code you can check for
issue from the new idea proposal of the
data developer so I encourage you to to
have a look at the page and if you want
to share your your idea and provide the
new improvements to the to the framework
you know is open source so feel free to
join and provide new information and I
would like to go a little deeper inside
research it so recipie that is what is
it what is research research it is I can
see icon structure composed by three
models the first model provided by Apple
is the consent so the concept allows you
to create in easy way I can say a sort
of onboarding system where the
participants can provide their
information and also they can say in the
NDA the privacy check for data usage and
going on so the system allows you to
take care only of the content all the
dividual or the view controller and
other stuff are already provided by
Apple you have only to check for the
color and for the content that they
other Chuo some feature is that the
system provides a signature manager so
is able to prove to check the signature
of the page
and the PDF generator so at the end the
system is able to create a PDF file of
all the information provided by the
patient the second module is the survey
probably is the most important module
because also we will notice that this
model will be used also in care kit the
survey model allows you to create easy
the easiest way you can imagine a survey
so you can create a system provide to
surprise you and the chance to use
question in a single with a single
answer multiple answer image task and
going on so in this way you can create
in a really few numbers of code a simple
or even a complex survey and also is
really easy to optical eyes so you have
only to manage or to pay attention to
the content and not to the visual the
last but not least for module is the
active task the active task allows you
to to ask the patient to provide tests
using the device itself so
semi-controlled
test using the sensor of your iPhone in
this case for you have to tap on the
screen of the device and the system is
able to collect this kind information or
you can collect information from third
party Arbor for example as if we said
information come from Hell kit provided
by third party application or our dealer
you know fit dance at the watch and
going on
another important thing is that you are
able as you notice afar to to ask the
user to provide data you are able to
collect data from from Hell kit from
other suits and they're really
interesting thing that stopped the
researcher to say oh researching is
something really interesting is that
that you can also connect to Big Data
for example in asthma health app you can
notice that the application is able to
to collect information about your status
about asthma but also is able to collect
the quality of air near you and you know
if you are able
to collect all this kind information and
provide a packet of information or to
your physician for surely we'll be able
to have something more in order to try
to to learn and figure out how to
improve your your health and for sure so
we are able to mix information about I
the unsubscribe by the user by phone
sensor so gyroscope and going on the
third part part is sensor and the big
data so the limit is a probably is only
your imagination we we said that
research it for sure is committed to
Apple so you have to you can use that on
iOS devices iPhone iPad iPod Touch and
if you are brave enough you can try to
use even that on Apple TV but some
developer decided to port research kit
to Android 2 so you can check for
research stack on key tab and you can
start learning that for sure
this will also developer decided to
board this framework so you can increase
your number of potential patients so
even patients with an Android now can
join our research we since this very
moment we talked about the devices but
we have to say something more research
hit as no backhand so does Apple doesn't
provide any began for research feel free
to use your favorite own so if you have
already won feel free to still use that
and improve your application in order to
to reach or better in order to to make
use of that or you are able to develop
your own and you know in the last few
month Apple released as with the soap
and Zeus so if you want you can try to
develop it even Swift
using the Linux version and some of the
frameworks that are spreading about
about this also have to say that you
know the last week we have the WWC in
san francisco payable and chew free
where they did no new announcement by
helpful about
circuit one was about branching tasks
you know we said that we are able to
create form and sometimes in in a form
we you have to skip a question
checking the previous ones so if we ask
you have a car and you answer no we will
should not have to ask him what's the
color of your car so Apple improved the
system that allow you to manage the
branching off of tasks the second module
for sure is very interesting and eliud
in the easiest way you can imagine to
create a system that allows you to login
for sure and to register so you have
already in place that visual you have
only to connect to your began and also
the system provides you a system to
generate a token or a pass code like it
happens for your lock screen so you you
have to manage important data with this
you for sure will be able to access in
this you can see the best way to your
application and this model is also
compatible with the touch ID so you can
use that to to login inside your
application and the last model is about
charts they improve the charts provided
by the application I would like to say
something about colorblind AB curb blind
app is an application that we developed
as a proof of concept in order to test
and to start working with research kit
you can find it on a Apple Store and it
provides a new approach to test the
color blindness you know sometimes is
tricky to test the curb lines because
you have a pattern with numbers inside
and if your children are not still able
to read and to say that the number is
inside co-brand make use of images of
for example a dog a car so it is easier
for them to notice and to say what's
inside that image so color blind up
would like to provide
kuroh blind test two people that are
still not able to read and if you want
you can also find the full source code
on github so feel free to have a look
and to learn about that and test that
now it's the time of care kit care kit
as I said is the youngest frame applied
by Apple so is has been release in April
of this year and as Apple state is pcs
uh Gnostic so you can be able to use
that for for humans for pets even for
for botanic so you can use for whatever
you want and is able to help you to
collect information and as I said even
Kirk it is open so you can find it on
github at this page and the really
interesting point about Kirk it that is
that is more complex I have to say then
research it but development is really
easy the first model of the six is the
care card probably you notice this this
card during the presentation of care kit
as you can notice we have the upper part
that provides you the day of the week
and each hurt provides you the step the
the complication of the the task that
you have to do during the day so a clear
card is a system that trade the tracks
the treatment and each task can be
defined using a scheduler so you can say
that you have to for example take this
medication one two three time a day or
one day and then wait two or more day in
order to get the other medication or to
use the other medication you can provide
a color in order to out the feedback the
visual feedback of the of the patients
and the really interesting thing is that
if you tap not on the on the dots for
exam
not on the green dot for diet but on the
right you can collect information and
you can provide description with text
images and video to help the patient to
have information about how to proceed
with that task and another module for
care kit is Santa Santa as you notice
use the same system on top then direct
that it's used in the care card so you
have the status the completion status of
the day and you have some tasks that you
have to manage to provide information
day by day
this task are built on top of research
kit so you still use research hip to ask
and to create survey for this able to
say tasks and topics and even you can
use devices like we said before with
data provide provide by L kit or any
other source to provide information to
this part and the really interesting
part you know is that we have collect
information so far and then sine terms
so the next step is to provide to
provide insight about the information so
we can create graphs that are able to
show the correlation between the two
information so we can check the declare
card so the information about the tasks
the symptoms and then we are able to
provide as we as I said grab asked or
tips alert about the progress if the
user is doing well and then the real
interesting part is that we have
assistant to to have a list of
connection of user that we can use or
better we have a list of user that we
can share the information so we can have
all the information that we
not so far collect them and share them
with your physician nurse or your
friends and family old information are
stored inside the care plan store
kirpan and Soria sort of database and
encrypted database and old information
provided by the user inside the care
card and the progress card are stored
inside there and like it happens for
them for research it were sure you are
able to to create to generate PDF and
HTML file and share this file with as I
said your physician your nurse your
caregivers your parents and going on so
as we noted so far care kit is more
focused on the patients on the check of
usage of medication on I have to say on
tasks about checking the patients when
is I have to say alone research kit is
more focus vice-versa on creating groups
of patients in order to study something
so for sure research kit issue is used
before and here kitty use it during for
example I don't know if you have a
surgery and to check if everything is
going well after that as well as we as
you noticed before
we decided to do something also about
care kit and we decided to do something
different and focus on on the on our
pets so as I said his species and
Gnostic so we decided to develop dog hit
dark it is for sure the first care kit
application developed for pets for dogs
and is for sure the first care kit
application developed so far in Italy
and it focused to help the owner of a
puppy to provide information for
the early days of puppy to the vet
so to keep in touch with him and provide
information in order to stay focus and
to manage the health of your dog I have
to say that I try to just to provide you
some information as I said an
introduction to these two topics now I
would like to to ask you if you have any
question feel free to ask and continue
conversation and I'm here to answer your
request so feel free to perfect let me
see I think you pretty much covered
everything very well I thought that any
questions I was gonna ask you the dark
haired I saw one also an Italian version
they're both the same yeah okay perfect
I think your current there are no
questions good job on that part okay
so if you'll want feel free to 12 a
visit to our website and as I said if
you have any idea on any questions feel
free to get in touch back with me with
you know Twitter and LinkedIn that's all
