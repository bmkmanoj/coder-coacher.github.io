on the webinar my finger a couple on the
water as well except my website i will
really would think about me division
engineer visits photos you have kissed
your sister just really just a minute
about five months ago so it's nothin
chillin very limited until Dylan so I'm
just going to tell you what about are
you can develop applications for this
and a couple more tips and tricks then
how to create an identification they are
under application for the nexus bear 400
TV the really want to cook publish all
those applications on the engine to be
born well if you busy clicks over Linda
vulcanizing the applications for the
nexus player and then a quick you donate
if we still have time okay so let's talk
about that to me and then extend or
actually plug into them how many of you
yes yep okay so definitely the most of
you in the developers maybe we can move
in what to do just for a big TV
interface and you can see real this is
this is the love spinach me on North
Dakota deal with it I good or it's gonna
be TV or necessarily get this small
notebooks and if you look to each one a
night and in the box it comes with all
these years and it is connected
application because the front honest you
can kind of call it a superset and so
I'm going to be the superset the protest
they have phone customer relations will
be obtained in all leaving soon you're
going to be by the nexus player on so
that that works on yes then you can
support ask us applications from the TV
spot it's an application that you can
use that the people play music youtube
movie the TV and another streaming in
other like gaming applications and the
story is actually done only 40 80 HP so
a little later how to develop your
ability but basically on the score for
the TV interface you wouldn't see the
normal application so you have to change
your McGinnis and ethnicity for it to be
employed and shown on the storm this
AOSP depends so it's all part of the
AOSP just a few moments like that much
allows you to control this by the soul
eater face on the develops in the face
twice and it made an Intel processor it
which is a essentially hopeful quad-core
Silverman's architecture installed the
homeotic series in it 64-bit speed limit
to port numbers opengl es 3 dot one in
the lazy producers for people ahem it
also has Wi-Fi NC 1 gig of ram u- of
flash USB on-the-go that's probably all
smooth you're wondering oh that's kind
of a geek is really free you can then
say that's a small mini USB port well by
which you can connect an external hard
drive right oh yeah thanks so there's a
mini USB port on which you can connect
an external hard drive and it kind of
natural whatever you want okay so a
quick home and this is such that I just
unplug the back
ok so that's movie HD vm NX is land so
if you have an under education you can
just modify it a little bit includes the
lean Huffington but if you want to play
the obligation though
in the text which include an activity
which will take care of the TV stuff and
also the one that will receive a new
document you also need to integrate on
the TV specific items so for example you
saw these obligations here remember
what's called a banner thank you have
enough looks like we might want to
change your images to have a delicious
the bigger a bigger TV environment and
then so yeah I one of the other things
you need to support non-touchscreen
input because this is not that's
something like remote controls on and
obviously we show that the major
experience because it still lives any
time even if you have a phone in the
tablet some of the applications have a
user experience wouldn't we both devices
so the fame of the TV you have to let
that the user experience with TV
education what removed ok so if you
already have an application or so before
others should be dying all the
ammunition itself you just take a near
activity which groups to the Americas
and you add a little customize that will
be on with experience that's our 300 TV
experience motivation anticipate the TV
specific applications and then you get
to like you get to entertain more than
an application so if you just want to
take one application for following a
tablet or the TV you can do it one if
you're going to have multiple ones which
is a bit
which is a bit more tricky than you can
also do that right so they have to make
sure this is what you have to to end in
there I mean if it's very simple about
the banner as I mentioned before the bun
is air conditioned make sure that this
fall it's just like on if you see
interesting the wicked a child just like
the window they decided to go and you
have to put a hole in case you carefully
I'm a protocol episode I'm not sure
about tamil of your life is there anyone
is not so please knock over okay so you
have to pay just require home because
otherwise ever sell vehicles by my
people and I'm not going to base or so
if all the NSA mention support where
applications to be the better it has to
be a first variable which is actually
doing my parrot team the webinar has
crashed
is actually inside today look at the
major experience deepika lips on the TV
and so on let me make sure that the
defuser experienced this before it's so
that's one other thing the convention
that typically memory card you can also
tell me you can see you can you can
adjust power consuming the screen are in
which order they are when you use it no
November box so you know most of us and
you can see Ferguson energy me here
internally much work to do you have an
opportunity now is your view examples
but you have total take care of that but
we go that lyric and lyric support is
only maybe I 17 API level level 17 so
happy bday no evil for example so any
controller is the Bluetooth compatible
can be used for the next day stuff
example you can use this collaborative
you can either follow comments right
back there and you can use the Amazon
controller you can eat whatever whatever
let's do this compliance you can just as
important well let me just go to pairing
mode and that's it
okay so if you were to support multiple
controls for example chip and photos Kim
oh and the most notorious can be
connected at the same time so for
example one of the demons the oil
cleanser the candy actually found a
puzzle game shows they can play
multiplayer and Satan the same game yeah
so if you things change affects the
relation system in its search system
these are kind of old the onset of
optional saviors soon that will within
another at my back so by a further
information and application to the
typical a storm you have to say if your
application of the game yeah 14k time
tell us as you say is ordinary but if
I'm supporting a fraction game Adam you
have to say it in converting files and
alternative to be done with this then it
will note your energy for tablet for
enriches the computer which will no
longer need to be so our growth in an
application to be only important because
there's no TV as a location for one year
application
we add um but secondly when i actually
get the profile pictures of internal and
external location the alternative to not
be required because this excuse me and
this will not have a gps so you also
need to turn that off the camera
obviously there's no camera in hand so
you also need to take care of that
microphone yeah you will see there is no
microphone in what is going on the
search so that's also all the traps you
can note for example an application in
normal pic or Tokyo you can only take an
education cannot record sound or and
yeah the most is kind of the telephone
telephony features obvious it is now on
the death so have you taken care of all
these things and all the many quite lot
of things to take care of you need to be
aware of but it's just about the
interviews we all want to TV interface
and you know it doesn't use that you get
the double in size camera phone whatever
so a phn is invaluable the diagram and
just mmm IDK you awkwardly manner in the
future and you can
okay so that works on interpreters so it
seems today and obviously in India can
be adapted to to Intel 276 because
otherwise the exodus new devices will
work with any applications so initially
developed algebra then all the
definitions were going home of the box
because having a normal 5 translator and
that will translate in the Java code if
you interfere in there
most of the time or we will also work
but usually we need remedial provisions
with little girls to Intel because you
gain a lot of foot Foreman so it seems
with your application that have gained
50 mg per second performance by a
fortification and it is very weak
ecologist when the condom i'ma say in
decay of a BRI equals all and it
compiles all of the libraries x86
matrices and we five in several store we
also have a lot of third-party libraries
to have the numbers manipulation person
is actually they are supporting
negativity on deck 86 club photos so
there are no we all know community so
there are many others which have taken
volatile exhibit 6 so configuring the
target but they don't have 64 negative
emotion all the 64 days libraries will
be compatible genetically but now you
went wandering alone really verification
or below native code to say on like 50
megs to her name that's okay on the user
it's well let's just say it's a big
another 50 in the next places it's more
than that you have to go it's
recommended basically applications
multiple applications
and the biggest river thames from the
rivet is its activity so it out if you
have both pathetic tradition especially
for giving you first 164 bitch silence
so long movie actual last very very
little so that multi- put and imma be
well and i need not to recommend it
so after you is developing your
nomination you have to be story so that
means you want to upload multiple
education education what about doors oh
yes that's when the vision on oh neato
Store for Android and internal
development I didn't want to worry too
much because in a few minor famous
shopping for and the last minute and
dedicate your seven tools because we
develop a lot of tools that help
developers optimize the application see
bottlenecks graphics power and so on and
to start with I'm actually going to top
the orbital a hassle or actor and
generate additional images which is the
way to speed up the entire emulator so
if you work with in delivering the
market is really slow but with the next
36 image and we go with the Exim install
this is really fast so it's as you just
are having a form on here so it was
written for with the touch I can just
touch to to play with no the electorate
is really comfy room but one of the
things that you have to have it to be
negative about so otherwise you would
cover you live it's more error or Intel
inde or integrated to make chief
development and the viral it is one of
our new school attendance great gave you
an American ship your applications
videos to go and this is 107 200 for the
free end zone on hold for me as well so
it feels to be loved in this application
is also supported in there if you want
to know movies or was it just comes to
me and Merrill you know tell you before
that's when at least one is the Intel
GBA graphics performance analyzer this
allows you to journalize the application
that you filled for windows were ongoing
the record on the target device and you
can play with different metrics so for
example i want you to see the wireframes
cpu load onto the GPL oh and when you
connect the phone to your pc and you
have to see those matches grand also
things change on the phone so for
example if I wants to the wife they may
just click the log in button and on the
phone see how the water appears so this
is real time debugging anyone will be a
lot of metrics and irreducible connect
and then you can do manage accordance he
rather fortunate yes right its next
mission so then new almost three months
now so if you want to do this from a
guarantee you recommend if you doing as
soon as possible because as fast you can
get a little before you would get more
visibility because they are not for now
they are but they're not as many on
there as on the normal Android for
because of the things is going to use so
if you want to eat you want to do it as
soon as possible you might featured in
there or what we don't have is a real
journalist on the place before every
trading as i mentioned to you it is the
support under to be
malta local communities have to take
care small UX guidelines you have before
the occupation 212 there there's no need
to mention of temporary change only
Christian usually all of the work should
be done in the same education usually
always recommend that you give your
little indication will remember you for
the for x86 is not because it's very
simple and you will gain a lot of
performance and yet the last dimension
is all of the tools that will provide
for our vendor development of over the
development which are all with used so
yeah we welcome you to today yeah I'm
seeing anyone has any questions there
was right you know laboratory market and
not yet but the 64 bits of the second 50
emulator cousin was the first one on
board and really click so we're getting
impact but we know before we had removed
as of yet yesterday on amazon a step
yeah why i was actually to be honest I
was a bit surprised because of all that
word but yeah I've seen it yesterday one
second
yeah oh yes it was it's great for
expressing now with expecting to be
honest because in the US the ninety nine
dollars but I get the public companies I
mean I was looking at personal thing I
was looking at the most a 360 I'm an
engineer for law all of any registration
the bureau's he's have a physics Club so
yeah this will what happens but yeah if
you want available in there hopefully
good lunches on their restaurant soon in
Europe as well and hopefully the prices
will go down but that's not in our
control any other missions no it doesn't
well they obviously have a process
because you have to check out the user
experience to see that you all the
assets touchscreen and so on but I
didn't take on so I think we might have
a colleague has been a Miss permission
around november six just after is open
and it took around in our underwear so
it is wrong it might take a bit of an
advocate with more applications and more
ramen engines are recompiling and having
the TV features but dish and a problem
yep
pacific western ontario of Honor I would
assume yes because yeah you do another
how to the nature of all this community
any other questions yeah then right now
thank you very much and get it over to
the next you can be able to go in the
next day after winning the limitation
and again the questions I'm going to be
around so thank you very much
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
is it recording the directory like the
whole world thanks for telling me that
and also eventually but in the spirit
the time we dedicate that time for you
take off course but what's more
important at the move so if you got any
and regard for some projects currently
working on then you again show everybody
your detailer to set up somewhere and
just let me know some beta testers baby
yeah ok let's go down ok hi from my side
um I'm gonna talk a little bit about few
customization on Ambria so first let me
show you use myself my name is karina
i'm originally from austria where study
computer science i'm now working as an
Android developer for about four years
and a moved to munich in the mid of
august my current employers i can mobile
which is designers of her company with
the headquarter in Berlin but with seven
additional locations all over to work
you're looking total about 170 m please
I'm basically Munich and I'm working for
them and B&amp;amp;W where we are developing the
Everett remove apps for conventional
Bibles but actually all the miners I'm
presenting today are all from my leisure
time app which is about controlling
eating's certain manufacturer of
observer manufacturer so let me show me
if you see ya on top you can see the
beta keys
it after healing and also the outside
temperature I'll give you on the bottom
of that I'm able to show dynamic ads and
depending on the actual heating and its
configuration and the app will show you
the appropriate since so if you swipe
from left to the right you can you can
switch between those type 2 blocks
blocks and if you swipe down information
about this country walk so what is a
great epic Allah it's not only about
it's not only about what you can do with
it but also how you can do it so one
lesson I learned during my antennas
Android developer is don't just start
writing code first think of what your
users want just over there what you want
you use over there and then I think of
the best and easiest way how do you keep
it to good practices to create mockups
and all to do some testing with
potential users there tons of tools are
there which can help you with that for
example one of the most things one is
sketch omnigraffle zanuck mocha Pro to
Iowa or even photoshop if you remember
we can think of any use case let the
users also tell you BAM so also provide
feedback within your air and another
good practice it's also to analyze the
behavior of your users so if it tries to
use
so let me show you one your exit example
within my L unfortunately due to the
restrictions of the leading manufacturer
people are only able to step in the
whole network so for them it's
sufficient and only provide the IP
address to the page and connect to the
game but some sophisticated users are
aware of how to use gain extra parking
so I was thinking of the opportunity to
provide them this functionality without
confusing keahak users so what I mean
was in the settings screen you can swipe
the header and you can get a hidden menu
away it's good from JP address URL and
then also enable loving credentials that
you can use forget to connect so
benevolent edges in code um hopefully
you can see this is a nice liquid
animations the water tank is warming up
right yeah so when we give you some
consumers of how to implement past what
are we gonna do is we create a custom
view that it sets you and we're gonna
use the group if we all want to do some
layer I outing of potential children and
each of these these horizontal lines
enemy he is represented by a 1 hat so we
create an average worth of the line and
do you get this
feeling out to the right a we use
certain shade of the been in India
gradient which is just getting that
error to the right to get the curve
effect on the right side are you start
of the path object and as you can see
they are also right in ARCA segments
within each ad and you just use a dash
net effect an editor to depend objector
so next we want to do is to drop his tab
directly on the canvas so we override
the description of action and we create
our own layer just to be able to be set
all our translations and rotations at
the end then we're drawing on the oil
itself no matter if like the heat is on
or not but if it is him we also draw up
the pipe so we begin with the up at the
boundaries and then we draw each of the
horizontal part at the end we're gonna
use a handler to call it off action in
order to get the enemy as long as the
queue size is the same also the path
coordinates for the bullet or change so
it would be quite inefficient if you
would have to calculate or the path
coordinate and what it is each drawing
cycle so what we gonna do is to put all
the coordinate equation into the on size
change methode and as it only needs to
be kept
changes another small trigger what you
show is about driver resources against
every Android developer knows they're
handling all the different ppi sizes the
big effort and giving you to scaling on
some devices they might look fatty there
so another solution you can also think
of is using as cheese instead of di
graphics so how we gonna do that me you
want again create a custom view and when
the fuse has changes we just draw the
SPG with the exact fuse you sighs and
places basis as a back problem of the
few so for every screen size we can
always get the perfect image if you're
interested if the functional example um
I will you can also have a look it get
up our air with project next thing I
want to talk about is custom touch
components it's um on some views is the
user can swipe down just additional
information so how we gonna implement
that I'm gonna create a custom you can
take inner that keeps cubes namely the
ground view which is taking the entire
person scream at the sky you would just
placed on top but it's not visible by
default because if you were to shoot
them so that only the ground fuses or by
default we want again except you grew to
implement this custom touch component
and now we have to take care of layout
in the children so
Liam gig is a two-step process namely
mentoring and lay open the unnatural
death Road calculates the required size
of the few it there for a year in your
natural method you get to public groups
maybe it will the hay is a natural step
the matter is they're keeping Kate's two
values namely the official size and also
the mode of the size resolution which
might know from XML the condition like a
marionette or a Content so the first
thing we're gonna do in here is to get
out actual width and height so we used
the framework method won't default size
which is also considering the port of
the metro spec afternet with an entire
available space to the parent himself
very important to do said the metric
dimension for the future because if you
don't do it at the end yanmega manhood
are your Apple crash so after serving
the entire input space for the few
itself we gotta do the same our children
so um once again I mentioned before the
the ground view is getting our entire
little screen please juggle with
consideration of the heading of the
parent fume and the sky view is actually
getting all you hate which I measured
itself of what you don't get that is it
it is intended to be the second part of
the Lamb conclude this is actually
acting by the way with just cold months
it said like other than the
on measure metal we should not be called
several times ending on the layout you
using so if you have any heavy
calculation going on you're going to pay
up first it's better to be only a method
in this medal because our children into
the layout with the given bounce so like
if one skyview some fun with this the
top and the front view it's just me it's
really what I mean here that you always
use the epic measured within a method of
the children because can women get him
eat you usually use it's not already set
because question you in the layup
process yeah the name thing would you
give this despite are based on the user
touch events the basic many of my head
is on touching head and it always gets
called when you use your touches of the
movies on the screen there are several
thresholds are defined by railroad which
you should always consider for example
to touch slow which is a ceilidh ranch
homes from where you just should start
trolling if we start rolling what we
always wanted to do is repent intercept
chief from Adam if Eric used for example
if you're smiling down or up you don't
want to you get interception for example
from the Pew pager here also would swipe
left or right and then we use into
thrown by a method to Berkeley shift key
word if the root user releases we also
wanted to
there are two the open or closed state
we don't want to leave it in the
intermediate state Android level
provides strong class it lets us stroll
from from the current to target position
to department to perform snap there we
use the computer olmedo which is always
cold during the drawing and if your
class everyone is really an intermediate
position we keep on scrolling
automatically and the solar always rises
the currency when what is called to and
the end we just call the most dominate
method that just keeps us strolling to
me which the end position yeah that is
it from the coding water um I've
mentioned before interested in the full
sense that just don't give up um you can
find out the exact project there and um
i guess if now everyone wants to do you
have to try you can use with your family
forget door and you can enter the
following IP address Oh because a box to
travel about actual healing from there
and so that
and if you have any questions yeah for
SG no agreement using a standard library
but if you mention correctly like from
logical onwards you can also use a GED
fabric for that especially in the early
days of entry don't advise you can
experience problems with that but I
think nowadays to the whole then we
dream is rolled over to devices I never
experienced any any issues with that so
of course it's always something to
considering that also the main reason
why why did you do it yourself in the
platform but yeah like nowadays I would
say there is it's no big deal
okay so if you if you come up with some
other questions I'm all around you so
feel free to ask you later and so thank
you okay it was a time of 12 like it
optimized you want what pictures for
Jake I'm cheers my dear to me also
looking for
you
you
you
you
