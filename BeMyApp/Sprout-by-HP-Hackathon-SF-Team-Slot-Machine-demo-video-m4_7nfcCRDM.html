you
hi we are the sprout slot machine team
and uh so for our manage up to the main
objective for this project was to
showcase a javascript what javascript
can do in sprout multi screen
applications um so for this project we
made a slot machine that will allow
users to have a real casino experience
right in the comfort of their own homes
so why is slot machine well who doesn't
like to play slots um not only that but
the dual screen ah dual cash screen
sprout allows us to make the appt more
interactive and allows for a more
immersive game experience so Jeff is
going to talk about some of that I'm
going to talk about the technical part
so we come here to experiment JavaScript
with the sprout machine so we try a
couple approach like one is the cure
using QT webkit browser record that's
one of their approach we try and we we
also want to give it a try on the
crosswalk Cordova hybrid approach and
also the the chrome packaged app with
the Native Client so our compare our
startup specialized on dual screen
technology so we have our in-house java
api that can make multi-screen
communication seamless using the local
storage within the browser so you can
have we can have a physics engine level
animation synchronized and also with a
pretty strong MVC model between the two
screens yeah well you're welcome to take
a look at our demo station later thank
you
we are very excited about this new
sprout unique do screen features so we
believe that feature it will bring our
user brand new gaming experience one of
the reason that we pick slot machine
it's because in the real casino you have
the vertical screen and also the panel
for the producer to play so this really
bring that experience into your house so
you put the money into the Machine and
you got credited and now you pick up one
line that you want to play three lines
in order to win a jackpot you have to
use the 5 line that's not bad but not
jackpot so we sit we set it up there so
I you we expect to hit it like a run 10
times ok so so the the one the most
important feature of our app is we have
a view in physics engine that make sure
the particles is in sync in both screen
and also we have an MVC modeled using
backbone but also in sing on the Pope
app
this app is a fully functional you can
you know you can you can set up how
difficult the jackpot to be yeah
hopefully we will hook up with the 3d
printer when they went era when sprouts
3d scanning features ready yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
