introduce you our - Raymond Camden from
strong new he'll be here she will help
us explore a new back Iorg our
presentation Thank You Fernando and let
me fire up my screen share entire screen
let's do it okay
hey Fernando can you confirm that you're
seeing a slide
cool all right I'm gonna take it from
here everybody all right so just so real
quick my name is raymond camden as we're
going to say i work for IBM i've
actually been on this particular team
for maybe three weeks or so so i'm kind
of a new member of this particular team
but I've been at IBM for a good year now
or so my focus at IBM is on strongloop I
also do a lot with bluemix and I do a
lot with Cordova and PhoneGap nodejs and
I like the web so I'm still playing
around with html5 and JavaScript and all
that fun stuff and just seeing what can
be done with web standards high blog at
Raymond Camden calm and if you have any
question about what I'm showing today or
anything web elated the most and you
don't get a chance to ask me today
please visit my blog there is a contact
form up there where you can send me an
email send me a question and then I love
getting those questions because it
typically turns into something that I
can blog about and share with other
people as well you can also follow me on
Twitter at Raymond Camden where I
promise I only talk about serious
importance
stuff and you should definitely follow
me so I'm gonna begin by just kind of
talking about the history of how I have
done web development and this will be
important I promise you stick with me
and I will be able to relate it back to
how loopback is useful so when I first
started doing web development and this
was shoot probably back in like 93 or so
so a really really really long time ago
I focused heavily on the app server the
browser's back then really could not do
anything so I would do everything on the
application side and I began with Perl
CGI's but I quickly transition to a
application server called ColdFusion
from Adobe and basically the app server
would do everything so we've talked to
the database and it would generate the
HTML do all the dynamic aspects the
reason for that is because the browser's
were really really really really really
really bad back then you could barely
debug in there you could barely put a
ordered list together HTML it was pretty
bad so essentially everything was being
done server-side so as an example you
know I if my web page needed a list of
cats the browser would do a request and
the server would say okay I'll talk to
the database maybe even Microsoft Access
because this was 90s and it was cheap
and it would take that database query
and it would actually generate all the
HTML for it and then bring it back to
the client and the client centrally was
doing next to nothing so the server did
everything and of course back in the day
the shiny awesome browser was Nescafe
gator 4.0 I can remember being very
excited about navigator 4.0 coming out
it was the bomb so how we do with this
now is really radically changed from
back then so the biggest change is that
the client the browser's are a heck of a
lot better now you know we used to get a
new web Brown
or once a year once every 16 months or
so and now I mean chrome is probably
going to update while I'm doing this
presentation so you know we have these
evergreen browsers that are constantly
updating constantly adding new features
and the other big change obviously is
that Mobile is significantly more
advanced than it was certainly back in
the 90s so where we consume information
is changing as well so now my server has
gone from you know doing everything you
know talking to a database and
outputting HTML crafting HTML
essentially to basically just responding
to API call so as an example the client
would say hey give me a list of guests
and well bless a client I mean browser
client and the server but basically said
yeah here you go here's their JSON and
the browser then could actually take
that JSON and do something nice with it
and of course the other big change is
that we have a incredible set of tools
to work with building websites and to
essentially handle every part of that
aspect so when I started I basically had
notepad and homesite and now I have
about 500 different tools and much like
how Chrome is probably going to release
a new version while I'm talking there
will probably probably be five new web
dev tools released in this one hour
alone so the server hour and of course
I'm is the typical server that I
work with in 2016 it's smaller is
simpler and could be essentially just an
API provider and typically not some big
machine I rent I can remember the first
web site I launched I had to drive to
the ISP I had to sign a contract and all
that and they thought he you know large
machine just to host my stuff so back
then my tool typically were apache adobe
coldfusion my sequel and again yes i
actually did use microsoft access
because it was cheaper than sequel
server and little to no javascript on
the back end
again we really could not trust the
browser to render that data correctly
mmm now again this is my personal
experience I am typically using nodejs
and Express and my persistent system
will be something like Cloudant or Mongo
and I will use JavaScript everywhere
obviously on the server with no js' but
in the client as well and just
essentially all over the place now I
have to make a confession about
nodejs when I first saw it all right it
was not enough and like I feel like
that's a shocking thing to say that I
saw a JavaScript on the server and it
wasn't enough right like that should be
enough right everyone loves JavaScript
and for me it wasn't and the reason for
that is because I kept seeing the same
presentation somebody would build a web
server in nodejs
and I had no interest in building a web
server in nodejs
like why in the heck would I do that
when I have Apache in I could I I got
the idea that it was smaller more nimble
or etc but it just bored the heck out of
me I I didn't want to spend time
rebuilding something that I had been
using for the last 10 years or so and
for me it was really Express Express was
you know I guess a cup of coffee that
woke me up to why I would want to use
nodejs especially you know to move away
from cold fusion and the biggest thing
is that you know all that kind of
boilerplate stuff just went away and
that was really really nice and
expressed and allowed me to focus on
actually building what the website or
the application was and being able to
skip all the setup stuff and just focus
on whatever the particular technology or
whatever application was being able to
do that for me was again you know I went
from thinking oh yeah no js' JavaScript
and server that's cool but whatever
I went from that to like oh I want to do
every single thing possible with no js'
with that being said as I moved into
doing a lot more mobile stuff and
started doing less and less on the
server the next kind of you know
awakening for me was loopback so the
reason for that is that loopback
is a framework that's specifically
designed for building API so if your
server is essentially just an API
provider for a mobile client or even a
desktop JavaScript client loopback will
handle 99% of that work for you out of
the box which is really really freaking
cool it's focused on this idea of a
model where a model represents the
particular content that you're working
on and it also handles creating
rest-based API for that so this is not
some kind of weird API this is a
standard way of exposing your data to
other and to be clear we're going to do
a bunch of demos and you'll see what the
models look like and how to create it
and what those rests api's look like
there's also a simple Aurum system now I
hate this a simple horn because every
experience I've had with the worm it
always starts simple and it kind of
progressively gets more and more complex
but loopback does have a kind of baked
in system where when I have to find a
particular model I also get server-side
code that does all the basic crud stuff
so you know on top of having rest-based
API to get data and to create data and
to search data if I need to do something
on the server side I have a complete
system for doing that as well loopback
also has an angularjs library you
absolutely do not have to use it I have
not used this yet I have used angular
with loopback but I've not used their
own particular little angularjs library
so it is completely optional if you're
doing ember jQuery Mobile anything else
and you do not have to use a little
helper utility in fact the example
you'll see later will be incredibly
simple no angular at all and to be clear
out of the box you're gonna see me make
something and it's gonna be totally open
and that's really really great for
prototyping it's certainly not great in
any way whatsoever for a production
system lube bag has an incredible amount
of ways to configure security and
towards the end of this presentation
you'll see me do some examples of that I
just want to make sure that's very clear
because when you start off everything is
completely open and you have to actually
lock things down yourself before you
move into production everything I'm
talking about today can be found at
loopback i/o and you can go there to
find out more so whereas strongloop
comes in this is essentially a graphical
tool that works on top of loopback it
handles much more than just API stuff
it's gonna do things like deployment
management monitoring debugging
essentially all the fancy stuff where
you know I finished my application but
now I need to push it to production and
an automated way I need to kind of watch
it to make sure it's performing well and
you know something is going wrong so I
need to debug it strong loop is optional
you don't have to do that to build the
API you can just use loopback obviously
I wrote for the strong loop team and I
want you to check it out but I'll be
focusing more on the API centric aspect
that is completely free and open source
you can find out more about strongloop
at strongloop comm ok so how do we get
started how do we install how you play
around let's take a look at that so to
install you will need NPM I assume that
most people probably already have this
if they're already doing nodejs
development if you don't have an PM then
just go to no chat or download node
install it and you will
get nodejs and get npm there once you
have that you will want to do NPM
install - geez wrong loop and what this
will do is give you the command line
tool SLC it always confuses me when I
npm install' X and I end up with y so I
like to make it very clear you're
installing the wrong loop PAC package
and your ringing a command line called
SL C once you have that you can go into
your terminal and by the way this is a
OS X screenshot but it will work on one
Windows as well you can do SLC - V and
just a confirm that installed correctly
and you could see the current version
once you have that so how do you
actually create a new application you
will type this I'll see you loopback
you'll be asked a couple questions once
you've done that you can start defining
models and then run the application so
with that let's actually get out of the
slide deck and go to our command prompt
all right so let's create a new one we
go in the demo first I'll have a clean
space all right so I'm going to create
one and I'm going to call it March 31st
because I'm very creative so it'll be
directory will be the same as the name
of the state okay and you have a few
options here I recommend the hello world
because it gives you a couple default
options that are better for testing and
better for learning once you get more
comfortable you could definitely do MV
or API server but HelloWorld is nice so
we will do that it's gonna do its mojo
grabbing all kinds of bits and it's
grabbing grabbing grabbing grabbing
stuff and we'll let this go it should
not take more than about 15 or so more
seconds so I will let this finish
there we go sweet Aniston so it's
telling you exactly what you can do to
go in there and take a look at it I will
open this up real quick just so you can
take a look the client folder is empty
that is a place where you can put
client-side code you absolutely do not
have to do that server is where these
server will go and you can see all kind
of fun stuff there that you expect
various JSON files with JavaScript files
you have your package dot JSON and root
root and a common folder where we will
put our models this is where we'll
actually define you know what API is
we're building so let's talk about that
let's actually create something an API
I'm going to do SLC loopback model and
let me just make this a little bit
smaller so for the model name this is
where our API is going to look at I'm
going to call it cat now out of the box
loopback works with a data persistence
system it supports a bunch of them I'll
show you a slide later on but when you
first create the application it's gonna
have a memory based data source this is
really great for prototyping because it
means you don't have to set up Mongo or
my sequel or or anything at all keep in
mind though that as you rebuild the
nodejs application if you restart it
then you're gonna lose everything and
memory so don't forget that you can
actually configure the memory data
system to persist to a file don't do
that for production of course but for
prototyping it's really really nice I'm
just going to say DB and take the
default for the base class and obviously
we want to expose this via a rest-based
API the pearl of captive cats and then
we will again take the people so at this
point it's asking me for properties now
this is completely arbitrary it's
whatever your API is I'm gonna make a
property called name this will be the
of the cat and I have various different
types of properties and you can see them
listed here
I will gets a string and we will say
required equals no I'll talk a bit more
about requirements later we'll give like
the cat a color will also make that
string and not require and then we'll we
will give it a age and say that is a
number and not required and when I'm
done I'll just hit enter and at this
point I'm actually done I've actually
built an API you can see this I'm gonna
fire up the server and you can see right
there it's running on a particular port
3000 so we will sorry for the infinite
recursion there I will go to the
localhost now what you have out of the
box this is justice leave these the
default homepage it's just an uptime
value and when it was started if we take
a look at this code and it is right here
we can see that we actually have a
spread system and it's actually kind of
hard to see in this example but it is
running Express on the box and we have a
default route here now we'll be doing a
lot with code actually but let's go from
here and look at the Explorer now what
you're seeing is an automatic API
documentation system that all came from
me literally just running back command
line and creating the cat API and I
could click in here and we have a
complete crud for working with cats I
could do everything via the browser so
I'm gonna go in here and I see the D
documentation and those properties are
based on what I picked I can actually
test it via the browser and I'll just
click the copy here and we will call the
cat Elvis and we'll say he has a white
cat and age of 2 and I can leave I need
a zero there and loop back will just
ignore that click try it out I see the
curl command if I want to copy and paste
this
and I could see the response and it
actually created a new ID for it so I'm
going to go back here and change Elvis
to Sinatra he will be a blue cat and the
nine years old not 89 that'd be pretty
old cat and try it out now I just made
two items and again this is being
persisted in memory I could go to my get
request and just try it out and you can
see there is my date and if I want to I
can copy and paste this URL into the new
tab and there it is so literally I just
built a full crud cyst on the full API
in about five minutes now it's not
locked down there's no validation none
of that I'll talk a bit more about how I
can add all that it's actually pretty
darn quick as well but as you can see
like I am ready to go I can literally
start working on a front-end application
talking to this REST API and start
building my full crud system and be good
to go centrally all right so let's go
back to slide deck so we're the
strongloop come into play so again I
mentioned you know strongloop has a
bunch of stuff I runs on top of loopback
it does a lot of high-end performance
monitoring debugging etc that I'm not
focused in on today and to be clear this
is all optional I'm not trying to sell
you on any of this but let me kind of
show you can some of the cool things it
does in terms of working with api's and
that was a quick visit to that slide
back and we'll go back to the terminal
I'm gonna kill my server and type SLC
art this is gonna fire the web-based
interface first time you run this you do
have to register with IBM but once
you've logged on it will remember all
this it won't prompt you again and again
and again all these tools over here are
for the debugging and testing profiling
etc composer that will actually work
with our API Zen you can see on the
left-hand side here the note was
basically part of the hill
world-system and you could see it too
fine with the continent title but the
cat one is the one that I made and if I
realize that you know I forgot something
I can just click new property and say
friendly as a property define it as
boolean and save the model and I'm done
so I don't need to use this all this is
doing is actually modifying code in the
back end and will happen it will take a
look at that in a few seconds but if I
prefer this model to the command line or
working with files then it's a option
for me to use let's actually take a look
at what this did is this actually
changed the file on my system so if I go
into the folder I made mm-hmm I have a
cat JSON file and this is the model for
what I created you can see everything I
had typed them via the command line
there's a name there's the plural it's a
couple things that you don't to worry
about right now and these are the
property so if I don't like the command
line if I don't like that web-based
system you can see it's pretty easy to
go in here and just you know type around
and add properties by hand you can also
see things like validations and
Relations is security etc so we can
configure this out big time
most of you who are I assume are looking
this and saying yeah but in a real
system there's all kind of business
logic and stuff like that that you're
not defining you can go crazy here and
define anything you want so as an
example in terms of validations we had
at the CLI a simple you know is this
required or not but you could do a heck
of a lot more than that so you can
actually pretty quickly say yes this is
required but it has to be positive so
for example for age number by itself is
not enough a proper age has to be zero
or high or a 1 and higher and for cats
we could even say you know logically a
cat can't be
/ and I'll just say 25 I don't really
know how the oldest cat can be but we
can do stuff like that even to the point
of you know if my business logic is that
a male cat cannot be over 20 but a
female cat can be but not over 27 any
type of weird business logic like that
you can definitely add within loopback
and we'll do all of that validation for
you out of the box I mean it's really
really open-ended in terms of how you
can customize stuff and I really really
appreciate that it does that if we go
back to the slide decks I want like a
bit more about stuff in terms of read
data sources you know what is it like to
work with a real persistent system out
of the box you have support for what I'm
listing on screen there and I won't read
it in terms of how you add that it's
literally installing what's called a
connector and that's an example right
there of how you would install the
MongoDB connector and once you have
installed support for a MongoDB or my
sequel or rediff sequel server whatever
once you have done that you can actually
go back to the filesystem and type it in
by hand or use a command line or and go
back to this arc system and define a new
data source here and you can even test
things within strongloop itself so if
somebody gave you a MongoDB system to
work with you can type in B credentials
here and what's really cool is that once
you actually have this up you can
actually migrate a model and its data
from the in-memory system into your real
system so what I appreciate about this
is that I could do a lot of prototyping
with the in-memory system and then
switch to my you know unquote real
system once I have it set up
and what's kind of neat and this is kind
of an advanced example but the connector
system the the whole database system it
is literally just one more API it's one
more system that you can extend so for
example if you had some crazy system
let's say your client data is in CSV
files and not even in one CSV let's say
you have 10,000 products and you have 26
CSV files where every CSV file is the is
a letter so you have excuse me products
a dot CSV products B dot CSV and the
logic is if I need to find out about the
cat product because cat begins with C
will be in the C dot CSV file you can
actually set up a connector to handle
that logic and still have a nice API
only a rest-based API in front and no
one has to know that you have some wonky
file based system on the back end if in
the future you switch from that crazy
system and you definitely should and
switch to MongoDB once you might create
your data your REST API never changes
you no one ever knew that you had a
silly kind of file based system and you
have a enterprise system now your API is
the exact same going back so that's the
database system in terms of security
again you can set everything up as
whatever business logic you need so in
about two minutes or so I'm gonna show
you an example of what this is like kind
of other box but keep in mind that if
you have some really obscure system so
people are allowed to create content but
only in the morning loopback will
support you writing that custom logic
and wiring it in you can also do custom
method so we have a rest-based API and
it has you saw a big X for the list and
the the post for a create and you could
as well on top of this you know you have
the ability to add your own stuff so
what you're seeing on screen there that
little filter that's baked in so if I
needed all the cats but filtered on a
particular property in this case where
friendly equals true I don't have to
write logic for that that's just baked
in and I even do ands and ORS and stuff
like that greater than less than etc and
it's all baked in if I find that a lot
of people are using my API and they are
searching for friendly cats I can expose
my own new remote API called friendly
cats that essentially does the exact
same logic or if I have something that's
not supported by that fancy filtering
clause it's just you know way too crazy
I could just expose my own system to do
whatever makes sense for my own business
so another example of that as a custom
method I could have logic that says when
a new cat is created if it is friendly
changed name to whatever so in terms of
the life cycle a data creation you have
the ability to say before you persist
after you persist when you retrieve you
know that entire life cycle of before
and after for create read update and
delete and working with the REST API you
can hook into every single aspect of
that to dis essentially you know go
crazy
so let's actually look at some examples
of that so I talked about data sources
already what I want to do it's gonna
quickly show you what the security
system looks like and what I'm gonna do
is lock it down cats and I'm going to go
up on the command line and it will be
loopback
ACL for access control list so it's
gonna prompt me for what I'm gonna work
with and what I'm gonna do is you know
typical security system you lock
everything down and then you begin to
expose you know what you want exposed so
I'm gonna work with cat I'm gonna say
all methods and essentially all types of
access and I'm gonna say all users and
I'm going to essentially block access to
everything and I'm done
now all this did was work with that file
and if we go back to the file you can
see it's there so again if you don't
like command line stuff this is very
readable you can kind of see what it's
doing I'm gonna fire up the server again
and let it start and if I go back to my
API because I locked everything down
this should be flat Oh actually I
apologize it was an in-memory system so
it is going to block I was going to not
have any of the data I created before so
if I run it from here and try to post it
should be locked down unless I screw it
up and I did but I'm not gonna worry
about that - simple demo fail it
definitely does work I'm just double
checking to make sure that I didn't do
anything in particularly wrong just kind
of trust me you definitely can't lock it
down so what would happen next is that
you would actually go in here and then
begin to expose we read on amis do that
one more time you would begin to expose
the read access and this is kind of
broad so I could say for example all
users are allowed to read and we would
grant them access and they come back in
here again and say write access it's
only for authenticated users and we will
grant them access so again if we go back
to the filesystem you can see where
these things are and again I definitely
mess something up I'm not gonna worry
right now it definitely does work and
these are kind of broad rules so for
example read would be reading all cats
to make filtering all that if you need
particular ways of locking something
down you can definitely go farther than
here the same applies to the right role
so when I said I'll indicate it
basically that means anyone who is
logged in to my application can do stuff
if you wanted something like for example
writers as a role can create content but
only editors can do edits and deletes
you can definitely get you know
particular in that way and set those up
too to handle something like that
and again if you had something weird
like on the weekends you weren't allowed
to create content that is something that
you can do as well okay I'm gonna switch
to another example that I already baked
a couple days ago
okay so I mentioned about the ability to
create a custom remote system this is an
example of what's involved it's really
kind of two parts the first part is
where I build essentially my business
logic I want all the cats where friendly
equals true I mentioned that there was a
simple form based system and you're
seeing an example of it here
I have a cat object that allows me to do
fines on it I am passing a filter here
in this case it's you know just one
particular property I could definitely
get a bit more complex and then I pass a
callback or I use a callback to handle
the result I call the callback that was
passed to me which was the remote client
and essentially pass back my data so
this is essentially the server-side way
of building the custom method when I
then want to expose it I have this
remote method call here right
define what the path is so in this case
notice that my path is friendly I could
have said friendlier or friendly cats I
could define the verb I could actually
go a bit crazy here and just to show you
what happens I'm gonna go to that that
15 example I'm gonna fire up this one
and if we go to the Explorer for this
older application you can see there it
is right there so again this is a custom
setup I don't believe I have any cats
persisted we go check it out real quick
and hope yes we do
and we have two friendly cats so if I
were to make a new cat that wasn't
friendly I will say friendly equals
false we'll call this the meanie cat
let's try this color will make them blue
and we will call him the meanie cat and
age of one and post it out all right so
I have three cats now I will verify it
by going back to my git and there we go
but now we can also go to that special
method I made my kind of custom one go
in here try it out and we have just the
friendly cat so again kind of a trivial
example but it gives you an idea so you
know out of a box you can really kind of
quickly prototype a bunch of stuff very
very fast when it comes time to add you
know very particular types of custom
logic loopback is open every single
place possible so you can plug in logic
anywhere so again you can really really
customize this every single place
possible there's beta and support for
files so what's nice about this is if
you have an amaz
s3 bucket for example I could define a
model I could say hey this particular
property is actually a file I can tell
loopback where this s3 bucket is and
loopback will then handle all of that
binary data transfer for me so I don't
have to think about it out of the box
that supports s3 as well as local file
system storage as well and you can
actually kind of go crazy and define
something custom there as well there's
also something that's kind of
interesting it's API based model and
I've been saying API lot and what I mean
by this is that I can actually define a
REST API that proxies another REST API
so what does that mean so imagine you
know I I have my application and I do a
lot of stuff myself I have my own models
that do whatever it makes sense but for
some reason I need to partner with a
partner with a third party to do let's
say music lookups you know look up an
album for example so I may use
SoundCloud or Amazon or some other
system I don't want to tell the people
using my application that oh you're kind
of leaving me to go to Amazon I can
actually build a proxy where I expose a
rest-based API and it actually just then
speaks to Amazon now what's nice about
that is that then I can filter and
manipulate what that remote third party
returns if they return for example a lot
of data and my clients only need a small
part of that I can strip out everything
that I don't need and return just what
they have even better if my third party
kind of goes crazy they change our their
pricing model or do something else I can
find a new system nobody knows the rest
API that I exposed it did not change at
all and I just change it on the server
side and it just works I will have a
example of this
on the strongloop blog pretty soon so
you actually you see this in action and
obviously strongloop itself does a heck
of a lot more with deployment and
scaling and all that this presentation
is really kind of just focused on the
API stuff
I will also quickly add that we just
released a product called API Connect
that works with node or Java and some of
the similar type stuff it's kind of a
more higher-end
type system and if you will learn more
about that you can hit the website here
and by the way I'll make sure all of
this slide deck is available to people
watching this so uh just real quick the
thing that I love about loopback is that
you can get started making an API in
less than five minutes you can prototype
and go crazy if you don't like it you
can scrap it and start over again
because it's rest compliant hey you
could even stop using the loopback I
wouldn't recommend that but because
you're doing something that's gonna risk
apply if you have some other solution
that exposes REST API as heck you can
leave it you're not kind of locked in
because you know you have not spent days
and days and weeks and weeks to build
the API is because it was so rapid
you're not necessarily tied to doing it
I want to see you use loopback I want
you to use strongly about what used to
love it but as a developer I love that I
can rapidly test this and rapidly figure
out if it makes sense for me so if you
want to find out more we have a lot of
Doc's at dot strongloop com
I will show before I stop screen sharing
and we look at the questions I want to
share my contact information again my
direct email is raymond camden at
gmail.com if you forget that you can
just follow me on twitter at Raymond
Camden and if you free kid that you can
go to arraignment canva.com and I have a
contact form there and you can find
various
examples that I've done with loopback
I'm still learning it myself so as I
learn it I build various demos and
examples so you can see some deeper
examples of what I talked about today on
my blog as well as the strongloop comm
web site so with that I'm going to close
this I'm gonna stop sharing I'm gonna go
back to the hangouts and Fernando we can
do Q&amp;amp;A now okay I think are you well yes
Enterprise Java based tools okay I'm
just gonna repeat that question to make
sure I heard it right
were they saying that they were
surprised that IBM was doing Note stuff
yeah instead of using your Java based
tools yeah so there's a lot of people
doing java at IBM I mean we're 400,000
people so iBM has a lot of people
working on nodejs report of the node.js
foundation we're doing a lot of open
source stuff I mentioned in the earlier
slide deck that I've done a lot with
Apache Cordova and we had people working
on Apache Cordova so yeah you know this
is part of why I joined IBM and I'll be
honest before I joined IBM about a year
or so ago I did not know that IBM did
note stuff I didn't know that IBM did
open source stuff that's part of my job
is to let developers know that we are
doing stuff like this cool stuff I think
so I'm happy
oh god I'm not surprised that you were
surprised but hopefully you have a
better impression of IBM now from Daniel
will provide support for angular 2
anyway yes what is the timeline for
supporting it
so I assume that he's talking
specifically about the angularjs stuff
that you could use to make it a bit
easier to work with loop back I don't
know the timeframe on that particular
package and I am give me one second to
write that down support time frame if I
had to guess I'd say after angular 2 is
finally released I will remind everyone
listening that you don't have to use
that support package I have it I've used
that with jQuery I've used it with ionic
and because it's a rest-based API but it
just plain works so I if you're doing
angular 2 now then you can use whatever
makes sense for you I have barely begun
to touch angular 2 so but I see no
reason why you would not be able to use
this right now because again it is rest
compliant but I will check about our own
little particular package and see when
that is going to be updated okay next
question from Jesper Iranian is instant
level a CL supported by new pack or does
the system have another way of handling
this can you repeat that after the beam
name is instant level a CL supported by
Lupe or the system have another way of
handling this so the question is can you
do security on one particular item so I
definitely showed how to do security for
cats as a whole
the question is in can I do security on
a particular cat instance I have not
done an example of that but that is
definitely possible so remember that you
have full control over the life cycle of
I'm coming in to request cats so if you
have very obscure logic that you know I
have premium cats for example then you
can do lock downs on that particular
subset of data again you can go as crazy
as you want premium cats cannot be
accessed more
then 10 times a day on Monday okay my
next question from Andy Hitler you're
strong you and you back work as well as
the latest five point X yes I do not
have the exact version requirements in
front of me but latest on both should
work fine when I first wanted using
loopback I was on four point X and now
I'm on 5.0 whatever and they both work
fine but we should have a URL with you
know the exact specifications on what
the minimum version is and I can get
that URL and when I share this
presentation I will share that URL
perfect our next question is I'm
developing using version 1 how would it
be a refractory my review one code to
working new back version to only
envision doing son if you were using an
older version of loopback so I I came
into loopback fairly recently let's say
about 2 or 3 months or so ago and
there's only been a couple minor version
updates oak and to be honest insane I
can't tell you offhand what that upgrade
process is like I would assume that you
could check the changelog but no I don't
know I haven't worked with an older
version of the blue bag but I will again
put that on my list of things to get a
resource for you and I apologize for not
having a good a great answer for that
ok our next question is I would like to
see the debugging process for seeing
what was done with the blocking access
to learn how to debug other problems I
have a blog entry on that I can't set
that up right now
quickly but I have gone through what
debugging is like and strongloop so what
I'll do is I will you can actually go to
my blog and just look at the strongloop
tag and you'll find it but if you don't
want to do that
when I share this presentation I will
include that link as well it took me
like I think 10 minutes it was pretty
easy to set up all right
and our last question is from Matt how
do you have do you have an example of
the relationships I do obviously not in
front of me
I did a example app a couple of weeks
ago it's not on my blog yet because I
have to actually write it up but what I
can do if you're comfortable looking at
the source code then I can share that
with you I definitely don't have a
problem with that but in terms of like
you know here's how it does X and here's
how it does why I don't have a nicely
written example the dots of course talk
about relationships and you have the for
example has many has one you know every
type of relationship that you can think
that would be typically required
loopback has support for that so I would
say check the strongloop Docs
I will dis include a link to my source
code for the demo that that I built and
that should be enough to get you started
if not definitely let me know alright we
do the question come in from the video
hi Daniel great talk to more advanced
user know you mentioned security
concerns if we had to publish the API on
production yeah definitely so again the
out-of-the-box behavior for the API is
to allow everything so that's great for
a prototyping it allows you to add data
and do stuff like that so you will
definitely want to lock everything down
and again typically the way people lock
down stuff is to say that no one is
allowed to do anything period house like
a it's like a global rule and then you
say okay if you're not logged in I will
allow you to read if you are logged in I
will allow you to write if you're logged
in but a role of administrator you can
delete so that
that ACL demo that I showed that again I
flubbed up but definitely does work
where you're allowed to kind of lock
down how we're doing stuff so you would
definitely do that beforehand I assume
that whether you're using loopback or
node or PHP or whatever I'm assuming
that you do a security scan IBM actually
has a service that will do that for you
so I always recommend that again no
matter what you're doing you'd want to
make sure your ap eyes are down one of
the things that I do when I go to a
fancy website and I see you know Ajax
requests to a cool pressed API I
immediately open that up and I start
poking around just to see what's locked
down and what's not so I'm a script
kiddie I'm definitely not a hacker but
if I'm doing that then you want to make
sure that you've definitely locked
everything down I think that covers the
question was that everything he asked so
are you that's a buddy okay yeah our
next question is from Frances can you
request items from the API by conscience
of a raid contain an example cuts that
have properties for legs plus two ears
are closed so what's this question is
can we do a complex query essentially
what's that yes or no sorry I would say
yes if you want you to the barn door let
me just copy this I'm not quickly on the
chat so you can see so listen why you're
pasting that I want to go back to that
last question on security because I did
forget to talk about a particular
feature is that loopback does have a
user's a user system it's a kind of
baked in model that you can extend and
what's nice is you know typically for a
user system we do stuff like you know I
have to build the port so that a
username is unique I have to build
support so that an email address is
unique Lubeck has
entire system baked in and on my blog I
have an example of that in action so if
you're really tired of building a user
system for applications loopback gives
you about 95% of the way there which is
really nice so that was the you come
back to security so yes can you request
items from the API the contents of
arrays ah so if we imagine a product
that has an array of parts and you're
saying I need to find one where find
products that have a particular part so
all the ones that have like a wheel for
a part yes you can do that I was talking
earlier about the relationship code and
I had to do some stuff like that so
again I don't have a nice simple blog
showing that but I had to bake support
for that into my example code so it is
it is definitely possible I do not
believe that the out-of-the-box query
string filtering support something as
complex as that but it is a pretty
complex system so it is possibly
actually baked in but again if it's not
it is something that I could expose so
if I needed a rest-based API for all the
products that have wheels then I could
definitely expose a friendly API for
that and then write my custom logic and
hopefully that makes sense the person
who asked ok guys I'm gonna quickly just
show up Raymond's blog just in a second
when I post a song and everyone should
be seeing it let me see can you see yep
I can't like Raymond mentioned if you
have any questions as well this contact
information is there and I believe we
have no more questions let me just
double check just to make sure anybody
and yeah guys that's about it Raymond I
just want to say thank you thanks a lot
for signing it I know it's pretty bright
and early over there across the Atlantic
I want to thank everyone for coming down
don't forget webinars weekly or next
webinar will be next Tuesday if you want
more information you can just check out
community.com and with notes I wish
everybody good afternoon good evening
