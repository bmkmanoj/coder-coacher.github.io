for Intel but as well opportunity on
your face look familiar so this this
presentation is nothing to you it's also
very different from the from the
presentation before because it's it's
very low level and very simple so this
is technology I think from the 80s or
90s good so the idea is so the idea is
other practical problem i have a
bathroom without my knowledge i have a
radio at the bathroom with a baton on
the last kilometer switch on the light
and ask you some change so basically
being an engineer i can do a flowchart
with this so it is to target when /
music from the bathroom the other way
run so basically if you like me you
always want by to the bathroom and
you're already on the radio so this can
be simplified rock and what I want you
to do is that the radio Charlie that's
basically what i want to do so this is
perceptual computing peak that's what i
want to want you into what I have or
what I had basically as a standard
making some water taxi squeezebox right
now and the good thing about this radio
is it one thing is it has a thumb light
sensor and it is running an operating
system that I can work with so five
minutes and this basically makes it very
easy to be about this license because
reassess advice file somewhere in the
file system which you can find which
tells you what's up my pessimism so far
turn on the light and password
the switches from a phone number to them
and if you have all this information you
can use something in a very high level
language right match it's another isn't
where you just read out the defile you
define some thresholds so that you don't
have to like other make your talking on
off if it's somewhere in between and
then basically you run this and check
out recession form under this device
right intercom and the mixer or Trimble
is simply muted yes a little bit will
resolve yes it is well that radios
running all the time units actually
measure the power consumption ok this is
this a very eat well practical way of
using some kind of things are
information something to watch ok I
can't show it at the moment because i
don't have solved this video i'm not
working the solar system is connected
radio as well and and I'm try to say
this how do we know board can internet
is remaining that's and which is
connected well to the network that
sources on and to detect some light
incentives and L message students really
this is perfect rule which I don't have
any slides on words it's working
how do you get access to livers is a
real console yeah you can't just take
one really good I think I semenza a deep
end high percentage of America to first
infected by your ancestors little bit
until most of us the same MO so much
this is funny linux as well of course
it's not money privately me I'm thinking
it this is sound available and the
protocol and domestic exactly the same
pathway so you could basically a user
fault for that as well easily like such
meaningful so the natural sure if you
want to keep your wine oh okay everyone
oh oops you have one one thing is it
doesn't work if you have a little chubby
okay so this is probably the worst
presentation I ever did because I just
slam this presentation together in the
drive yesterday last minute and it's
basically too bad presentation one part
is going to be about the front end on
user interfaces on website which runs a
CMS content movie system which was
thinking about a lot cuz the first ever
ever said I was free web hosting project
and it did not allow curl or any other
sovereign nations from server to server
so if you wanted to download any files
from in the other server you have to do
it manually isn't after p and that
wasn't what I wanted to do is so I built
to work around using javascript and just
a bit of basic PHP to Donald files using
javascript from server and then write
them to your own server using HP and I
have a gunman for that and a quick sauce
code afterwards but basically this is
the setup for a content management
system and working on so it allows me to
set up a basic password and after that
it allows me to install the call system
which downloads in the browser using
javascript and install itself choose it
to the server so if I now check in this
folder which I was just running this
thing from it should have more files
which it just installed using javascript
this kids a bootstrapper install or two
inside your CMS yes it's basically one
file installed over to those and they
user to set up anything from a browser
oh great amazing oh no it yeah as you
see you know has a few more HP files and
PNG files that are just downloaded from
my root server installed on this testing
folder and basically it just needed one
file which is the CMS dot PHP file and
which basically bootstrap downloads all
the files from my other server and they
are actually just inserted into the web
page as a JavaScript file and they run
function that handles the content file
that pushed them to the server yehs
which is I can tell you it's not it's
not a good thing to do but it's all
words and it basically gets around this
problem with not having curler and its
socket connections on a free web server
so if you're a user and you want to set
up or something it's basically the
soonest way of setting up something even
though it's not the best way for the
developer right well one so this is the
back end page which sees if you post any
content final to it and it also works
for encryption using RSA are so yeah
those because it can download the Good
Shepherd can download a library which is
called lived PHP or something over and
can use that for encrypting and
decrypting files are verifying files
that have been signed to ensure that
there is no viruses or anything download
to your server which would copy what you
want and the other thing i have is
actually a server that is emulating HTTP
application functions in JavaScript
using Adobe AIR which recently
implemented an update that allows for
running
connections on th the TCP and UDP only
in JavaScript and basically flash if you
want to develop and flash but I
personally think because I think that's
just not the future and if I run this it
should work and it yes does start a
server and I can basically tagging any
port I want and just going to take port
1337 for reasons on them and yes it is
working let's see I can access it and
yes the dust actually I'm going to exit
the server and what it does is power is
a file which is similar to HT Access
file which is M retin JavaScript and
allows me to redirect your else to other
pires so to one whom it home so for one
to redirect using mod rewrite I can do
that and what I'm currently working on
is the PHP part which is what i'm
calling JH e which is basically parsing
any content into system using the eval
function which is not actually load in
air but there's a background for that
and it's all it works and the nice thing
about that is is that you can run native
processes and basically system direction
processes in air gosh that's what its
polished seems like two releases and
it's actually proof of concepts that
going to be very stable it's not going
to be very fast but I'm going to build a
server version for that from my back end
or the asset English it before so yeah
that's what about it's justin is great
hi focuses on cxr I say let's give ya my
feet yeah you can write agree but the
thing is gloves too many play the file
of your writing on to the server in
three stages close to Young Money plated
wireless and the remote server what is
in the browser in Baltic coast of the
server so you can have the user interact
with the content you delivering in real
time so you can basically download a
file and then see that the file still
needs and configuration and then have
the user enter configuration information
in real time what are you writing the
file so you don't need callbacks for
that only ask me any more questions is
the CMS derives a use case what there
are better ways to show how I know we
like yeah there's by the way I it's just
something I was developing for myself
because I like meddling with stuff and
it's like not really professional at all
Thank You vendors tiny fraction so
you're 18 yeah he's 18 people that is
like a shame
or you guys do when you're 18 hello
everyone my name is Claudia I'm the PHP
and JavaScript developer and tonight I
would like to share with you a little
story about a journey and how it ended
up into eight windows i asked them and
which i ported a little application
window for one of our clients so as all
the stories we need a place to start so
in this case its place is a city o Allah
that sits in the heels of sovereign debt
money neatly and this is where
everything again this city is you know
quite well known its products most
importantly wine white truffles but
probably most of all Gizella but i'm not
talking about food actually its sweetest
so i like to introduce you know the main
character of our story who is Umberto he
is basically the founder of this project
and in the past it was like a wasn't in
a building business was a lead
contractor so it may have his fortune
like building houses stuff like that so
at some point in his life though a you
know felt like he had to investigate a
bit more in itself due to some
happenings in his life most specifically
about his dreams so he started a journey
and a journey into into his dreams so
basically together
team of psychologists and philosophers
and wrote you know some some materials
language a book which translated sounds
bit like between reality and utopia
there and back again and I was in
consideration about the state of me it
is more about nightmares and dreams but
probably sure then you need a degree to
get that but anyway he made some
writings and you know paintings and
stuff like that and after years of
oregon's on himself he thought that it
was been good and nice to share this his
experience and his journey with the
world and so what's best then you know
the internet for doing such thing so
this is mrs where we step in basically
contacted a company in UX and UI in
southern switzerland sketching we in
turn to contact us for develop apart so
they started reviving a few ideas you
know writing documents and no working
with get psychologists to come up with
you know i'm working from the eye of the
idea in America that the government
presented movement which basically is a
website allows you to track your own
dreams and give your own journal or from
your trainings this is because all his
work you know ray was ready to breathe
and to improving the self-consciousness
through the analysis of his dream so
basically we build a website and a la
application running iOS that's been
launched in november two thousand twelve
and i was reached almost five thousand
users he received the the dashboard from
the west side and the mobile application
and you know in process of building this
website of which i was responsible for
review the web part there have been a
few challenges so the most interesting
you know for it is for this conversation
I think it was designing the tree
that can be seen attachment or basically
it represents the dreams that users
track so in the first steps during the
you know the development of the private
data I came up with and not that
convincing you know resolve these this
is three even though you know it being
sort of convincing was harder than I
actually thought and so the first result
was not that good yet so in order to
improve it and do you know given better
results the user during you know the
phase between private beta and Republic
lunch we started working it again so in
order to improve the algorithm behind it
and the overall results and this was the
tool I worked on to you know put the few
things together first of all the art the
new algorithm for throwing the tree but
also the applications mobile application
to allow the designers to play with each
and every darn either of the three
rendering no to you know reach the best
possible rendering of the tree and at
some point when windows 8 came out I
thought okay I mean you know I've never
actually melt for Windows but I was
curious about possibilities that
introduced who you know thanks to the
ability to develop application
javascript and so I wanted to you know
see what would work you know the
challenges importing this application to
win say I also took the opportunity to
introduce a few libraries in that
project that's cool man no testing and
because I wanted to put a new stuff and
so more or less this word you know all
the other libraries the marine ball the
tree was implemented in new campuses so
it was using html5 canvases and so I
said okay I want to take that and put it
into a Winsett application you see how
and see how long does it
it to to have a working application how
expensive is that if you will and so I
found out that basically it's not that
hard to port given em you know moderate
complex application the application
itself is not very complex but it
involves few you know advanced
functionality is infused good set of
libraries so I found out that the only
problem importing that application was
the domani connection so because like
ninety percent portable besides you know
the jQuery party feels good thumb
manipulation but I was quite lucky
because the guy told me that there was a
revelatory of get off developed by this
company called happened to that
basically for a darshan of jQuery that
is able to work around the relations
security limitation with his ID and so
in very in a very short period of time I
was able to you know for that without
much effort and you know I was found a
theme that was mocking the metra you why
portage of your widgets and so yeah
basically a so this is the end of my
evolve this little experiment I can say
reporting you know existing web
application using that interest rely on
JavaScript and HTML to wednesday it's
pretty is pretty easy and I probably
recommend to you know people people try
to that but you know for what concerns
the the widgets I'd probably go for for
native components if possible unless you
actually relying on jQuery and jQuery UI
and so you got you know the cheaper is
the should without that suppose this
any questions while the next figure well
there's little fulfillment ah sure I'm
here it's not on the store because I'm
just waiting for in the legal stuff
happen but I athlete in package setup if
you go just tried it in pawn for spray
all right first of all no slides now you
know myself or sensation always with me
first of all this is my company second
thing you can tell you about me is very
much on you so it's like I do javascript
educational side well do you know I'm a
better don't care you don't know yes
some of you know live it up good it's
also i want me look forward and up on
the web forward is this I think very
much what's about he said that you are
in our place here and I appreciate that
awesome with so many who please walk
here please come more often to us and
visit us as much as you can however um
well two years ago something happened um
this questions was posted in like 2009
August someone asking us easy to access
the accelerometer is somehow using
javascript on the iphone so it means
like I want to know what direction the
iphone is right now well the answer was
always no until two years ago there was
a question that was eons would like yes
with 4.2 iOS as possible that's awesome
and they did a lot of stuff there to
improve the WebKit experience in the
mobile safari so well let's see what can
we do with this the accelerator events
that long ago defined on the w3c
definition that's pretty much and stuff
so perfect it especially I don't know
many people don't know it you can also
track the acceleration of your notebook
why because of the nice drive HD drive
so hard drive as like Sarah measure in
it not the SSD Drive so as a possible
with my macbook air but it would be
possible with any other no no poop to
see what direction notebook is there are
many use cases but all that stupid um
there's cool side can I use us rotation
I mean the other problem is supported of
course not ie Firefox unforeseen awesome
the Chrome Safari not really but the iOS
Safari and that's where we start beside
that you see blackberry opera Android
and so on soft so what we were
questioned about was like what can we do
with this and i love this whole you know
step chiral confusing stuff the problem
is you always need a device device it
don't carry with you it like webcam or
like there's this leap motion thing or
there is something like the you know
your series like a price that yes pretty
much cool stuff but you need to have it
so we thought about what can we do to
get as many people as possible with the
devices to carry around together that's
the cool thing about html5 and
JavaScript we can do so this is a little
game arm it works actually on every
device so you could actually join but
right now on your mindful join me so um
the side um I'm opening looks like this
on my phone um it does nothing that
showed me an ID where I can entertain
the idea of my players which I'm very
one I can enter one two three you take
two please good um I'm side that there
are buttons because we thought about we
need a fallback light on my macbook air
for I don't know a pretty old problem
that only has some kind of whatever and
then you can click the button so you've
only wanted to make it more beautiful
but
so now it's okay absolutely yes doesn't
matter us so let's see ok who's the
right thing it's us um who's trained us
whatever let so again so I'm playing on
the one um is that yeah okay s'okay this
you and this is me and welcome but know
that so I'm saying I can control it by
however well accelerating my phone and
the idea was to catch the details as you
can see we don't break do this well the
fine is why I thought about this was
like you have so many time were you
waiting when you somewhere like on the
on the airport somewhere and there's
also static advertisement like paper and
so we thought about what could be a way
the people without downloading any
annoying application that want something
and you need to have a device that has
reported it could be a way to get them
together so the idea behind this you
need to see is actually a football game
11 players who played with a mobile
phone or internet connection just by
accessing the browser from device
whatever it is so how do we do just
little short look into what was amusing
what it's pretty easy um the events of
device motion and you attach it to the
window and then you get to accelerate
acceleration including shorty which is
important because the gravity's would be
annoying and then we see okay is that
one two three or four by eight just do
the math whatever
it's the director of the phone the code
could be so much improved it's now
remember it's like two years ago we did
this demo in the background there is a
socket server reduce reyes if you use
faith which is an awesome gem it took us
a long time to do this acceleration
thing and the second thing but we're
grabbing the low gift of a snake game
isn't that easy as I thought actually
modern mobile a US bank but it was like
five six hours to be you know you can do
pretty much cool stuff with a browser on
any device just do it please use HTML
fast and for sure the support those
devices it's awesome but please provide
us and like it for all things going to
notice that within across all devices so
that's up so we have one more speaker
yeah i got i have no proper presentation
and this is my name is Sam here I'm also
having a meetup oh that's called radical
in so we're a bunch of people from
designers per hour that we like to do
crazy things with computers and so the
next big thing we are buying is married
to do something for the public session
what I think all of you are free to join
us if your ideas so at a same time I'm
also like advice when we computer so I
mostly play with a clip come on it's
mostly so i have an application that i
will like to solve you later you to stay
here that it's like you can't wear your
own kind of video did a time yes i can
basically designed it all this go to
with the hot so it's actually hard
because it's a 3d camera attract you in
3d so you can see yourself no money with
cheaper but this case it will be
it's been up the computer you see
yourself you will see the scooter you
are doing and then you will be able also
to my snowmobile and move around as real
time so you want you like to come in
which there's anything that's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
