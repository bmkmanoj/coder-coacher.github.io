series now when we explain to you the
software which converts the images from
the webcam and changes them to raw bytes
and transfer them to the Arduino so
let's get started we are now going to
talk about the code that manages the
serialization it retrieves the pictures
that we modified with opencv that we
extracted from the webcam and that will
be sent and serial to the Arduino for
the serial communication we need this
particular file terminals H we have done
some define this one is what we call the
bra date it's the speed of the serial
communication and this is the name of
the serial communication file since you
work on the other side and on linux on
linux all inputs and outputs are files
the main function in this one avoid open
for we have a file descriptor and open
it means we open the file with arguments
the most important one is this one we
are in a reading writing mode to be able
to write in this file we have to
configure it for that we have a
structure that we initialize with this
function TC get attribute there are
several elements in that structure one
of the most important ones is the C flag
in it you have two very important
elements the birth date and speed and
there is cs8 it is the number of bits
sent for each character once we have
done this to our serial communication it
is open ready to read and write data
here we have a very simple function
that's going to take a certain number of
characters from a chart that's going to
write on the sea report we in fact work
with characters on the sea report now
octet sore numbers here we have our main
function that retrieves an image that is
going to call other functions to send it
to a serial port
it is going to create an XY r g and b
tag because it is going to give the
arduino the coordinates of x and y and
three components red blue and green it
is to interlock loops it can scan a
two-dimensional chart we retrieve the
components of the picture we insert them
in the chart and we send this chart or a
to the serial port</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
