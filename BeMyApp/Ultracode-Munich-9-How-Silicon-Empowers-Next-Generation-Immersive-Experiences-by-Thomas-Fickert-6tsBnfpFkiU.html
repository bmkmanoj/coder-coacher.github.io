entertainment part you know and welcome
to the second
tation of tonight and thanks to
Christian for the great introduction how
to get from sent to silicon two
transistors to micro processors i'm
looking more into devices like like this
little piece here which allow us to
create new types of content you know and
finally to create some immersive
experiences very blending over the the
real and the digital world a new way so
any guess what this is okay you have
seen it indeed a fully 360-degree camera
with 2 180 fisheye lenses and I'm just
taking now with this click here a
panoramic picture you know and I think
this is an exciting example how silicon
and micro processors you know enabling
really exciting new technologies all
right so and by the way you can see the
result of the picture I've taken later
there was already an introduction about
myself so my talk is about how Silicon
empowers immersive experiences so again
I see their new ways to blend over
digital and physical worlds and this is
powered by a lot of new technologies and
my company the Xperia is specializing on
these new technologies especially on
augmented in virtual reality because
this is basically the foundation to
create these next-generation experiences
and I'd like to start now with a an
example from Intel because intel has a
lot of very exciting new technologies
which help in that area and you probably
heard about into real sense but i still
think it's it's a great intro what these
new technologies can enable for
experiences
yes
yes
Oh
alright so who has already had a chance
to play around with the real sense
technology there have been a bunch of
hackathon so great you know and i think
the wording is great this is just the
beginning you know we have had some
prototype cameras the first commercial
products are out but i think there will
be much more advances in the future and
this is really just the beginning for a
lot of exciting new experiences so you
have seen bigger the technology is
basically taking pictures like with an
RGB camera but there is also a depth
sensor you know which allows you to
really get a 3d representation of a room
you know because it can actually detect
the depth information you know you can
basically scan there's a product out
there from hewlett-packard called sprout
it's a pc with the built-in realsense
camera and it's really focusing on 3d
objects can you just put an object under
the camera and you immediately get a 3d
model and can manipulate it and do
something with it you can also go into
very exciting new exciting ways to take
pictures you know because you get the
full picture information and you can
decide later what the areas of focus are
you want to have in your picture you can
like we have seen create new ways of
communications like a chat where you
really take a person out of its context
put it in another context and of course
you can do also wave gesture recognition
so we're actually building a prototype
of a virtual boxing game where we using
this technology to detect the hand
movements and then give a gameplay where
people can you know do a simulation of a
real boxing game I think this is a great
introduction how technology can can help
us to deliver new digital experiences
and I like to focus on three things in
my talk the first is about the internet
of everything because I think it's a
great example how digital technologies
are invading our lives you know
and allow us to do many exciting new
things then I want to talk about their
the digital experience spectrum because
there's a full range from experiencing
something in the real world starting to
augment it make mixed reality up to the
full virtual reality experience and the
final part will be about the enabling
technologies behind these experiences so
let's start with the internet of
everything you know I think the exciting
part is that we're having more and more
devices and services and we using them
in all kinds of different contexts you
know when you think about the context
your body is becoming a smart smart body
you know because you're putting a
SmartWatch on your hand you're putting a
smart glass in your face and there are
many different other exciting
technologies in the variable space so
that your body is becoming a computing
environment but then you have your smart
life you know the places where you spend
most of the day you know you you're
smart home with a connected TV with a
connected kitchen then you go into your
smart car and drive in your smart office
you know there you're spending a lot of
your time but you also go out in the
smart life in the smart world this means
you go into a shop and then there's
suddenly some beacons who start to talk
to you so the whole world is getting
much more you know filled with all kind
of digital technologies and I think this
is powered by all the scent and silicon
you know companies like Intel are
basically developing then you be using a
lot of services because all the context
and the devices are useless without all
the data and the computing power we have
in the cloud you know when we look into
the devices we have classic devices like
pcs mobile devices smartphones but a lot
of new device types are emerging all
kinds of connected devices variables
sensors and this is the new playground
we have for building next generation
experiences and I will focus a little
bit on technologies which are helping us
to build more this immersive kind of
experiences so it's about augmented in
virtual reality technology and you've
probably heard about most of the devices
here a lot of them will come out
or have been already on market has been
taken away from market like Google glass
but there's still a lot of technology
development going on and we will see a
lot of exciting stuff coming up I highly
recommend the company called k zero it's
a uk-based consulting company and
they're tracking all the developments in
the world of virtual and augmented
reality and so they they have a very
good overview on what kind of products
and technologies are already on the
market or will come soon and the
exciting part is the big launches of the
consumer products like the oculus rift
and other high-end headsets are just
next year you know but you see already
how many devices are here on this chart
and when you look into this number as it
gets even more exciting because it's a
projection how many devices will be sold
in the next couple of years so and we
are now in 2015 and don't wonder they're
just some development devices out there
you know there's nothing on the market
you can buy now but there's a huge
prediction for their upcoming years that
this augmented in virtual reality
headsets we really get a big market you
know so or so the a lot of you know
virtual reality augmented reality the
first place something for the eyes you
know how you see and experience
different worlds but you need also some
interaction capability so how you track
basically the movement of a person in a
virtual room so just an example there is
a product out there called omnivatics
it's like a kind of virtual treadmill so
you have sensors on your shoes and you
have a ring across your body so that you
don't fall off when you when you use it
and then you can really fully move
yourself in a virtual environment and
all the movements you're doing are fully
you know transferred into the virtual
reality environment to give you this
this presence you know the feeling that
you are really in a virtual world and
there i think the exciting part is that
some people say that the market for this
input system is at least as large as the
market for the the headsets themselves
you know I think they can focus on a
good computing power on on visual
representation but you need a lot of
additional technologies to interact with
this virtual worlds and I think we will
see a lot of very exciting developments
here you think the majority of the sales
this charge businesses or the private
customer that's actually a good question
you know I think when you look into the
announced price point for instance for
oculus rift a that just recently
mentioned that you probably need a
computer worth around about a thousand
euro just for the computing power you
need to devise itself which is probably
another 500 euro so it's probably a
niche market in the beginning for
hardcore gamers for instance you know
not not a mass market yet on the other
hand but probably a lot of businesses
are starting to to buy this technology
to create a an immersive showroom to
present their product so I think we will
see how the market will develop you know
but it's not a huge market in the
beginning just early adopters like
gamers or special businesses which see a
value will probably take off but there's
another thing I've talk later about it
you can already do a lot of cool stuff
with cardboards and your telephone you
know your smartphone it's not the full
experience like having a height and
headset for a thousand five hundred euro
but it says something which is pretty
exciting rich
yeah and I actually would would you buy
a first generation product which is
pretty expensive maybe you would wait
until the whole market is more matured
and then you would go in you know and so
my expectation is that devices like this
little cardboards help people to get in
contact we see a lot of people who the
first time in their lives make a virtual
roller coaster ride or something they
are totally excited they have never seen
it before and for this first moment it's
totally okay to have not the best
resolution and not the best you know
frame rate whatever but it doesn't
matter but this technology helped to
create the awareness at the broad mass
market that the cool technologies is
merging and by the way this chart I
think it's three months old it's wrong
anyways there are other others outside
but the most exciting part is every
every each one of these charts is
showing high numbers for the future you
know all right so now that we've seen a
few examples how digital technologies in
the internet of everything are invading
our lives I want to now specifically
show you the digital experience spectrum
so I told you before you can experience
the real and the virtual world in
different degrees you know you can start
basically in the real environment let's
say you go in a shop and you have your
smartphone this is an example of an
application we built where we have a
beacons in the store and they talk to
you when you're you know crossing a
product and let's say you're interested
in sneakers and you running across a
sneaker he can talk to you and say well
I have a little video to you are you
interested to to view it whatever so
there is already a way to extend your
physical experience with some digital
technologies but it's in a way it's
disconnected because you have a separate
device you know there's a little bit of
communication but it's not really
blended over this is different when you
start to do augmentation you know and
this is an example of google glass I
simply took it because we have are also
the two years of google glass
development
and as you know the product has been
taken from market or has never been
launched but I think we will see a lot
of augmentation technologies coming you
know a lot of people use it today with
their smartphones with their tablets but
it's of course much more convenient to
have a virtual reality glass and when
you look on a product you see some
additional information the pricing maybe
some social recommendations from others
and I'm convinced that when the
technology is more mature maybe in five
or ten years and everybody has a little
clip he can put on his ordinary glasses
nobody sees that you're wearing this
fancy technology but you still can do
are going to Drella T experiences then
this will be cool you know you've
probably heard about microsoft hololens
also an upcoming technology so there
will be a lot of exciting stuff coming
in as you start to look into the real
world but there's more and more digital
overlay coming into place and you can go
to the next level this is an example
from a company who's also in via kinds
they are selling this NGO dressing
system it looks like a huge iphone you
know it has a gesture recognition
built-in it's based on connect northern
real sense yet and so you can stand in
front of this device it scans your body
and then you can start to virtually make
some dressing stuff so you see the
digital information is getting more
dominant so you still see your body your
face but the rest is maybe a digital
overlay you know and of course the final
version of this experience spectrum is
when you go fully virtual you know let's
see you sitting at home on your couch in
the living room and you go in a virtual
shopping mall you know and maybe you
even meet other virtual shoppers by the
way I think this will be a big thing
even oculus is working on a social
cinema experience so you are going into
a cinema and you see other people
sitting in the cinema and you watch
together a movie you know seems to be
something which is starting to take off
you know it's probably not for everybody
you know but some people maybe think
this is cool you know but again it's the
full spectrum and when
we think about digital experiences we
tried to design them in a way that the
consumer can decide how he want to
experience it let's let's think about
this room here I took a picture before a
360-degree picture now we could start to
to augment this information with some
some markers with some overlays let's
say I'm looking onto the Intel logo and
I'm getting some additional information
about Intel while I'm here in the room
wearing an augmented reality glass I
would see this marker and get the
experience by being here but by having
the full video or a 360-degree panorama
I could experience it also at home you
know I would look on a digitally
generated virtual reality but I could
have the same information and that's the
kind of exciting part about it that you
can have this experience in different
degrees more on the real world side more
on the virtual side okay so now that we
have seen what this digital experience
spectrum yeah there's a question this is
just like really narrow because it's
just replicating
that's a good question and we come to
that later because it depends of course
based on what kind of material you're
doing stuff let's say you you're
creating a virtual reality game you can
do something complete artificial which
is never real you know and that's the
coolness of it on the other hand you
maybe want to create something which is
hyper realistic like for instance we
doing now a boxing game and be taking
the kick box champion world champion guy
and we want to make it give you the
impression you are really boxing against
a real boxer you know so we're trying to
replicate the reality you know so it
depends on what your intention is you
know and of course you can give the
ability to experience something totally
artificial or to make it to give people
the ability to experience something in a
way they never can do in reality let's
say you put your capturing for instance
we talked about this for a project you
put a camera on the head of a polo
player you know because you probably
don't play polo you know but when you
have a 360-degree camera on a helmet of
a guy who is playing polo you give him
the ability to somehow feel like it is
to play polo you know it's of course not
the real thing but simply having this
this viewpoint you know and all the
other things it gives you the ability to
experience the reality in a way you have
never done before
yes that myself I want to hear
you know my age dessert I know exactly
what you mean and this is indeed a
problem you know so and again it's
exciting when I talk about our virtual
boxing game because on the one hand you
know you you see you a real hands you
know we did it with a real center leap
motion and you have a kind of real boxer
in front of you and in a real boxing
arena you know and you are really
knocking him and everything and you have
the noise and everything but what you
don't have is the knock-back you know
you you don't get the punch when when he
is knocking you down and I think it will
be exciting to see to what degree this
is harming your excitement you know but
but I'm sure that there are already some
some technologies which try to give you
some some a haptic feedback on uneven
virtual reality but I think over time we
need this very urgently at the moment
the focus is more on the realistic you
know projection and the kind of
immersive you know the interaction with
the system not having real haptic
feedback but we need this
are we the sea horse
snaps when we all wrong this is looking
out for me
you know yeah yeah I can so when it
comes to this kind of stuff like
pornography you know like all technology
advances have had their the most
financial success in the porn industry
you know it was the video cassette
format or whatever so each technology CD
ROMs the internet you know there was
always this pornography stuff which was
a huge market and actually even one of
the more prominent poor portals of the
u.s. announced recently even some
technologies you know where you're
combining your visual impressions with
some devices you know so in other words
i'm fully and we talked to be honest to
a lot of people in this virtual reality
space and just today I had a talk to a
person who is working on on a business
around this kind of content you know so
I'm sure that this is one part of the
spectrum and and in case you're able to
create some virtual environments even
with some sensory wherever stuff
pornography is one of the fields which
it probably could work maybe not for
everybody but I think it will be huge
market from a business perspective
no but but in general I think that what
happens here is pretty exciting you know
because you know a lot of digital
technology's changed fundamental
behavior look around you when you go out
on the streets you know most of the
people are staring on their smartphone
screens you know look back 10 years it
wasn't the case and so I think a lot of
and even children start now to to to try
to touch the television screen at home
as a daddy the television is broken
there's nothing happening when I touch
on it so a lot of technologies are
invading our lives have become pretty as
a full part you know and they change a
lot of stuff like look at the
smartphones and how people communicate
today you know it was totally different
10 years ago and as I think also these
technologies will bring this social
change the interaction to another level
you know and I'm not sure if this is all
good or not but it will happen and we
need to carefully look into the impact
to our society and all the kind of stuff
you know but but I think there will be a
lot of very exciting changes and maybe
the the impact on our personal lives you
know and and even the society is bigger
than everything we have seen before you
know I think thing about scenarios when
when you do remote consultation you know
maybe you don't go out yourself you make
a video chat with your customer and he's
repairing his broken whatever himself
because you can give him instructions
you can see what's wrong you know this
would change the repair business it just
as an example and I think they're the
kind of disruptive potential of these
technologies is is broader like
everything we've seen before from my
opinion you know this is why I'm so
excited about it and building hopefully
a successful business around it so do
you agree or do you say it's just
another I don't know it's like having
smartphones or is it potentially bigger
what do you think maybe you're not
decided yet you know
brush social structures galleries
yeah now it will be very exciting you
know and what we've learned every
digital technology which is possible is
coming to market and find its ways of
you as you know it's up to us to reflect
you know if it's good what we do with
this technology or not you know and yeah
so it's an exciting point in time to be
and so we didn't see what happens you
know in the next part I go a bit more
deeper into some examples of devices
which are enabling these experiences but
also then then go more into the
capabilities you know because the device
is providing new capabilities and when
you combine all these stuff you get a
new experience level you know and let's
start on the device side we have our
standard computing devices you know this
is a good example of an existing
technology like a tablet which is gone
to the next level so this dell tablet
has the realsense camera built-in so now
you have an ordinary tablet and can do
certain things which have not been
possible for you can make in 10 seconds
a 360 degree scan of your head and have
a 3d model of it I've seen a game
developer who is building some
technologies that you can really make an
avatar head in in 10 seconds and put it
into your Unity game development you
know it has not been possible in that
quality before you know so it's a good
example for an existing computing device
which went to the next level we have
also seen augmented reality headsets you
know I was a big fan of google glass we
did a lot of development but it was not
ready for prime time you know but it's
not just about google glass you know
there are i think last year i read a
report and there have been more than 10
to 15 augmented reality glasses close to
market release you know and there are
many devices out there even until just
recently acquired a company who is doing
an organized reality headset i don't
know the name but you see a lot of
augmented
devices already today more in industrial
production because most of the devices
look really ugly in hook I think Google
glass was a nice more stylish approach
but it was still not socially accepted
in the public you know and so there are
a lot of augmented reality devices and
there are some people who say it takes
another five to ten years until this is
getting really a mass phenomenon you
know but I fully believe that that the
augmented reality part will be something
we are experienced the whole day think
about ho lowlands maybe you're getting
when this technology is out there from
Microsoft in one two or three years
maybe a lot of people will use this
technology in the workplace they will
not run around with an organic reality
computer on their head but then maybe
use it extended hours during the day for
their job to do some construction stuff
whatever and I think in the end the
organ Adriatic technology will be maybe
spend sixty to seventy eighty percent of
our daily usage and the twenty percent
is for virtual reality it's like going
into cinema having entertainment playing
games watching a movie or something but
we will have all these these
technologies it's not just about there
the augmented reality headsets we talked
about this the holographic stuff like
hollow lens you know and in case you
haven't seen this microsoft hololens
video just search for it and it's pretty
exciting you know and i know people who
had this technology on their heads that
tried it out and they say it's cool it's
maybe not as cool as to do video
microsoft has done and in the first
version but but it's really very very
promising you know but it's not just
about the holographic headset it's also
about holographic projection you know
even when I took the picture here I have
a full 360-degree information about the
environment and I can you need oh so oh
there okay should I stop talking to some
dancing or okay no but when you have
this information and you have the
geometry of fruit you could take a dell
tab
and make a capturing of the room let's
say you have four balls and then you
know how you need to beam out the
content of the video to make give you
the illusion that you have a virtual
room rather than a squared room with
four walls you know and so I think even
holographic projection is coming to a
point where it's affordable so this
device is a Kickstarter project and
costs around about eight or nine hundred
dollars and I will come out in a couple
of months so even holographic projection
will become a reality more and more and
of course we will see virtual reality
headsets you know you have heard about
oculus rift about the Sony more for is
about the HTC wealth everybody is
building something and so thank you okay
but there's not just them you know the
the regular high-end headset says mobile
we r which is from my point of view even
more exciting because when you have had
such a oculus rift and all the cabling
behind you it's not fun you know but
when you put on a let's say a samsung
gear vr you know it's the freedom you
feel just put your phone in and you can
walk around and it's also not too bad
what you can experience so there will be
a lot of exciting headsets come out okay
so but the question is with this device
is what kind of capabilities are
contributing to this immersive
experiences and it's about the first
part is about how can I sense for the
context you know I'm somewhere but i
need some contextual information and
when you think about wearables you know
they can give you some contextual
information about your body you know
what's your heart rate you know what's
your blood pressure whatever so this
gives you a context you know wouldn't it
be cool in a couple of years to have a
sports broadcast where you can feel the
heart or you can see the heartbeat of
the football player when he scores no
war it was a hundred thirty you know
when he did the score you know because
he had a son wearable on his body which
is captured this and it would be even
cooler in 15 years when you can
reproduce the heartbeat on you on your
body
then you have some sensory output
whatever some ejection which is getting
into your body now just kidding but but
this is really about capturing
experiences and reproducing it you know
and I'm sure that in many years we go
even in that area where you can try to
influence some body data by by some
technologies you know it will maybe take
a while but it i think it's not totally
wild okay so we have variables to send
your body we have of course all this
beacon and bluetooth technologies which
allow us to interact to get some
proximity information you know and based
on that proximity how close to our you
are to an object you can can do
something we have the good old
technologies like wife your GPS you know
you don't necessarily need to put
thousands of beacons in in a in a
shopping mall to get some proximity
information you can you can do indoor
navigation up to one or two meters based
on your Wi-Fi signal you know so there
are also some some old technologies
which helps you to get some context and
of course in another area of getting
context is this RGB depth information so
all the the kind of cameras we will get
there already a bunch of products out
there from with the integral sense there
are some some laptops out there with the
camera built in there are some tablets
out there and for sure most of the
devices will have a depth sensing camera
soon rather than have just an RGB camera
so we can sense for context but we can
also interact in a different way and I
think for me personally at the first
time I had an iPad in my hand and was
able to touch it was really a
life-changing moment at that moment I
decided to leave my old employer which I
worked nine years because I think
there's something interesting going on
another company has invented something
big you know and and we are using now
touch so every day but but I think this
in itself is a very exciting technology
before having this touch capabilities
the digital world was different you know
it's not just about touch it's about
voice you know and maybe you're not so
excited
about it you know and we have seen the
first versions of Siri and all other the
jokes about it but I have also an
android smart watch and not yet on my
hand pad or not not here with me but I
realized it's working so good these days
that I'm using it more and more often
you know it's it's very natural to just
speak on your watch ask for something
and it simply works it wasn't the case 5
or 10 years ago but voice it has also a
chance to become a much bigger part of
our lives and especially also in virtual
reality applications it's very helpful
for navigation into a virtual seen you
know we build a for example an
application where you can navigate in a
virtual real estate object and then you
can switch the floors just by your voice
through our number one floor number two
so I think voice voice will be a bigger
part of our digital lives look into the
commercials like Google is to him now on
television you know it's a lot about
search and voice and even my daughter is
talking to her computer all day google
and you know this wouldn't have been the
case five years ago because the quality
was not so good the next thing is about
gestures you know we can now start to
interact with our computers by by really
doing some gestures you know very
exciting again it's enabled by
technologies like real sense like lead
motion and have even heard about other
exciting technologies where you can
detect some gestures by the change in
the frequency spectrum of your Wi-Fi
signal so so a company really did some
research and they figure out that there
are some characteristic gestures and
when it will like like this they can
detect a change in the frequency
spectrum and they can use it as a
gesture you know and you just need your
wireless network and some special router
settings and then you can even start to
interact with teachers based on your
wifey spectrum so that that's exciting
and so we will see a lot of other
exciting team today I talked to
accompany a start-up who are building
some gesture recognition technology
based on ultrasound
they would say they come next year to
market with a product which is like a
one dollar a 1 euro coin and the cost
will be significant below 10 euro you
know this in case they I ordered already
some beta can see no but m and i'm not
sure if they've really able to to
deliver but you see that there will be a
lot of exciting technologies coming to
to really capture your gestures and use
it for interaction and of course there
is motion you know it's not just your
gesture of your head you know I actually
i just recently met the CEO of this
company so they they have a kickstarter
campaign running so it's 800 euro it's
this vertex only thing it's a kind of
like a virtual thread mill you know you
have sends us on your shoes you start
running you know and there's this thing
on your belly which make sure that you
don't fall off you know but it's very
exciting what you can do very realistic
gaming you can move your body you can do
some shooting games whatever and so you
can really capture the motion you know
and bring it into the system ok so the
next thing is how you visualize stuff
you know it's about the augmentation you
know we have seen the classic 2d
overlays probably everybody has already
played around with this classic janiyah
browser and you looked into you know the
environment oh there is a starbucks
restaurant you know 500 meters away so
this is this is kind of not that super
sexy 2d overlay you look into the real
world and get some some some 2d overlay
on it but it can get more exciting like
having real real 3d overlays maybe you
know the company Mateo it was the Munich
company the world leader of augmented
reality tools they have been recently
bought by Apple and they had a very
exciting technology and and one of them
the exciting applications for it was and
I kyare our catalog so and the quality
is really good you go into this catalog
you scan basically a piece of furniture
and go into your living room and then
you put this object in
3d in your living room and they have
been also able to replicate the correct
lighting so so they captured basically
the lighting conditions in that room and
made sure that the shadow of your
virtual object is in the same direction
like the real shadow from the other
object so it is pretty cool you know and
this is getting into the the area where
the blending over of the virtual and the
real world is getting really exciting
you know so the 3d stuff and of course
you know Microsoft is potentially
bringing it to the next level with
hologram and an even more exciting
blending over off of these technologies
so we will see next year hopefully all
right so but but then we talked about
visualization I'm the last thing I love
to talk about is how can you virtualize
you know things how can you really give
people the ability to explore something
which which is either real or artificial
you know so you can virtualize even
human bodies you know there are some
studios out there with sophisticated
camera setups we did some tests with a
facility in Prak you know they have in
the meantime camera rigs with more than
200 DSLR cameras you get into the setup
and they take in one picture with 200
DSLR cameras and you get round about 12
million polygons then when you try to
make a 3d object you know or even more
and but but the realism you can get from
from this capturing his amazing you know
so you can really do this this body
scanning you know you can of course
create some objects which are not real
now let's say you my neighbors selling
luxury boats you know they have some
designer sitting in Italy they designing
boats fork I don't know 50 60 millions
you know they are not built yet but when
you want to sell it to a customer you
maybe want to give him the ability to go
into this cool thing you know maybe to
even do some customization of the
furniture of things like that so it's
cool to really build objects which are
not real yet and give the ability to
explore on the other hand
you can of course do some total crazy
stuff you know give people the ability
to experience to build some virtual
worlds and give them experiences like
people will never have you know think
about a roller coaster ride you know
where you have all the g-forces and
whatever and then you put a virtual
reality headset on it and I call this
over play and then you're doing the same
rollercoaster ride with the same physics
and the g-power but you are a dragon
flying in an artificial Kingdom whatever
you know so it's it's giving you the
ability to to blend over the real world
and and some totally artificial stuff
you probably will never ever experienced
in that way in your life so that's
that's exciting okay so with that I'm
coming close to the end and I just wanna
finish with a low tech but high impact
technology I mentioned before you know
this is this cardboard stuff you know we
we have built our own cardboard you know
like you can see here like you can try
out later we believe it's a great
opportunity now to start to deliver this
kind of experiences through the masses
even without having tons of oculus rifts
delivered you know and so we are
strongly believe in this low entry on
the market saying put chest your
smartphone in like this or even your
life I phone whatever into a piece of
cardboard and start to play around with
this immersive experiences you can do
orientation let's say you are really in
a real estate business and somebody is
going on the building site of the new
house you can put this into your
cardboard people can see the real
environment they see the 3d model of the
house and they look outside of the
window of the new house and they can see
what kind of part of the neighbor
building they will see or what the
neighbor will see from your building you
know and that's exciting and this is
something you can do today for nearly no
money you know and so this is the power
we we see in this in this cardboard
movement
and I think it will help to really
spread out this augmented virtual
immersive experiences in a big way and
with that i think i'm at the end of this
presentation thank you very much if you
have some questions please ask now or
later i'm here for the rest of the
evening thank you so the real challenge
will be to excitability applications
right like the hot awkward like really
seem to you to complicate costly but I
I think in the end when you build some
virtual or immersive content or media
it's just a matter of let's say you need
to adjust them to the capabilities of
your device let's say when you have a
oculus rift in mind you can have a much
higher frame rate you need much a better
quality of your video of your 3d models
but you can scale it down to a certain
extent to be even cool on our on a
low-end device what you of course
missing is the interaction stuff you
know but I think in general the problem
we have today there is no standard every
every manufacturer comes up with his own
input devices the one is using some
ultrasound infrared whatever technology
the other had an input device and we
don't even have a common understanding
on how a user interface should look like
you know today you can take an ordinary
computer you use your keyboard and a
mouse and you know how to regardless if
it's linux mac or windows you know you
are somehow familiar to how to use it
but it's not the case when you put on an
application for a virtual or augmented
reality headset because every vendor or
every eppler has built his own kind of
way you know lead motion is doing cool
stuff be doing a boxing game right now
and we thought why not use your hand as
in the boxing glove as the user
interface so when you do a gesture you
see the boxing glove and then it pops up
like a menu and you can do some control
it was our idea for the boxing game but
another person or another game developer
is coming up with another idea so we
don't have really a good standardized
input technology or even user interface
you know and so the minimum common
ground is to use some some on-screen
buttons you know like there's a virtual
control popping up you know and even
when you don't have any other input tool
you just look on a certain object and
when you don't look away it's like you
know it's it's like a button press but
yeah so and this is you know for me
one of the most exciting things how the
user interface and the user experience
with all these devices will standardize
over time yeah but I think this will
take a couple of years okay es su marine
last names this was personal
last year this year she is a big chunk
of this case was beer hard work and it
was there with excitement in that space
or the comics someone was there were two
son was laying with you all the time and
there were two dozen
watching it constantly during and August
have each patient's to their places and
every day the few was about to there was
a similar queue at center so this is a
selected group these are in that sphere
but still the excitement was
possession but come on des so this makes
me help you know by the way I was or two
years ago I was about wearables I was
excited about wearables and stuff you
know and you see the power of this and
there's also this kind of expectation
that every ten years there is a new
computing platform blahdy blah and a lot
of people already think that this kind
of virtual augmented thing is gonna be
the next big thing and to be honest I
fully believe i feel myself like being
in the early days we did online before
the internet you know and everybody
thought wow now the web is there and
something big is going on nobody didn't
know what will happen but everybody had
their the impression this is going to be
big you know and for me it's the same
with this stuff now and I see it nearly
every day like today we have been on the
Royal Jang on a startup event whatever
and a lot of people have seen the first
time in their life a cardboard and a
virtual reality headset and it takes
mostly 5 to 10 seconds to get either a
cool guy Lau you know so and nearly
every every second person is having this
experience they are super excited and I
think this there is a certain power in
this first time experiencing maybe it's
it's just this little moment but most
people who wear this the first time get
excited about it and this creates some
long-term potential for business you
know and you're just emphasizing yes
it's
so the future will be bright it will be
