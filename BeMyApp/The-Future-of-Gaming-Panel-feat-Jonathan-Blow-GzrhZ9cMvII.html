work in videogames but I want what I
want to do is kind of introduce them and
ask them a couple questions as we as we
go down just first of all I just wanted
to draw your attention to that corner of
the screen there in San Francisco IG da
this is sort of collaboration we have
our Twitter account here and if you are
interested you live in the city and you
want to come to events kind of like this
on a regular basis we have them usually
once a month we're trying to do them
once a month so please follow that and
try to find us on our meetup group okay
so this panel is about the future of
games but I think in order to talk about
that we're gonna have to cover a little
bit of what's what's happening now
currently in games and I think you know
there's maybe a couple of problems with
with with our industry and so I kind of
wanted to establish what the status quo
is with what these fantastic wonderful
wonderful people so first off I wanted
to start with Susan because yeah so
we're gonna really get into the into the
meat of this Susan is a writer fantastic
writer his who's written for the
Bioshock series for tomb raider and has
has had a wonderful career and has some
rather shocking news I don't want to
over blow it but I'm a woman Susan Susan
is a woman but she is also she's also
phasing out of the videogames industry
and I think why that's important to talk
about is because it it's probably
highlighting a problem that we have in
our industry right now so I I wanted to
start with you Susan and talk about why
why that is why you have that respect
right now um yes well thank you for that
awesome intro you might see like come to
parties with me yeah I first of all I am
really grateful for the career that I
had in video games I mean I had like
incredible collaborations with some of
the smartest most creative people I've
ever met um but yeah after like I feel
like I'm backing away slowly I mean it's
not a hard to stop
I still take game video game projects
from time to time but less and less I
think I'm down well anyway yeah why am i
doing it well I mean you know it's
partly me I'm sure I've just sort of
changed and I'm interested in different
kinds of things but in terms of what I
see going on in the industry that I
didn't see when I started because when I
started I was in love this is it I'm
done this is awesome and what's changed
the two things that come to mind that
have changed between then and now
and one is what I think we've heard a
lot about which is that the the business
has grown so quickly and the budgets for
console title it's not indie stuff
obviously but for console titles is so
ginormous that studios have to mitigate
risk for the return on investment and so
they have to play it safe with their
creative content and that can be
challenging because I know that people
developers are chomping at the bit to
try new and different kinds of things
and and often feel stymied in that
environment not always but sometimes and
indie is definitely an option obviously
but I'm not for everybody so you know
that was one thing I considered like
well should I go indie but I love
working with with teams big teams on big
projects and so I'm sad that I can't do
um can't be more challenge sometimes on
some of those bigger projects my focus
is really on storytelling that's why I
got weirdly that's why I got in the
industry which sounds ridiculous now but
when I started it didn't seem so strange
and I I want to sort of this is such
dangerous territory I feel like I have
to really choose my words carefully
you know I think when games get greenlit
they can't get greenlit without a story
right like the executive committee needs
something to hang their hat on you can't
just say here's the mechanics pure game
mechanics there's that's it they're like
well who who's the player what's the
Avatar right what's the whatever and so
the team putting it together and needs
to put something there right so a lot of
times it's something's kind of
placeholder and then the game gets
greenlit and then they at some point
roll bring on writers and the
constraints are pretty established like
it's a shooter it's a military shooter
he's it's World War two like I've seen
this before you know and like most
people have and there's nothing wrong
with that but when you start seeing sort
of the same things over and over again
even though the people like I said that
working games are so creative and such
great ideas but the system itself
doesn't really support innovation as
much as I I wish it would right
um and it's interesting you use a word
like innovation when you're a writer and
you're because I think a lot of people
when they think about innovation in our
industry they're talking about
technology correct and and I think that
it's a really important topic and and
and so it's something we should come
back to when we start talking about the
future but I wanted to move on to
Jonathan next cuz you you have always
been in Indy you've never worked at a
studio was that correct
mostly I contracted at a couple for a
short amount of time okay and why is
that I mean why is it that you you you
didn't stick with that or why is it why
is it that you wanted that kind of
independence it's my personality type
like I just look at a big company doing
big company things and it just smells
bad to me and I don't want to be
involved in that and in fact the times
I've tried to be involved in that kind
of thing I get very quickly demoralized
and just can't physically do it anymore
so this is sort of the only mode of
existence that works for me
is it do you feel like that you what you
do is it I mean is it is it sort of that
big company mentality or is it is
also you know combination is that the
fact that you are what comes what's very
clear in your games is that you are
really an artist that this is a form of
expression for you and is is that the
thing also that you wouldn't necessarily
have ownership over something you're
you're creating in a studio like the
hunt ownership is the wrong word
so actually you know I I generalized to
big company a second ago but it's not I
don't think it's the size of the company
that's inherently the problem I think
it's you know can you show up and
believe that the thing that you're doing
when you got to work today is the most
important thing that you could be doing
versus any other choice that you could
make in life right if you're going from
day to day and at some point you realize
you know I'd rather be doing something
else but I can't because of money or
whatever then for the human spirit
that's not the greatest situation right
so that's the thing it's a lot it's a
lot easier to achieve that kind of
situation like I know that what I'm
doing right now is the the most
meaningful thing that I personally know
how to do it's easier to achieve that
easier when you're in control of the
mission statement it's also a lot harder
because you don't have all these
resources to bring to bear you have to
make it all happen right but you at
least can whereas most large companies
are relatively entrenched in what
they're doing and if you show up and you
want to do something users there's no
room for lateral motion right right does
that come into conflict when you're
trying to also run a business or trying
to you know actually you know generate
money when so far no okay and but but
the only reason is because I don't care
if I'm poor right I mean I made a bunch
of money for my previous game and the
deal I made with myself for this one is
it's okay if I lose everything as long
as I make something that I'm happy with
and so so none of that well and I'm
speaking in absolutes it's not really
true like once in a while a little bit
of like commercial goblin whispering in
my ear will try and get me to influence
my decisions and I just
to recognize that and try and and resist
that because it's going to lead to a
game that's like many other games right
and so you want to avoid that so when
you you you've you've made sort of some
kind of deal with Sony right with for
the witness or not really people think
that that that's a thing and it's not
really a thing okay yeah so you would
you would sort of put like very clear
barriers between what is you know having
that influence your work
ya know Sony doesn't Sony has been great
to work with because they've provided PR
for the game and all that but they've
done that because they like the game
they're not funding it they have no
control over it they have no voice in
what it should be they're just they're
helpful and nice to us and that's great
but it's I wouldn't ever sign a thing
with a publisher that gave them any
traction over what we deliver I just
wouldn't do it cool okay so Amy yes so
Amy you've you've you started out at EA
as a designer was that yeah that was my
first official job I was I did an Atari
game was just me and a programmer before
that okay and and then went to Crystal
Dynamics worked on the Legacy of Kain
series after that obviously creative
director of one of the best-known
third-person action-adventure games out
there uncharted the Uncharted series and
some people would say that you've kind
of revolutionized that that genre how I
mean to to do something like that create
it's very difficult within a corporate
environment can you talk a little bit
about how that was how that came about
it Sony yeah I mean to echo what
Jonathan was saying I mean Sony actually
is very good to work with
they are very hands-off I think it was
sort of a perfect breeding ground to to
be able to do something that was
at the time seems kind of bold and risky
you know in hindsight it might not seem
that way but in terms of the technical
challenges in front of in front of us
it wasn't something that had really been
done before when we set off to make
uncharted one but I think it was fertile
ground because you know we were in a
situation with Naughty Dog where Sony
did trust us as a developer and were
relatively hands-off I mean we would get
stuff filtered back to us mostly through
marketing about you know a lack of faith
in like why are people gonna want to
play a guy and a t-shirt and jeans well
you need more cray doses and it's like
you know we thankfully we could just say
you're gonna have to trust us
and that was an okay answer in some
companies that wouldn't be the case I
mean it sort of feels like that should
have just happened at that crystal like
what what what uncharted should've yes
well I mean look it was it was a weird
time right I'd been there for eight
years and had been on essentially the
same franchise the legacy of kain Soul
Reaver franchise the whole time and you
know was clear that we probably weren't
going to make another one in-house right
and we were finishing up the last one
that I was working on a few months to go
when I got a call from Naughty Dog to
say would you want to come join us be
the game director on jak 3 and then
transitioned into being the game
director on new IP for the PlayStation 3
pretty attractive right right about the
same time we got word that I just was
going to take Tomb Raider away from core
because it had been struggling it had
been a little bit damaged and give it to
Crystal Dynamics so it was sort of a
little bit of initially for me a dilemma
and then I realized they were so freaked
out about needing to rehab of that
franchise that although arguably they
were giving it to Crystal because of our
track record they were also a little
freaked out to put in anybody's hands at
Crystal including mine and so Doug
Church was at I Dawson they brought him
in to be the director of it
think they were trying to it's that
whole mitigation of risk thing it's like
we can't afford to faceplant one more
time with Tomb Raider
what's a sure bet you know and so was
sort of interesting is like it's like
well I would have loved to have done it
on the other hand I'm glad that happened
because my path took me where I needed
to be and I don't think at the time we
could have made but uncharted at Crystal
right
again just which ground was fertile and
it just turned out Naughty Dog and Sony
was and so I'd be lying if I didn't say
there was a little bit of gratification
and being able to kind of go oh okay
well I'll just go make my own game then
you know you want you want Doug to do
tomb raider fine you know I'll go do
something kind of similar with less
constraints right you know and less fear
right it was great yeah when you think
about the games I mean so I'll tell you
a little story when I started I work at
Crystal currently and when when I
started there the the when you called up
the company you could like type in the
last name of the person and get that
person and so somebody found me somehow
and told me I love the Legacy of Kain
series are so good and and what really
wanted me to help him get a new one of
those games made it so you you
throughout your career with your games
people have that kind of reaction to
them they love these games you can you
tell us why you think that is what is it
what's kind of at the heart of the game
to youth well you know I mean the stuff
I've made has been pretty mainstream but
I've always been in the fortunate
position to be both creative director
and writer I mean we've talked about
this a lot Susan and I you know and you
know I feel very lucky there's not a lot
of people in the industry that actually
have that opportunity in mainstream game
development and so what that means is
because story was very important to me I
could put it front and center in game
development and I think at the end of
the day you know no matter how fun a
game is or how flawed it is what we take
away
is story and character that's what we
fall in love and we forgive the flaws or
we forget the fun if the if the story in
character isn't there and so because we
always you know you know put it ahead of
gameplay but they they are part and
parcel of the same thing you know and I
think because all the games were built
that way I think that was tangible to
the fans and and also because I poured
my my soul into them you know a labor of
love yeah great
so Greg you you started out I I once saw
an interview with you where you were
saying that you kind of always had this
idea of of starting your own video game
we're not necessarily starting your own
video game company but really making
games but you started out working as a
writer and then became the editor in
chief at GameSpot so wide and that was a
ten year kind of adventure what why did
you why did you do that and not go
directly into games yeah I did start
writing about games kind of straight out
of high school and and ended up really
falling in love with that and did that
for you know like 10 or 12 years but I
wanted to make game since I was a little
kid like playing games on the Apple to
see or something like that playing the
ultimate old series of computer
role-playing games and it was just the
most amazing thing that I had
experienced as an eight-year-old and I
had no idea how it was done but I knew
that a human being made it or a small
group of humans and I wanted to learn
how to do that and do it myself but as I
repeatedly tried because though the
obvious path end was to learn to program
it was not it was something that I
struggled with and just kind of dabbled
with on and on and so so writing was
something that came more naturally to me
and and I just sort of encountered less
resistance with it and I was playing so
many games in high school that I was
like I need to do something productive
with this just to kind of feed the habit
you know and so I started writing about
them and
kind of woke up one day and there's 10
years laters I think I'm a
editor-in-chief of GameSpot and I'm like
if I don't if I don't at least kind of
try to come back to this I know I'll
always regret kind of not not at least
giving this the old college try like for
real
so I got an opportunity to go to
Electronic Arts down in Los Angeles
where I worked on command &amp;amp; Conquer I I
worked at 2k games for a year and now I
met a supergiant which is a much smaller
studio than either of those working with
a couple of former ei colleagues so I've
yeah I've gone from you know the kind of
the editorial side to kind of internal
development at a at a huge game studio
to like external production at more of a
kind of a boutique but still triple-a
studio 2k and now a small independent
team where we do our own thing that must
have been that must kind of give you a
little bit of an advantage of having
that experience one you know what what
reviewers and people are gonna write
about your games and so you you have a
sense presumably of the quiet quality
bar that you need to meet meet at the
same time you also know how to reach
that quality bar because you worked in
production for if you use working at
these big companies and you've managed
to release two games in about six years
right yeah we started in a little less
we started in 2009 and Bastion our first
game we did in about 20 months and and
then transistor our second game came out
a year ago so that was about two and a
half years from there so we it's it's
long for us coming from EA where we were
banging out a game a year like in the
command &amp;amp; Conquer franchise or whatever
as soon as when what 18 months was a
luxurious amount of time yeah there but
but yeah we I think you know we
definitely when we were starting off as
supergiant and we're thinking of all the
many reasons we would more than likely
fail as a small start-up independent
studio we're trying to like be positive
about the advantages we did have and one
of the things we really felt we took
away from our experience at EA was like
hey
and we we have shipped videogames here
like we know like finishing a videogame
is is even more difficult than starting
it often times and and just having that
production discipline sweating those
details and knowing what kind of some of
the some of the surprises that are
inevitably gonna come up by thinking not
only if anything it maybe love us into a
false sense of security about our
ability to actually do the thing and
being not terrified is really important
in terms of making forward progress and
development I think yeah and but you
what was it that also like kind of made
you kind of make take that leap is it to
create that that studio man what was it
that you weren't getting at at EA or 2k
that you yeah you know we were we were
playing so our team at its peak at EA
was about a hundred people which is like
today is like a pittance on a triple-a
team but you know back then it's pretty
big we're playing these games like like
braid that that John made and and plants
vs. zombies and Castle Crashers and
stuff like that like this was in in 2009
it was already kind of a bit of a
Renaissance period I think for for
independent games they threw like Xbox
Live Arcade and platforms like that I
think they they kind of reached both a
level of quality and like kind of a new
level of awareness that they hadn't in
the past and and we were just thinking
like man how is it that three people or
five people can make a better game than
a hundred people this is this is
initially counterintuitive as an idea
and meanwhile you know we didn't we we
didn't kind of strike out because of
because of EA but for sure
kind of like what John was saying a lot
of a lot of bandwidth does there's a big
communication overhead the bigger your
team is and it can be harder to make any
kind of decision be it a good one or a
bad one and if it's a bad one woe unto
you if you spend a long time and then
arrive at a bad decision but the there
was something really appealing about
just going and trying to do it our way
and and learning from what
our experience there and also just
following more of our intuition and
making the kind of game that we would
never be able to make in in a in a large
studio environment and just making
something that felt more personal to us
and seeing how that would do and the you
know like the what was happening in
digital distribution at the time I think
is really what made it possible
from-from like a I guess from a business
standpoint like it although those are
still really competitive environments
the part where you didn't have to like
put a video game it print a video game
you know on a DVD and put it in like
Walmart's around the country or
something was what enabled a lot of
small studios like ours I think to come
into existence cool yeah so now I want
to kind of focus the conversation more
on the future which is what this is
supposed to be about but I think it's
nice to kind of get a real sense of
where you are all coming from and how
you kind of got to right now on in order
to sort of understand your answers so I
just kind of want to throw this out and
sort of get a gauge of from each of you
what do you think you know a video game
like video games need to be sort of 5 10
15 years in the future whatever kind of
makes sense to you as a goal like when
you think about what is this video game
need to be to really sort of and and and
this doesn't need to be anything sort of
specific it's just to you as what what
is it that you want to make and what is
it that you want to experience as a
player in the future well so when it
comes to like what the game should be in
the end I don't I feel like design is
just diverging into more directions you
can't really say but when I when I think
about you know I'm about to finish a
project so I'm having these kind of
questions what am i doing next and this
totally doesn't answer your question but
one of the most important things I can
feel like I can do is like improve the
technical infrastructure because the way
from a technical standpoint the way that
we make games right now is just
terrible you know you have these large
large large teams a substantial portion
of whom were actually trying to program
and I say trying because that's what
they're trying right and most of that
effort is wasted and and dealing with
problems that shouldn't be problems in
it it just makes up like all the all the
problems that we've been talking about
that happened with big teams get worse
the bigger your team is right and it's
very clear that at least on the
technical side we don't need teams as
large as we have it's just that they're
fighting fires all the time so you know
I'm very interested in clearing out the
the underpinnings of how things are
built like replace the programming
language replace the paradigm of like
how you move data around and how you
represent it and all that that has
nothing to do with like what you play in
the end except that they'll make
everything better because people will be
able to make things faster with smaller
numbers of people so that's that's all
that I can say there actually yeah I
completely agree almost I think that
thanks one of the biggest problems I
talked about the business but I think
the tech is a problem as well like as a
person who's focused on content ten
years ago I thought well eventually the
tech will get resolved and then it'll
become a means to an end right and the
easiest metaphor is like we'll figure
out the movie camera and then we can
focus on what's happening in front of
the camera right but the reality is that
we're always looking at the camera and
we're always tinkering and and it's it
becomes a real barrier to creativity for
everybody I think like you said the
programmers are stuck because they're
dealing with wonky yeah I mean you know
they write a scene right and the scene
doesn't work because it's not animated
very well because the animation tools
were too slow for them to iterate very
fast because the programmers didn't have
time or morale to go rev the tools
because they were just dead and couldn't
do it because they're too busy like
getting the some other thing even
running right and so like you then even
just from what you would think is far
away from us technology as a storyteller
you can't actually do the things that
you should be able to do and in all
right right I mean we can't even do
what's like we can't we can't you can
but like it's a big uphill battle
but even doing the things in his
traditional kind of a way like when we
get to start really innovating with
story in a completely different kind of
way you know any mean like we could be
doing so much more than we are not just
with story but that's what my focus is
and I do feel like that's where the
tripping point always is like well we're
limited we can't do it because this
limitation that limitation it's always
back to the tech which again to me it's
a black box but it's a black box that's
like on my chest choking me you said you
were gonna stop writing game stories you
could learn to program you can like long
direction wrong direction Amy when you
you're also taking on a new project now
yeah and and when you think about it do
you think about any differently than you
thought about you know the in charted
series or legacy came well yeah I mean
obviously there's some obvious
similarities because it's Star Wars I
mean and frankly look you know I'm 50
years old I've been doing this for over
25 years
if it had been anything but Star Wars I
probably would have set off in some
different direction but like it's like
that's the thing that makes me who I am
and I'm not unique in that so you just
don't say no when an opportunity like
that comes along but I think the
challenge is like you know I think it's
kind of like what what John was just
saying it's like I don't even like the
word should I don't like Dogma in these
discussions there's such a breadth of
games that we can make you know and and
and trying to limit that by criticizing
somehow each other's work whether we're
mainstream or Indies is silly right what
I'm excited about is the fact that kind
of what grey was talking about it's
we're at a point now I mean we keep
talking about how we are this pioneer
industry and this is kind of the Wild
West and we're on this frontier this
felt like that honestly for 25 years
still right but I guess that's in the
big scheme of things that's reasonable
but I feel like we're just now entering
a time when the shackles are coming off
because so much is getting democratized
when I started you know it was like
there were no freely available game
engines like unreal er unity the access
to the tools like Maya was incredibly
limited I mean
SGI for god sakes you know the there was
no digital distribution so everything
had to fit that model of a $60 game in a
box all of that is blown out now
and what that means we can see is a lot
of voices coming out and and as a gamer
that's what excites me the most I mean
that sounds ironic given the kind of
games that I tend to make and and what
I'm working on now but I think you know
my attitude is always that like even
making a game like Uncharted or Star
Wars you know there's a Trojan horse
opportunity with these games to to try
new stuff about what we can do with the
medium as an interactive medium and if
we get it right we reach a lot of people
with these triple a Trojan horse titles
you know what I mean what I'm excited
about
for our medium you know and wanting to
see us push more on what is the language
of interactivity versus just a thing
cinema and again I know that sounds
ironic coming from me is that it is a
vehicle for empathy not just sympathy
and for experience rather than just sort
of vicarious you know passive experience
I mean that's what VR is even more
exciting that idea of presence is even
beyond the idea of you know the empathy
that can come through an interactive
medium so that's the kind of stuff that
it's like I would like to Trojan horse
into my projects and I'm kind of envious
of the people that get to do it like you
know full-time oh yeah I I really love
the Trojan horse expression by the way I
strongly agree with that as an idea that
you know players go in to these games
are I think truly formless other than
their interactivity being kind of their
defining feature interactivity in some
respect I think that's the only other
than them being digital when we say
games we
electronic games I think in this context
and the idea that people keep trying to
poke at the boundaries of that is is
really interesting I feel that I I agree
with Amy that in a certain respect I
feel that people have been doing this
for a long long time already and people
talk about it like it's this new thing
that happened in the last two years and
it's really not but at the same time I
think the the degree to which more game
developers are attempting more new types
of experiences and having success with
those with those efforts at at different
scales is really encouraging so it's
great to see a continued kind of pattern
of unexpected successes and some people
kind of cynically want to write them off
as you know outliers or whatever is in
the right place at the right time but
when that's the entire pattern when
people try something new and then it
succeeds and reaches some new audience
some some seeming niche that turns out
to be very very large I think that's all
great so I I like it creates a kind of
an incredibly competitive and scary
environment in one respect but it's also
feels very feels very pure where like at
least everyone feels that you're just
not gonna succeed if you try to kind of
ape someone else's success at this point
if ever that was a viable strategy I
think it probably never really was and
less so today than before I think yeah
it's an interesting point about sort of
I mean also democra the democratization
of it and and has kind of led to you
know kind of global success that you
know Jonathan you've had and you've had
correct view as you move into the future
how do you scale that up safely well you
don't end up in the same situation with
like these massive teams yeah we we've
talked about that a lot at supergiant
we're like we've what are one of our
programmers he worked on modern warfare
1 and 2 before you know working on
Bastion or whatever so he he's been
there at kind of the the top of the
figurative Mount Everest as far as like
triple
a game development and triple a scale
success and and our thing is like we
like I said we've we've taken a lot of
super positive lessons away from that
and we loved working on games at that at
that scale but in terms of what we do at
supergiant it's it's completely core to
everything about us that we remain small
so the answer to the question of scales
like we we simply do not scale we we
just sidestep the the the trap of like
trying to make like a bigger better game
every time if like well this did well so
ergo this plus you know online
multiplayer and this and that well will
do even better it's so avoiding avoiding
the trap of just you know more scope
equals more quality is something that's
very important to us and just we a bunch
of our guys come from like they like a
music background or whatever so they the
the band analogy is really you're really
appealing to us if like a group of
people who just sticks together over a
long period of time and does work
together and it'll just all have
something consistent through it in its
identity because it's the same people
but hopefully each respective work is is
unique in some way and surprising and
interesting cool yeah Jonathan you
you've with with the witness your this
is very definitely a scale much larger
than than brain and I so I'm wondering I
mean this is obviously also taken a lot
longer for you to make so is looking
beyond this are you kind of like took a
stuff but like wow yeah and so part of
the motivation was definitely to make a
large ambitious game and having having
done that you know relative to our size
right
having done that like I like to do
something new every time and the thing
about the witness is very high density
environment where everything is
interconnected and absolute like
everything is meaningful in ways that
surprised you 30 hours into the game
right like I've been walking past this
tree 15 times and on the 16th time I
realize why it's important right and
then the whole game is that
but the next game is not gonna be about
that right and so it doesn't part of
what happened with the witness is it
needed to be 3d because our game plays
3d in it I don't know just all these
things added together but we've actually
done okay so you know braid took about
three and a half years is about I think
of it as a five hour game of course that
varies heavily based and he's playing
the witness is probably about 80 hours
and it took about twice as long with the
time it's done so we made a game that's
what is that sixteen times as big in
twice as long so that's four times as
efficient so so that's fine but but I
don't feel they need to keep growing
that necessarily although I yeah yeah
depends depends on your point of view
yeah Amy I maybe you don't want to
necessarily be the person to represent
your company in this but election
Electronic Arts is this horrible track
record for you know laying layoffs after
big projects on is there any sort of
responsibility you feel towards your
projects and and in that I mean in terms
of not necessarily being responsible for
that there laughs but is there any way
that you want to or try to mitigate that
or yeah you know I mean I'm honestly you
know I had some trepidation about
rejoining yeh you know and I know I sat
down with the CEO of on down to talk
about you know my concerns and in my
hopes you know and you know I'm hoping
that and look it's it's a very different
company that I think people think and
it's certainly a different one than my
work that many years ago and I'm hoping
that you know if I have some leverage
and a bully pulpit I can I can use it
for good to make some some change a seed
of change and and model better
development but yeah I mean obviously
like you know it's a giant organization
you know this is difficult it's a lot of
giant rusty gears you know and and you
know you just try to make local make a
difference locally and hopefully that
influences people on a larger scale
but I think the answer to your question
before not to go off at a tangent is
really that I think what you're gonna
find is large publishers and developers
are actually gonna start shifting the
way of indie development not indie
development having to start scaling
because it's not sustainable right it's
just an arms race and the money it takes
and again the the mitigation of risk
that goes along with it and the fear
that goes along with it both of which
are antithetical to game development and
creativity isn't it's just it's it's
toxic and you know we have to do some
what outsourcing which is great you know
as long as you know if you can manage
that it's there's nothing wrong with
that
but I think the old business models
falling away and now with digital
distribution and live services and
people looking at things like
subscription models and then you're
looking at Netflix I mean I think the
whole industry is poised to change and
there's no reason we couldn't be making
more reasonably sized games ourselves
because the budgets can come down
because we don't have to have a $60
price point you know there's no cost of
goods so and I think obviously the the
work that we produce is going to improve
because of that because we can take more
risks that's it's a really interesting
observation because it sort of seems
like we're kind of midway through the
collapse that happened in the film
industry the studio system and and so
then I guess the last question is for
like people here as they're trying to
get and position themselves well for the
future it sort of sounds like we're
headed much more towards a
a future where we're gonna outsource
things we're gonna you know we're not
going to have these massive teams that
it's maybe gonna be small teams that are
essentially producers that kind of
create this I don't think that's
probably very realistic you still need
your core creative team on site the
outsourcing is same thing the animation
studios I've been doing for a long time
the massive amount of artwork that needs
to get done but a lot of the the core
creative work still has to be here I
don't think that you know it's not like
the VFX industry where I think our jobs
are going to disappear but I do think
that look even these big publishers
they're shackled into a business model
if they know doesn't work and they want
to get away from I just think that
that's because those wheels are rusty
and slow to turn it's gonna we're gonna
see that change a little slower than
we're seeing it in the indie development
scene but we're gonna see it because it
doesn't make sense for them either you
know it's just hit that it's it's
hitting that tipping point that we've
been all kind of holding our breaths and
waiting to see which is why like you
know even for me trying to make you know
a game similar to something I've been
doing for many many many years I feel
like without the being able to take the
IP Star Wars you know with Star Wars out
of the Rizk column I think would be hard
to get something greenlit anymore just
because it's just too terrifying and I
understand why it's not because they're
they're being cowards it's because it's
a hell of a lot of money
Susan is there anything you it's there
any way that we can get you what would
we need to change for the future of the
industry to have you phase back I don't
know if anyone cares if I face back
which is fine I mean you know I think I
think what's probably gonna happen is
that we're gonna start seeing
innovations when people again I'm such
an outlier I mean I love story
I always feel weird at these things talk
about story I'm like I know almost no
one cares but I care a lot I mean when
people start using these tools to create
like storytelling experiences deep
empathy like we've never seen anywhere
else like when that starts happening I
will probably get excited again but I I
think it's gonna happen
because lots of people are getting our
hand their hands on our tools it's not
just you know people who label
themselves as game developers like I
went to Sundance they have this new
frontiers storytelling lab and it's
really interesting they bring people
from all fellows in who are working on
all kinds of different projects and some
of them are game developers backgrounds
some people are like combat
photographers there's a guy in
particular I'm thinking of and he is
using VR to create an experience that
he's gonna be sharing with kids living
in conflict zones so they can talk to
the enemy right quote-unquote and the
idea is to try and create some sense of
empathy towards someone they hate on
sight in real life and you know it's
gonna be flawed it's gonna be messed up
I mean any anything new it's gonna be
executed poorly for a long time right
like but it's gonna get there eventually
and I think that will probably happen
but it's but honestly ten years ago
that's what I was hoping for - like soon
any second now and the reality is like
wifes
you know tick tock and I just kind of
want to get on with it you know so I
wish everybody the best of luck
someone's gonna be some of them gonna be
really jealous of but I will probably be
somewhere else by then which makes me
kind of sad but say Levine yeah well
that makes me kind of sad too but you
know see you later um I think we know we
don't at a time for questions okay well
thank you so much this is such a
wonderful plan thank you so for being so
