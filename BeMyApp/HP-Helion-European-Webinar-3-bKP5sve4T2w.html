go whoever i mentioned earlier could not
make it so once again he just want to
thank everyone for really coming down
and this is a very strong collaboration
between the mainstream and Intel for
really trying to set a fly the IT
industry and as you can see he has all
this rain down no he was very eager to
join us but he's here with us in spirit
info on HP are strong partners and
collaborating allowing different
activities in the IT industry they have
decided to join me to organize this
series to share with them vr is actually
their commitment into the open source
and a particularly open start HP and
into our climate members of the
foundation and both folders seen in the
board of directors until developers work
with the communities to expose in those
hardware technologies to OpenStack
software modules and to extend open
skype technologies to improve security
compliance high availability
manageability performance and high end
user experience so off furthermore i'm
going to give them like to it's in NC n
are you ready hello
yes hello everyone hello a confounded so
yes let me just fix it like right now
I'm showing my swing so and myself so
I'm 18 climbing the Emmy team so I am am
French as maybe you can hear and I am
sick why no I lost my voice I'm sorry
but we can concern this event because it
is very very important on I'm sure it
will be a very very interesting for you
and so today we are talking about a
beyond death platform so we're talking
about application about apps about
collection way so let me just ask you a
question so i have just few question
just before to start just to know if you
have seen my first webinar just to know
if we're talking about the same thing or
if I have to speak maybe to do some
recall about my first webinar so the
port is open Rhino so you can vote if
you should see it or not all rights
artists / songs so I am a period site
okay let's wait okay so let me to do a
quick quick quick or maybe just to
explain a few things just to be sure
we're on the same page happy of course
what you prepared today okay so i am a
developer rhino in HP i am more selling
products but for you i would be a
developer again i do to developer is
back in time so today we are developing
in a pic became as you know so the main
program for a developer like me it's an
application it's not only could you know
credits not enough that's why when I
want to develop a new application I have
to cut of course and I like that I love
of God but under unfortunately it's not
enough don't need a network ok a
database to first my data a video where
to want to exhibit my code a server to
us this occurred security x-type stuff
and the main problem is as a developer I
just want to be focused and my code
that's it end-user M is when I am
cutting my code is depending on the
infrastructure so if the infrastructure
is changing I have to change Mike good
and this is the that's but really by the
point form okay so if the server is
different if the network is different on
the database maybe it's not the same
database I have to change my code and I
don't want to do that anymore that's why
today we are cutting an application and
i will show you how it's possible to cut
an application a clan native application
with not depending of the entrance which
oh ok this point is very very important
so today are its its life HD Moore life
coding that's why there is maybe a lot
of programs a lot of fail Exeter so this
control this counter is there to see at
the end of the webinar if I am still
alive because I am dying I am sick if I
am still alive at the end of this
webinar we have this control just to
know how many files our minis fixes okay
so just be very confident I hope it will
be a lot of success so all just to know
if we are both the same language and
what is your favorite language if you
are developer if you are not maybe just
choose a mais you want but if you have
developer on just let me know if it's
more PHP maybe you are cutting a lot of
a lot of languages but just the first
one okay okay great so you are more PHP
ok ok ok ok so you are more web
application or next time and this is a
good choice and it seemed Joyce and the
GS of course the GS out of that but
again fifty percent PHP ok that's a good
answer so today I have a good news for
you one developing with me ok so I think
it's a good good idea and because you
love key and me as well so wrong so the
dimmable we are starting their lights or
something very easy so we just need to
push application again let's it seems
easy ok so lets me choose very easy so
we deploy your turn what first thing you
need an application ok so i have one i
have a web application very easy let me
go inside this is my F ok so it's PG
HTML some pictures and that's it ok let
me go in the well is my pictures so I
have just one file home dot PHP ok let
me open it um let's all right on that
pitch p ok this is my website which are
a PHP developer you know what i am
talking about because this of course PHP
tags so very easy as a classical
application like a traditional this my
sentence so this is a great app for be
my app ok hello ok such it may be as my
life because as a developer i love
smiley and so okay so at least my lip ok
so this write-up for my appt 0 km and
another PHP code so this a clean native
code ok i know that's crazy but this is
a kinetic odd because basically when you
want develop when you are deploying your
application the platform is scratching
for you a lot of variables and their
environment variables ok so with PHP we
can just get the vipers ok so in this
case i am getting a seaport the local
port where is executing my application
so i want to know as an application
because my application is marked I want
to know myself ok which could which port
excuse me which part is using a twigs
acute my cut
so by this very very simple and common
function I am displaying the local port
of my container okay so I am steaming ok
so now my application is almost ready
diodes it's to perform that I profile
stuck at to dock in recommend it's a
manifest manifest to describe what kind
of application I want to deploy so let
me open it just to show you what you see
I am saying ok my application is also
described so my application is in this
folder ok i want this space as a free
disk space I want this amount of memory
I want this name by up and i am using
this framework i am using PHP so i am
just telling to the platform to crash
shortly ok i want my code my code needs
this kind of elements to work you can do
everything you want you can I don't know
it may be a PHP server up my Chi you can
also where you want I just want this
kind of elements and I hope it's working
ok so now I just need to do Eddie on
login of course because I I any true to
sign in my electronic platform so of
course with very very secure so now I am
connecting to my car in forum okay i am
in just two minutes okay perfect i mean
why no I just need to type Eddie on
pushed and that's it so just remember
it's just good so I just my a web
application and I want to deploy it to
worldwide web so if I am deploying your
application you can use it from your
laptop so it's it's crazy and you go to
deploy on conjecture yes please it's
using the fine the final I'll show you
ok the application is deployed with this
URL so basically if you are using a my
company com
Krypton risk waiting for you a new URL a
new domain name my application that your
company doctor so I don't need to manage
the network it's managing the network
for you so gate swings not bad just for
test so I don't need to set a very very
good wlm and I know it's writing the
application for me ok so I just need to
wait I am good in this part just need to
wait so let me n waiting ok so it's
creating services ok do I need a
scientist maybe not quite science is to
bind No ok and ok perfect so so maybe
you can see it it's a funny well it's
starting the application and the next
stage is to see if the application is
working well ok so basically let me just
to do a quick record I just quite single
simple application PHP ok I'm just
creating a money pit so we both to do
you have to write this file if to mall
you are using performing don't don't
forget you have to write a file a
manifest to describe your application
and after that you adjust to type cred
for me or Eddie on push and that's it so
let me copy the code drew a line I am
opening a blur a well web the I paste
the code as you can see i'm waiting a
little because refreshing I lost so let
me way and maybe i just type until we're
checking if it's work suspense my
application online yes as you can see
maybe on your screen then with the text
this is a greater problem I up with the
local port with where I'm listening ok
so we can do something right I am just
copying the code in the chat system and
you can make me taste it on your side so
just to be sure it's not a fake my
application was on my laptop on right
now my application is under the web so
basically as a developer I don't need a
10 min shuttle right now I can do it
myself I don't need no wine I don't need
to speak to someone else ok so the good
part so let me just show you some signs
to move on so just a quick explanation
so what we did we just right sometimes
we just write the code get off on the
variables of your mods so let me show
you more fibers well as began let me
draw a beautiful a row ok so there is a
lot of variables ok so this is just a
few examples for example you can display
nugu you can show which OS is exiting
where is my application what kind of
services I have well wherever to the
domain which is really how many
instances I have ok so this point is
very important because your application
your cognitive application as to be
smart so your application as to discover
ok what is the variable for me so now
it's not a question from the server the
question is from your application your
application as to ask what I have deploy
myself what I have to work ok so that's
why it's very very important ok load let
me one out whisper how it works ok it's
very very easy basically I have a
cognitive application ok so as you can
see it and a cool a docker container is
scratching for me by the platform ok
so this is a very very simple
application okay right now we are
developing a more complex application
because what is the other thing is to
use database so where is the database
database is in the so the in the inner
platform there is your code and services
a database it's like a service okay it's
like a file system file sharing API XD
ah ok I can ask services to the platform
because in this know what I mean evening
a lot of application ok you have to wait
to ask for a web server I agree with you
but if you asking for database as well
it's a nightmare ok so this is a good
sample if I am waiting for a database I
have to wait ok am quite a lot because
the question what kind of database do
you want ok i can set for you an
instance on this server it's not easy to
access I have to set the good route so
good rights for us ties up so it's it's
a waste of time so now let me see you
it's a database so submission ok so let
me go inside gee I so if i want set
database I just need to add some common
lines ok let me beat you with this life
right now with the traditional
application I know everything about my
ok because in PHP it's very very simple
I just need to set a function and I just
need to write down at the oast de login
and password ok very simple but with
cash for me I have no information about
my database ok that's why I need add
costs remorse come on swim all rights
show you why so the first one as you
know because now you know this from
Jersey I need to ask okay so right there
I am asking okay what kind of services
do you are okay so get everyone get off
recap services okay i am asking to the
platform what do you have for me after
that geez on system so i am decoding the
design and i am using the database is
this some / okay there is a mysql
database so i am asking okay you have a
myschool database em get you the first
one as you can see i'm not a very good
draw but ok I want the first one above
zero and after that I am losing juice
name looking and password okay so right
now with the traditional education I
know the information okay so it's very
easy but with a clinical application you
have to ask you have to a new
application as to ask okay what is the
login what is the password etc etc okay
not very hard to understand and that's
why let me show you our beautification
with me it was growing up perfect so
basically let me just open my backup
file then ok this up so let me open my
the fine we did I can affect this one a
great OPP OPP on can remember why no I
imagine more lines so remember why i am
asking ok what do you have for me after
that I am decoding the service and I am
asking for scrap no shirts that's it and
I am displaying the same is named Logan
Pass 10 stand tall and now i can use a
database in my clan native application
so let me show you so this new code so
do you to update your application you
can do that very very easy and the
resultant election with carefully I just
need to type alien push again with the
same come online and we're eating of
course and so into some questions wait
to deploy yes it's using the manifest
file it's updating my application
automatically so it's okay yeah i have
already this application so i can do in
a bit comparing application just to
upload a new file change that's it by
the existing services to my appt no but
cried services to bind to my appt yes
because no we want to use a database
okay so if i want to use the database i
am asking to the crash phone with server
what do you have for me so the question
is very very simple one kind of service
so i can choose the kind of database
maybe I want the MongoDB okay a
microsoft SQL a rabbitmq from ascending
or postgresql so if you like PHP you
like my square samurai yes so now i am
asking for mice ql database the name so
i can choose free my square okay i am
choosing maybe my screw air till I my up
right and it's creating for me a
database and it's biting this database
to my application okay so this is a good
font or we just need so as you can see
it's I don't need a little side I don't
need 0 wat you arrange the right pork I
don't need to open my firewall
extraction but this is very well okay my
new application is deployed with a zero
done time switched so this
very good because my user can see which
depend on the in bit okay so let me
complete paste but just some the same
uln I don't know OOP here we go I can
see some stem so this random number okay
to to set my son miss them to describe
my new database look in this log in to
connect to my database plus one most of
the database and the local port so now
as you can see my application is ready
to be connected to the database so this
is very very good so let me show you
think maybe the dashboard showing you
the dodgeball because I am a developer
so I am using the common line but to our
I don't you're not GNE miss what DHA mr.
with a dashboard a web dashboard it's
better because you don't need to code
and you can see okay we're using a
crutch runway the editor platform how
many applications they are deplaning
extra and so let me connect to the role
not a lot of people noses this dashboard
so it is good to show you and Jake maybe
if the database is is well quite see
also so by this point we can check if my
pick a name so we know that but maybe we
can check the database okay so I am me
applications tab and I can see my up
okay so i hope it for fishing on your
side if I am clicking on it I have
ordained for
need it so as you can see let me just uh
plush you yeah nice that can stop it
okay i can go apply to the instances and
services so we're going to services I
can see my square silver right there is
ready for me with this name and that's
it okay so if I need to do some stuff
for example my application is is
becoming very very famous I can add more
instances myself okay one two three four
just getting mad ok so this very
direction so if I want two instances i
can set okay i want minimum two because
my application is very famous and as you
can see another instance is creating for
me and opening so the load balancer is
working well a new Duke of container
exciting for me with my simple
application so why not if i am wrong pay
as you can see me dirt okay 46 I hope
it's changing let me check yes fill
three and 50 366 swish again and let's
be chicken first while changing because
i have two instances so well since is
one arm kappahd so of course with the
road bouncer the wrong rubbing mud each
I customers visitors are getting a new
instance okay so maybe I am getting this
as the first one or maybe the second one
to absorb together to charge okay so
think
good point sting a good repair patient
banquets to top layer but all you want
to do the GS application will be
application ipython ok a java
application so it's working exactly with
the same way as ice bitten if you want a
clinical application you have to do some
stuff first one just ok why because i'm
watching the same code for every
platforms the same call them cuz I'm
code for every test ok not a dybbuk test
visual basic style of just one code to
describe my asian that's why I designed
it bounces so it was the manifest file
ok remember as a manifest fine where I
exceed the information like the
framework well is my application the
amount of memory style okay so I need to
define the bounces ok I want to pitch p
from work I want the dotnet I want to
not GS driver from work x done after
that i have a configuration file ok
where is he and i need to ask some
seasoning so database one kind of
database it's done and that's it my job
as the developer is done right here YZ
the next step is the job from the thumb
ok that form and create a release of my
application because everything
everything is everything is already
sitting so I don't need to do something
else ok the platform knows your code the
platform knows service is needed
platform those of from rose so that's it
why not the platform can create a
quantum foil so the platform is taking
care the containerization file that will
be front and of course remember to
connect yellow instance your application
to the right service the right database
talk to him
and so just don't don't don't forget the
very important know that inside your
application okay because as you can see
if my first instance is not working when
okay i can delete it i'm creating a new
one okay there is no backup on mr. for
clinical application okay so if you are
down pat so please stir it in a service
okay stow it in the database okay no
record data the very important that's a
new a new way to develop okay and it's a
patient is able to the visitors to the
customers and you can I consume ipi
exeter i strap so good to know tight 12
factor dotnet i am sure you know this
website maybe but it's very balanced
tasting to know as the big big draw to
know what is the crud from the Oakland
native application okay so don't forget
to visit this website this website is in
French in italiana yes an English actor
so move on as 10 oh it's creating for
you a container so what is inside
containers it's easy if you are pushing
a PHP code is watching for you a
container with apache server and PHP
library so this massive okay if you are
pushing your java code is fighting for
your tomcat server inside as you
continue but tomorrow maybe you want to
develop your own language your own
libraries maybe a nap achieve at the
special web channel for watching so how
to create your own container that the
question and you can do that with a
custom boot back so with a custom
replied you can choose ok i want to
upload my code but they want to use this
kind of server ok so i want as
do cure container question with this
kind of server on with my special
features so we can do that let me show
you how it works don't burn move it
sorry let me open it a bit like somebody
ok I hope it's refreshing and you're
saying this will bike is hosting is a
street by its very easy such thing by
get ok so if you have a good project of
if there is a good project you love you
can use it ok you don't need to download
it ok you can use exactly so if I want
to use the special peachpit back from it
I can do that ok and let me know so I am
editing my manifest to find right there
in this file I was specifying ok i am
using the form of PHP so you can use the
native PHP server but y know I don't
choose I don't want to use this server I
want to use this big back ok so please a
duel for me a new web server a new
container with this server ok so dressed
to sleep an alien push well testing ok
so same question maybe you want to
deploy ok yes of course using manifest
to fight and as you can see ok it's
choosing this feedback right now so my
platform application ok is downloading
automatically this with my cue from it
and using it inside my container ok it's
magic s'okay we don't need to deploy it
I can stop right there let me one ok
just few samples so if you want to use
maybe another bleep action for the GS
will be Paige Pico people you'll beat
back you little bit by a company built
like a sex object backing statics that
you can do that okay so infinitely a
Kryptonian platform is unlimited okay so
it's not only for this kind of code but
you if if it's a web application okay
it's unlimited ok so don't trust the
people would say okay yes but it's
limited no it's that ok so did you
beeper activity so natively you can use
all this kind of remarks wrong good jeez
elements that are basic star but of
course as it says you can add your own
route back so you can add more code more
framework more web server if you want
again it's not a program your bull wish
everyone is still there are you I'm
Krista developer that's a good question
maybe sometimes maybe oh no i don't know
maybe you like that I mean sometimes you
have to use Microsoft I'll no way okay
not bad fifteen fifty percent okay
exchanging fifty percent for never why
no 64 level okay so you are not very
microsoft fan so I know if I have to cut
you okay it's changing thank you thank
you for everyone maybe please sometimes
often maybe add some information a key
okay that's the bad ok so we are talking
about Mike sorry why because it's very
very interesting to know with HP
development platform you can use
Microsoft technologies okay who are the
first want to do that it's not easy to
be couples Microsoft it's the river real
crowdfund bring a partner like Churchill
remember but in a big company in
business we continue the HP the net
application stop Exeter so yes the net
application roots whisker fine okay so
basically it it's this different
architecture okay so you have a linux
gee let me just show you with a pen up
in this part is just too old the
containers okay so when you are pushing
card like that okay it's creating for
you a container on hosted by Dylan XD ok
I am a very very good royal so basically
this working only with linux application
like a PHP apache Javad register so if
you want to use microsoft containers we
are did and that's a good thing the new
g only for windows so this vm is working
for windows sweet-talking exactly the
same way when you are pushing a
microsoft con writing for you a
microsoft Jenelle ok called price on and
basically it it's a small i ASO gets a
more microsoft web server so we did
their form the microsoft part and also
for the services because as you know
inside services you can stay
SQL Server MongoDB Stella but you can
also set a micro so desperate seller
native herbs with soon as nvm only 2 o's
de microsoft cell ok meet you wizard
anymore yeah I this good in to show you
yes or we sort off or a deeper Microsoft
data-based it's it's not very easy in
fact it's not easy at works but with
currently on HP it's it's easier ok
Rhino it stays yeah and let me change
out specific so i am using my view so
people love this tune if you want to
prepare of course my clipper if you are
not maybe you add this to but you can
develop on the GS a lot of languages so
it is let me open my micro of project ok
this my project ok so there is a flower
five pounds a microsoft and development
so it's internet mail so let me maybe
show you a page ok main page one I think
the same taste this Dwight up oh my ok
this I don't forget this my necklace and
that's it ok so I'm the replimat into
very very classical and its be net HTM
extra still now a microsoft developer I
need to change some information so the
web that coffee is a point where is my
where is my boots database ok so if I
want to connect my web application by
microserver application to database I
need to set this fight ok so as you can
see if i want to set up khodam i need to
know the database but with the crossfire
platform now you know
I don't know I have no information to
the database before the deployment let's
fly in to change it we just apply come
on it and I need to do it by some
information so babe is the server this
Vermin pie I but M 02 / fix my database
okay with the contoso University and
this the variables k member in PHP get
over on Mount recap services and after
that I am decoding the design okay with
Microsoft it's almost the same things i
am using the Vipers of your not like
that so i am just sitting astride
hashtag a password hash tag username ash
technic okay that's it so now directly
from visitors to do but i can do that
from eclipse from eclipse if you have
moja bites that's in the same thing okay
so for my clips on with just you i crack
to click on my project click on publish
to cut fun way okay so i'm waiting for
the refreshing and suggest asking to me
see what we did with the come online
exactly the same thing okay so i need to
log in my cat from way I need to ask you
some question okay remember also
manifest file so I the amount of memory
I want the name of my application and
the URLs which dominate the access
number of instances and that's it okay
the news is a new thing from Microsoft
is we can be locally the application if
I want okay so remember with cultural
industries PDF pause between
successfully and the copulation is doing
online okay by the platform right now
with Microsoft you can do the
compression from your laptop and the
final project is pushing
okay all you can choose ok now I don't
want to compile at my laptop but I want
the platform a compiler for me okay just
intercept bridge and waiting that's it
so basically it's a plodding algae
project for me the microsoft project
okay and it's writing for me a new web
server a new container inside Microsoft
server putting on your container with I
is inside and that's it okay so it's
it's not fast but with the dodge ball
okay so it's loading as we University
it's uploading it's not fast we would
lose because as you know my often on the
whites it's a nightmare because it's
scratching a lot of stuff it's uploading
the fights I don't know cutting the i8
is booting us some seats I think the
framework kinetic set up you should like
that honestly I like my but I have to
say it's it's not very very fast okay so
okay let me wait and maybe we can check
in during this time okay why did you
play for what we did well to do with
application basically we just change the
web config file again just to set the
connection string okay as a connection
system to connect my application the
platform okay so I said your name the
paw of my database but as the name the
username so the name is the basically
the instance I can remember and username
and password and that's it okay so I
know with this kind of information it's
working for pregnancy application so you
can take this application Oprah to
another confirm the platform okay it's
not maybe not an HP platform another
k'tralli platform like people
and it will it would be well let me just
move this up and I am done with the mic
after that just to know compatibility
requirements so we are using SQL Server
2012 2014 sp1 you can use crutch for
dotnet version x 2 x rays oh ok so let
me check if the application is a problem
arose as I said hello to Mike so maybe
it is working with a new application
university that you see that my company
that gum and I hope my Microsoft web
application is working well it's that
easy because if you try but to deploy a
Microsoft Application it's a nightmare
for everyone but as you can see why no
it's working well so without Microsoft
itn miss water without the one I
deployed my first web Microsoft
Application okay it's a great app for
mail so that's a good news that's a very
very good news okay and so 16 the main
question is how can i dominate the world
with Quattro okay because finally it's
great I need I don't need to speak to
101 because i'm a developer so i don't
like to speak to a doctor / except you
of course the ice but how can i dominate
the world with gradually that's a main
question okay so i would like to do
something fun with you okay and spell to
just before all the tips i would like to
develop each channel and ass not a web
chat I
3d game ok I would like to develop a 3d
game okay from my laptop to your smart
phone or your computer okay how it's
possible it possible to do it because
it's warm right now is Babylon I don't
know if you know this framework by
building is a JavaScript framework with
Babylon I can developed a sweet game
inside the browser a web browser so
basically tomorrow the games will be in
a web browser okay so me how it's
possible to do that quiz sony go okay oh
maybe I have big mm okay oh if I am
going straight and maybe to open
descriptor not paid coding for fun check
so I'm doing I know I have no idea no
maybe okay this okay yeah just to show
you this bed okay so badly learn it's
very very easy it prints from work so
result okay without another framework
without video only with JavaScript I can
developed a web a sweet game we may just
try okay this is my game again push I am
pushing my game so as you can see it's
very JavaScript so it's only java sweet
i am pushing this game on my platform
application deployed the agenda planned
that quiz which quite informative
platform and we are testing together if
the game is working well a new
smartphone okay don't need services okay
and right opening the game the World
Wide Web
suspense ok as you sprint suspense and
so pudding starting the application so
as you can see it's faster than its
Microsoft up I'm sorry if there is a
microsoft customer microsoft mumble
employees maybe I like you guys so it's
nothing new ok just need to wait a few
seconds more ok quiz is deployed let me
copy the weather there I am in madill ok
and see and I am just testing the code
so up perfect so remember my application
was a clean native application but very
simple with a java script from work so
it was JavaScript only no flash nothing
are you pro did to cultural rain let me
try ok and launch oks be more you can
see my screen ok maybe it's writing
because my internet connection is that
we re very fast maybe i am a i'm
traveling a lot and no more information
so the question is ow can i play ok to
this game against up the question oh you
want to play it when game let me just
click on where a and just focus because
it's very very fast just be focused I am
still though ok maybe not but I am in a
browser so I
okay people in this world you can book
okay let's be due soon as i'm sure it's
slagging very very smooth side and i can
show so again but what I want you are
testing this code once you taste this
app this 3d picture so let me just click
on this Alma and now i open my you can
flash it yeah with your foot flash if
you have the right application flash it
to see this game inside your phone okay
because of the point the point is this
game was on my laptop and two seconds
later i deployed this code to your phone
okay so just take your phone okay or
maybe if you want i am pushing the URL
okay the exit is directly to a well
prove the true let me just okay so if
you are looking for the uln just check
the chat the chat part inside the
dashboard so if you're checking the chat
part you can just click on chat go to
the quiz and see if it's working well
from your site basically you don't need
to set a question okay just click on
create and you can play with it again
okay so this game is why no in
microphone right platform ok so this
game using my laptop few minutes ago and
y know it's on your computer on your
laptop okay and it was very easy because
as you know remember this webinar you
need to ask so your application for we
developed a new application you have to
ask for everything ok so your
application as to be smart ok ask if you
want to use
if you want i don't know maybe to use
exactly a database okay so you have to
ask your application has to ask I all my
view if you want to to know the rain the
data if you want to know if you have to
create a new instance okay your
application as to ask for that oh let me
ask you and you with this treaty up okay
so the police open maybe yes you can so
in this kind of it's crazy because this
application was on my laptop so from my
laptop to your computer it's very very
efficient and as the developer you can
change the world y know so yes a lot of
people can play with it some people
count but they didn't try so it's cheap
such as that's why and thank you for the
answer and no i am not a game i agree
with you i am not a gay male well but
that's it but no just it's not a joke
you know it you just do to explain
tomorrow as you develop our you don't
need to ask to someone something okay as
a developer if you want to deploy if you
want to sell a new game a new
application and you can do it yourself
ok so that's the point that's a very
very important point of this session is
now alone ok without an 01 you do can do
that so that's why it's very very
important from the company's a very
important from the IT manager itn news
writer to understand ok if we don't have
the truth inside your company it's not a
big deal ok we can do outside the
company easily ok right now the power is
for a developer ok the power is back
developers back actually ok so I am done

too slow maybe with the internet
connection
