from DNA app and i'm here with TJ just
before to start the webby now I wanted
to to present a bit be my app because we
are doing webinars but not only that we
are doing lots of events for developers
and startups so if you want to learn
cool cool things and attend cool cool
hackathons and start apt events have a
look on Eva w hat calm and you can
register to the newsletter by clicking
on join the community button TJ today
you're going to talk about native script
yeah okay you're you're gay you're ready
yeah ready to go Fredi for me to share
my screen yeah and just before to start
or so and feel free guys to ask your
questions in the comments section and
we'll do a Q&amp;amp;A session at the end of the
will be excellent all right I you see in
PowerPoint slides here all right i'll go
ahead and get started so I am TJ van tol
I'm just gonna talk to you a little bit
today about native script in angular 2
sort of how angular fits into the native
scripts story as well coming to you
today from the United States from the
great state of Michigan so it's it's
around noon here so sometime around the
beginning of the day and basically what
i'm going to talk about is what native
script is i'm gonna show a quick little
demo i personally think the best way to
sort of see a framework or get an idea
of what it looks like is just see a
little app built in action so that'll be
most of our time today but you want to
take a minute to just quickly tell you
what NATO script is and why you should
really care why she you should bother
listening to the next 40 50 minutes or
so and then if we do have any questions
that come in we'll take whatever time is
left for any outstanding questions or we
always reach out and chat later if you
have anything that you want to continue
chatting about now native scripta I
think the best way to explain what
native script is is to really describe
where it came
from or why why we thought the world
needed yet another JavaScript framework
now the story really starts with a
company called telerik which you may or
may not have heard of we were software
development company really big
especially in the.net space and telework
is where native scripts to got started
somewhere around 3 years ago telerik we
have since been acquired by progress
software so we we fall under the
progress software umbrella so that's why
you'll see this progress branding all
over the place but same basic companies
same basic idea and at telerik and now
at progress we have a lot of experience
in the hybrid development space and what
I mean by hybrid is Apache Cordova
phonegap ionic all of these different
frameworks that build on top of Cordova
and if you're familiar with this
approach to app development the idea is
that you're really getting a best of
both world scenario that is since you
can write using web code with any of
these frameworks you're writing in
things like HTML CSS JavaScript using
frameworks that you're already familiar
with and you get all of this code skill
reuse that you normally wouldn't have if
you're building say natively on Android
or iOS the idea with Cordova is that you
also get this other side of the equation
this hundred percent native access as
well that you get the full access to
device api's and you get this really
rich experience with native feeling apps
and the idea is that with this
architecture that you can really hit the
best of both worlds as as your solution
now at teller cannot progress week I
said we have a lot of experience in the
space we have what's known as the
telerik platform we make a whole bunch
of tooling with hybrid we also have
what's known as our Court of a
marketplace you can go to plugins
telecom essentially we have what I
believe is the largest listing of
Cordova plugins outside of the the main
court of a plug-in listing on their own
website and the reason we did this is
with the telerik platform and with a lot
of the other tooling that we have will
be kept hearing from our customers from
our users is that people increasingly
wanted to get this out of the equation
that they felt limited by hybrid and the
fact that
it's great that you can use this this
web this sort of your web skills your
dom dom skills but that it became
increasingly difficult to get that
native app that you really wanted at the
end of the day a really high pop really
well polished iOS and Android solution
so if you look over our Cordova plug-in
marketplace what you'll find is a lot of
plugins that we built it sort of push
the boundaries of what you could do with
cordova do with a web-based solution so
you'll see things like a native page
transitions plugin for Cordova several
others I encourage you to look through
the list where we're really trying to
push the boundaries but at the end of
the day after sort of experimenting but
this week we found that Cordova with
core over that you can only go so far
ma'am Cordova is at its heart web-based
and if you try to build too many plugins
it gets kind of paki and messy and it
sort of gets away from the core idea of
what Cordova is built off of so native
script started with that premise with
some early prototypes a few years ago
we've launched native script for the
first time last year in March I believe
sometime last year and we've been
building our community up since then now
when a descrip tak chua lee is is first
and foremost it's an open source project
so you can go to github com / nato
script you can see everything we do is
up and available there it's apache2
license so it's very liberally licensed
so you can do what you want with the
framework with native script we're
trying to let you build truly native
mobile apps and I use that word truly
because we are not sort of unlike
Cordova we are not using a web view we
are not using HTML we are not using the
Dom we are building native iOS and
Android user components native interface
this app civ feel native and feel like
they belong on the device but we still
wanted to give you that skill reuse so
you can use things like JavaScript
typescript you can optionally use
angular which will be looking at today
and we use the subset of CSS for styling
your native apps so that's briefly what
NATO script is but since there I mean
nowadays there's a ton of frameworks out
there that you can use to build apps in
and sort of a get to iOS and Android I
thought I'd just very quickly before we
actually dive into a the code of NATO
script just give you five quick reasons
that you should care about NATO script
at all and
of what I feel differentiates native
script from other frameworks that are
out there the first is really
performance that with native script as I
mentioned with some of the backstory
that we really wanted to provide a no
compromise solution we didn't want to
run into some of the restrictions we hit
with Cordova we wanted to give people
the ability to just build the native
apps that you'd expect to have an iOS
and Android and since I think seeing
this sort of a on your device in your
hands is more important than seeing a
few animated gifts here if you look if
you just get out your iOS or Android
phone right now and search for examples
native script in the app stores you can
multitask while watching this and just
sort of get a sense of what NATO script
feels like on your device you can see
the performance for yourself you can
also if you just Google native script
showcases you'll find our showcases page
that has a couple dozen tab set our
community and some of our customers are
built as well if you want to see some
things that weren't built by us so first
is straight up performance the second is
code and skill you so in addition to
give you that performance we still
wanted you to give this give you
essentially as much skill reuse as you
possibly could and so this means with
NATO script you're writing your code in
JavaScript or optionally typescript but
it also means things like using CSS to
actually style native Android and iOS
user user interface components it means
using utility libraries based off of NPM
most of our architecture is built on top
of NPM our plugins are distributed
through NPM which we'll look at in a
minute but we also let you use native
iOS and Android components as well so if
you're not familiar with iOS say they're
sort of equivalent rough equivalent of
NPM is known as cocoa pods it's just a
library of or I should say a collection
of iOS libraries and SDKs you can use in
your app and we let you use those in
NATO script will also let you use
Android libraries from places like
Android Arsenal in other places where
you can get native libraries as well so
that's two one performance two goes into
code reuse the other one is angular and
typescript support
now with NATO script the native script
assertive core was built with typescript
from day one we've always been pretty
big fans of typescript and we think it
especially fits the mobile model when
you're actually building native mobile
apps quite well so we've been using
typescript for a while now the angular
support came later we were actually
sensed since we use typescript and when
angular made their announcement that
they were switching angular which I I
think happened about a year and a half
ago we were pretty interested in that
and we've been working with Google for
the last I think year and a half now to
actually make native script plus angular
a possibility now for those of you that
aren't is familiar with sort of
angular's architecture angular one
shipped with an architecture that was
very much tight or coupled to the
browser into the dom meaning that when
you use angular 1 your solution really
can't live outside of the browser there
are specific Dom API s that are encoded
directly into angular and so some using
angular 1 in something like data script
is just impossible but with angular 2
we've been working with the Google team
to take any of those api's that are
specific to the browser and it's
abstract them out into sort of like a
parent API these platform specific api's
in the way that works is then the
angular team can implement say the
browser platform and encode all the
specific Dom things they need to do to
say like manage a tree of UI components
but then us and native script we can
actually implement those same high level
api's with Android and iOS code so that
you can code once at a higher level with
your UI components and have the ability
to render both for Android and iOS the
web and we'll take a look we'll be
diving into code here in just a second
and we'll actually see what that looks
like in practice now number four or five
and the thing that actually puts the
native in native script is really our
defining feature is that we give you
complete access to the entirety of
Android and iOS now if you look at this
code here I'll give you a minute because
this this can take a while to wrap
head around what's happening here now
the first thing to note is that this
code here is is valid native script code
and you'll see that this is also valid
JavaScript and it's also about
typescript syntax and so these are
semantics you're probably familiar with
if you've done any sort of web
development before however if you were
to take this code and say like paste it
into the chrome devtools or try to run
it in a browser even though the browser
would recognize the semantics it
wouldn't know what this API is because
this is actually an iOS API uialertview
that's used to create essentially the
web equivalent of an alert so what we do
is that we actually inject the entirety
of iOS and Android into the JavaScript
vm that runs NATO script apps and it's
not just iOS it's Android as well so you
can do things like allocate native
objects really anything that's possible
in the native ecosystem we make possible
in native script as well now i'm not
going to go into full details of the the
sort of architecture here and really
dive into how NATO script works if
you're curious you can just Google how
NATO script works I've also got a bitly
link down down here that you can use it
really dives into sort of how we
actually make this possible how we're
able to inject these api's into
JavaScript and also the trickier part of
how we actually make this bridge so that
when this code runs we actually are
instantiating a native object under the
hood but the important thing for today
is this sort of get the the high level
picture is that the reason we did this
this goes back to why we sort of broke
away from Cordova didn't want to go with
that architecture we didn't want to
limit what was possible in your app we
always wanted to give you access that if
something was possible on iOS and
Android we wanted to let you have the
ability to do that now that being said
we also realized that the reason that a
lot of developers especially a lot of
web developers choose to use a framework
like native script is very specifically
for the reason that they don't want to
write code like what you see on the
screen here so it's sort of this weird
dichotomy and that we did want to give
people access
this but we also realize that this
should be an advanced usage scenario if
you have a very specific thing that but
for common things what we do at native
script is that we take these platform
specific API so this example is suppose
you want to allocate a file as part of
your mobile app it's relatively common
thing that you need to do now with the
native script runtime you can do things
like what you see on the bottom of the
screen here so on Android you could type
out new java dot io def file and run
that code for iOS you could use this
sort of verbose monstrosity api that you
see on the bottom of the screen here
which will also allocate a file a time
for iOS but what we do for native script
is that we abstract for for common tasks
we abstract these api zips into
javascript and typescript modules that
abstract these details away for you so
instead of writing this mess you would
instead just import our our file API
from our file system module and then
just allocate a file that way the cool
thing is though these api is that we
writer implemented using what you see on
the bottom of the screen here meaning
that when you actually need to debug or
sort of extend their build upon
something that we do a native script the
source code is is very approachable it's
just a bunch of typescript code you're
not diving into a different language or
dealing some with some weird semantics
and byte code that you're not familiar
with you're staying in typescript where
you may or may not be already fairly
familiar with how that language works
the same mechanism also applies for the
UI as well so much like you type new
file to allocate a file when we take
care of the platform-specific mess you
can do the same sort of thing with UI
components as well and this also works
when angular comes into the picture as
well which we'll look at in a moment now
if you're curious about these modules
what sort of abstractions we have as I
mentioned all this is open-source these
modules are part of the main nado script
repo so it's github com / nato script /
native script if you sort of want of
peru's around as you're looking for this
the UI folder has a lot of goodies in
there too so you can look around
our native script plugins also build
upon what's possible that you don't see
currently in this list and we'll look at
NATO script plugins here in a minute
that was four or five I got one more
reason you might want to use native
script and then we'll actually move on
to demo just my favorite part of this
and the last point is is something that
I kind of mentioned already but that
native script is fairly made your
engineering effort by a major software
company so I feel need to mention this
because in today's sort of crazy
JavaScript world where framework can
sort of come and go every day and you
should know that progress is a major
company we're I think we're almost I
don't think we're quite 2,000 people but
we're fairly large a global company the
native script core team is something
like two dozen people and there's a
bunch of other people that are involved
in native script in some sort of
supplementary role as well through
things like sales marketing and that
sort of thing this Lots times leads to
the question of okay if if progress is
making this and it's free and open
source then how does the company
actually make money off of the product
and so I'll show you a few quick things
for that so we have what's known as UI
for native script so we sell premium UI
components so if you you're building a
native script app and you need some
really rich charts you need pie charts
line charts there's a few other
components in here as well we will sell
those to you we also have Enterprise
Support so if you work for a larger
company what's often these big companies
want some sort of support backing so
they know that they'll have some help
when sort of things go wrong and we also
have what's known as the telerik
platform which is some premium tooling
and things that you can use them sort of
a back-end is a service analytic some
other things that you can add to your
native script app as well now I won't
really be talking about any of these
premium things today really everything
in NATO script is truly completely free
and open source you didn't have to pay
us anything to go out to the app stores
for anything like that so everything
i'll be showing is completely free open
source part of that distribution so with
that out of the way I don't know are
there any existing questions that have
come in since
since we started here otherwise I'm
going to go ahead and move over to the
demo I'll go ahead and get that ready
say I don't see any in the comments
right now if any others come in i'll go
ahead and tackle them else i'm just
going to go ahead and keep going here so
um I'm actually gonna then build up a
small native script app from scratch
here just to give you an idea of what
actually using native script feels like
let me clear this up here the first
thing to know about native script is
that if you actually interact you you
build and work with your native script
app from a command-line interface which
is what I have open here I've got open
my terminal on imac native script also
works just fine on linux and windows you
also work from the command line there
just one small not've on linux and
windows because you're actually building
native apps you're unable to build iOS
apps on those platforms just because you
need to have a mac in order to build and
compile we're using xcode under the hood
on iOS so you can build Android and
Windows and Linux but you'll need to
have a mac in order to develop for iOS
the vanator script nato script
command-line interface is built on top
of em p.m. so i would npm install native
script actually installed a COI once
I've done that I'll have a NATO script
command and also the shorthand TNS
command which is just short for telerik
native script in is a little shorthand
that makes dealing with your
applications just a little bit easier
you use the TNS create command they
actually scaffold out an app so if I
wanted to build a quick hello world app
I could do that here but for the
purposes of our today and I'm just
grabbing my code over here I've already
scaffolded out a little app it'll save
us a little bit of time so we can get
straight to the point of what building
an 80 script app actually feels like so
this little sample app is called
groceries and I've got a couple things
that i'll be adding into this app as we
go at a high level this is the folder
structure of a native script app the
couple things I want you to pay
attention to is first of all you'll note
the package that JSON and node modules
folder now if you've built with NPM
before if you've worked with no j/s
before
if you just sort of consume them ham
libraries and as part of some front-end
project you're probably familiar with
these conventions but with native script
we try to embrace sort of existing node
and NPM infrastructure and workflows as
much as possible so you can see that
really all of your configuration of your
app is just in your package.json file
you manage your dependencies in this
file as well the core of native script
the nato script modules that we looked
at earlier come from here I've got a few
native script plugins that I'll show in
a minute that I'm bringing in as well
and you can see most of my dependencies
here actually angular and I'll also
mention quickly that we we're not
altering angular in any way specifically
angular for the most part just plays in
quite nicely the magic that sort of
integrates native script wit angular
happens is part of this naked netted
native script angular plugin that you
see here but the key thing to know is
that really your building a pot on top
of semantics that you already know if
you've done knowed before or the very
least the you're using reusable skills
so the things that you learn is part of
sort of managing your dependencies in
such in NATO script you can reapply to
things like no door utility management
in any of your front end applications
now the other two folders to pay note to
our app and platforms now what platforms
has is your actual Android and iOS sort
of native apps so if you've built for
native Android before you might
recognize things like your Gradle file
and some of your configuration files
that live in here for iOS you'll notice
things like your Xcode project and all
the little various utilities and such
that you need to build an iOS app and
this is where they live in native script
but the cool thing is is that would need
a script we really treat these things is
generated code for the most part you can
see that I'm actually ignoring these
platforms from source control all
together and just generating them as I
need them instead I'm doing most of my
work in the app folder which is sort of
the the crux of where your application
is and if you're familiar with angular 2
at all you can know that it sort of
follows angular tues model as well of
where your source code lives
now at a high level what the native
script CLI is actually going to do when
it builds your app is it's going to
create an a native app an Android or iOS
native app and then it'll take this year
code from your app folder inject it into
the appropriate spots in the platform's
folder which is cool for a couple
different reasons but I'll show you a
nap just to give you an idea now before
we got started today I scaffold it out a
super simple I actually ran this app I
can show you from the command line you
use the Tina to run command to actually
build and deploy your app so I ran this
thing both for iOS to get this emulator
up here and i also got it going for
android so i've got these both chillin
out here and let me move these over a
little bit so we can seem a little bit
side-by-side now one of the things that
i guess the main reason this
architecture where app changes get sort
of descent into the platforms folder is
that when you actually want to change
your app so let me bring up the code
that actually builds this so this is an
angular 2 applications they don't worry
too much about the angular 2 syntax here
i won't talk about angular too much
during this talk just cuz i think
probably better places to learn angular
2 and I'm instead going to focus how
angular 2 sort of fits into the native
script story but this is sort of your I
mean it literally is your hello world of
angular where you're actually building a
component that just has a simple label
that's outputting this hello world
change here and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to use the lie sync command
that made of script ships with that is
actually going to set up a little water
with this watch flag that's going to
watch for changes that I make to my app
folder you can see I haven't made
anything changes yet and when it detects
this change it'll actually save this
code in this case its type script code
so it'll also compile this type script
file into JavaScript code and then
transfer that code or live sync it if
you will into the platforms folders that
your actual native app updates making
your development workflow pretty fast so
let me go ahead and update this I'll get
a little more excited about native
script pretty excited already
and this will take a second just because
it takes a little while for the the CLI
to first get the watcher up and running
because it's going to watch for type
script code as well and we'll see should
take just a second um I think it it
synced once with the initial change let
me get a little more excited because I
think I picked up on the first change i
made when i updated the file and it
should sync here in a second so we can
see this change ios and android or we'll
be racing here yep and so there's
android with the exclamation parts and
normally iOS follows a second or so
behind and there's the change there as
well no I think why this is cool is if
remember here that the comparison is
building with native iOS and native
Android applications which normally to
actually update iOS and Android apps
that you have to go through a full build
cycle because you're dealing with actual
byte code but with native script where
we're building native UI components and
I'll get into what this actually means
here in a second you're building native
UI components but you're doing so with
what feels like a very web like workflow
where you make your changes and the
changes just go ahead and update in your
emulators pretty quickly usually takes
about a second or two deck update both
for iOS and Android now in terms of the
user interface I just got a label here
let me paste in something that is
slightly more complex here just give me
a second and we'll paste this in so we
can see a little more complex of an
example let me move this over so you
have a little more screen real estate to
deal with here now if you've worked with
angular queue before and most of this
code is actually going to look fairly
familiar to you in terms of how we build
user interfaces with angular 2 the big
difference is obviously in this template
on the web you would type something like
a button sign in rather than this button
that you see here now the reason we take
this sort of approach in native script
is what we're doing is each of these you
components you see in your template
szostak layout text field button we're
actually implementing these api's with
native code so what you see here both on
Android and iOS these aren't that
there's no web view these aren't Dom
components that you're seeing here
you're seeing a uibutton and Android
that widget that button on the screen
and if we go into that modules code that
I talked about earlier which is
somewhere down here UI button if we
looked at the iOS implementation for a
minute you can get an idea of just
roughly how this works so when this
button actually gets instantiated based
off this angular template what's going
to happen is that we're actually
instantiating a UI button under the hood
this is the code that's actually going
to run and generates what you're seeing
over here the cool thing about native
script is that's really completely
transparent to you you just type button
and you just let native script take care
of how this actually renders out on iOS
and Android as well so that's UI
component so I want to get a little bit
further into this so my first example
was the UI but of course this app looks
pretty ugly this is not particularly
interesting so I'm going to show very
briefly here how you actually style your
native script apps so I'm going to add
two things in here the first is I added
an app that CSS file and I added some
CSS rules that will talk about here in a
minute and then I also added some style
URLs to my component angular 2 supports
styling based styling you're at both it
really like a global level and then also
at a component level and just showing
very quickly how that can work so these
are rules that apply to my entire
application essentially and then this is
a rule these are rules that in these
files that apply just to this little
login component that I have here now if
you look at this actual CSS file here
you'll see that semantically again this
should look fairly familiar this is CSS
in the sense that you use selectors you
use brackets you define you define
actual rules as main value pairs in your
I also this should look pretty familiar
if you've worked with CSS before now
some things might look unfamiliar the UI
components that we use but language-wise
thinks should be fairly similar so you
can use element selectors to actually
select the tag names that you see in
your components you can use CSS class
names you can use IDs you can use
descendant selectors all these other
type things that you may know from CSS
now the one big difference is in how
these actually work remember how I said
earlier that there is no browser here so
there is no like this isn't like the
equivalent of going into the chrome
devtools and saying no the background
color is white here there's actually a
native control a component that's
controlling this page so again what
we're doing here is that what native
script does is parse this CSS file I'm
using some just existing open source CSS
parsers and for each of these rules is
we take these and actually apply the
native equivalent of each of these
things so there's a native equivalent of
how you apply background color to a UI
component on iOS and the same and
Android and that's really where the
heavy lifting is happening on the native
script side of things now what that also
means is that this isn't a complete CSS
implementation that you see here so even
though you can do things like background
color and font size certain CSS rules
just aren't possible to replicate in
native iOS and Android and some of them
just sort of present some major
performance issues or that it's it's not
really a good idea to make certain
especially layout things possible from
CSS and replicate those in native iOS
and Android so instead if you look at
this template and I can show it again
here real quick it was log in that HTML
you'll see things like a stack layout
and grid layout and special layout tags
that we have that lets you lay out your
UI components that you have in your amp
but do so in a way that a we can
actually make work on iOS and Android
and be work in a performant manner so
that you're not actually getting slowed
down by some heavy math that's going on
in our end
so that is CSS we got a couple more
things I'm going to add a few more
things to this app just so you can we
can get it to the point that it's it's
somewhat fully functional so the next
thing I'm going to add here let's go
ahead and toss in one more version of
this app is I'm going to actually add
some logic to this I'm going to make the
user able to log into this application
and at the moment I'm just sort of
hard-coding in that if this works just
toss up a lil alerts though that you can
see things work and we'll come over here
so you can see this happen but the
reason I show this example is the way I
have this app architected that I've
created this shared folder and which
shared in this context means is that
I've written this code in this area of
the application in a way that's not
specific to my user interface at all for
instance this login service is in user
and there's this login function here and
I'm I'm actually using this to
authenticate hit I hit my backhand a
little post this is just some some
generic angular 2 code but because this
actually is it's sort of you I agnostic
there's there's nothing that says update
this user interface or anything like
that I'm able to use this service in my
native app so i can use it on android i
can use it on iOS i should see an alert
over here but it also means that this
same code is something that i can
directly use as part of my web apps as
well and actually if i look at this
application this is the fix the screen
here this is the web version of my
groceries app and what I'm actually
doing in this web implementation is I'm
using this exact code you see here
completely verbatim is part of my web
app now again to go back to what we said
earlier the reason this is possible is
that in the in the negative appt i
should say in the web app angular is
actually implementing this HTTP API and
they're doing it with web api so that
you'll see something like XML HTTP
requests and all the various API is that
go into making that possible so what we
did with native screen
is weary implemented the entire xml HTTP
you pap I and I think it's at sexy xhr
we implemented this in the entire
interface of it but did so with Android
and iOS native code instead so what that
means to you though again as an end user
of angular 2 and of native script is
that you can code the angular 2 api's in
this case the HTTP API and get code at
the end of the day that works both in
your native apps so native iOS and
Android apps but also though in your web
apps as well which i think is pretty
cool so with that out of the way let's
back out of this I want to did you do do
do gotta got about 10 more minutes here
that we're gonna chat about native
scripts find my mouse again and the next
thing so we've owned it over how to
build UI components how to make them
look halfway decent with our CSS
implementation how to build some
back-end logic the next thing to chat
about is actually how to do routing and
let me paste in one more example so we
can see how this actually works and
switch over to answer right here now
what I changed here is I just made the
be this login call when it comes back
instead of alerting some nonsense I'm
now actually navigating to another page
and again this is just angular 2 this is
how angular 2 works but the one thing
that's different is if I go to where I'm
actually declaring my router here um I
think it's this app routes here yep get
this out of the way now I am especially
when we get into this this sort of
co-chairing idea where you can share
code between web and native apps running
is a little bit of a unique beast in
that routing just tends to work
differently on Android and iOS a native
you have things like a hardware back
button on iOS you can do the like swipe
to go back gesture and those things
really don't exist on the web but at the
same time
on the web you have things like a URL
you have a refresh button the back
button you have a hash that can appear
in the URL things that they're really no
direct equivalent of in the native world
so what we've chosen to do for our
implementation is that we again let you
code to the same angular API so we're
we're not really changing angular's
api's all together but instead we
provide this little extension you can
see that normally if you're building an
angular q web app you router method from
angular router and what we've done is
we've just wrapped that call so that by
coding to our actual api's you can use
the same basic approach with angular 2
but let us take care of the sort of
heavy lifting when it comes to how to
make routing work on Android iOS so in
this case I'm just routing simply
between a login page and available like
grocery management this is code that is
again being used but essentially
verbatim other than this one little
change where I have to essentially hell
NATO script that I need a little bit of
help making the router work between
native and web apps but pretty cool
pretty cool to be able to use angular
for this as well because again it's
important to think just to take a step
back that you are building truly native
apps here this this is a completely
native Android app this we also have a
completely native iOS app and normally
to get to this point where you have a
functional login screen we're using a
bunch of these native UI components
you're not only building two completely
separate code bases one with iOS swifter
objective-c another with Android or Java
so it is pretty powerful to be able to
code to one API and get to both of these
ecosystems at the same time with that in
mind I've got two final examples here
and then we'll start to wrap up because
even though I've talked a bit about
co-chairing I've showed a little bit of
how you can share code between web
innate of apps and I do you think that's
pretty cool I think it's important to
note that if you're going to go through
the hassle of building a native app
because building a native app isn't
really easy
better what technology you really use if
you're going to do it you should really
take advantage of the fact that your
billing for native I mean native devices
are capable of a whole lot of things
that I mean if you just look at this app
I've added a few little things like you
have a native share widget sharing is
just built into your native app you have
pulled a refresh so if i go over i've
got it hooked up into the SAP I need
let's see what it would other fruit die
of I could do some limes so if I add an
item to my list on the web well the
Refresh can be a little bit of a pain to
implement on the web I native it's
really just a quick switch on the native
controls it's something that's really
quite easy to implement I could also
make depending on my use case I could
make this an N a scroll lists i could
add some like swype actions there's all
sorts of things I can do that since I'm
using native that I guess the potential
is so much higher and some of that I
might i'm going to add to less things to
this application the first thing i'm
going to do is I'm going to go back to
my app that CSS file and one thing that
we added in one of our recent releases
was support for CSS animations so again
you can see that this code and I think I
might have to mature if I have to turn
that coat on or not um you can see that
this impacts feels exactly like CSS web
animations where you're defining an
animation name and you've got keyframes
going here and other things as well so
it feels fairly familiar but remember
that you're dealing with native
applications here so what is I guess
what is possible or what the device is
capable of is just significantly higher
because you're not dealing with the Dom
you're animating completely native iOS
and Android user interface controls and
what i'll be doing i just had to restart
my singer because I broke it is that I'm
going to be taking a background image
will see a background image appear in
the back here I'm just going to scale it
you can see I'm switching from a really
scaled in view and I'm gonna back it out
and switch to a I really zoomed in view
which will add a nice little effect to
this login screen and you can see that
it'll feel pretty polished and hopefully
should work here on Android and iOS they
get sinking
yep so you can see it on android start
to build in that change here and then
you'll see it on iOS happen here as well
but again I showed this just a show you
could push the boundaries and a
background sort of a break on change
isn't exactly groundbreaking so to
hopefully iron there put that point
what's what's the phrase I'm looking
forward to to really hammer that point
home I think that's the saying I'm
supposed to use one of our major script
community members wrote this explosion
plug-in which first of all pretty
awesome name and also very descriptive
name because the plug-in does exactly
what you would think it would do and
that it makes things explode so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take this
login screen here currently it is just
logging people in which is kind of
boring so instead I'm going to have it
queue up cue up a series of explosions
and make some of these things on the
screen actually blow up now I'd like to
show this just to remind you that we are
dealing with bytecode here you're not
dealing with the web so which you know
what you build with this sort of
solution the the bar is just so much
higher in terms of what you can do so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
make some things blow up you'll see this
will blow up this blows up as well and
you'll see in a second the entire
application will blow up which of course
there's there's no api you could really
use to do this in the web there's no
equivalent of this sort of thing
existing um and what's cool about NATO
script is that anything you've seen like
if you've seen an iOS or Android app
that does something you know that you
can do that in native script because
you're dealing with native code and
because all of the native api's are
available and just to give you a sense
of that so let me back this out so we're
dealing with normal code in here um like
in this app for instance I'm viewing a
couple of small little tweaks to the
status bar because I wanted this to
tweak the status bar to look a little
bit differently and I just have some
really quick coated in there to do that
um I have some code and hated just sort
of play with the colors of the hints I
prefilled this but if I back this out
item code change the appearance of X I
didn't quite like it all these these
small little tweaks
and through using native script plugins
which is what some of these things that
my pull-to-refresh was a plug-in
explosion field was a plug-in you can
really greatly expand upon the sort of
native things that you can do if we look
at the explosion plugin in particular
sorry I'm just bringing this up here
because I screwed that up you can see
the real power in that this is the
plug-in in its entirety and all it's
doing is just using an existing Android
library it's just bringing in that
library and calling its API and that's
really all this plug-in needed to do to
make things blow up on the screen and if
you're interested show a couple other
things here and if you want to get an
idea of what plugins they're out there
you can go to native script that rocks
and there's a little plugins link here
and you can get a sense of just how much
excuse me do with native script the sort
of things that you can build you can see
if you need an autocomplete if you need
different loaders if you need to
integrate with as your geolocation all
sorts of things that you can do you just
I guess I just show this just to give
you a sense of the scale of the number
of existing solutions that are out there
you can also go to NPM remember our
plugin system is built on top of em p.m.
so you can just head here in search for
native script and you'll find I think
we're over 300 things now so mpm sort of
raw certs the native script rock site is
a little more of a curated look at the
plugins that are out there and available
and with that that's most of I wanted to
show today if you're at all interested
in this M this this demo was pretty
short I just try to give you a brief
idea of what you're dealing with with
native script our website is made of
script org if you do want to check out
native script further if you really want
to dive in and and learn the framework a
little more if you click this getting
started link here and there's there's
two buttons to tutorials that we have
available for learning native script and
it's really the best place to get
started if you do want to use native
script with typescript and angular as we
were showing today this tutorials where
you'd want to start if angular is not
your thing
native script where as a library we're a
fairly low levels so you can just use
vanilla JavaScript as well and we have
lots of users that do that so if that's
something that sounds more appealing you
go ahead and try out our JavaScript
tutorial to get started finally if you
have other questions so if if you have
any questions for me today I'll take a
minute here in a second and will will
answer me those for you but if you're
seeing this later you can always reach
out to either me or native script on
twitter our twitter handle is as you
might expect native script and we watch
this account pretty closely if you ask
any questions there we should be able to
help you out you can also join us on our
community slack channel so if you just
look for an 82 script community slack
you should be able to find this but our
community slack is fairly active I hang
out and they're most of the core team
members are on there periodically and we
try to help out the community we've got
a pretty active group there it's a great
place when you're getting started with
NATO script to ask questions sort of
bounce ideas of people to see where to
go and with that I think that's all I
have I guess I'll thank you again for
for having me are there any other
questions that came in I think that was
the end of my slide deck ok Thank You TJ
and so yes if you have any questions
please use the comment section in the
YouTube page to to ask it I'm gonna let
you a few seconds to do it and during
this I want you to tell you guys that we
are with searching for people could be
interested in talking about any topic to
during your webinar so if you guys feel
comfortable with with any kind of
technology and you think that could be a
relevant powerful for webinar feel free
to send an email to lu lu l owe you at
be my herb calm and and she she can
arrange a webinar with you and something
else so I talk to you in to you before
the web now about
what the map is doing so we're good to
have a look on even study not calm and
two if you want to receive the
newsletter join the community and
tomorrow we can have another webinar
about Johnny Five jsm walk allowing
developers to make IOT stuff so if you
guys are interested in that also it's
gonna be tomorrow at at six-thirty
european time I guess so let me refresh
the page to see if there are some
questions okay TJ there there's no
question for the moment but but feel
free may even after the women out who to
post your questions and TJ can can
respond to eat it later on yep okay bed
and youtube channel and and Twitter
we're pretty active there so feel free
to reach out okay thanks a lot today and
see you soon yeah thanks for having me
