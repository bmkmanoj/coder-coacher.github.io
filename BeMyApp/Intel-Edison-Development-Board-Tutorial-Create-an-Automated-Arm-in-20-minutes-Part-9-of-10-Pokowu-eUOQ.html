the copy movement functionality will
have to build the second robotic arm so
let's get started we are going to
explain quickly the codes to recover the
movement so we edit the code we can see
here the 4 / clone when we call it we
want to make a copy we'll put s3 to say
that we're going to put the motors in
freewheel at least we can move them
manually once it's done we can use the
clone copy function that is going to do
it s too so it will ask all the
positions of all the motors once we have
all the positions we receive the right
to buy call back the on data so on data
this is going to call on read then we
are going to parse the message and we're
going to get the data that's going to be
the angle of the motor with its ID then
we said it's going to go back to the
other Edison so here it its IP that we
had at the very beginning now move all
because when we send the six of them at
the same time now it's time to test the
code upload it on the board when we move
the first arm we can see the second one
copying the movement of the first arm
the series is almost over but we're not
done yet now we're going to test out all
the other functionalities and review
everything we did so far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
