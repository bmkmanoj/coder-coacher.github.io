our settings this always get complicated
because we have for the people who has
more experience without fragments which
is basically awake when glow the
different personality we think one
activity whether slight excess that we
gonna when we have taken on an
application which have working sense
that something really useful if you see
here on the link i have a beacon working
sets well for angry and here you are 400
projects another one for blackberry
another one for demos whatever in this
is spring we can set up a default
launcher icon for our application with
Soviet like one with we are using by
default from angry we will probably want
to create our own one and if we choose
to create an activity with have
different options to create one we can
create one completely block that means
yester basically yeah with no content
inside a full screen one basically we
remove our action bar is a thing we have
above the application that allows us to
move through the different options of
the avocado or master detail flow that
has something to see with the fragments
you can see here we have on the left
side one list where we can technically
display some options and the bright side
we will typically pain the content we
have selected on the left side it's a
lot to see with tablet so basically the
idea is among other since we develop
applications that we can use universally
an angry device is not only for given
for phones not only for tablets I felt
really won't forget fear created that's
because I'm a little bit tricky and I
will has Peter
because some classes that them i'm going
to use through the fruit play this is
how one standard application looks when
it has been created with about source
okay here we will store aware because we
are programming for the application we
have a folder for gen 4 from generated
and basically here we are generating
some files automatically that we will
use to access the resources for example
if we have let's see some indices which
represents the icons or colors or
whatever we access them through a file
called air the journalist with important
and redevelopment that creates a
connection between the code and the
resources to break the modelview pattern
we also have since 1817 I would say this
file called bill confi which allows us
to create two configurations if we are
developing an application we sometimes
want to come at a bad note or after tax
amount that means when we are testing
the application we probably want to
attack our database on a production mode
so from here we can control each kind of
environment are we using we also have
some more stuff those folders just
include the yard files and using in this
case angry cotillard is inside API from
Android and the support library that's
the library we are mainly use it for
well you're really familiar with the
fragmentation problem somebody knows
about it or annex play in 10 seconds
fragmentation lots of versions lots of
devices exactly so we have a lot of
devices still on to point something
obviously in to point whatever we
support different things as we support
in 3.0 or 4.0 the last version is 4.3
jelly bean and well as a curiosity we
have more devices we done
2.2 as devices with Windows Phone so the
problem here takes a few statements and
if you're used to program with iphone
beside which is pretty much okay program
a universal app which is not a run on
all the devices none we will face a lot
of problems oh yeah so that's one of the
reasons why we would use this tantric
support library we have android
dependencies if we assist any android
project if we are including or any java
know yet if we are including libraries
with what we use that include different
functionality the libraries will be
added here and yeah we'll have some
folders catalytically assets eyes when I
want to include some artistic resources
for example a class I can include them
here in that's pretty much a temporary
folder that is rewritten every time I
combine the application I'm creating the
executable files lips what I include all
the ER source files and grace which
stands for resources here I can see all
the bits are pretty much in axis also
layouts which are pretty much the files
what I would write the appearance of my
activities of my applications under if
you don't have experience photos well or
at least these separations attends to
the model-view-controller the idea that
we should have the representation of the
files on an external file and we already
haven and all the models on the other
files programming them by using our code
some of these files are automatically
generated when we create an application
for example extremes serves to create a
multi-language application we can see we
have these values here we have an
extreme token called happening and here
we have a representation of is a string
how it works just very fast if for
example I would like I want to create
the I want to internationalize this
application for german i will create a
folder named called Valley Venus de
which song is lea stands for going
by cooking here the 5s dreams of XML I
could sit here for example to the coat
rack huh and when the device is well
when I'm combining the application the
device automatically will look for all
their folders I half and when I when it
finds the folder that corresponds to the
device language it will get a string or
that were stars form a nice or
dimensions for anybody that I want to
use on my application if I cannot find
one which corresponds to my language I
will go to the default one which is just
slash values so let's gonna start a
little up the androidmanifest that's
prolly a little bit important okay the
androidmanifest ass is like would say
the controller of the application we
have some shortcuts here to access wrong
techniques but i think it's not morgy if
I just saw it from the up from here so
we assembly some properties for the
application that are going to be pretty
useful like the person code that means
which is a sequential number that
specifies the coat the version of my
application when we have load 1 verse
into the market this has to increasing
at least one so it not being to the
three whatever and this one will be the
version name that is gonna be so power
users own data for the application it
can also be alphabetical like 1.0 also
please candidate whatever those are the
values we established before when we
were creating the application and here
there are a few of language will turn
out to be relevant afterwards so I'm
going to remove this one lady or I will
leave it here when I create an activity
which is this a concept or this viewing
so before it has to be declared here if
not it will not
able to run in the device so I'm having
one over here and i'm going to create an
activity to begin with the application
right now I only have a few classes i
have created before xml parser I don't
know if you're familiar with X in a
language you're here I guess so since I
didn't want it to create it life this is
a pretty much a basic passer prendre
that can gets the XML from the from an
address and we specify and can't get
some things like the dom element that
means the top element of external
document and i can get there is for
forex of the nodes of the application so
first with control in control and i can
create a i can open design look to
select i wanna create and i'm going to
select plus delta plus so it will be on
these packets also i personally creates
always on a new package lists all the
activities is something personal and i
will call it named activity that's
always a personal decision of each of
you an activity has to extend from
activity which is one of the android
classes and by clicking you see that
there is a error mark here that means
that i have two important application we
can over with the mouse and then
clicking here but if you like a sore
thumb as i click in common Oh for
comments if oh yeah we automatically
import the classes we are missing that's
pretty useful when we are like a copy
copy pasting from the internet and we
need to import a lot of ink 03 very good
string whatever okay so I'm gonna like
fear the others I'm going to make a
really sort xml analyzer downloading
from a web service i can download song
information about being says i will take
them on a leash you and then i will show
you have to open access to the list view
and I need to the events etc so the
address is something like Andre
okay this is basically an Elohim
including all the all this information
we have a good element continue I'm from
the same in there are hanging so this
even has an i-beam has a name as a cost
the price of the margarita is very
expensive for being here as and a
description of the of the pizza so first
we need to reduce government in order to
import is in our application so to do
this we are going to create the first we
have an athlete a constant which is
going to be the name of the URL and
we're also going to create a few more
attributes do you have any question at
any time or you wanna ask why i am doing
we just see clouds so here I wouldn't
start that Ethan
what I'm doing is creating constants so
I could do this just hard coating on the
code but my intention is to I festival
this elements to transfer some time and
a greater cut first and I have
description
what if you want to attend to more I
always like to get some information
about federal faculty applications
biasing circuit so we can for example
click I think it was common severe slope
anniversary to comment box in here and
as you can see now this madness
highlighted that means that I can modify
it like writing and it will be reflected
on the entire code for example I can do
factor entire classes function names and
I they are using different activities
like will change them very easily and we
said that's gonna be a description okay
so we have a custom we have this trip
sent people okay in order to make the
application work all the Android
applications need to override a method
from activity somebody that uses android
can say which one it is the most
important if exactly we create here
these men is very useful by the way if
you go to be fucked over right implement
methods you can access to all the all
the metals from being a parent activity
you have up as you can see a lot of them
is almost impossible to remember all of
them horowitz activities are today
because they need or whatever so this is
always at a really high flexion and rick
has a life cycle that means that we will
have this method song create on destroy
home play composite view when I have
nothing from it more information about
this I think
here and this is something really
important to control because um
sometimes we we about application will
be closing is another application will
be popping up we will be able to sit in
a call getting messages i'm waiting to
control how this is gonna work so yasin
we starve on activity we will call the
method oncreate then on start undressing
and the activity will be running so go
through all those three methods there is
some more explanation on how they get
destroyed how they get pals how they get
a stop there is the bar between
destroyed or they are debts are memories
sounds really important for performance
and okay we have this method oncreate we
are going to create the an XML parser
the one we have before if you want to
access without a complete it works with
a control and his face so the yeah
excelent you know the different
possibilities I can access from my cabin
code and I will call it xml parser and i
will call it to the constructor by going
to the constructor I make sure that your
gate will not see me know so I can
access all its different properties is
one of the main mistake we are
developing with angry we don't call the
constructor I would get with you know
that we will not be able to access all
its methods so we are going to first get
let's see if we can get the XML from
number of you okay I'm going here again
with control blues space and trying to
get up there different methods from the
from the subject I will get an external
from URL that semester that it's here in
the file xml parser but right now we are
putting into not how it works and i'm
gonna make us ezel
very mins we'd love di can paint of the
lockdown which is one of the debugging
tools for android if the content of
festivities really useful when we wanna
see we're gonna see what is happening I
call it here first parameter is the
title nor Gaeta second parameter is the
string what a pain and I'm gonna import
log with the comment i saw you before
and by executing
I will execute this as an Android
application oh it's prolly gonna fail we
decided an update on the Android
manifest where I am fine that's anybody
that has a experience with the American
lasers yes yep everything yeah fail so i
will try it again it's not the most SPD
scene so you would probably want to use
some real device or some other solutions
like any motion which had my native
developers for native malaika's for
android
yeah that's anybody knows what's
happening this is the manifest and this
is my main activity that's between one
of the reasons the other ones I also
that i'm not using a danger my
permission and i'm trying to establish
an internet connection introduces a
really good eous system you will not
start the singing i use which is
basically a system that allows us to set
up which reduces our application season
a happy the tries to give some security
to the android play starts and you know
there is no aggravation process so you
could technically unload some malware or
upload some program which is gonna steal
something from your phone so by using
this system kind of we prevent or at
least we give the user the last
abilities are you say last barrier
against malware he always has to click
and I accept this or or not so if i go
to the manifest section permissions i
have a few of them i can go to acts
internet other missing internet and i
will be able to now connect to the
internet so i will keep on being here as
that- it i'm probably when I have the
same exception again but Australia an
advanced topic to explain so
yeah well basically an Troy doesn't
allow either to execute request from the
main street so I normally have to create
different tweets in order to create
application I'm first gonna cry the
entire code and I will later included
within a difference with ok i will stir
in the xml though the stream i'm going
to get us a response from the web
service which will be pretty much this
one from here and then i need to parse
it so i don't know if you have any of
you have experience with a pass email
XML elements on Jana nope well if you
have android is pretty much the same if
you don't have the students with android
java is pretty much a straight forward
not exactly the same stuff you things
are changing but yes soon as we are
so like calling
this I will act as the list basically
the intermediate objects that allows me
to access the the XML elements then I
could create the no please I have here
some of the code because I didn't
remember this exactly
i'm going to import notice as well
development sorry elements
there you go okay then on not least as
you can imagine is a list of elements I
will need to eat at it sue them to the
entire unit and I will get the elements
one by one so it has to be smaller and I
will increase the unity one okay then
what I want to do is create in a plasma
and I will be stirring the by units were
like pears be aiming with a
representation name with its
representation because we did
representation I blame them later on a
list so for this case the first map has
to be a husband a club does anybody
doesn't know about the hot Maggie's so
I need to import as much nice importance
i have created my class map and utilizes
one of the tricks i also like a lot for
eclipse is in case you have for example
you can have this pretty much move the
window kind of order with a common a you
can select the entire class and with
comment me you can order it so that's
also pretty nice when your copy paste in
an entire flight from from internet
comment 60 again so i would be able to
import my elements in this case the
class element is failing and i have to
import this one is very tiny problem or
we can the item is the yd value key item
here game now my sissy
yeah you're right it's a pkt them and
Ethan should be here and I should cover
ki d including that yep doesn't give me
a lot yeah the right thing ok so i will
import my element and now we needs
enemies like we'll be able to pretty
much to access all be well for all the
different items i will be able to access
their all the beef right now there is a
type of habit side if you don't use this
control a space that you can see is
really very nice and very first to
complete the code so you can put a live
in the defense of a half of the time do
you spend working with with application
okay here you can a bloody money what
I'm doing and these yeah i'm going to
take each of those elements and i'm
going to insert them without within the
key map so
one for the key name one we're here
because
um another one for the key this so now
that has my basic of all the different
elements
and now i'm going to create an a variety
of her snap that means i'm gonna get all
those has maps that I'm creating and i
will insert Infanta within an ArrayList
yep yep except one thank you ok so my
list is going to be of the type Kozma
the string yeah you'll be celebrating
with all the scenes forgetting why
putting one more my list it will be a
new arraylist basically you having me
with our Ivy's you can understand it as
a release the clasp elements one above
it so there is no particular order for
them up this is not completely true but
for the we are going today it's close
enough so when we have a finish with a
hashmap we have to add it to the Rileys
we have been before and at this point we
should have realized that means our list
of elements with hot laps that means a
hazmat that has a mapping of all the
elements from be with average from the
xml so now we want to add it to our list
so we will create well first one of the
things is that there is one important
fashion an android which extend content
view to this function we can call
you see this error file I told you
before this is actually gonna act as a
connection between my resources on my
phone I will import condos Rick adult
remote calculator and what I'm going to
do here is accessing to this layout
called me which is basically one the
graphical representation of an activity
here we see that we are going to have a
listening and it's obviously easily we
will be thanking all we already fun
elements this is the way we have to
access all the resources trouble but it
could be error does layout that main
whatever air that extreme if we're gonna
act as a Texas cream and waiting to
install the wings can see the layout
sorry there at least 4 12 and contains I
creating a lease adapter there is a
whole lesson we could learn on how to
create / customizable adapters and some
staff atty synthesis hello I said before
today okay i will explain this
the spanish keyboard when a good man
physical one always know where other
things
and this is the way I have to send the
content to my adapter
I'm forgettin somethin Umbridge sewer
now it says work cool so basically when
I have my list i will have to create an
adapter this adapter is an infield and
intermediates between my data and my
visualization and the way I have to
create it is in from here google easier
to see the dancing okay i always have to
send this in anger it means pretty much
context that mean that means the exactly
the contest be a scenario where we are
dealing with our application may arrive
list it's going to be the advice i have
created before with all the content i
have a happy nagging inside this is the
layout i'm going to be using for each of
those elements as always we have this
before with herpes air element layout
that we speak them I mean we open it we
can see that the basically pcs specify
the description of how it's gonna be one
single row of the table we will have a
linear layout linear you're basically
means that we are gonna put a lower
elements on a linear order we will have
a textview including a which is going to
be the name another one behind which is
going to be the description and then
another light linear layout of this on a
road here having two more wise which are
the costs well the string X at six ghost
and then the actual ghost of the other
pizza so we get nothing done missing a
parenthesis or
no this one too many great we're
gradually
sorry yeah this is how it sorry you know
I don't need this one is okay so I
talked with my adapter what one thing I
haven't mentioned total is that I will
not have exactly an activity but at
least activity which is really a more
specialized activity I will have to set
my list adapter which is this
intermediate between my my content and
my view okay and pretty much I can see
what it has taken a little bit more of
not yet of half an hour but here I cut
my single coat so my all the pics
assigned reading for this web service i
will compile this is gonna give this
thing that right Heidi for
yeah so okay how can I do this really
fast
so if you know how is a fuckin deal in
android with a multithreading and how
you separate the different threads of
execution on an application create
passing exactly you normally create an
asynctask or if you want to do it's not
there until you create your own place
that is gonna sting from ah I think I
seen a task and you will implement your
own methods but I don't think we have a
lot of time to not do it very dirty so
I can create hear my single task this is
gonna be the same task
an important
and I need two other rights and methods
the main one is doing background that
means the operation we are going to
perform an hour news right but we come
if we go to this source bobble Right
implement methods we see that we have a
few more as I said this is really useful
thing for coding very fastest even if
you are very experienced with Android
you will never remember exactly the type
of all the attributes for all the
different mix of methods and I think
that's can give us an a3 execute doing
background what's execute three a post
execute execute before and after the
execution of the main street and a
progress update which basically we would
use while there is an update on our task
we will be able to paint on the screen
for example which is up for when we can
a probe this far we want to pay the
content when we are loading a file when
we are for example a music whatever so
I'm gonna create this fast and running
you normally run it with a start or
execute we are sending a parameter know
this is a well something that
ok we need to parameterize the specific
language paramètres I'm gonna send here
No
there was a way to send to davis in one
lesson technical parameters
okay so basically this code creates an
ascent us do not get in background after
what I execute execute we think that so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
copy this code here it could be more
beautiful definitely like I could read
the the code first and then I could when
I have rid of the internets
m can also hear something
so I guess that's the so closeby morphic
okay I knew this could happen so I
prepare the application before so I
don't think I want to be a lot of
minutes with all these yeah yeah it's
working so basically you can see that
the code is pretty much the same i'm
reading the value and what I connecting
to the internet and I'm thinking the
value I'm going to compile it from here
yeah when I compile an Android I will
depending on the configuration but
pretty much I can i will so I screen
with all the different devices that I
can where I can execute application
those are laters but they can also be
physical devices if I connected with my
USB cable some selecting this one and
now switching to my emulator again and
here is finally working so here you can
see that we are reading a all the data
we got from the web services where else
up in some styles on the XML this is
quite a straightforward we move here to
the mesquite them by saying the color
size is your used to HTML that will or
CSS that will be really like very easy I
think and yes I'm here we can also when
we click we go to a different activity
and we we saw that the details of the
beans are we good for example if we if
this were a real application we could
create a button to order the pizza print
here safe to favorite pizzas whatever so
just has take a little bit more but
you're done explaining
it's really believe you can do this
within 15 or 20 minutes and yeah I
wanted to explain the Android studio but
I think we don't really have a lot of
time now so it will stop here never mind
if I said this is my contact information
if you want to contact me for anything I
also participate a lot is in gbg mini
candy de Barcelona in this time we make
lightning out where we explain those
things with the participation of people
on a chelating they're really cool that
one I think was about precisely what
languages studio and we will call one in
two months in GDG Barcelona about how to
integrate an Android application with
amazing and automatic building systems
and holy sisters last but not least if
any of you it's an Android Windows Phone
library iphone developer and is looking
for a new career you can contact me
after the token we can discuss about it
because well I guess that happens a lot
in meaning at my company 6 we are all
the time for electives developers so
thank you and I hope you have enjoyed
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
