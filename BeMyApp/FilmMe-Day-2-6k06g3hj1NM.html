yesterday super nice area birthday to
you happy birthday justin bieber the
birthday to you and many more so that's
the kind of content you can create in
our app and then right now we're working
on um be so this is the info about the
video right now we're working on yeah
right ready to flag it and then right
now we're working on the D add a new
video flow so this is how the actual
creation process we go to the add tab
here the first time you come here you
need to choose a username and then you
can optionally give us give us your
email address to get notified when your
film is done once you've done that click
get going and this takes you into the
pre-production process so now you you
fill out your film title you give the
collaborators that are collaborating
with you on your on your video any
instructions so what what is this video
going to be about what do you how do you
expect it the contact right contacts
what style do you want me to do it in
where do you want them to film etc and
then you choose your category and then
once you're done with that you actually
go and record your your piece of the
video so we can't demo that in the
simulator so these are just screenshots
but you would it would take you into the
video recorder the standard stock video
recorder once you're done recording you
trim your clip so you drag these handles
here and and and edit it down just to
the section you want and then once
you're done trimming um it takes you to
a finish screen we're still working on
this the screen that's actually feel so
designed right there yeah I'm really a
big fan of like hyper minimal design
like almost non-existent
so I actually think that the dog
actually we can show that done is so
much I was joking right that was joke um
oh you're saying that speed was done
that was guy yeah yeah and I take like
we only need to buy out from the gay
okie from the dime and like people will
get it cuz you don't have time to read
you know you get the first letter in
your phone
our biggest challenge has been that it's
two of us if we were a team of five we
would be in much better shape we've been
begging borrowing and stealing anybody's
time we can get to because right there
where he is right now designing out of
the goodness of his heart and he's
trying to give us some good design
treatment on you know we've got the
framework and now we really need to give
it some attitude
no I mean we had do we have the frame
you know do we have some basics yeah
okay I think we're gonna be okay yeah
yeah I think we will be able to present
a pretty good thing yeah step into a
priority
I'm at six I mean it's hard when you
come home at like 130 and then you're
like us really good you know yeah you
get in bed but I'm someone who like me
to nine hours to function properly so so
six and a half is definitely running
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
