the barrier to entry for young animators
and storytellers is way too high so
animate me empowers kids to turn their
diverse imaginations into a visual story
sprout provides us the first time with a
physically immersive user experiences so
our software lets them scan in objects
from their environments even themselves
and their friends into their animation
while sprouts touchscreen technology
makes assembling their stories hands on
an intuitive like no animation software
that's come before it animate me is
clean and simple self expression for
kids this is the basic internet for
animate me and you can see here this is
the vertical screen that's essentially
the video player portion of it and then
the bottom screen is the design portion
of it so this is where people will make
their things on the side we can see this
sort of a almost an emoji format thing
if you're used to that in which there
are different drawers like we pulled out
and these drawers will have so for
instance the head drawer full of
different heads and so on and so forth
at the bottom currently open drawer is
this camera and the camera has a basic
camera this is interfacing with the
normal SDK and so that ftk will actually
launches an external application that
just saves images and then if you want
if you click the normal one then this is
just like the main image so it'll just
take a regular photograph of everything
on this mat and then if you use the
puzzle piece that's just a segmented
version of it so getting multiple
segments saved and then from there we
have just reset general buttons plus to
lean frames and so on so i'll go ahead
and probably start to demo just the just
adding some friends so i'm going to put
on something here and lets you take a
picture of that now it'll launch that
external thing it's a little bit clunky
for that as you can tell since it's
launching our interface now you have a
frame and start to crush this a bit
and I'll just needs a mouse since it's a
little bit easier for presentation now a
second frame you can see that it started
to animate already and it's just going
to loop through these frames back and
forth while it's plain and keep going
okay so on the technology side of things
we have this is all built using unity
and unity doesn't actually have support
for multi-screen Metro apps so we just
have one large thing that's just kind of
stretched out which is you know it's not
beautiful but it works for now there's
plans support for that in the future as
for the person with the arms and head
and legs and so on that that's built in
using using a mesh and unity and one of
our guys made that mesh and you can just
basically add sprite to the different
components to the body and deter this
it's just a repeating animation set of
set of images that are each saved as
textures</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
