the loan program away okay another
program I'm an artist and designer I
have no idea what to do it cause I made
a calculator once it could count to four
okay it was written in python python you
know and that's it so that's my skill
but if you give me online in for I can
build all game ok so I'm going to do
that so I'm going to build something
live on stage I only have half an hour I
also have some other things to say so I
pretty much have like 15 minutes to
build a game okay I'm going to build a
simple game in 15 minutes then i'm going
to highlight if i have time left a
couple more advanced things just to show
you a bit of a you know what happens if
you take what I've just shown and you go
beyond that and then some general unreal
features just basically a sales talk for
a few minutes that's it okay so let's
see this thing breeds a lot it's not
annoying good so that's my name right
away I'm like Dutch I'm Belgian I don't
know what it is so now since i didn't
know what it is i came to Sweden so I've
been living in Sweden for a while and I
work for epic games i've been using
Unreal since 16 years setting up shows
the age of the engine as well and how
long we've been doing this and again I'm
gonna build a simple 2-d game I'm gonna
build a 2-d game because it's one of
those things that people don't really
associate with in real you know when
they think and real they think years of
war next-gen triple-a stuff with
shooting and this block on their stuff
okay yeah so I'm gonna build a 2-d game
just to show that as well so what I'm
gonna do is I have a level here it's
very basic level you see it's just
basically this we have a 2d toolset
since about half year seven eight months
what is it so can these are actual
sprites I don't have that much time to
go into all details but you'll see as I
do as I'm doing it I'm going to try to
explain what I do and I guess you'll
just get a bit of a feel for it before I
start by the way how many of you have
used I'm 19 for that's like 40 h % I
know 35 okay how many of you are
programmers yeah I'm gonna offend you
and I'll hope hopefully make up good so
the first thing I need I need a couple
of racing
people first steps and these are rather
boring actually but I simply need to
tell the level and the game you know
this use this kind of game type and then
use this kind of character I just need
to tell it you know set it up use this
specific script right so basically I'm
just going to do that for that we have
our own we have blueprints and blueprint
is all visual scripting I'm going to the
whole thing without touching a line of
code so a new blueprint class based on
game mode my name is a very artists like
so they're very bad really bad it speeds
it up so I need a second one so i'm
doing is again new blueprint this one is
however based on stick base character so
you take it inherits the parent right
i'm picking their parent classes the top
you are like a couple of more default
standard classes and the bottom list is
everything else so I'm taking a specific
parent class called stick base character
name don't take example I open up this
one and I actually let me open that one
as well again it's very boring just
preparing this is basically the game
mode this controls the game you know
what what are the rules of the game are
like what kind of play what kind of
inputs everything kind of comes from
there and here I simply said please use
my character the second one I made his
character the player that's all I've
done and then I will simply tell the
level you know please use this game mode
that's it ok I just prepared good let's
play the game it doesn't really work so
I guess we didn't really do much so
let's go back to problems the camera is
wrong it just faces straightforward and
we don't have a player I mean we can't
see the play the player is there we can
see them this is my player it's hard to
cpu there but there is a collision there
since i base it on stick base character
i inherited certain stuff right so i
inherited the collision this is the
shape of the player you know all the
basics of the fact that you can move and
all that is already there but you can't
see it there's also a sprite inherited
which is the thing we're supposed to see
but on the right side it's empty so if i
just assign something
like that I get my basic layer thing you
can see it's a it's 2d we have quite a
build-out 2d toolset we're still working
on it i mean it's its work in progress
but it's getting there so for example
debts let me very quickly show you how
it works obviously you import a texture
so texture and what you can do then is
you could right click it and you can do
for example to extract sprites so it
will automatically extract all this
price so now we have this basically
split up you know frame per frame in our
own sprite editor which is this thing
etc and then you would be able to select
all of them and you create a flip book
of that and you automatically we have
this little animation editor thingy so
you automatically combine them there you
know frame off the frame any place it so
basically that's already been prepared
right in this case it's a crown upon
which is weird but hey whatever then we
need the camera there is no camera here
in there is no camera it just takes 00
so it takes that point basically so that
doesn't work so i'm going to add camera
and i'm going to add a spring arm
swingarm is the child of this camera is
childhood spring arm so I dragged it on
top it's now I'm gonna need it let me
just set some settings no collision test
no inheriting rotation it's 1005 run off
and I think it's a minus 90 rotated just
rotating and setting the arm this is
basically the offset of the camera to
the target the target is a player and
this is how far it's offset it and how
its rotated right so I've simply done
that okay let's play so that kind of
works now we have this don't really
press anything oh I'm gonna get that it
hits me I mean my collision is higher
than the crowding thing but yeah but
yeah I can't move that's my next issue I
got hit by unreal on the head so I can't
move so let's go back there and I can't
move because I haven't said anything up
so like I said blueprint is a visual
scripting system we haven't seen any
visual script yet so blueprint also pro
as all those stuff in there it has
components in there you can
anything you want measures sounds
particles no sprites anything you want
but they need all of that you have the
actual visual scripting you know the
functionality part which is here so what
I'm going to do here is I need something
that happens an event so i have event
move right for example and i have to
type that right move right and let's run
the one saying jump should probably type
it more correctly than that um jump so I
have two events okay and these are
actually set up can show you very
quickly or prepare this in the past but
in the project settings here it says
input and here we can see jump here is
what i typed it in here I bound w and up
and spacebar and all kinds of other
stuff to that event so it simply took
that input and now it made an event in
blueprint right and the same goes for
move right and then I could say okay add
movement input so when you move right
all of this is context-sensitive by the
way so if i drag from here the menu that
I get here and the options that I get is
different than if I right click there or
it's different than if i click from
there right so you see in this list is
much shorter so it's completely
context-sensitive so you only get the
options present that you can actually
use at that given point good when you
press move right we will add movement
input world Direction is one there and
the axis value is a scale value there
basically the axis goes from 1 to minus
1 Bend if you press left or right left
would be minus 1 1 would be right okay
let's play okay so now we can do that
two traps not the best game still but at
least we move I haven't done with jump
so let me very quickly do the jump or
edits it's just jump okay ah but yeah
the animation is the main problem right
the animation didn't update we keep
having the unfeeling animation we need
different animations so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to add second thing
called animation state there that
animation state which all get back to in
a second that outputs a flipbook so
basically the animation state is
selecting which kind of flip book to use
and again I'll show you that in a second
let me just finish this first let me
take the sprite in here so this prize
the thing we're actually looking at so I
drags in this represents what you look
at and on that one I do set flip book
because I want to change the texture and
i'm going to change it to the one that
the other function is basically a
function that that one found i'll play
and then i'll explain a bit more what
happens so now you can see you're
standing up if i move i get this if i
jump I get that okay so we have actual
proper animations so what just happens
this is something I prepare to speed up
but this thing if I double click it it's
this ok this is in the parent class
actually you can see this is called
probably very small and so on projector
but this thing where I'm now that's the
stick base character that's the 1i base
yoruba not this is the parent plus the
parent is not a blueprint and in that
blueprint I prepared a function called
animation state this is that function so
it basically is more visual scripting
but it's like you know it's located
somewhere else and this basically simply
checks are you crouching are you falling
or you jumping you know what's the
situation and based on what it is its
outputs a different flip ok each one of
these represents the different animation
that's it and these are some of the more
advanced features all I hopefully have
time to get back to you later on ok so
that works there's one problem still I
can go there whatever go left I can like
do Michael Jackson moon slide something
so it doesn't really work either so he
should flip when he detects that I go
left he should flip everything around ok
I'm going to take the axis value because
as mention the axis value becomes minus
one if it is if it's left so based on
that I know if you're going left or
right I executed afterwards so I
compared that one with zero if you're
above zero or below zero left right
again and then I do get controller the
one controlling it and I do set control
rotation a few steps here make rot
I make the rotation for it basically I'm
controlling I'm rotating the controller
and I wrote in 180 degrees or back based
on left or right so if it's more than 0
it means you're doing you're going right
which is correct so you're doing nothing
you set 0004 rotation if you're going
left if it's mine is less than zero you
will rotate 180 degrees there and that
should work now we're that okay so that
works that no game is complete without
shooting so I'm going to make him shoot
okay game we have another one of these
input actions called sorry wrong one
fire same one as the other ones you know
it's just a button bound to an event so
on fire I want to spawn an actor and I
wanna spawn and even if it collides and
this is where it spawns so where it
spawns is get act or transform it's me
so the actor get act or transform
everything the nectar every object is an
actor in this case it gets its own actor
transform is in other words it gets the
location on the player so wherever the
player is spawn an actor problem is I
don't have anything to work with right I
haven't made projector yet okay so let's
do that so new blueprint again this time
it's based on nothing it's based on
actor actor is just empty neutral class
it's just as basic functionality in
their nets it so just take nothing this
was actually without spelling errors no
actually yeah but i was spelling errors
school good then we have this it's empty
you see the ball there but it's just
place all to have something so on the
left i'm going to add a collision to it
the collision that will actually you
know that's the actual projects out so
sphere collision you can see that
replace that there's a fork ball there I
say its radius 16 should be a bit
smaller and then let's add a flip up to
it we can actually see it because we
can't see the collision flipbook set to
that okay so it's basically a 2d
animation again it's just some sprite
thingy Chloe whatever it's an energy
ball and then to make it more complete
let's add a particle to it so it just
particle and say that's that this looks
better when it moves right now it's not
moving so it's all falling same place
but if it moves you get to leave adults
flying you know behind it cool arm well
actually that's just that's autosave
feature lets just assign that to the to
the player already it's not going to
work but let's just take it let's take
it from here because it's kind of fun
even if it all that work now we have
that maybe not ideal for a projectile
but at least we can do this so it
doesn't know that it has to move forward
so it's simply it spawns when you click
and that's it and then it just hangs
there okay but hey we did that going
back here i'm going to add something
called a movement a projectile movement
and that basically gives it continuous
forward momentum so it's already built
in so i'm going to say speed is let's
say 2500 and gravity is 0 so it always
moves in a straight line forward fine
play you know you have that whoa still
there's issues like it doesn't really
hit anything but at least we can shoot
so next step it has did something okay
so i'm going to do a new event here on
event hit when you hit something i want
you to well basically list for just
destroy the actor so destroy yourself
but before you destroy your straw
yourself spawn a particle where you hit
sort of spawn a hit particle and then
kill yourself basically okay so there
the location may spawn this location
where you hit that debt and raised it
think that one
and one more step in the sphere I
haven't set up the cleat incorrectly I
simply added the collision with default
settings which doesn't work so here I'm
going to do it should block everything
except a player so ignore only the pawn
the player if I don't wanna hit the
player because it spawns in my body so
it would be a bad idea but now we have
this okay so getting there someone was
there but the one thing I don't have
here is that these blue blocks they're
actually supposed to break when you
shoot them they should break and that's
not happening so that's the last step
I'm going to do and I'm going to talk
about how this works on a bigger scale
and then sum over all things these
things are blueprints as well you can
see a lot of things are blueprints so if
I were to right click this and I to edit
breakable brick you can see here we see
the the brick if this a sprite as a
collision it has a script attached stuff
here and in here we have a function or
an event in this case almost the same
thing for us destroy this brick so I
want to call this because if this gets
destroyed two brick would explode in
pieces and will disappear so I want to
make sure that this gets called when
this one hits it so I'm going to do is
I'm going to do other and other is what
it hits so this is the projectile and
other is whatever the projectile hits so
if other is castable to breakable brick
to this class if this is true then we do
I forgot the name of the events which
destroy this brick then we call on the
event in the other blueprint so
destroyed is brick and then we
eventually we still appeal to projectile
if it fails it means it hit anything but
a blue brick then we simply destroy
yourself anyway you know as it was good
so now I have that and we have cast just
to live it up a bit but it works now
before i show you what happened on the
right side of the screen here i'm going
to very quickly go here first because i
want to talk a bit about what happens if
you do this on a bigger scale so here
this is also this is my personal project
by the way I usually show
is because I know what I've done myself
I mean this is what I've been working in
my free time but it also shows you what
happens when you use unreal for
obviously bigger things and 2d games
could stick character shooting cats like
things yeah which is the the points and
now we have out a safe at second and
then we very quickly place to the ocean
is not green okay so obviously unreal is
built for very big stuff what we want to
do is you want to move away from the
engine being you know people think of
the engine as being suited for Gears of
War and next-gen stuff and that's it you
want to make sure it covers everything
it should get over every genre it should
cover almost every platform it should
just be widely usable by developers
right so we want to be able to go from
this thing to this high-end stuff and
anything should work is to scale up and
now she work on mobile should work
everywhere that's really the philosophy
and if you then look at blueprints
because you might look at this and say
like you know especially since your
program is you might be like yeah this
is really cool if you're like new to it
or if you don't know how to program you
know it's cool to a cool tool it's fancy
but you can't make a game with ads you
know you might think that and we really
want to move away from that this has to
obviously work for new people because I
have to be able to get into the engine
in an easy way but it also has to work
for triple-a team this has to work for a
team with two or three hundred people
you know and this has the speed of their
work this is also not meant to replace
programmers so that's good for you i
guess but it's meant to it's meant to
empower artists and designers it's meant
to free of the time of the program so
you can focus on more important stuff
than a dude can you move this particle
on the gun for me by one unit you know
anything more important than that it's
really meant that it's men so you as an
artist and designer can come into the
office in the morning and you're like
what would happen if the play would slow
down when you walk uphill and you can
just do it without touching a line of
code and it doesn't mean it has to stay
that way you probably want to move it
over to C++ later you know or maybe you
want to involve program but it's really
good for prototyping tweaking things
trying things and that has really been
the idea so when you look at my game and
the things I've been doing and this gets
this spaghetti like which is not unreal
sports my fault but even so it actually
serve
spaghetti you can go and say any far
with this and again I don't have a lot
of time to go really deep into it but
you can go and say any far really
there's so many layers of complexity
beneath where you can use to organize
your work it's crazy and there's c++ and
uh needs so in our own project this is
c++ this this this this this or actually
know that but this one is cetera so it
can completely easily you can do
whatever you want in c++ and then you
can expose that to blueprint and here it
continues or any combination you want
you can do almost everything here or you
can do everything in C++ it doesn't
matter anything goes okay so it's very
easy to go back and forth I'm going to
run out of time so let me very quickly
go back here and again I have this
running over there so if you want I can
open it up later again yeah but let me
show you a couple of the more general
features and for that I unfortunately
need to use unreal to get up the wall on
the right always I can't jump over it
you're using Unreal as a foundation to
move on in life a lot of cats it's a bit
of a walk in the meantime you can look
at my email while we walk good so I have
a couple of slides here I hope I get it
done in the five minutes I have left so
I'll do this relatively quickly a big
thing for me and unreal as all the sub
editors completely I mean everything is
there we have everything from material
editors particle editors animation
editors you know AI editors everything
you you know basically the whole thing
and it's all the same style you can see
all the different ones they're all
exactly the same the done by the same
people they work on all the platforms
they're pretty much bug free small
things aside of course it's maintained
by the actual development team so it'll
work everywhere is documented and so on
and they all talk to each other because
they're done by the same people that's a
big thing for me we got templates
especially if you're new to the engine
or you just want to mess around or
prototype stuff we got both c++ and blue
print template so you simply pick around
a third person game and it will generate
it it's the one button make game bottle
thing it it makes basic games but at
least it's very fun to just learn it you
can press it and just see how we did
we've got a lot of example content about
20 to 25 things we've released a lot of
it is very high-end content and you can
just look at it and you can we can look
how we made it any content in there you
can use commercially as well we don't
care if anything goes so we have that
then we have we're working on a
marketplace where you can buy assets and
plugins so we've got that going all the
source code is released so it's C++ and
it's all released on github so anyone
can get it you can modify it you can
send changes back to us if we agree with
it we will possibly put it into the
standard engine and so forth you could
make the entire editor purple or
something then send it to us we'll
probably not agree to put it into the
standard version but you're good okay
and we have more we have all of these
i'll give it a bit short but basically
you know we gotta stand the stuff
documentation Vicki's tutorials you know
YouTube etc we got weekly twitch streams
supports streaming and so on we got the
road map since of year or more already
where you can look through it etc but
the most fun thing I think is for me
this one so we'll just focus on that
these are all releases so we've had to
4.8 release or is it three weeks of
something ago now and I'll scroll
through or I'll have to speed up at some
point but it kind of tells a picture i
think is ideal to tell that picture your
information the scroll bar is now
they're still okay so you're getting the
point and i'll go to page down instead
but this is page long so this is for
speed but still this is one single
release every two months we do this so
in two months around September we will
do this again and again and again again
that's the velocity we're moving at so
and also we're very transparent with it
we just want to communicate everything
if something is broken you know we will
fix it and we will communicate exactly
what has been changed what has been
fixed also since you have all
source code we can fix whatever you find
yourself you will never get stuck on
development because there is a certain
barking engine you got everything so we
will fix that for you but you can also
fix it yourself if it's urgent or it's
very specific you can do anything you
want and go back here from Roland almost
there it runs basically on everything
except Windows Phone and Nintendo okay
and we're going to give away 5 million
dollars there's also that not to one
person or one company I mean divided in
small small it is a two three hundred
thousand crowns or something depends
really on the project but still we're
going to we have no end date set for
that you can apply whenever you want
there is no deadlines it's just ongoing
so if you have something cool made in
unreal send it to us everything gives
indeed cool and you know it's different
or it does something we haven't done
before in the end and haven't seen
before in the engine we will give you
money that's if there's no strings
attached you don't have to pay it back
you don't even have to finish the
project you do whatever you want if the
project fails and the money just gets
lost the money gets lost it and then the
last one do you know what it costs by
the way who knows what it costs really
only three people for really really it's
probably more anyway it's free there you
go there is five percent royalties if
you make a commercial game with it so if
you make a game with it to the game goes
on sale and it gets sold to the end user
this 5% royalties on that which we feel
is fair for everything you've got there
but everything else is free so you use
it in education it's free you use for
research it's free you make
architectural visualizations with it
it's three you use it for a marketing
game where you get paid by Volvo for
example to make a game that volvo will
then in turn release for free to the
public it's free okay so anything is
free except if it's a commercial
entertainment game basically sold by you
or a publisher to the end user that's
pretty much it so good I'm Hana</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
