constructed baby concierge a service
from your mom's new dads and you ladies
so in order to never again forget that
baby bottle our app well next you and
show you a picture of what you may need
forgetting so you will not forget the
bottle you will not forget the blankie
and you will not forget the bear should
you not have time to check your phone
and look at the picture and remember
that the bear is missing or not be able
to do so a text message will be sent to
your spouse that says hey you please go
over there so if your spouse although I
home from work can pick up the bear and
meet your grandma house and the story
will end happily so we actually had
enough time and make not one but two
apps because Jesse heroically went and
talked to families in the park all day
on Saturday so that we had real feedback
from real moms number with their
problems really were and build our app
system to solve those problems amp
number one comes directly from those
conversations and apt number to build on
those conversations a little bit more so
that app number two number one helps you
be able to know exactly where the bottle
is at all times but apt number two helps
you be able to know exactly how much and
let your being busy since eating
patterns are the number one thing that
you get that me and Pediatrics want to
know so that we are able to know is that
one how well these are growing and if
they're getting the right nutrition so
what we envision is that anxious moms
when they're coming
from the hospital would be given a
starter kit and given this baby pack so
that they're able to know exactly the
rubber things higher they have a lot of
questions and also meal the trap feeds
so that things are healthy and going
happy so that parents themselves are
more reassured in doctors or as well ok
so in the short term feeding is taken
care of emergencies are taken care of
forgetting is taken care of in the long
term you establish a data pipeline
giving you your baby of a position to
get pediatrics the long term Diagnostics
they need to make sure your child grows
up healthy peace of mind happy babies
hard work to apps question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
