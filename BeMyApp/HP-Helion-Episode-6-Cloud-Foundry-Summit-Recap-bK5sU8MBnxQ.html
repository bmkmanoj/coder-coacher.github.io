know because we are only three correct
no I'll be the three of us okay we are
live okay fantastica thank you very much
this is a Erica guy Johnny speaking i am
from the AMIA cloud the marketing team
here at the red Parker the enterprise
and he's a big play for me with this
first webinar to kick off the second
series of the helium European webinars
serious that we started the back on sep
tember it was very successful we really
covered a different topic that
apparently were very attractive because
the number of participants was keep
increasing a webinar after webinar so we
decided to extend these successful
series with another couple of events as
you know these events are supported the
sponsored organized by ulet Packard
Enterprise in collaboration with the
Intel you know that Intel and the unit
Parker enterprise are strong partners we
are collaborating in a lot of different
activities in the ite industries as you
probably see everywhere and this series
of webinars that we are proposing you is
an additional opportunity to share era
with our developers users IT
professionals our commitment in the open
source technologies and in particularly
on OpenStack and a cloud foundry Intel
and you'll pack enterprise our Platinum
members of the OpenStack foundation and
we hold the seat on the board of the
ragdolls as an additional proof of our
movement eula pack enterprise ilion
OpenStack that is our distribution make
it easier for you to configure deploy
manager do
SPECT imaging in your existing data
center with our technology we are
committed committed to provide you with
a strong residency ability agility and
really to provide an enterprise level
support that you need to accelerate your
business outcome you know that the value
of OpenStack really really a lot and by
the way this combination helps you to
avoid all the vendors low key Intel is a
strongly committed as well and all the
Intel developers worked with the
community to expose the Intel hardware
technology to do stack software modules
and they are committed to extend the
OpenStack technology to improve security
compliance of ability manageability and
overall the end user experience so let's
say de you can understand that the
reason why unit park enterprise and
Intel are working together on this
series of events that you are proud to
offer to you as anticipated there today
we are kicking off the second series and
we have a very interesting topic because
it will be presented by AT&amp;amp;T intent that
will introduce himself right after my
short introduction we were both
attending the cloud foundry summit last
week in Berlin was a fantastic
experience and I'm pretty happy to have
a TN sharing with you some of the
interesting learning experience from
these events and it can will also cover
second important topic today is a very
important day for a ulit Packer
enterprise is a launcher is a launch day
so basically we are doing a lot of big
announcement and particularly today we
are announcing the unit by the unit
Parker the enterprise ileana OpenStack
development platform at all so the
version 2 of our Cloud Foundry is the
distribution and in addition to the
openstack cloud foundry to doto we are
also notes in a number of additional
producer in the area of the docker
containers and then sure that again will
entertain you also covering this recent
announcement the second wave inertia of
this series is scheduled for next
november 24th so next tuesday it will be
a gay
panel with all the former presenters of
the openstack European webinars so we
will have to internals again special
guest again we will have a Christian
trying curve that is taking care of and
steak and we are going to have to
external speaker Martin kisa and the
Jews a pattern 02 HP is a most valuable
professional and we are really hoping to
a panel conversations so you are all
invited to submit your questions live
during the next week webinar or from now
on if you go to the website either where
you did the registration to attend this
webinar you can start to sign emails and
to submit your questions that our
experts will be happy to take and to
answer during the winners let's say the
sorry the introduction was longer than
assaulted and about a lot of interesting
things that without a lawyer
participants and I'm happy to do now oh
the mic add screen and the voice too hi
hello everyone yeah Thank You Enrico
thank you very much from this great
introduction so I am Rhino sharing my
screen so i hope you are seeing my
slides so today hello everyone of course
i am very very happy to speak with you
about Claude family and especially the
last Claude phone with submit in berlin
in balance so when I was a participant
with Enrico so it was very very useful
and I have a lot of things to say to you
today but just before to start let me
tell you
no really big news big features to
explain our to say or to share with you
because it's not like a nipple a turkey
not you know the code for noise submit
it's not like an apple keynote with the
big announcement of the last project i
watch etc and just why because Kershaw
no it's a community so the updates
features everyday deployed the git
repository so there is no big bong
update you know so it's a big community
so every developer RL playing every day
every night so it's not we are waiting
three months just before announce a big
news so every news on every bird every
day every hour asked in da git
repository so actually the biggest news
is a nuke red phone ray logo because the
initially logo was built in 2011
designed by a developer so as you know a
developer it's not really a graphical
man so welcome to the new logo this crud
far away from the Sun logo is mockery a
very faint 6i Stella so it's it's a big
future so I hope you can see my screen
because if not of course you can see the
logo the beautiful and new logo so let
me let me see you and as unusable
because I don't know if you remember but
during my last webinar I did a demo with
HPE hdb so indeed Zeebo I was deploying
a Microsoft Application to cloud foundry
I don't know if you remember it was a
nice speed net application I was
deploying this clean native Microsoft
Application right from my laptop to HP
HP e def platform so it was great
because HP is supporting dotnet but
rhino as you know acronym is an
open-source platform so HP gives
occurred to the community songs to the
greenhouse project
with the initiator from for this project
so by this way all cloud foundry
platform support doesn't it why not
natively so if you want to download the
last version of Crow family community
it's supporting dotnet and of course
it's supporting dokur as well so this is
a great news about the curl let me
explain because when you are putting
your code as you know traditional is
creating for you a docker container and
this docker container is a sin x zg so
it's called garden but before it was the
warden so what I suppose like a
container but it's was not the curl it
was another container technology but y
know you can ask a counter or docker
container directly in cod4 line but it's
not the only news because instead
instead pushing your card now you can
push a container so you have two choices
remember you can push your cut directly
but you also can push a container so
clutch phono is an application platform
if you are pushing your application but
it's also a container platform if you
are pushing your container as well so
the thing is you can build on your
laptop your own container on push or
container directly to the platform so
it's your choice it's depending a lot of
situation if your application is maybe
cognitive already so by this way you can
push your code directly if your
application is maybe not clad native
maybe you can build your application
inside the container a docker container
and after push the container to depart
so this is a great news and this don't
lose is the bush collaboration so i will
speak about bush later but basically
bush is the Orcas at all the cloud
foundry or Cassata so this great because
for example if your crude form a
platform is a animal is full maybe bush
can ask to your infrastructure platform
to deploy new vm to oast your
crowdfunding platform so it's coming the
collaboration is between
cloud foundry Bosh on OpenStack so it's
coming if you want to understand and
OpenStack judge firmly on top as the
link between these two platforms would
be a much better y know it's very very
complex to use bush OpenStack
entrepreneur it together another new
squad for me on as you so basically as
this is a very well grand news but
currently platform is available in
Microsoft Azure the public cloud of
Microsoft as an image an etsy dimension
so you can deploy it right from
Microsoft Azure wizard configuration the
crowd for my community confirm the
foundation platform so this great the
other news is about pivotal pivotal is
announcing is a new release basically
it's Twitter guides of features of
Torquil previously that's it so the Duke
as per the NetSupport exeter ever with
HP HP e so as you know we bought the
product stuck at with a great staccato
is a very great crowd funding platform
variability force they burn nice it is
very great for our companies so the new
HP crowdfunding platform is called Eddie
on staccato so this crowdfunding
platform is a multi-platform I don't
know if you if you know this information
but HPE alien death platform is a
platform for OpenStack so you captain
style hpe death platform with another
infrastructure system but with against I
Kato against a Couture is a crowdfunding
multi-platform so basically you can
instead it on a vcenter amazon web
services microsoft azure virtual box
except an exit down so these are great
news another information so right now we
have two big projects for the company's
motor cloud the first one is a managed
cloud so of promis-- called alien BBC so
it's your private cloud but i'll still
unmanaged by HP if you don't want to
manage it or we have another solution
with a real private cloud or street and
managed by the company itself
called alien current system so you just
need to install it as a clutch system
software on your data center so it's
very easy just to remember to big
mindset to be ways to use your cloud ad
on GPC of Primus or alien cloud system
on primates so what's about class early
so I'm sorry I'm sorry to say this
information but it's not from me it's
from a secret for my foundation itself a
crude fun way is not exciting so I know
it's that easy tween this kind of
information but I got in the community
it's true crowd from know is not
exciting so why because DJ sitting sing
with her phone is what you will be able
to do with that actually what you can do
with cloud following basically the
application you can developed on it is a
big architecture you are capable to do
these services you can do in cyclotron
line is this very very exciting so
corruption oh it's just twenty percent
twenty percent of the solution to
develop Oakland native application so so
exiting part is okay with currently it's
great it's just a tool but it's great
because I can develop the clan native
application microservices artifacts abs
exeter exeter so these very fun the
platform itself it's empty platform okay
so the main question for you or for me
for companies it's how can we change is
it possible to develop a clinton achieve
clutch application using cult following
so this is the main subject because okay
so platform it's right exactly I it's a
polyglot platform but the main question
is how can we change my company how can
I developed a credit application so the
first and soil is it's time to change of
course because let me give you a very
very simple example and we
moving on getting on you watch maybe you
are not bringing your ex-wife your old
baggage ease no you have to start with
new things maybe with new closest new
owls new bike a g6 dynastar so zoom any
day I d8 to explain it it's very odd
very very hard to transform your
traditional applications to akron native
application so it's much better to start
a nuclear native application from
scratch definitely while first maybe
because the application architecture is
already different the traditional
application is not the same as a nuclear
native application it's not just a
technical thing it's not just a
technical question because you have to
change because the organizational
processes are not the same definitely
not your team has to be different and
that's why I'm talking about pizza today
I do you know why maybe yes because it's
not from me of course sites from GSC io
from amazon the two pins our team it's a
new concept very very important in a
cognitive team a cloud foundry
architecture because basically your team
is looking much better if it's a two PG
team the thing is if you can fit if you
can't actually if you can't feed your
team with only two pizza it's because
your team is too big so just to pizza
should be enough to fit your team so I
agree with you it's depending the people
may be in your family and just one
person can eat two pizzas but anyway it
just to explain five or six people could
be enough energy in a neutral nativity
so this is a huge change because as you
know in the traditional company of
course it's big team with a lot of
people so it's not very agile it's not
very fast exam so makes more tips
because plan is the worst thing
theme it's a link between people you
know the connection between each people
for example if I am asking how many
links are in your group maybe you don't
know is this far for me the links in you
know if you have to talk to someone if
you don't know we're talking to another
person and basically you have you ever
to talk to this person this person has
to talk to others or 1x texts are so so
it's it's simple because you have to
check if your team is not too big to
develop our manager Oakland native
application so it's just impossible to
so to speak as I say to each people in
your team if it's too big but we have a
formula to check it so it's not so much
time sorry it's not second it's far from
my eye on the phone booths a bitch n is
the number of people in your team ok so
for example if I have a team with ten
people i do think i can I thought for a
second guys ok your slides are you still
want slide number one of course not ok
because we currently just see slide
number one on the screen ok i think when
i am sharing my screen slide number two
ok ok ok so i have to ok i can use the
slide show mud actually I guess ok well
it's ok so i am walking like that yeah
just quickly just a quick way back up
George following year ago you went on
smart exactly what I say while
supporting the curl every platform are
supporting this part looking on the net
traditional is available on SEO very
important Ellen stuck at 0 ok very very
ok I see the like okay it's not very
fast ok there is a lag between a ok so
right now i am talking about alien
staccato can you see the slide oh are
you still seeing the crowd phone
reassigned now I see
takato on the top and the Illiana would
be see on the bottom ah okay perfect so
alien staccato is the product we bought
with HP as I said and I was blessed
explaining cred for me was not exciting
okay so just to be sure whether the same
page with the same slides you could be
much easier for everyone and let me go
to this part so this is a formula from
Einstein just to check if in your
company you have maybe two teams long
teams are buried too big so n is the
number of people so as I said if I have
a team with ten people I do 10 with 19
so it's a in 219 sorry in 29 so it's
giving me 1919 to 45 so 45 people it's
not bad okay but it still be but not bad
but let me give you another example if I
have a team with 20 people 20 with 19 it
gives me 3 android on 80 split into 100
on 90 it's a lot just amazing so more
you have people more connection i'll
increase our lawyer i I and it's crazy
so the question is reduce your team or
build new small teams the best thing
stood and just why because a new jobs
are coming it's a new develops
organization on i am showing you what is
this new organization as you can see do
you know this schema uses architecture
infrastructure ok but um you you need
infrastructure you can change these
parts and platform on top of the
infrastructure and of course on top of
the platform your code right there so
the new job very important is a platform
operation ok so this job is taking care
of the platform that's it not about the
application only for the platform so it
deploys platform makes stop down 1 times
Sammis available
immunity platforms get the platform a
broad platform with zero in time extra
so I have to be sure okay the
crowdfunding platform the OpenStack
platform or under the infrastructure as
to be right ok so my platform has to be
right d and ready to use and of course I
have two new jobs the application
developers this one this job application
developers basically is the developer so
it creates a deployable application
artifact but that's it right I've taught
that Mozilla developer the application
of passion configure the is taking care
of the configuration of the production
environment so it deploys the
application to production it monitors
the application schedule the application
and deploys new application reaction
with zero downtime so as you can see why
no it's small teams but two people from
the developer with developing the
application and pushing the application
to production and the platform passion
is not I think I'll about of course the
application but only about the platform
let me show you maybe with a varying
right sample without the animation I'm
sorry because it's not working but just
to show you India who I life because in
server life it's very very easy because
as you know we need more than one
platform okay we need a platform to dev
another platform to Jack cell phones so
the clarification I'm fanelli a
production platform this ripred forms
are the same sweet crude phone web
platforms so the platform operations or
carry their job to be sure the petrol
ready to use that's it and the developer
is developing this code okay so it's a
provide the plant and it is is doing a
first commit that's it of oak oh of
course is testing on the death platform
if it's working it can deploy code to
the acceptance platform
we played solitaire shine so with the
application of pressure if it's working
well let's okay but if not he has to try
with the den platform again so it's
fighting with another platform
chromatics and finally the v1 is ready
but as you can see it's not the
developer himself with deploying the
platform so the application to the right
platform the developer is taking care
only of the application to the Deaf
platform so right now it's another job
with deploying the application to the
production and the acceptance platform
so we have two jobs for developers one
job to click link to taking care of the
platform very very important and that's
why finally we have to share the last
point because as developer is creating a
artifact application so the application
has to be self self-described so I'm not
creating a documentation next time just
creating API that's why it's very very
important when you are developing any
application just to to to open your
application logical source code maybe
but just to open the API so just to get
an access to your application it's
exactly like you can develop
microservices so it's not from me
directly but this later is very good so
it's a little from a CEO of Amazon Jeff
a letter sent into the employees an
internal later so basically exist all
teams will expose downtown from shiny
teeth services interfaces so he is
asking ok if you are developing a great
a great application or great
functionality don't chip this
fortunately for you you have to expose
your application and your functionality
to another system so we can't if we can
choose your efficiency ok it's not good
and the conclusion fries is anyone who
doesn't do this will be fired so
you have a nice day of course it's very
direct bearing us but it's very very
interesting so share by default so
that's the point if I am developing an
application I have to do up the eye for
this application I can keep this
application without ipi that's a very
important point I'm just another news
very important about Bush as you know
but it's like an orchestra talk
fortunately but this is a castrato is
honestly a nightmare so it's very very
powerful because you can create all the
VMS right from cod fun way it's all
automatic so it's very very powerful but
it's very very difficult to to use it
let me show you this this decide just to
show you the difference at all between
chef / pet or ansible as you can see
chef it's easy to use it's not bad per
pet same thing uncibal same thing but
bush it's a nightmare to you so you have
to to do a lot of things it's a lot of
its not very ready to use and it's not
it's not very not easy to to to learn
but when your brush is okay walking when
it's it's crazy it's very very robust
very powerful so maybe you can try to
use brush just to tonight eyes between
your death platform or your crowdfunding
platform and to the upper structure to
make the link between platform and
infrastructure but right now my advice
is to wait another boy's reaction ok so
the action is it's coming but try
knowing it's not a good idea to use
birth so if someone is talking about you
with bush ok you can try but you have to
know it's very not the best idea how you
can get so this point was very important
let me maybe just to do a quick recap
with the slides
it would be very very efficient for you
i'm sure the quick recap is this one so
the cred fun we logo okay so you know
it's a new logo this slide so right now
a pivotal cross family foundation IBM
bluemix xterra are supporting do care so
the colonel is a new way to deploy a
container and the microsoft.net so
microsoft is very very powerful and it's
very very useful for all the microsoft
community so right now it's a native
support inside exceptionally and bush so
it's through the collaboration is coming
so my advice is to wait to wait a bit
emotion and if you want to try microsoft
across one way you can try currently on
as you with the stack a diversion so the
HP is take a tool is available on as you
so my advice is to use it it's very very
great very easy to use so go to
microsoft as you are amazon and try hpe
staccato and I guess that's my
conclusion just please just try this my
best pal because rhino platform is
multi-platform much even though so you
can download an image from HP from
another crab for my foundation and try
on your laptop so it's very early and
this is the first way to traduce crab
for me is to try it and now it's
possible just before it was very hard to
use crush on way to install it but y
know it's easy that the big news
everyone can instead it on his laptop so
do it and that's my co efficient of
course well uh thank you very much
indian y'all I can really much
appreciate it and we could have a few
words say well no thank you very much
again yes I can only say from the
overall experience at the cloud foundry
summit I need to say that
I was impressed by the quality of the
participants you know as I can say this
was the first cloud foundry summit in
Europe and we got around the unit park
enterprise was one of the sponsors and
there were around 500 and more
participants so not comparable to the
experience that we are doing attending
and sponsoring ad OpenStack I'm six
hundred and thousand participants but
again was the first one was absolutely
important and very interesting to be
there aldi for your information all the
key ID by leaders are investing in Cloud
Foundry so at the sponsors pavilion we
were not alone I don't want to mention
of course all our competitors however
all the key vendors were there and what
was interesting was really day to see
the excitement generation the spirit of
all the participants and all larger
sponsors then I p vendors apart was also
interesting to see a lot of small
organizations small software houses
small companies attending the summit and
the game ad was really really
interesting because is me that this
platform is going more and more
pervasive even if probably not really
exciting as etienne has failed us
however it's really something that is
growing and growing and growing
good I spoke with the Sam actually I
don't recall the second name is
basically the cloud foundry CEO we had a
conversation etc and he told me that at
the moment the cloud foundry
organization estimator something like to
billions users of applications developed
by club foundry with the cloud family so
is a huge number of course the rally
those are not the applications but are
the users of the applications however if
you think to billions of people using
cloud foundries based applications they
really give the idea of the impact that
this technology is having in the market
let me ask the participants if there are
questions for Etienne or myself or there
is another topical that I would like to
ask at the end if you can briefly cover
I'm just in a quickly enough um everyone
participant if you have any questions
you can ask via twitter with the hashtag
Healy and web series or you could ask
via email Fernando at be my app com if
you have any questions you can ask there
so in the meantime again I another
interesting things that we realized that
the or at least it was myself at the
cloud foundry samhita easy the how dr.
technology is growing we really have
that is really a lot of interest this is
in a bit in addition technology is
really rising incredible fought with an
attention and I know that today together
with the de in your net the variant
platform to doto we also did the
important announcement in term of cloud
foundry support from doctors I wonder if
you can tell us something more again on
on the announcement yes yes about so
there is two two things to understand
the first one is were supporting a
looker so we have a to type to two kinds
of platforms the first one is a platform
platform the service of course but to
platform for application so you are
pushing your code directly to the
platform and we are creating signs to
dhoka dhoka container and it's very
great because after that we can imagine
a lot of micro services so it's like a
big software but each modules are all
container for example if it's a web page
you have the commands but it's a
container a docker container this
summary it's a container I don't know
the approaches module purchase module of
the command module on the spam module
extra it's another container so we have
to split in a lot of parts a website in
different kind of containers under its
managing side with a lot of tools so you
have the curve swung to all the
containers look up compose to create a
micro services system and that's why
it's very very important so y know if
you are creating a clean native
application very simple okay you don't
need dukay I agree with you but if you
are creating a crime native application
with micro services okay you definitely
need the curl on that's why it's very
very important to be focused on local
okay that's it LOL ok so so so yeah so
so we're losing a lot of things for as a
platform of the service for application
for culturally but while most in a lot
of thing for the doctor for a platform
the service for what containers so we
are watching
catch form a container platform we do
occur with a lot of tools to monitor as
a container to compose so to create a
lot of containers manage the DevOps so
to manage your life cycle of containers
and were quite see plugins for another
thing with to create deploy to push to
start to manage containers so that's why
we are watching a lot of software to
manage on to orchestrate the containers
the docker containers so we did it
choice to use docker because it's a
natural choice and I think it's the
biggest community with growing growing
lingering so so yes bigger be focus and
under kayla and we have a lot of
projects to help companies to manage the
containers okay very nice um with that
gentleman do you have any other things
to say hello proc now with you two
ladies and gentleman who attended thank
you very much for coming for the winners
the way we're going to choose the
winners from these two from this webinar
is very simple for many of you know the
next episode which is next Tuesday is
our last for the season finale and it's
going to be an off-speed panel that
means once again we're gonna have all
the speakers so in turn is coming back
Maureen giuseppe and Christian they're
going to all come back for an all panel
discussion and basically we're also
gonna be having your questions live and
to win the two HP Cloud boxes for this
webinar you just have to send me an
