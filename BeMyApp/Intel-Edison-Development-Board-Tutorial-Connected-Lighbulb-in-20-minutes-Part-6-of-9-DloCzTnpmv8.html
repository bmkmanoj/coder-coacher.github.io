break down the project's wireframe let's
look into the wireframe you can now plug
the LED strip directly to the Intel
Edison since the Edison wasn't made to
supply enough power to the LED strip the
Edison gives one point eight volts and 3
milli amps which is not sufficient to
power our LED strip so we'll need a
circuit that's capable of amplifying the
power while maintaining a very low
threshold voltage so you might think of
using a Darlington pair using two NPN
transistors this might help us give
enough power to the LED strips but with
a very high threshold voltage which is
not going to work with the Edison so
instead we are using a c-clip air with
the NPN transistor and a PNP transistor
so this is the whole wireframe the LED
strip is represented by the common
cathode the RGB LED we have a single
power supply so we have three circuits
that will regulate the amount of power
that will go into each color red green
and blue each one has a low transistor
that we connect to the j 14 j 0 and j 20
on the Intel Edison here's what it looks
like on the breadboard you can see our
pnp and npn transistors are small
resistance the colors and the power
supply which so we can regulate the
power of the power rails congrats you
just finished part 62 the tutorials see
you in part 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
