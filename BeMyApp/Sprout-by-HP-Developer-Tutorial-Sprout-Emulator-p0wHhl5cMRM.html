some of the features of the sprout
emulator in order to run the sprout
emulator you will need to connect an
external monitor to your laptop or
desktop computer the emulator will treat
the external monitor as the main screen
and your laptop or desktop screen as the
touch matte screen when you launch the
sprout emulator it will get the sprout
start screen click it and the workspace
will load the workspace consists of two
screams the gallery on the main screen
and a selection of apps on the matte
screen on the touch matte screen you can
see some of the apps that come with the
sprout work space such as capture create
and gallery if we open the capture app
the emulator will capture some block
data which is presented in the same
fashion as the real thing on the actual
sprout hardware when capturing with the
sprout hardware if you put multiple
objects into the capture area the
capture app will save the capture of the
whole map and one file for each of the
individual objects will hit save right
here and as you can see each image has
been saved in the gallery under the
images container another app is to
create app we can drive one of the
images from the gallery into the create
app like so in the create app there are
multitude of pens and colors let's just
pick one and write a little something
keep in mind
that on drawing right now and the
picture are currently on two different
layers
now we save the project and there it is
in the gallery saved in the products
container now the emulator has several
different special hot keys that are
bound to perform actions that the sprout
Hardware has dedicated buttons for but
your computer does not all to is the
home button and will bring up the
gallery up one will bring up the virtual
keyboard alt 3 is the home tab button
similar in function to the alt tab
hotkey on a regular windows machine but
intended for sprout
alt for toggles the touch input on the
mat screen and alt 5 toggles the
projector since the projector is absent
on the machine with the emulator you
will get this little notification
telling you off for trying to use it
another way to return to the gallery is
to open the gallery app on the matte
screen the main purpose of this emulator
is to allow developers like you who do
not have a sprout system to develop with
the platform I have here a little sample
program and I'm going to install and use
with the emulator
you can see the little Pacman app there
under applications I'm going to move it
to the touch Matt area which is similar
to pinning things to the start menu or
taskbar in Windows and there we go it's
a very simple little app that just shows
a screen on the main window and then
when you click the button shows a screen
on the mat window when you want to close
up the emulator there's a little X in
the top right-hand corner of the gallery
in order to close the touch matte screen
you may have to go into task manager and
end the task
this video covered someone
any features of this pro emulator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
