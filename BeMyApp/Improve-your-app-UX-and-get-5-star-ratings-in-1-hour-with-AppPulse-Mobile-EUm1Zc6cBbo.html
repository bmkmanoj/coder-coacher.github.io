factor architect of Apple's mobile and
part of the R&amp;amp;D group with me here today
is the happy hi hi everyone my name is a
vector based on I'm the team leader in
the Apple small Valley R&amp;amp;D team thanks
happy so just before we start I'd like
to let you know that you can post
questions and by clicking on the
question icon and I'm sure you will have
a quite few and we will answer all the
questions at the end of the sessions I
also the slide that could be available
as a handout indeed where we now and the
one last thing before we start I'd like
to tell you a bit about who are we so HP
software are indeed its previously in
two thousand six and two thousand six it
was the HP mercury so in total we have
more than 20 years of experience with
IBM software so its application
monitoring and even system monitoring
everything together end-to-end solutions
for the enterprise business and also for
the small businesses and so with this
experience will came up around two years
ago with the new and innovative solution
which is the apples mobile and and this
is what we are going to talk today we
will review what is Apple's mobile and
then we will discuss our approach to a
monitoring a mobile application and you
will see very new unique ID I promise
you that what you see here is not
available many things you see here are
not available in similar products and so
we will go through a measuring the UI
performance of your application and
measuring application errors some
application or sit and there there are
no indication in the code that they may
happen so it's only the use of see them
in the UI and finally
you will see very cool approach to crush
analytics see all the tools that will
help you not only to get a quest but you
also know how to reproduce them so when
we talk about let's let's understand
what is the apples mobile so APIs mobile
is mobile application monitoring tool or
analytics tool if you want and when I
talk about user experience monitoring
it's still approaching developers so
when I talk about user experience we are
still I need to isolate crashes and we
are talking about a pinpoint team
pinpoint the client-side performance
issue and the network problems and the
resources that your application consumes
form your users things like battery
everybody knows today what happens when
the battery in your cell phone is is a
great tip Brent do you find the app to
blame and we're still talking about all
these problems the cheers develop either
an iOS or Android need to solve but our
approach is to look from the user
experience we are going to first of all
find what impact the user the most and
only and let me focus you on these
things that you really need to fix and
because these are the things that your
users will complain about and and once
we focus you and show you what user we
will show you what user experience and
what impacted most users only then we
take you into the deep dive with the
tool to solve the problem again if it's
slow UI or or a crash check one so um
this is a high-level athlete to sew up
as mobile is a service solution and you
simply register to our service you a
download the SDK and embed it in your
mobile application and M so in order to
es de gain the Android application just
run a command line and we wrap your apk
and in the iOS you link it into a
project you had a framework but the
point my point is that you don't need to
do any code tagging and everything
everything that you will see today is
instrumented automatically for example
all the user actions and their names and
the names of the screen we do we we hook
up to all these key methods and we and
we are able to automatically a measure
and capture all these actions and all
the the network calls and everything and
connect it all together we see this in a
moment but it's important to say it's
really really really five minutes to
edit a purse model to your mobile
application and of course we not
overheard the no impact on the on the
end user and so all this day once you
add Apple's mobile to your mobile
application you go and test it later on
you deliver it to your a crowd testing
users or eventually you're a real users
and once users are using your
application everything that impacts the
user experience is being a captured by
Apple's mobile all this data that we
will see and this presentation is being
sent to our SAS back end its energy a
unit Picard Enterprise a cloud system
it's stored in the vertical those of you
were familiar a little bit with the Big
Data technology are probably heard about
a vertical it's a very strong and
popular and a big data and system
database and eventually what we see
today is the sum of the the reports and
the value is you can get from apps
mobile as a user and so we'd like to
start with a UI performance and what is
your performance and how and you can
isolate it and fix problems so we are
now I now handing it over to
abacab is on with it reminder the team
leader in R&amp;amp;D hi okay so let's start
with your high performance so today
we're going to show you a cool new way
to measure a nice select performance
problems and let's start with the
challenges with existing tools that we
have so we have the debugger of course
which allows us to understand some of
the performance problems this is of
course limited only for the development
time and also is not thread friendly and
we have logs and which also a way to
measure a performance but again it's a
maintenance and it's not something you
can scale with and we have approaches of
code tagging where you co tag and and
then measure times in milliseconds and
put that and report that in order to
understand the performance of the app
and there of course application
monitoring tools and mostly most of the
application monitor tools you will see
today are focusing on network and and
those that do and cover a user
experience and you I am processing a
tent to be rely on to rely on SDKs and
what we're going to show you today is
our approach to a tagless and monitoring
of users directions and the measurement
of the perceive your high performance
okay so we say it's all about the users
actions so and the approach for Apple's
mobile is basically to measure and each
action and when we say use direction and
we mean any and tap swipe launch of the
application any
interaction that is being done by the
end user and we are available to
automatically capture it and measure its
performance and report that to our
servers and so the solution as we said
is tagless and the way that we are doing
this is by tracking the UI updates the
async operations and threads and also in
the network codes that are being
triggered by the user action we provide
information regarding the measurement of
the user action and we also allow to
drill down and to understand a what
happened in the code level and in Europe
and all of this data as I mentioned
before is database that is being sent
from production so you are able with
this tool to view to get a code level
view code level visibility into your
production and mobile application okay
so the way that we do that I'm going to
drill down a bit and to clarify how we
measure the in the DUI response time for
a user action just to make it clear
because everyone here are technical so I
want to elaborate and so you will
understand the technique okay so all of
the UI updates that are related to the
user action we track these and
automatically and the time between the
the action started when the user tap the
action and the last UI update is the
measured you I performance okay now to
to calculate the last you UI update we
basically need to track down what is
going on in there so we do that by and
tracking a all of the async operations
that are being triggered by the action
and end results with UI updates and we
also have some
means to filter out and UI updates that
are repetitive like banners or ads and
to make sure we get an accurate
measurements and in the screenshot you
see here below you see some examples of
a the measurements results so and you
see that we we sort and the user actions
by the the users that are affected by
slow performance and all of these this
is the screen name and the action name
we get this automatically there are also
ways for you to give an alias by
yourself to change that and also an
option to change it in an SDK and you
get and also the response time so that's
the average response time and for a
specific use direction and in the drill
once you drill to them and and to the
next step and you basically get a view
that shows you what happened in the code
okay so and this view and let's go over
each element in this view so we have and
we have the first line which indicates
and what happens in the main thread so
we see for example that there is a the
the inaction always starts with a with
it with some kind of a listener so in
this example its own click it could be
any handler that you've configured for
an action and and and the the line of
the main thread shows all of the code
all of the methods that were executed on
the main thread we see here for example
that we also capture activity sorry a
lifecycle events for example this is an
uncreated vent and uncreate a view by a
fragment and so we captured that we also
capture all of the activity lifecycle
events and and since these lifecycle
event
have been triggered by the onclick event
and even if not directly even if
indirectly through a sink processes we
do capture that and give you a holistic
view that shows you and the UI updates
that were triggered from the the on
click and you also see in the lines
below you see the threads the worker
threads and we have here an indication
of HTTP of network in blue in light blue
and we also have indication of method
and which is orange and so we get all of
this information to you in one view
let's look at some some more examples so
so you'll get the picture so we see here
an example of of an action that starts
with the of course we listener on the
main thread and then it it started an
async test that executed an HTTP request
but at the end there was no and there
was no way update to the UI so if we
take the most big sticker and a acing
pattern in Android which is a async task
and let's say you didn't implement
anything in the on post execute so
that's the that's your example so in
this case the dip the measurement of the
UI from the perspective of the user is
not the entire and a time it took to run
the async method and the HTTP request
it's just the UI updates so we are able
to to give you a view and so you have a
will be able to understand that so in
this example we see that the from the
user perspective the UI responded fast
okay there was no a update to the UI so
this is exactly the difference this is
the essence of the difference between us
and and the other monitoring tools which
look more systematically and give you a
asian about the network so you could
basically be looking at the wrong stuff
you could be looking at something that
takes a network code that takes a huge
amount of time but but it's not
affecting the UI so maybe you shouldn't
solve that at least not solve that first
so when this is a nice aspect to look at
now in second day and a second example
so this is an example where there again
there is a it starts with a a onclick
and there is an AC process and HTTP
request and it leads to an update so in
here probably onpostexecute of some kind
of other and a a delegate to to update
the UI was was implemented and so let's
go to the next example and this is an
example of how you this is actually a
example of a good way to parallel a
network calls so we see here an action
and this is like a search action okay
where you have you need to fetch a lot
of resources from the network okay so
what we'll what we see here and the
implementation is basically we see async
async method running and there are
running parallel and they are mostly a
la aligned and we see that we see that
really visually where with this tool and
this is a bad example what you see here
you see here something which visually
looks like stairs okay and so I I would
I will not say which up this this is it
but but this is an example of
implementation a bad implementation of a
parallel networkers okay so you are able
to view that with our view so this is an
example but you can
like this and to anything that you do
and not only network if you're doing a
sqlite and processing if you do a JSON
parsing anything that it could be time
consuming on the client animations you
will see all of that in in this tool and
we will now see a nicer implementation
sorry this is even worse so this is an a
nicer implementation and of that and
that uses only one in a async task and
avoids the overhead of creating multiple
a async task that really don't work well
in parallel and so and basically this is
a we've shown you an example you can
take that to your own domain your own
implementation and get a really good
nice value out of this and so basically
all you need to do is like a phlegmy
said your instrument the app it works
for both Android and iOS and you get and
you would get the data into apple's
mobile okay and next topic for for us
would be their analytics okay so and so
a lot of being said about eleven oolitic
crashing latex and I think we have a
water ocean showing you today is again
an approach from a unique perspective a
rather than a systematic am monitoring a
way to do that and so we are talking
about what you see here in the
screenshots you see multiple
notifications of messages you've
probably seen this a lot in either the
mobile app you're developing or any any
mobile app that you using and and and
these have a could have a huge impact on
the mobile user experience and so
traditional application monitoring tools
when they talk about errors they usually
talk about HTTPS or errors that you
write out in some SDK call and but but
none really gives the the the stage the
center stage into these messages this a
UI notifications and so basically you
could be monitoring with a traditional
APM solution and you can think of
everything is going well with the app
where the users that are actually using
that are experiencing a lot of these
notifications and and this could and
impact the user experience and the way
people view your app and so let's drill
down a bit to understand what what we
are talking about so we have and we have
a message okay a pop up message it is
shown so I started by saying that this
is the naval but it's it's not an elf oh
sure okay there are n and you can see
this in in these two examples here there
are times where you need to either pop
up a question to the user you need to
notify him about something and it's not
necessarily a nevel okay so at the
challenge that we are facing in the
solution here is to identify not only
identify that the message box and was
raised but also and be able to indicate
if it's an error or not and so we cannot
rely on any tags or keywords to do that
and again icons is not something we can
we can guarantee and so everything that
we have we could work with is text so
our approach and for a for a dissolution
was with the text analysis and so in
here
an example of how you would see that in
Apple's mobile and so basically and we
our approach is to do a text analysis
and which is based on the machine
learning algorithm and and and and and
we are able to classify each message and
as a as an error or not an error so and
and and also we provide an interface in
the Apple's mobile UI to to enable you
to provide your own feedback and improve
improve the results so you can say if
something is not enabled and then you
can tag it is not an error and so you
are able to to also give your feedback
and improve that and align that to your
needs and so basically this one the
point here is this is the this is your
way of getting notifications error
reports about notifications that your
user experience even if this
notification is about the validation
error that behind it there is no HTTP
request or any the trailer or anything
else like that so it's just a message so
you're able to get that with the with
Apple's mobile and also with the more a
complex a use case but is also where
possible in case you have an action that
that has multiple errors and related to
it the for example a HTTP request let's
say a you you have an action you need to
access the network you got a 5x6 some
kind of a better response from the
server and you in a new pop-up
notification to the user then you will
get all of this data together and in
Apple's mobile we are able to group that
around the action around the user action
like
said before like we talked about the
performance in the context of user
action also in here in the arrow
analytics everything that you see is
grouped around the use direction and so
basically you could see and you I arrows
HTTP years and and the SDK errors and
all together in case they really are
grouped around the same action okay
regarding SD carers and so and there are
always cases where heavily will talk in
the interminable about the Croatian
oolitic so personal ethics about is
about unhandled exceptions and so
Apple's mobile captures that
automatically and you don't need to to
add a line of code in order to get that
functionality but there are cases where
you have handled exception you still
would like to report that because that's
something which is abnormal to you and
you would like as a developer to be able
to see how many people get that and in
what scenario they get it and what is
the stack trace and all of the data that
you would get from accession reporting
tool olo reporting tool so the way that
you do that is using a simple API we see
here examples of the API and you have an
optional description that you can attach
to that and and it's automatically
linked to the user actions as we talked
before so again you would get a you
whether you would see and you added a
line of code to report the exception and
it's automatically correlated in the UI
to the user action so you are able to
easily and get to it okay so in the next
next topic is crash analysis by femi
thank you
ok sorry second so just want to mention
that even though most of our examples
are run Android just let me clarify that
most of the things that you see today
also available for a iOS application of
course so let's talk a bit about
crashing analytics so if you are a
mobile app developer I'm sure you're
familiar with the crash analysis there
are many tools some are even free that
are doing crashing ethics so what is so
unique in Apple's mobile so you remember
we were talking about a user experience
approach so the user experience approach
comes here this experience approach an
hour a capability to capture
automatically captured the user action
comes here in the way that we group a we
link on each crush to the user action
okay and we group all the crashes
according to the user actions so we
don't report you a nullpointerexception
in this line happened ten thousand times
what we report is that in this example
for report to you that highest number of
users in this case 260 experience crash
when they hit the Scan button in the
check deposit screen so this way you or
your manager or your product manager a
poner everybody can understand what
happened and can prioritize the crash
that he wants to fix and now yeah you
may argue that for a specific action
that could be different type of
questions in practice in almost in most
of the cases em the crashes of the same
user action are most most wickets are
the same and even if it's a crash that
happens in several user action it still
be available here is the top in the top
action this crush the most so and we see
it in
real life example for customer that this
is a this approach is very much loved by
our customers okay so now once I focus
you on the user exchange question you
understand what happened and you
probably get the desk to fix it so if
you drilled into this user action you
can see the sample of the clashes so
this is an example of a sample of the
crash you see the direction but beside
user action what you see here is pretty
obvious I mean you have the quest log
and the device state and most of these
things and come with almost every tool
however if you can see this one it's the
crash trail so the crossroad wants a
click on the crash tool for this crush
and what I can see here is the flow of
all the actions the user did that led to
the crash so you get the list of
automatically get the list of all the
user actions proceeded across you know
exactly how to reproduce the crush if
you remember before we've seen we have
devised it so we know what is the device
what is the operating system and which
connection was it how much memory was
free memory to memory problem we see the
quest where the quest log and together
with the the the automatic rushed well
we have a full picture that helps us to
to be able to get all the means that we
need in order to have a very good chance
to reproduce the question once we
produce the crash it's usually is it if
it's easier to fix the most of the
problems when you have a bug is to
reproduce it usually and but sometimes
it's not enough to know what were the
actions that that procedure to the
question sometimes you need to know
about a specific logic and that happened
in the code to which server it was
connected what was the state of a
specific flag of something like that in
order to to pinpoint to to get
information about since specific into
your to your code level then you have of
course the breadcrumbs so like I will
show you API about hellos we also have
api that enables you to log a bread
crumbs in strategic places in the code
and to think that will help you solve
the questions that may happen or
anything else so in this way you get the
full picture you get it you know you
know what is the user action this quest
okay so you know to a to prioritize it
ok so you identify the crash and you
know where it happened and is it
important next you get the type of the
error and the crash log the device state
and finally in the quest world the u.s.
reactions right and finally your bread
crumbs that you hopefully already logged
inside it will help you to fix this flow
so this way you have a full picture of
anything that you can get in order to
reproduce the question and eventually
fix it now um if I'm sorry so this slide
shows you the the API in order to lock
the the breadcrumbs that I just showed
you everything of course is documented
in in our SDK the papers that comes with
the SDK now again all the functionality
you get it out of the box but you have
the power to use the API to add more
information and of course the web cams
are linked to
context of the question of user action
and finally if you go if you are the one
that so this information in the apples
you I you may want to depending on your
role and you may want to log a defect
and so we have all the information we
know how to produce what is the
environment what happened where did it
happen in one click you click you see
here the button submitted effect so in
one click you can submit a defect with
all the information about the crash log
and now to put using out what was the
environment and currently we are
integrated into JIRA and HP a HR manager
which is also a SS solution to manage an
edger project and defect management and
this is how you can actually see the
end-to-end we focus you on what to do
what is the question to fix and we also
give you the means to fix it and ok I
think that's about it from my side a we
have we had some questions in there yeah
I mean let me let me start with some of
these questions we just had a couple of
them along the way and some of them were
answered in a written form but let's
just open up to the group one of the
questions was since you're gathering a
lot of information how is this going to
affect in terms of data consuming as
well as battery do you have an estimate
yeah I can take this this is ave and so
we have a white paper that's detailing
all of the do it the way we operate in
terms of resource utility you
transitional device and there is no way
overhead we keep a rate and for the
network that we we do to report the to
our servers so we have a rate for that
network and we also do not operate when
the app is in the background and not to
drain out the battery so all of that is
we have that in a white paper and we'll
try to get that white paper also as an
hand out if it's possible so you can get
a read that and go do that right and I'd
like to add to that you can test us I
mean once you instrument your
application with Apple's mobile one of
the things that that Apple's mobile is
measuring is how how much a data each
service provider each third party is
consuming so you can just go out and try
it and you will see what is the
percentage that is from your application
that is consumed each service and it
includes of course also our cell service
so you can it's it's out there it's
nothing to be yeah great so thank you
hey me and avi there's another question
you know we're gathering again a lot of
information in production how are we how
are we dealing with the user privacy
policy okay
take that so it's it's I mean these two
questions indeed are the first questions
it always stands out and I think we we
are one of the most the product to care
about the the privacy of you uses the
most essentially because our customers
are enterprising our band I mean I think
the banks are the M and our top
customers so what we do so first of all
the data that we keep its not
user-specific the data is aggregated so
every all the statistic that you've seen
are not specific to user XO user why so
which these are aggregated statistics
now if we talk about the DUI that we
measure for example the a button the
label on the button if you have a button
that contains credit card number and we
will not report this number because we
have some mechanism that filter out use
a regular expression filter out these
these patterns these a private numbers
of private strings so we come with
out-of-the-box configuration for the
most common things but you can also
configure your own and you can add on
top of that more patterns that you want
to filter out so this applies not only
to DUI but also to the URLs so if we
measure the network then the power the
parameters is not something that we
report and again you can and you can
configure and filter out any private
pattern to the true relevant to your
application and if it wasn't covered
with us and and same here the technical
white pepper answer this question as
well okay there's a question that we get
quite often from developers that goes
along the lines of that you know there
are a lot of developers that are
monitoring using crashlytics and many
developers just want to know how are you
differentiated from an offering like
crashlytics
sure yet it's a great question so
question latex is it's a free tool and
it's it's a good tool for developers to
to gather information about about
crashes and it does it does it well
however first of all Apple's mobile it
does a lot more Apple's mobile we didn't
see a demo for the full product we just
focus on the isolation stuff a bad
apples mobile measure the first of all
measured all aspect of an user
experience so it's a lot beyond crashes
and so we're talking about total user
experience talking about if you talk i
will show you the UI performance we
measure the response time as the user
perceived in the UI we capture all the
user action we capture arrows network
HTTP network we capture a ellos in the
UI we capture a list of civilization
like a data consumption and battery we
basically monitor everything that impact
the user experience we give you a
unified school for your application
quality we call it the fund X and we
also focus you on what you need to fix
the most if you will search for our
product you will see what I'm talking
about so so one thing is and it will
also have the user flow so it's also and
it has also the mobile analytics yo and
so all these these things the mobile
they like the more user analytics but
also the all the measures the technical
measures it's also brought to to the
product to your managers and maybe I
earn the manager or you're a Oreo p.m.
in a way that they can also understand
it you do not need to be a technical goo
so this is a one thing its just its
critics is good but we do a lot of lot
more the second point is that what I
showed you with the crash analysis that
we group the crashes according to the
user action so this is something that
you will not get a by the free tool we
capture the user action we group the
action according to do
action and when they did when we drill
down you see also the the flow of the
resurrection the crash trailer so these
are the aspect where where we do we
simply do more and more than ready free
too much more and and also will we have
marked the nos and one one more point so
as I mentioned we are part of the HP
software where we develop a PM product
so when we talk about a PM and it's good
that you can identify what is the
slowest action and if what is the
slowest URL that caused the action to be
slow but eventually you're part of the
team that also has a needs to isolate
the backend sometimes so I uppers mobile
is part of the apple sweet and and we
have it so course latex is focused on
the questions for the mobile but we are
proud of a sweet so you can you can
expand yourself and monitor also the
back end or roosting tetek monitoring so
you can do much more with the APIs
okay very good so there are a lot of
mobility teams that may ask you know why
can't I just get some of this
information from google analytics what
would you respond to that okay so a
google analytics is emo of complimentary
a complementary tool google analytics is
focusing on the user analytics so it's
focusing it focuses on tells you what
your users are doing where do they come
from yes it does a little bit of
questioned Alyssa's and things like that
which requires you to use the duress DK
but the focus is do analytics our focus
is first of all to measure the user
experience to know where the problems
are and give you the end-to-end
isolation and we have some now even in
our part as I mentioned will also have
some some analytics for example we have
the user flows okay which is a google
analytics also have the user flows so
the difference here for example is that
we capture and we do the user flows the
user funnel or do the journey however
you want to call it we do it all too
much is so there first of all we do it
automatically it means that we capture
all the screens and the actions and
their flow between them automatically
naoko change you can try us out just ten
minutes after the meeting you can you
can just see your flows and the second
thing is that on top of the flows we
also put the layer of the measurements
the performance in the questions so it's
not only that you see what are the flows
and where users are exiting your
application you can also see if it
happen due to crashes or performance
issue so you
application and the user behavior
for questions
in the in terms of being able to use at
pulse mobile with your mobile
does this increase the size of the of
the mobile app is that going to cause
any overhead there but the other the
other side of this is in terms of time
there are a lot of offerings that maybe
you have to code and tagged how much
time savings could can can you save from
this code listen tagless way of
monitoring instrumenting yes and okay so
and so it's a first regarding the
overhead so the overhead and for Android
is somewhere between 200 and 400 400
kilo bytes and for iOS seats between 500
and 700 a kilobytes you have all of this
information in a white paper and
document that we've attached as a
handout and secondly and regarding it
the amount of time you can save so with
with the with sdk based solutions which
do not have a user action being detected
automatically you basically have to
chase your code and in order to have a
good APM solution you have to chase the
code you have to put a dedicated
developer on your team that is always
working on this that is always working
on making sure that the APM tool gives
you what you what you need and and and
this is not the way it should be the way
it should be taping and tool should work
for you and so we have that in Apple's
mobile you get all of the user actions
automatically weather is for and a user
experience monitoring or for use of
analytics and you also have the power of
the SDK if you want to enrich and the
data but this is again also in cases
where you need to log something which is
really internal to the app and not
something which is generic as the user
action
and thank you very much both of you if
you want to learn more about at pulse
mobile you can go to hp.com mobile and
Emmy and and obvious thank you very much
would you like to share your your emails
in case somebody wants to contact that's
there on the screen so you can go to
hime dot chavali at HP com or avi
cabazon at hp.com and if you have any
questions following up from this they
would be glad to answer those for you
but thank you all very much for joining
us today thank you Eric thank you thank
