my role is kind of a future for my foot
technologies are traveling to tell me
for technical audience like you about
marks next morning on I'm usually very
much more second and and talking about
it is a staff development with web
technologies so my first question to all
of you this is anybody using Windows 8
in red yes and talk with a web developer
point ok there are some guys fresh so
you're done today checking or change
whenever feasible a box you I regarding
the programming model of middle age we
at home can use that technology types
html5 CSS JavaScript to write apps for
Windows 8 and I am entering the truth
you probably all know the good right
cover to mostly small the most on each
end for right away late ok so with the
release of windows lake and some very
basics technology technologies have
changed in windows races we introduced
the cause and you touch surveys the
capability of the racial system to react
goodbye my fingers we optimize earth and
back from up to another perspective he
introduced a new platform that's called
green front I one time is set of 80 is
that we can access from several
languages drive windows 8's when they ex
are also new on Windows platform we
never had abs before we own all this
talk about desktop application for the
network of apps apps nike has for the
iphone it's like apps for the windows or
android now we have concept of apps and
we can really write apps or bit late
these apps are released using the
Windows Store just like you have so
little so i can let you know i console
there you can as a development put your
software and the consumer can install
software director and will be positive
apps you all have you an execution
environment this means that the apps for
Windows 8 a running in another security
context there are new runtime
restrictions for these apps in contrast
to the applications that we used to more
so they do that and from our development
sectors because we have live for
somewhere down there in your face and up
to now after the operation system 7
we only provide estimate vacations and a
problem within 10 right justification of
other desktop applications that are
running under seven continue to run on
windows 8 at least indicating right
desktop applications but this estimate
vacations are optimized for the input
with mouse and keyboard a lot for me
forth in the purpose of beaners so it is
not legal justification people to use
probably see shower visual basic on the
maybe some of you guys of course the
cases see us as a friend of ability
maybe some of you decided to write
applications the veteran well she's that
were running in the browser this was
possible in the past but equality five
now this is eight and as I said before
the windows runtime and the windows
runtime is a set of KPIs that allows
developers at rest for example the
sensors in our edge of the camera of the
bus and this fight storage stuff like
that all the networking stuff and the
interesting thing is that this one time
is implemented natively is part of four
so it's not now as Manish son is a
high-performance part of the operation
system core and it interesting question
for us as Bella bridges how can we use
the window mata how can you ask
everything which language we have
generous will macaanto and now the good
part there might even have different
magnitude step in truth if you already
have implemented software for Windows
Phone then we probably chose ce n'est
plus or shows this message
to use these languages and can access
google not i'm using these languages the
gentleman is can be right our surveys of
sugar glider or by their examples we
have out that exam one nice to see you
your telomere keep our can also be used
now to describe your life if you're
writing successful applications but i'm
using a dictator of this party and we
can now address native entice racism in
front i'm using javascript this means
you can really write native windows 8
applications in javascript initially and
then move around controlling each other
at most our applications you don't need
internet explorer to as a ram and round
11 it's really a job specification I
can't access direct the API is the
operation system using javascript this
is really brave this is really the first
time ever that Microsoft supported and
chance to developers in that way so if
you are a developer effective ever damn
probably in the past it wasn't enough
for was already you probably know but
now you're really just a little too and
later take a little truth and truth and
power feels if you access in fact so
this isn't give you one brightness or s
so som everything the lingual in the
past the school has to be thousands
eight but now we have also the
of ass and these apps can be written in
C job c++ or in javascript is well it's
possible by AP called a blank expression
the middle runtime and provides the
answers to all the operation system
south and consists of several tons of
options and this is not an object and
contain several names faces within
methods and objects and what these
objects are projected into the different
languages by omega is equal length of
section of this latest protection agency
makes it very easy for us as developers
consume 80 is it makes the ice cube
natural is the nexus that use so haha
c-sharp developer when I'm working haha
well as a time and not even noticing
that I'm addressing or in front of
objects when I because since I met so if
I web developer and I'm everything I
mean Atlanta of chicken making
animations for the racism I hope I don't
notice it because because it feels
absolutely natural so for example is a
sharpie up its uses it if you'd want to
access it is not much just as an example
this one and verse with help open is
metadata I don't go disappear just
finish off with random objects provide
numerous major they tell if a user that
is automatically use to project the ad
is into the dance okay so that means you
can use activities to rile up the cash
and what's great about we're checking
the cookie well I think web technology
has evolved a lot in the last year's
with html5 and c3 everybody is trying to
write nice web applications like 10
years ago notice that it wasn't always
easy and we're already very happy left
beijing in five slowly driving around
and then some popular teachers there are
always more of you submitted apps for
example this is a freezer summations up
the animation stuff we have perfected
and late we have served graphic effects
you have the multi-column layout all
that stuff wasn't is in the past p he
hands the screen features the good news
is that with a 10 ciee organization the
extraversion and we support all these
features and engine is used to render
the Middle Ages it's exactly the same
engine as in a tent so every feature
that I attend the thoughts as was
employed in orbit Lakers and I don't
know if you never try by each other
thing we all know that we mess up Alexis
and I think you're gonna really prepare
with a nine and I think you're fine
there is any sense of Monday yes before
I hardware acceleration for some of
these features so they are fast really
much peace but then he has a relation
but likely killed us and I you were
going to interview but I think my
progress are quite addressing concert
kind of my spray in JavaScript or for
example he needs me to score big mouth
theta so what that's for this is the
compete but I think we really small
bottles and all of that we are entirely
to provide a true well being filled at
us this library is called vgs so the job
can likely that some head Lewis
development yes we saw in developing
builds a house it's automatically
delivered whenever you open up the same
as projects based on HTML the
transcripts and this am i stopping that
for some you get some episodes faces you
get some instance provide a dividing you
get some nice UI controls to get some
some occasion follow zeg not very well
you don't really have to use this
language myself ok Phil then if you
don't want to use it throw it out and
one haha like the important is this
process anyone ever for this much in
Johnson you can use promises if you have
glory tasks that you typically have this
calling beckons to if you want to
personally to make it out of every class
and practice takes five seconds to
believe you know the last night and left
you and the waiting for the bus leaves
in the code and your
as was i only use experience and to
avoid this without meters from obvious
is nothing more than a checklist return
really and that continue around whether
we press is fulfilled so promise has a
fan message that is executed when for
example a big reversal response this
magnet like this is nicole your metal
which nestles assaults hr8500 recently
modernised ifs so you can all do the
same page and when I this call returns
which may take some time pinnacle of
data instead then this focus executed so
you don't have to manually what's up
fall back yeah in cash costs moment they
want my advice that is not an idea miles
up and some kind of sannen desu which is
also imperative for subject here so you
use a library's closed possible process
one of the closets does I recommended by
Microsoft and figured little bit later
ok so now and it's out of three so again
we can go to
it's up here and I'll show you good
looking through code and they'll find
out it's really odd fascination as bad
as imagine that other languages c-sharp
beulas aura but we focus on jobs for
today so I'm gonna sweat and then I can
set different champions on the right
hand preview for the chat widget app
will move like and the screen capture
see this is what you like after I silent
and you only know that with a beside
this so you see we got a vicious that
you can put some to them so i'm assuming
twin and smaller and this is exactly the
same edison that only provided a charger
values and super so that's on the rare
occasion i love the passion ominous or
based on the replication sandwich so you
can and take the latest article
your guests will you just buy out the 50
K is your happy this is what it looks
like it's quite a few of us on the date
because it had a nice groove items
several groups oh you have to take your
own dishes of the pie dish vui you can
live on every button get a few of the
group and ok and even either yeah these
are the only item so this is the basic
tempted and always here you will call
out some HTML special moment you want
something or is this a majority of this
antenna this is uh controllers provided
by visions and all the other stock is
quite normal that she loved in this this
is a normal HTML just a better future it
wished um so nothing special here but
this is really depressing because this
is realize what a ass reference so this
is the part where la vie dresses out the
project the whole picture of the
Winchester fantastic yeah sure and we
can't even look at the fabric and
Salvi see our UI Jackson as well and you
can of course check what well the
homeless I can hear and so you Markel
show you exactly what I believe looks
like a hookah pi output and what science
at it will happen set here past an same
possible scholarship or so you have the
initial base yes eh SSS first of all the
extra blankets off 40 nangis i
implemented this we can be quite
pressing you can thank you internet your
own custom UI controls and you wanna
know how I kept a moment ago you can put
them break down here and execute it will
run into the empty pack this I feet
across it's ossified although you should
spend some time i think is all advice
but and if you manage to run your own
custom control things are good some
inspiration okay so like to show you how
to accent skin rather because right now
we really won't see trusted Thunder jump
somebody is foundational to the nation
cause and as you want rather have that
accessing a hammer and as you push will
buy all to the windows on time and find
out of this song has a name probably use
yacht across the ocean allows you to
explore this pace faster services a
little fun time cities are struggling
here to windows yeah it was you
and then as I want to access the cameras
every search for it you get some risk
besides here and we see the nature of a
class one and we can see why and from as
metal pot spacing and this really
awesome so I have two is a trigger
memories of us managed and a secret
agent reporting live from Tokyo
subsequent a picture so I remember wheel
chair caster camber castle I go back
into what chairs and starts having here
what we got a camera object and it's no
because it turns out the ball with us
dot me on so I eerie has Alexis gonna be
a capture come on everyone
an animal and goes and buys it and
provide the level take a photo of you
and as a living in a context to the news
while the actual excessively allowed to
access the camera so we do this in our
cake boutique you said about that excess
what kind of no no that's not a little
patient again we press them hey you look
the apples to memory and each other yes
so and what was the Larry King show this
that really want ace two lines from
transcripts bigger two texts the camera
and then you're in an Asian Tour de la
crisis and all you have to do this is
the Sun and object of certain namespace
the name a star village every knows and
that is all fit naturally because as so
this is really powerful and it has to be
signing indications you also provide
various tools called left when you just
goes boom us for developers to my sport
science in trust your name or a you
really have to just try line between
visits no Jacob you like sorry by
separating charge group and stillness so
if you have designer was to design your
application only a net and and then this
application opens your everyone exactly
the same profile
that is sending the same fights as to
you and this service and you I'll
tonight for siding applications of white
Solomon's click into your and sign in
DUI and see a horizontal course an essay
about this party agree and I say okay
that's at loose i believe abolish
compile and Zeus latests powder doing
goes below me and s we and okay so it
was a little bit like a very simple
smoothly you can focus but there's
something more honorable a good thing it
is that by small rhythm you probably see
and you can hear kind of a simulated
tingling in the middle and the race a
great thing about it is that the
application that I'm writing and in here
that I'm signing right now is actually
really right so it's not just more of
the design but I hope you likes of you
it's actually really running with live
shake so if you have in the minute
application doesn't see it from the
internet in the designer is running
inside beta in your verification that is
the countdown you can watch the time
counting down if you want to interact in
the application you can put us in the
sitting room in the exit move this is
the Sun here in another here for example
our next witness
same group and you go back to sign wash
and now I am NOT a motor can decide
another element for somebody Oh me again
and intergroup idea big sigh room beside
glass and set the color again soon as
ever okay and let's pitch so this is a
really nice food costs you really our
society live data network says they are
working height edge of your jorb can you
swim it left right so that's one motion
that I would make sure that's a great
Civil nail you probably haven't woken up
if you remember you don't have too much
different vices gave it a thought maybe
you know that I you support I think once
my lousy son will survive with lace
tests right now and is Sir creaseless
and probably want you to know what your
vacations like on a 10 inch screen or
very free industry or maybe an eighth to
this and that's why is not your
application silver then is nicely window
pops up okay like Taylor and
takes a little yes the old and you can
now switch the difference in size so
from 10 16 inch towards a 23 you at
seven six meses and you see what your
education good night look like on
effexor industry and actually different
yes so you can see that you is your
screen sizes I've never saw that one for
this oil the luminol previous reviews a
nice thing about the city name is that
is actually not just run time
environment perhaps but simulated but
it's very much for the windows 8 machine
come if you press on the start button
down here you get into stock menu and
this submenu should you if you go back
if I go back to my I also happen to you
probably see that this is exactly the
same the reason is that this simulator
is realized using a remote desktop
connection for pc so i have my complete
environment and where will be see in the
simulator this is possible because help
Esther in my see you later hey you
should believe it and okay so having
said this that's one more thing if you
are not together you only have already
written
or have used several jobs in libraries
maybe you were too jquery make your own
no matter what as long as you said the
technologies change the variable that
you can be used instead of your coat
from that in Windows Store and so we had
some mixing in and probably liver and
one line of my assessment say is if you
already have the skills to implement web
site in all of technologies you probably
know opportunities to get side
implementing to the store acts whether
the US alone is the new API if you want
to press open access the camera or some
sung Sai guys that you should for us
basically and is already knows if you
are interested in learning applications
on your left Nash my app will find
information you need air if you have
company asada and are interesting in
getting free software Microsoft just go
and check out this market only support
Styles is free software this is a real
friend over-consuming i think you get me
suboxone ever broke for free as long as
you're under the definition of Sodom
okay and that's it if you any questions
please speak up now or in every camping
near after doing some research networks
Master should be ours is they reduce
dependence right guy settings and sizes
and finally said points for such as they
are back really hot attachments mom and
most of the Hawaiian Islands Liquor
