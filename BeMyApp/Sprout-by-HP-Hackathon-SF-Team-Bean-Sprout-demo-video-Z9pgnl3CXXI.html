we are being sprout I am Eve this is
Charles cheer and using Vince trout a la
home owners to design the home and
remodel it easily the features that we
offer our sketch of flow flame from this
broad mat and convert it into a 3d model
on the sprout money to scan or download
an item to a treaty library and place it
on the capture sketch apply wallpaper
walk around the sketch in the first
person view 3d print a miniature models
the future feature that will be offering
will include adding a library of
building construction symbols to change
those windows frame etc allowing video
conferencing and screen sharing
capability dimensioning a sketch saving
the sketch to the cloud and easily
sharing it we are targeting the home
renovation model the landscaping
interior design industry according to
the US census bureau there were over a
hundred and thirty two million housing
units in the US alone as of 2013 and
home owners are spending about 130
billion dollars in remodeling projects
and as you can see on this graph this
trend is not slowing down anytime soon
or target customers are the home owners
of course but also the home improvement
stores like the home depot lowes etc HP
will develop strategic partnership with
those five thousand-plus doll to show
and us bring the creative excitement
back home all other CAD tools on the
market are designed for professionals of
you as you know it but bean sprout on
the other hand is for the everyday maker
even your grandma thank you so this is
bean sprout and she's going to start
drying some walls we have some simple
walls but um so this pen is actually
what comes with the tablet so you notice
that as she's drawing the walls the the
walls are being rendered in real time as
she's drawing them and so right now the
walls are scaled down a little bit so
that it's easier to kind of see over
them but the chairs and furnitures and
sup their size to the
standing there which is actually a
maximal character by the way so right
now yeah the drawing interface which
ones have together from scratch this
weekend includes features such as you
know connector joints and such and let's
check out the furniture placements so
you can use your fingers to actually for
furniture placement so great I know that
we have some furniture we can go into
first person view and I use the arrow
keys to walk around yeah so you're just
that guy who is standing there and now
you're walking around so for simplicity
the walls are kind of a little bit
shorter than they are so you can kind of
see outside of your room but you can now
kind of see what it looks like as you
walk around the chairs are kind of
looking kind of funky there we'll go
back into this view we can change
wallpaper and let's draw some more walls
well draw a new wall and so now we have
a weird pink wall uh yeah so basically
everything was kept from scratch
including this hammer j/s space
javascript paper JS hammer jas right
those are the two frameworks that you
use some she had together this same from
scratch and that's actually her first
time using javascript rain works so this
is unity based so we're actually
communicating through loko host this is
as you can see just a regular of local
hosts web browser communicating to unity
and it's updating per second it can be
updating faster but I didn't want to
overload the sprouts so the idea is that
you can sprout beans or objects in this
case their furniture but the beans can
be real beans are you know trees and
other 3d objects place them around and
also dynamically generate Pachulia it's
usually generate 3d meshes such as CM
walls that you can then on 3d print and
you know steer from different angles and
stuff and interact with and kind of
design your home and that sort of stuff
and how much time do I have left okay 30
seconds let's see do we want to
demonstrate more features or and there's
multi-touch support but it's a little
bit on a buggy side again this was
passing over from scratch and why don't
you talk about your experience having
this together yeah uh okay you don't
want to talk about it okay yeah so it's
kind of a half you sort of interface
currently in a sense that the connection
it while anyways its client server on
localhost so and that's unity okay cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
