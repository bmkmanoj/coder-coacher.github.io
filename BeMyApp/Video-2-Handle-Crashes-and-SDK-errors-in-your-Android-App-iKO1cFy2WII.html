look again at HP at pulse mobile for
android in the previous video I showed
you how at post mobile already provides
you with a lot of information by just
wrapping your app with the SDK if you
want more information to show up in your
app pulse dashboard you can do that with
extra statements in your code there are
two method calls for that first i will
show you breadcrumbs breadcrumbs are
basically log statements that allow you
to gather information internal to the
app from any place in the code second I
will show you how to report caught
exceptions let's quickly look at our
demo app it is a Notes app and I already
have two notes now I will add a new one
I type the title I tap the back button
and say yes and now the app has crashed
let's see how we can use the app host
SDK to figure out what is going on let's
see how breadcrumbs work first you need
to add the app post mobile library to
your project in Android studio you do
that by adding a reference to the jar
file to your build.gradle file
in the last video we could see the app
crashed with an illegal argument
exception in this class it would be
interesting to see how many notes there
were so let's add this statement
after building the APK we need to wrap
it again with the sdk
so I have distributed the app and it is
used let's see what extra info shows up
in the dashboard we look again at the
crash here grouped around the action tap
the yes button we open up the crash
trail again we see the last action was
tapping the yes button and then here
this is new we have the breadcrumb
showing that we were about to save the
data for three notes the other thing you
could do via the SDK calls was to report
exceptions crashes are caused by
exceptions that are not caught by your
code so called unchecked exceptions now
Java forces you to catch so called
checked exceptions by catching you make
sure that your app doesn't crash but you
might still want to collect information
about these checked exceptions you can
do so by reporting the exception via the
app pulse SDK let's see how you can do
that so here we have a few silly lines
of code in the catch block we add this
line of code again you build the project
and wrap the APK with the SDK now if we
look in the dashboard we do not look at
crashes but errors like crashes errors
are grouped around actions we can go
into this action we see the exception we
can choose to display more info and then
we see the whole stack trace of the
exception thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
