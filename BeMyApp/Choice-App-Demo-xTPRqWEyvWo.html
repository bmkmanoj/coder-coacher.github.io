million children in the world we're risk
of starvation there's a family going on
in the Horn of Africa and something so
small as a dollar a day and feed their
big Luhrmann's they know but it's very
simple fact the mainstream media is not
covering this in our daily basis you go
to the front page of The Wall Street
Journal it'sit's parities no longer
topical doesn't stay current the new
cycle fact for most people knowing that
two million people are at risk of
salvation is going to die it's a very
hard thing to swallow it's very big
thing so we want to be able to reduce
that to something very small very
relatable great understand also when you
want to donate donor webstart many of
the donation options are practice so if
I were wondering how far my daughter go
it's very hard to be able to compare
these things it's worth mentioning
before I said what we do is it doesn't
exist it please and are compiled phobic
created is a poor choice choice is the
philanthropic chocolate what that means
is you'll be able to find out exactly
what your dollar value convert to in
terms of development a horse nonprofits
so if we put in three dollars into the
ass it'll generate a list of what is
that we'll be able to do for somebody as
you can see we have two items in the
list of three dollars as measles
vaccines rehydration salts one of those
rehydration salts plus very very little
but it will save a life so maybe I'm
curious three dollars and that was
pretty easy what else could I do if I
can't leave it more money maybe is like
a ten dollars I might be able to make
more impacted as I increases now
information about the kind of items i
provide people around the world kind of
impact I could mass produce a very small
side so just a people on here go
storybooks for example we know that what
course one sec UF's the user experience
with an existing now maybe you don't
want to give seventeen dollars today if
you'd like to share for deployment this
kind of information so you can go into
these little factoids and and tweet them
out so as you go through the number of
what you'll notice is de facto it down
bottom will change so each tweet well
for the most part beer you mean if we go
through and tweak something now its
associated Twitter maybe we'd like to
say hey Vera or hey be my app did you
know that $10 buys three story books
like that can educate three kids
football that's pretty cool very simple
as you can tweet that and that's how it
goes so the the very succinct
explanation of this is it cool and
profit calculator that lowers the bar to
information on the impact you can make
in the world this is where we are to
debt our objectives are twofold the
first is to raise awareness of the
economy impact you can make and also to
apply the people are suffering around
the world so that will be one of our
metrics if we see people putting this
out telling their friends and I think
that would be a pretty good ND to
indicate
run something the same thing is true in
money terms our people donate if they
are you're onto something we should
expand that burger at which point we can
create the marketplace the next step
moving on past Minimum Viable non-profit
will be looking at being able to create
a similar marketplace the one stop shop
where you would go to be able to buy to
donate all of your front foot needs
where Oxfam Red Cross and Yusef all come
together like I said before this does
makes it selling point equals the red
crosses in front of people you serve as
other people quite ill with malaria
foundation there is no singular source
to make it really easy on people like
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
