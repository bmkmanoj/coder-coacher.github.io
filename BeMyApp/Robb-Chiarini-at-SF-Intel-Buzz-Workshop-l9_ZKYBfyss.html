happy titles rising tide I want to thank
Intel for inviting me out I wanted to
thank them for actually running this
initiative I'm a big fan of mine sure
like people getting together and talk
about things and hopefully you know
prevent catastrophes maybe if we all
knew a little something maybe this tie
to be a little earlier save the Titanic
whatever probably not probably not
alright so eSports the buzzword how many
of you probably have heard about eSports
right and this is a very famous picture
it's been around the internet been
around media circles for quite some time
this is League of Legends circuit 2013
season three finals in the staple center
you know big show a lot of people
understand that this is the major thing
and when marketing guys and people hear
about eSports is what they're thinking
about most the developers are talking
about eSports are thinking about this
thing this is the thing that they want
and they want it because it's huge and
it's massive and it's awesome and people
forget that just even in 2011 this was
their very first season finals in the
back of Dreamhack with tables with pipe
and drape around with gaff tape to the
table and things like that and this is
you know the premier eSports in the
world for most people as they consider
it and this is the reality where most
people are at when they're starting up
in eSports program if they're like hey
we've got a new game were coming out
you're not at the last slide you're not
even at this slide this is after the
game had been out for a couple of years
and it built to this level and this was
a different time in era right so we
talked about eSports definition
electronic sports specifically played
between professionals in a pvp format
player versus player right now there's
no acceptance of PvE we're not playing
against the machine's not the old-school
Donkey Kong's and things that's not
considered eSports that's considered a
cool challenge right so I broke these up
into some categories in genres we don't
have the normal three-hour tour that I
have to do something like this so we
have 30 minutes we're going to kind of
go high level for some of these things
talk about fighting games you talk about
big titles like Street Fighter mortal
kombat super smash brothers if you look
at FPS titles the call of duty's the
Halos the counter strike goes or major
players in the space we look at the MOBA
area league of legends dota 2 smite and
heroes of the storm coming up and lastly
we've got real time strategy with
starcraft 2 you know each of these have
come their own way they've all had
different success stories about how
they've gotten to the sports market
traditionally fighting
aren't necessarily considered eSports
but they've been around the one of the
longest it had a great community that's
kept that seen alive that now they're
finally able to take advantage of
monetizing that be able to support that
from a publisher level so it's just an
interesting path where some of the other
titles have had such mainstream success
that eSports is kind of something they
wanted to add on to it and something to
amplify what they already do it's a
little bit about the ecosystem okay this
is a great shot from new zoo did a
report on eSports recently so scene out
of this it's a lot of complexity they're
actually speaking much to the economy of
the ecosystem here more so than the
actual structure but because they're
dealing with that they are dealing with
the structure in some ways things I want
to call it specifically is we've got our
publishers the guys who create the game
and ultimately responsible for the
sustainability of the ecosystem for the
competition you've got teams and players
which is always highlighted but I add
talent and influencers to this as well
because while you need to have the pro
players playing it and inspiring people
to watch and play you also need the
talent in the shout casters and the
people that can actually commentate on
the gameplay and explain to you the
story and what's happening I think there
is crucial as the players themselves and
overlooked quite often lastly brands and
I'm gonna love brands and everything
from the mainstream brands that were
used to seeing the sponsors and things
of that nature to the endemics to the
non endemics as well as events leagues
es el es el won the events and things
like that and lastly content the leagues
and the events and all this activity is
generating content and really what we're
doing with eSports is creating content
which is interest to engage and
re-engage customers and allow them
opportunities for us to place things
whether it's placing our own DLC placing
expansions of the game placing brands
whatever that might be that's an
opportunity for us to expose them just
like television or anything else is okay
as of now the platform of choice is PC
in the eSports world yes some of those
games are played on console but that's
not the preeminent platform it's PC and
it's because you're able to own the
experience unlike you can on consoles
you talk about pvp net battlenet steam
when somebody goes to one of these
locations and plays the game they're
immersed in
the entire experience that company
controls what they view what they see
what streamed what's popped up in front
of them everything about that experience
is owned on a PC that's not quite there
yet on a console level okay so you're
all playing with in this whole ecosystem
in a single place okay another piece
that people miss you know of the
opportunity PC is offering an
opportunity that consoles don't
traditionally because of the breadth of
sponsors and partners that are available
in the space you talk about an Xbox you
only have so many levels of peripherals
that you can get into when you talk
about pcs you have a wider breadth of
things everything from video cards to
chipsets two displays to all kinds of
peripherals that aren't necessarily
available on a console but not only for
the ecosystem itself from the publisher
perspective but what's really crucial is
the availability to the players players
are what make eSports work there are the
things that we aspire to be just like
any other sports organization we watch
MJ and LeBron because they're superstars
and they make that thing look great and
we would love to be at that level as
well so the pro players are what make it
happen these sponsors allow those pro
players to do this for a living they're
able to position their involvement in
any sport against these sponsorships to
allow them to have it for a job so talk
about money and time with all things
right everything's about money and time
money and specifically talking about the
players not the publisher and what we're
getting out of running an eSport you're
talking about these guys need
opportunities they need to recognize the
game is fun because they won't play it
if it's not but is the game competitive
will it be sustained by the publishers
are they going to keep it up they're
going to balance so they can a patch it
is there a large enough audience can
they position their involvement against
this game and the content and the
sponsors to make a living or are they
just going to go play the other game
instead of playing this game so they
look at this holistically like sure this
new game is out it's exciting but is it
going to be something that I can
transition to and this is from a player
level but even a team level if you look
at a team EG or any other teams out in
the space if they're thinking about
bringing on a new team new players for a
new game they're like okay what is our
monetization strategy against this game
are we can be able to bring in five
players in an alternate in a coach and
be able to bring enough revenue to
justify us playing in
that from the audience perspective from
a direct money perspective and time it's
one thing that's overlooked a lot as
publishers we're trying to get out there
and get marketing which I'll talk about
in a minute but for an eSport to
actually be sustained it needs time the
game needs to launch needs to be out it
needs to be broken fixed fixed broken
played with a bit the meta needs to
evolve you know there's always going to
be issues with the game good or bad the
community needs to get built who the
heck is going to watch who's going to be
a part of this who's going to play this
if they don't have time to build and
have excitement around that and lastly
the talent that I spoke of earlier we
need those commentators shout casters
observers the guys who actually play or
utilize the tech or explain it to us
they need time to learn the game and
understand the meta and be able to talk
to you about deep details that can make
you understand what's going on all right
so models so I didn't get into structure
so much because we don't have time for
this much but at a high level I put
together some models of the industry
here so when is the community model
essentially they're running it for you
you don't control it you might support
it you might not you might just let it
go there's a classic example of the
fighting game community for the longest
time is because they just haven't had
the ability to sustain or support a
competitive scene so us organizers have
done it ourselves over the years we just
run tournaments and we support off off
ourselves you know it's not really
eSports because the defining moment for
eSports is can players create a living
out of this can they stop going and
doing another job and do this thing if
they can't and it's not really eSports
in the in our sense here and of course
obviously there's an existing an active
community duck as they're running it for
you right so that that exists in the
world for them another one is the earned
it and their earn it comes in two ways
either you earned it by having the
biggest game out there and you have a
huge audience and you can choose to have
an eSport right you've sold 60 million
copies of the game congratulations hey
guess what we're gonna do eSports
because we can or you've earned it the
right way well not I'm not saying that
the right way let me take that back
you've gone the right roads you've
created an eSport from the get-go you've
actually developed that as your strategy
not as an alternative to what you've
done traditionally right this is what
you've done to do this congratulations
to that sanal alternative model it's
your primary model perhaps maybe you
have an existing community in the idea
that you've built it the
aight way yes you have a community
because you've developed it through the
beta through the time periods of that on
the other side just because you've sold
60 million copies doesn't mean that
people are gonna be interested in
watching a competition for the game
right they just might like playing the
game that does mean they want to watch
people play it different demographics um
another mode for doing this is a quality
tactic hey we're in this space our
competitors doing it we should do it to
keeping up with the Joneses and lastly
it's the wonÃ­t group and this is all
the new games that are coming out right
and even some that are existing in the
space they want it they want to be any
sport for some reason whether it's a
they want to be in the club you know
maybe there's a game that was out 12
years ago that's got a resurgence
they're redoing and they're like we had
a tournament seen years ago we want that
again we were we were the top dog we
want to have this again whatever their
motivations you know maybe the game
lends itself to competitive play and
because of that they're like well we
should be any sport whatever the case is
equality tactics and fur let's assume
that there's no community with this
there might have been a community 12
years ago there might be some people
that have been around for a long time
that have been playing but that's not a
thriving eSports community in the common
sense of the term where people are
actively playing participating in
watching competition so tactics is my
favorite part so when I talked to the
marketing folks when I talk about okay
so we've got this new game that's coming
out and they go into their toolbox and
they pull out their ad hammer right
they're going to make a commercial and
for the most part our marketing guys
know how to make a commercial for the
game they know other demographics they
know what partners they work with they
do the agencies they take out their
hammer and they hammer in their their
commercial stuff and just like any other
hammer sometimes they hit their thumb
right they hurt themselves they missed
their mark a little bit maybe the
commercial didn't quite resonate they
wanted to but for the most part they
understand that tactic and how to do
that right this is why eSports are
nunchucks all right they're cool like I
pull these around people love these like
hey check out the nunchucks like if I
gave you these write by hand these do
you like those are cool you know what
they are right you get it you see it you
visualize you know what that is but that
does not mean that you know what the
hell to do with those things and if I
left you alone for five minutes you'd
probably end up hitting yourself in the
face and giving yourself a black eye or
you might be able to use that and hammer
a commercial right you might be able to
actually use that for something and do
something out of
you might have some success you might
knock out that guy behind you because
you want to but the idea is that it's
not a traditional tool that you would
use right just because you have
nunchucks whoops and one doesn't make
you this guy just because I give it to
you does not mean mastery because you
have a game takes time it takes patience
it takes learning to be able to master
something like that hope that resonates
a little bit so for me if I if I have
any message I send to you and you guys
take away from this is that try you
don't have to try and build eSports the
goal would be to try and create a
community of competition that thrives
and sustainable that people enjoy let
other people call you eSports don't go
out there don't be pretentious and say
that you can play in the same space as
other people right take the time do it
right build your competition build your
community because you cannot make it an
eSport sure you could pay you can pay a
lot you could pay and develop something
and have a series and have some people
participate that doesn't mean you're
going to get the viewership might means
you have good congratulations on your
two thousand viewers good job but the
idea is that you can't make this happen
the community decides the consumer
decides if you're going to be an eSport
right but you can certainly take steps
to make sure that you're not you can
develop things in the game that break it
you might be able to might put the
features and feature sets and tools in
it that you need to be able to be an
eSport so what are we going to try and
do we're going to try and do and create
competition and influence the things and
focus on the things that you can do to
make it successful so things that are in
within your control and that you can
influence the game and and I know
there's a lot of developers so don't get
boo boo about making a bad game it's not
about making a bad game it's about
making a good game that has the tools
and is set up to the eSports compatible
or competition compatible right it has
to have the things that they need in a
pvp it needs to be entertaining to watch
all the things that are exciting for
somebody to be participate in and to
view and watch don't launch broken
anything if you know that matchmaking
doesn't work don't lunch it or because
deadlines are reality right we can't
always choose when we launched a game
don't go hard into competition if you
know that there's something broken
that's going to affect your
competitive plans don't launch that part
of it yet push it back because all it's
going to do is going to magnify all the
things you've done wrong and then you'd
be in the media look at this game it's
broken again you know you know look at
this can't match make your have funny
videos made of you and if that's the
direction that you want take of that but
I wouldn't recommend it it's my job to
tell you not to do that so another one
is monetization this is a fun one so
ideally you're going to create some kind
of strategy that isn't going to just
piss off and irritate your consumers
announcing that you have an eighty
dollar DLC before launch or right at
launch it's going to make people go
insane it's going to affect the better
of the game like when does that come out
how does that affect the gameplay you
know as a competitive environment we
don't like big bumps like that we like
manageable ones that we know what's
coming and understanding but from this a
consumer point of view we all we all
know this is just an industry problem
right we're like how do we make more out
of a sixty-dollar game that we need to
do for a hundred million dollar
investment we understand that but it's
about when you messaged it and how you
message that and another option is not
to have a monetization strategy maybe
you have a different measure of ROI
maybe you're looking at market share
maybe you're looking at just keeping up
with the Joneses right if you just want
to keep the game out of the previews bin
during a very specific cycle and other
games coming out whatever your reasons
are those are your own we have to
develop those as a company and
organization in a brand what you want to
do with that and lastly and probably the
most importantly is the tools and
features similar to the game itself and
make sure the game has the things that
work we talked about the tools and
features that you need and if we focus
on we want to enable players to play
with each other we want players to be
able to create content if we look at
those aspects because that's essentially
it its core what eSports is just at a
very high level we want to put tools in
here that allow them to do those things
and maybe allow the community to take
off and do some things without you right
maybe they can take a leap start and
start going through some of the pains on
your behalf give them matchmaking give
them the ability to do custom custom
matches lands spectator observer
functionality create things that allow
them to create things for you and the
brand build those into the game because
this with or without eSports is still
viable right it's stuff that you can
still do that's going to help you create
messaging and activity around the game
far after launch beta 0 beta beta beta
beta ideally again now we're talking
about not free to play models here as a
role because free to play models usually
have a longer beta but we're talking
about our disk space models which is
like the pain of suffering of most of us
is not using beta as a pre-launch right
before a pre-launch activation it's not
a pre luncheon it's just a glorified
demo right we're talking about using
beta as a tool both to test and try the
things to avoid them from being broken
later when you launch but also is to
start driving activity and testing
things you can implement some
competitions during a beta and see how
it goes and what works and what doesn't
work is the community resonate do they
hate it they're like move we don't like
the idea of competition with this game
but you can try these things during a
beta because it's beta and you have that
window of time to be able to do that you
have to be careful of your messaging but
this gives you an opportunity to do just
that develop internally this is about
investing in your teams people like me
maybe there's eSports people that you
need on there to help bring some
knowledge inside the groups maybe you
work on developing talent people who can
use the observer mode or whatever those
kings are as you're developing long-term
what are your plans for this what do you
want to do with this game how can you
bring that internally instead of paying
some other dude to do it for you perhaps
right study your competitors these are
all things that you should do anyways
like what see what's going on in the
industry what are other people doing
what are the success is they having you
know what contexts could we make
directly instead of having it ourselves
are you or have somebody else going
through a middleman how can we go direct
to somebody how can we make a
relationship you know go and compete
send some people to go in other people's
games and try it see what their
experiences what are they doing right
what are they doing wrong what could we
iterate on what do we want to do
differently in our game how can we
change how can we be better do the work
it's hard because that everybody wants
to do that they want to rely on reports
and other people's but sometimes you
have to get your hands dirty and sense
of people to do it and then lastly
support externally community as I
mentioned sometimes the community will
run with this for you and ideally they
would even if you're running a league
and things they're still doing stuff
because they're that engage that they
want to do that stuff they want to
organize their own things right identify
leaders support them it's not always
about money sometimes just tweeting
about them and reposting hey there's a
tournament in case you're wondering
about stuff you know social media
activity things go a long way for
organizer like oh my gosh
that big company actually mentioned to
be in a tweet and now i got fifty
thousand retweets awesome look for
talent you need people that know your
game as well as you do or ain't better
right we need people that can understand
and break down a game that can play it
that can explain it to other people and
lastly the teams and players you know in
an eSports model a competition model
these are your marketers those big-name
guys those big name teams are the guys
that are out there saying the good
things about your game they're the
things that people living up to just
like the LeBrons and the Michael
Jordan's and such those are the
aspirational people that kids look up to
that want to be like so speaking of
disc-based games legacy issues so here's
a struggle that we have with the pre and
post marketing budgeting messaging who
wins it's difficult so in the
traditional sales model non free-to-play
talk about the big triple a is making
games and like how do we deal with this
we put we punch a game down we sell it
everything is based on the front end
side right because there's about a
window about this big that's going to
allow us to sell that game and after
that we're in the used bin we're marked
down forty percent there's another game
coming out we have a small window most
of us have a window to launch a game and
actually monetize on that so it's all
about building excitement anticipation
we need mass audiences for these massive
titles right we need to have huge
amounts of numbers it's not just eSports
guys because they're you know there's
this much then there's all these other
people in the in the community right
that we need to sell to so eSports is a
tactic not the whole enchilada for most
things you know I'm sure every one of us
has a marketing guy on our team that he
could actually you tell you if you give
me X dollars I can turn you X units on
that does anybody anybody have a
marketing guy like that almost every
single one I've ever gone to is like
okay my brand guy if you give me half a
million dollars that's going to
translate to this many units because I'm
going to do this tactic this tactic in
this tactic be mindful one big concern
about what you do pre-launch post launch
what message that you send are you too
competitive are you're not competitive
enough are you embracing your community
do they care what's going on with this
stuff you know do you make it seem like
you're doing some silly thing on the
front end but want to do something
serious on the back end how do people
react to that are they be like I'm not
going to play that game they had clowns
at their launch event I don't want no no
you know how do you deal with that you
need to be aligned with that internally
when you start looking at these
competitions in these games
this for me is the competition space so
if we say that bullseye way over in the
corner is the perfect eSport you know
we've got other rings out there where
people are using eSports tactics or
competition tactics to be close right
like hey we're running tournaments we're
supporting the community there's a lot
of things that you can do in that space
that's considered eSports and
competitive but there's this whole other
space out here that we get to play in we
could do competitive gaming we don't
have to make it easy for sui could do
tactics we can support communities
whatever the case is but there's no
right answer right now in the stand this
target where it's at right now five
years from now it won't be there what
works today is not necessarily going to
work tomorrow and lastly if I had to
channel my nastradamus and do some
predictions because I'm always asked for
these things you know I see more and
more games are going to be using
competition tactics pre-launch you know
we've had tournaments around forever
right before there was eSports people
have been running events at PAX running
tournaments and things like that come
win a thing right that's happened
forever but now the expectations have
changed a little bit because you soon as
you start doing that people like is this
eSports right is this what you're doing
and so there's always that question with
that I see a lot of attempts at post
launch programs there's a lot of reasons
why they're going to and I'll talk about
that a minute but there's going to be
more more people trying to attempt a
program post launch and see what happens
with that with varying degrees of
success this new genres I mentioned
before those for big blocks maintained
almost every single eSport that's active
right now that's meaningful there's
competition and some other things but
nothing like that so I see people going
to try and stretch the genres and go I'm
going to play in this blue ocean over
here and see if I can make something of
it that's not expected PvE trials again
eSports right now is PDP and I can see
people trying to integrate PvP
experiences and trying to justify some
kind of competitive environment around
that i'm not sure i've had a few people
talk about that i just don't see it
being viable yet because the excitement
of like he put up a high score it's not
the same as like trashing another team
right now large brands we've already
seen this some big brands coming in and
attaching to programs but i think
they're going to be some very specific
ones in the coming months where you're
going to see some very large brands
attaching themselves to specific
programs for variator reasons but and
trying to help influence and grow
eSports in a way as I mentioned before
about some of the post launch programs
being ill fated the platform Wars
beginning right so right now pc is the
king for the top level eSports sorry
guys who play call of duty things i'm
not saying Xbox is bad but the idea is
that right now pc is the king of that
stuff and i'm going to see other
consoles fighting against each other and
pc to try and earn some share of that as
well as you've got the mobile market
going we want to be sports too you know
good luck but the idea is like you're
going to see more and more people being
positioned against platforms and some
being put in a position that they're not
really any sports so they're going to
run the course of that programmer then
gone and leaving what we're right where
are the players that wears a community
to left out after that interactive
broadcasts we've seen some fun things
with twitch what they did the twitch
plays Pokemon and things like that I
know that people are trying to develop
technologies around how do we allow the
consumers to compete or play or mess
with or help the teams that are playing
could they choose a map could you is
maps picking a banding gone and the
community interactively chooses it what
ways can we integrate the consumer
instead of just watching it how can we
get them to play and be a part of it so
youtube announced that they're working
on their live broadcast finally getting
at going so we're gonna see a little
broadcast war i think coming i feel that
twitch and youtubers start going to head
head which is great for us frankly it's
awesome for us for them to start
fighting and trying to innovate on each
other and create new things i think we
are going to win out of that the most
and lastly i think that we're going to
have a lot more pro teams because of
some of these other items wanting
upfront contracts to be participating in
a program like hey oh well we'll develop
a team but we want guaranteed this and
that because we don't know if it's going
to continue on past six months three
months a year so if we want their
amplification if we want their
involvement they're going to want to be
contracted in a way which is kind of
good kind of bad as there's pros and
cons to all those things so couple
takeaways can't tell him a star wars fan
to go oh yeah so uh you know not every
game is meant to be an eSport sorry not
without happening they're not all
eSports but they can many of them use
competition tactics right they can use
tactics and tournaments and things that
could bring them close to that and maybe
not play in that space but benefit from
some way other success models like maybe
your
not of starcraft 2 sorry you're an RTS
but that does mean you can follow the
same path that they did because somebody
else had success doesn't mean that
you're going to have that that goes well
in life that's a life lesson take that
home with you because that's on the side
for you aligning goals internally about
pre and post launch activities how you
deal with that and then overall
determining the ROI like why are you
doing this what are you trying to get
out of it identify that because it's
going to help you align what you want to
do in the end of that and like I said
before the space as it is now is not
going to be that space very long thanks
any questions mentioned that the mobile
tournament stuff maybe not as successful
I know that the first free-to-play game
that I worked on we actually after the
fact but oh hey maybe we should run some
tournaments on weekends and stuff like
that and we saw one in five of our
customers is just people who downloaded
became paying customers so we were way
above the normal percentage and the
normal weekend spend during tournaments
was twenty bucks apiece for all those
guys so that was averaged it was pretty
good and I just I think you can do it in
mobile I think you just have to have a
special case where mobile works for that
and vainglory is a great game like
they're doing great things are trying to
grow along the east coast path and so
what I'm saying is about the eSports
about the professional players creating
a living out of that don't see that but
that's actually an eSports tactic that's
a competition tactic that's great
running tournaments and doing those
things for activity I applaud that I
totally feel that that's going to be a
viable thing for four platforms like
mobile as a matter of fact mobile
bedding and things along those lines
people are trying to get into that space
that will definitely work and that goes
right in line with that I just don't see
professional mobile players in the near
future personally anybody else my
question is are you guys trying to stay
with PC or are you trying to move to
console really uh that's a split group
it depends on the game so like the call
of duty guys are like no leave it xbox
but the pc guys that play CS co are like
you know pc masterrace console suck so
it's just it's just an opinion of things
so I I don't think any one group or
person is trying to move to that you've
got certain people in key positions that
would love to see one or the other
because
of influence because the background but
I don't think that one benefits us more
than the other really it depends on I
some day all the consoles or and PCs
will have peripherals that match either
side you can play a PlayStation
controller on a PC or whatever and it's
seamless and the controls and it'll
limit that but that's not where we're at
now so for now no it's gonna be who
designs the game around that platform it
will be always a lead platform for call
of duty or halo there's always gonna be
a platform halos easy right text box but
there's always gonna be that where the
community is where that basis is where
they're going to want to play you
mentioned briefly about the business
models behind these games like going
into and making these kind of
competitive tactics do you feel like
like a free-to-play has a very much
lower barrier to entry do you think
that's better to grow a competitive game
versus not like upfront thing and then
does the gating of certain characters
versus only doing cosmetic things like
how do you see those they that as the
barrier of entry for new players yeah
that's tough so we've seen free-to-play
models you saw like the four of them
over there and there's more and more
coming right and so that's a very viable
model because it allows that very
venturi to be gone people can get in and
play and be a part of that and it allows
them because of the structure they are
expecting to be putting content out
religiously right and they're going to
be putting out content and monetization
so they have the ability to have that
long tail program so they're in a better
position usually than a disk-based model
that has to go we need 60 bucks and then
please buy a season pass right so it's
harder to support that post launch so I
think that everybody's seeing games as a
service I think everybody is looking to
change that model but it's tough right
because like these companies have been
built on we print the disc we send it
out we make money we do another one next
year or different versions so it's going
to take time for us to shift our models
to be able to even support that so
you're gonna see few games pop up here
and there they're gonna have limited
windows I think that's why the community
is so key is that even if we don't
support it the community's going to do
things with that and keep that alive we
just got to be able to try and offer the
support that we can when we can do it
but stuff one though all right thank you
rob yep thanks
