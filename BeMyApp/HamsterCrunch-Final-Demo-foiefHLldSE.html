a cute little of superhero ninja master
had an evil crunch inator and this ninja
hamster is stuck in a working lab so he
needs your help he needs you to fear all
belongs by typing in the word key to
navigate to the pub and get to
Hamsterdam where there's an endless
carrot and pellets okay so now I'm
attended over to fragrant
the question is a really dangerous
creature and the evil scientist who's
running it no it doesn't like very much
so as you know our monster Grendel vs
way through the levels he's going to eat
up like more of his pals all the way and
so you're going to get better and better
at typing the words and at making your
way as you work with folks who get more
characters well let's go back to what I
talked about initially learning without
the word what they talked about where
different benefits are with it brings up
different benefits we can help you
attacked with more accuracy and speed
bring up the screen for example we can
ask it to six that say we did you know
about 10 minutes of gameplay
in two words did you know from level one
level two you can creaser weird minute
from 25 to 38 or even um within the 35
friends that um that signed up for a
house or crunch here I piss 15 we can
apply it to any skills so with the words
in the logs you can pre populated with
foreign language with math problems with
vocabulary
separate my ideas here at is genius and
I think it was built for the denominator
like mass market like just regurgitate
letters you see on the screen and I
think it's brilliant and I wouldn't
change anything for the mass-market
appeal it's about you know they playing
word games they play his games they play
games about the favorite characters that
are fun and emotional these this is an
awesome game I just put it in the app
store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
