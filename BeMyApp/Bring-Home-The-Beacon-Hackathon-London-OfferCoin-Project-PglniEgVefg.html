team of a coin we've done a solution for
the many millions of 18 colleges out
there who have currency one it's such as
dogecoin bitcoin-litecoin and the number
of others that are released so on
average one a week of release we've
developed an app which aggregates on the
public keys of these wallets and allows
a merchant or a very low cost and we
opened a few dollars to stick an ibeacon
easy shot as be able to reward these
customers who come into the shop so it's
a very simple proposition instead of the
merchant developing his own merchant
offerings and developing an entire
platform for yourself he joins up that
form tells us okay today I want to give
maybe wives dollars worth of offers away
and anyone who comes in my shorts but I
have our sinks with the beacons let us
know what public kids they have for
example if they've got indulge coin
wallet it will enable the dogecoin
wanted to communicate via a cloud with
the merchant so it keeps their hand
liberty of the customer as well as
allowing emergent communicate with that
customer
and then we're going to create a second
channel on top of that which would allow
each merchant who rewards his customers
and get a good feedback the ability to
send them up and offer in writing in an
email once a we show you remain that we
do that's the simple one opsys and we
can then once we got the platform
running with an old men are many other
features on platform which would have
now arrange them the ability for users
check all what values you have one
you're relying single male and it would
kill you all the different amounts of
rewards of birds and your overall
balance and order one it to me one
simple app that's it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
