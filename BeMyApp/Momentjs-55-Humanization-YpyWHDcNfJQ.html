this is the last video about Momiji s
and this time we're going to talk a lot
about humanization of dates and times
with moments it's easy to do and with a
lot of options so we're going to declare
a date and a result so moment date and
we're going to format it of course I
want to be using this format but you can
change it you just need to read the
documentation about it and the result
Thursday 3rd September 2015 but now
we're gonna focus our brain on the next
step which are the locale with the
locale you can display time from the
locale for example in this code we're
gonna display the French time like this
so you put the moment you press the
locale and we're going to use from now
and we display the result as you can see
the result is don't stop more after
displaying your day with a specific
locale you can also do the same by
changing the format so we're going to
change from now by a format and you
display it and with that we have your d3
set on 2015 by the end of this video I
hope you know how to change the low call
of a date and format by the same way I
hope you had fun and that this was very
useful to you now you can go try it out
with some exercise good luck and see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
