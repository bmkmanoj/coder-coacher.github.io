install the sprout SDK C++ bindings in
order to use the SDK you must have a C++
development environment windows 8.1 or
higher and it is highly recommended that
you have a 64-bit operating system with
at least 8 gigabytes of RAM to download
the SDK go to the HP developer website
there will be a link below
you
download the latest version of the
sprout SDK here
is the license agreement that's always
there you really should read it
once the file is finished downloading
you can extract it and you will find
several different things in it

sprout platform
this file installs the sprout SDK again
we have the license that you really
should read

path is here go to your C Drive go to a
folder called program data it is a
hidden folder by default so in order to
see it you will have to enable hidden
folder viewing in windows explorer
here's the include directory all those
lovely header files these are the actual
libraries for both 32 and 64-bit
architecture
now I have a little program here that
will check to see if we've installed the
SDK directly by calling it source for

installed and ready to run
