I did not license any of this so since
it's being recorded I should just say
to that character real quick so you want
to build a snowman but it's summer the
analogy breaks down later but basically
the idea is building your game thinking
about the future if you build something
specifically for winter and suddenly
want to play with it in the summer
you're gonna have a bad time but nobody
tell Olaf here's a little bit about me
like he said basically I've been in the
game industry 10 years I travel around I
talk a lot to a lot of people about a
lot of games and I love it and sometimes
I use the power of love to help people
today I'm just going to kind of talk
about things that we see that cause
people problem they try to port but
first I just wanna point out unities not
special at least not in this case any
technique that you would use and all the
techniques I my talk about if you're
rolling your own engine or working on
any other engine they're all going to be
the same things a lot of people are
surprised i think there's unity secret
knowledge nope you should think about
these things no matter what platform
you're on probably this isn't a complete
list this is just like when I go out
there and people that I go we're trying
to pour it from here to here this is
what usually people are tripped up on if
you watch this entire talk and are like
hmm those are all common sense then
you're more ahead of the game than you
probably think I'm going to talk a
little bit about a golden rule it's my
golden rule it's not a general golden
rule I haven't heard anyone else say it
but in general when it comes to
designing something design it for a
specific platforms especially when it
comes to like VR or something like the
real sense like I've talked to people
that are primarily known for like 2d
card battle games and they're like we
really want to go to VR and then I'm
like well are you going to take that
experience to be our it doesn't make
sense so in general just kind of a you
know designed with that in mind first or
at least if you're going to port to it
port to it and and do some design
changes specifically for the features of
that platform first thing we talked
about is input this is the most general
case especially since we're here at the
realsense day
a super simple separate the intent for
the man-machine interface if the user
wants to jump don't check this the jump
key everywhere check to see you know set
a boolean somewhere have a jump so I see
a lot of naive programmers do something
like this where all over all over the
code they have this saying where that is
straight up into updates a input get key
if it's the up arrow I want them to jump
don't do that go ahead create an input
manager have it pull up and pull it 410
does the input does the user tell me
that he wants to jump then I should jump
it makes it really easy because you can
change the input manager to handle all
sorts of input types without having to
go all over the place in your code all
your code for your input is in one place
for instance you could just say this is
the input manager here in a fixed update
which is a better place to pull for
input I could do the check there and
then I can just set my intense jump to
true this is all pseudocode don't ship
on this or in this case of real sense I
could say oh well I want my jump to be a
right-handed swipe on the real sense and
that means my character should jump but
again I wanted to change it one place
and as I go through and do all the work
to pour it over to a new platform it's
all in one file one person can do it
it's easy to manage it's less likely to
cause collisions and things like that
when you work in large teams aspect
ratio and resolution this one's really
big and mobile especially if you're you
know if you go from iOS and then you
start switch over to Android and
suddenly have an order of magnitude more
aspect ratios and resolutions to support
catches a lot of people by surprise and
that's just the screen size it's not
it's not me with the GPUs or anything
like that I design your layout systems
to handle change in aspect ratio again
should make sense up until five point oh
we didn't really have anything to help
you in five we now have this new UI
system that makes it super easy for you
to say you know make everything relative
try to avoid using any absolute values
don't ever say oh I want to be 200
pixels from the bottom right try to say
I want to be you know twenty percent
from the right side and you know seventy
percent from the left side you live in
that ten percent window because then as
your screen changes it's very dynamic
this is very prevalent today as you know
like iOS 9 announced multitasking so we
get a lot of questions for that and the
first thing we say is like well do you
suddenly want to run your full screen
tablet game in like the super narrow
view and apparently a lot of you do but
you need to design for that ahead of
time and the more work you can do up
front you just say hey if you suddenly
squash you know squash my screen down
you're going to have a better time and
less work to do in the future scaling
sucks I mean use appropriate sprites for
the the resolution so a lot we have like
4k monitors we have crazy amount of
pixels on our phones I think my phone
has more pixels in my HDTV it's pretty
nuts but again on on mobile or even at
home now you have you know standard def
which is you know 1080p and you have
ultra definite high definition is 4k and
then you have your phones and then
there's talk of 5k and like who knows
what's going to be out there but the
thing is like no matter if you upscale
or downscale one of those directions is
better than the other but like if you
have a straight line at some point math
is not going to be your friend and it's
going to make it look genki and you
don't want that so we have a system in
unity called asset bundles and in five
point 0 we added a new system called
asset bundle variants and basically what
it means is if you have a like say a
texture that's a sprite for button on
your UI and it has the same name and you
put it into a asset bundle that's named
the same but it's just as two different
variants on HD and SD we will
automatically make sure that that game
object has the same ID when you load it
at runtime you can it'll automatically
use the appropriate size for what you
say if you say oh I detected I'm an SD
screen it'll oh the sd1 and it won't
have any problems it's very good and
specifically designed to help in these
use cases with asset bundles I will
point out though that you have to decide
whether or not you want to ship with
your asset bundles how many
we'll hear use asset bundles good the
rest of you should it's a really good
way to keep your download size down if
you're going to mobile platforms and
things like that so but you basically
have a couple choices you can ship with
all of your assets for standard and HD
and then you have to you know you
basically I wouldn't say double but you
know you have a significantly larger
binary that your user has to acquire or
you can ship just like the main menu and
some tutorial at HD because usually
scaling down a little bit better and you
want to support that high-end experience
and then once you're on device you can
detect hey well my standard device and
my HD device which packages should i
download but then you have to kind of
either break up their gameplay or you
know hopefully download fast enough but
it's a decision you're gonna have to
make at some point minimum
specifications I see this one how many
people are here our computer people yeah
how many of you guys have like super
awesome gaming machines that you do your
development on that runs buzzing we're
all terrible people I do it too we're
terrible people minimum sex matter do
don't do all of your gain all your
development on some uber machine
especially if you think you're going to
want to go mobile or to a console or
anything like that in the future because
what's going to happen is it's super
easy for a naive programmer to like make
a mistake performance-wise and it'll be
just hidden because your PC has like you
know SLI Titans or has you know you know
32 gigs of RAM or some crazy things like
that and then next thing you know you're
going to you know a console or a thing
and you have like two gigs around you
have to worry about and you don't fit a
little bit about performance GPU stuff
we provide mobile optimized versions of
all of our shaders but as soon as you
want to customize your look which
hopefully a lot of you guys do you want
to like a custom look beyond this or you
want to have to or you either want to or
have to optimize specifically for that
unfortunately right now like you're
going to have to optimize for all the
GPUs there's about three main ones on PC
there's four main ones on mobile it's a
lot of work but you know it's something
to think about if you have the super
awesome style I shader
and you're going to mobile and all of a
sudden you you like totally suck on this
phone over here you invariably what will
happen is it'll be that the fact that
some optimization you made in your
shader in general is actually inverted
on that GPU for some reason and there
there is conflicting optimizations out
there across all these gpus and it's
kind of a bummer but that's that's the
reality of where we are today memory
uses a little possible but again this is
where if you're working on some uber
machine and you're not thinking about it
you're not using your own kind of memory
manager to unload objects like you just
you're not using object pooling or
anything like that and you have 32 gigs
on your PC everything's fine because you
don't play for like the four hours it
would take for you to run out of memory
but now all of a sudden you go to a
machine has very little memory which is
a lot of them so this is a few don't
know we have the hardware stats on on
unity site this is our most up-to-date
stats on memory available to to our
application system memory physical
memory install this is what the OS tells
us is in solved so if you notice like
thirty one percent almost thirty-two
percent are still at two gigs and that's
that's actually a significant portion on
mobile it's even higher on mobile the
less than two gigs or about two gigs is
at thirty five percent and that's not
counting how much memory like the OS is
taking up so you're going to have to
deal with this less than two gigs so
what I usually tell people do is if
you're if you plan on going to console
in the future or even you might want to
you have your gaming machine on the side
but by like a you know min spec machine
if you're planning on going to like the
iPad to you know make sure you run your
game often on the ipad 2 to make sure
that no performance issues like memory
or cpu usage has crept up and you're
going to have a bad time because doing
that optimization early is always better
than trying to cram it in over the
weekend before you're supposed to ship
plugins how many of you people here use
native plugins in unity
okay for those of you don't know native
plugins are a way for you to provide
native code across all of our platforms
most people do it to support platform
specific stuff or a lot of times people
do it for performance reasons there are
some trade-offs so if you write native
code for a specific platform just keep
in mind that the more stuff you do in
native code the more stuff you're going
to port specific to that platform later
on the other problems are cons of using
plugins is that if you want to do a lot
of interoperability you have to marshal
that data into the managed and back into
native and that's a costly operation so
you need to design around that and one
of the good things about plugins is that
you can you know you can write your own
threads and manage but a lot of people
like to do a lot of the core threading
guys I meet are all C++ guys so they
like to do threading down there then but
you have to remember that unity is not
thread-safe so you can do multi-threaded
stuff in plugins but you're responsible
for gating of you know the marshaling at
the right time to make sure that you
play nice with us in addition to the one
we're giving out here if you go to this
URL bit ly all caps intel WS 6 15 you
can also register to win another one if
you'd like i don't know how bobby wants
to run this i think i just caught them
up on a lot of time but if you have any
questions feel free to ask or I'll be
right outside the curtains and I'll be
here all day thank you over here sir I
guess the question is around managing
you know asset quality and size
specifically in VR have you guys thought
about that or is there anything specific
or just plain old poly counts and stuff
like that we are planning on putting in
especially with our partner platforms
like oculus and Samsung gear VR we are
been planning on putting in profiler
warnings for specific things that will
say if you tell us hey we're going for
samsung gear vr we will warn you that
hey you're using too much memory because
we know exactly how much memory you're
going to
when you get the machine will say hey
you know you are no longer at 60 frames
a second you're going to make somebody
sick don't do that and also things like
hey you're you have a script here that's
moving the camera the outside of
head-tracking don't do that and so we
plan on doing that as far as the actual
asset manages itself it goes back to our
asset bundles we will use the asset
bundles and acyl button all variants and
we're still working on that workflow but
basically specifically for you can
download the correct assets for that so
you're oculus can have higher res than
your Samsung gear VR because it doesn't
have to be sprites obviously be anything
so I was just wondering if you could
tell me anything about a potential
vector support for vector assets you
know in the future for like 2d games or
even for you I we've played around with
it before I think the official answer is
right now or a raster engine and we plan
on staying there that being said i have
seen prototypes for vector based
rendering and i know a lot of our tools
coming up in the future for animation
will support you know curves for
animating and moving things around but i
don't i don't know of any plans
currently to switch to being a vector
based rendering engine
no one going once going twice I'll be
right out there if you're one of those
shy people thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
