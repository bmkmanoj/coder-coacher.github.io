is mostly a talk about choice provisions
game laser life which they're making for
the real sense until platform and
hopefully you guys will have some time a
little bit later today in between panels
sessions we actually have a couple of
the machines set up to to play the game
if you're interested and these guys will
be there or at least one of them will be
there too to show the game off to you
but what we wanted to do here is give
them an opportunity to talk we're going
to be a little bit less coding focused
for the next half hour I wanted to give
these guys the opportunity to talk about
designing for real sense designing their
game with with very different kinds of
controls and some of the challenges they
ran into doing that so before we go into
the nitty-gritty of it if you guys can
just quickly introduce yourselves and
give us a little bit about what choice
provisions is all about sure so my name
is Alex noisy and i'm the co-founder one
of the cofounders of choice provisions
we used to be called gaijin games and we
made the bit.trip series of rhythm music
games for consoles and PCs and stuff hum
so you you may recognize us from that
and yeah so we're a local game
development studio we have a studio in
San Francisco here and one down in santa
cruz and we'll get more into what we're
all about with the game and stuff after
the introductions on that hickman i'm
the lead producer here in the san
francisco studio so i oversee
development of all the games done up
here as opposed to the santa cruz office
including laser life and just a wool hey
there we go sorry just to give us a
little bit of context about what you
guys are talking about matt is going to
be our Vanna today and and play laser
life for just a couple minutes so you
guys can see what what they're working
on and while he's playing alex is going
to talk a little bit about about the
game yeah it's only going to be a couple
minutes long and then we'll get into the
panel discussion so go yeah sounds good
I'm gonna
actually going to stand up so that you
can see the screen a little better so
Matt will fire up the game and like
Chuck said we're only going to show a
very small portion of it here on stage
but then we do have machines set up over
in the back corner over there and we and
we will definitely be happy to demo the
game for you there the game is in a is
an alpha State so we're all developers
here so we know what games our products
look like before they're finished which
is to say not finished so forgive any
weird goofiness that you see but you can
notice that Matt is just using his hand
here in front of the realsense camera to
control everything that he's doing on
the screen right now and the quick gist
of the game just to kind of understand
what's going on you see this astronaut
floating in the center there some alien
entity has found this astronaut a dead
human astronaut floating through outer
space and they slurp the astronaut up
onto their spaceship which is a very
abstract strange spaceship and they want
to figure out what this entity was they
know it was a biological entity but they
don't know what an astronaut is they
don't know what a human is and so they
extract the physical manifestations of
that astronauts memories and that's you
you'll see that as Matt plays he's
reaching into the screen and grabbing
these memory molecules as they come to
the camera and the game is a rhythm
music based game and so everything you
do is to the beat of the music and so if
he does perfect timing you see where it
says great there that was good timing
that was good timing I'm not it was
great timing and then he goes perfect no
pressure Matt yeah and you know anyway
you get more points for all that so in
this first phase you're collecting all
the molecules by grabbing and then the
next phase you synchronize all of the
all of the memories after all of the
molecules into an actual memory and the
way you do that is you fly through these
memory nodes and hopefully he'll get
there but we probably won't make it much
further than that here on stage so you
do one of these you fly through and then
you have to fly in a void
some subconscious blocks from the dead
astronaut to fly back to the spaceship
and then energize the astronaut like
Emperor Palpatine you know and then the
memory is made manifest and actually
tangible and comes out of the dead
astronaut and hovers there in your
spaceship around the astronaut and so as
you play you're basically painting this
portrait piece a biography piece of this
astronaut through imagery and and so you
start to understand what that astronaut
was and is and how they died and all
that and with real sense so it's a kind
of an abstract premise right and our
company historically has made relatively
abstract games that have sort of deeper
levels of meaning in the background but
we don't want that to be in your face
and everything so this is the way that
we tell a story about somebody's
memories right so with an abstract
premise we wanted to find an abstract
control scheme and with our original
bit.trip series on the wii we weren't
using buttons and stuff we're using
accelerometers to tell the story and
like sort of assuming the the more
mainstream gameplay styles with our
other primary series of games that we've
developed and so we were looking for a
way to do that with laser life and as we
were talking about the concept with
several partners in the industry but
also we did a couple of talks about
laser life as a concept and after a
little evaluation we we tended to agree
and so you'll see here matt is flying
that laser up and down just by doing
this with your hand hey get that mouse
cursor out of there thank you and so
this is like like you might do with your
hand outside the car window as you're
driving right and as he's flying through
these flower petal looking things he's
connecting all of the memory synapses or
whatever you want to call them to
solidify the essence of the memory and
so again that's done just like this now
getting into the real sense tech
a bit and I know you have some questions
for us you yeah we hold that let's
actually just thank Matt real quick and
then we'll sit back down and all right
thank Matt so one thing um I want to you
touched on when you were explaining the
game I want to get into a little bit is
the real sense technology itself now I
don't want this to seem like you know
this is all about Intel but you are
using this does acknowledge what I do
yeah you'll have your chance to talk
about you know about philosophy of game
design and all that but I imagine it was
a bit of a learning curve for you going
from someone who who designed for
controllers and four buttons and the
more traditional way of controlling a
game now everything we saw Matt do was
he didn't touch the computer except when
you had to move the mouse cursor out of
the way right yeah it's just insane
figuring this out so our studio were a
bunch of industry veterans we've been
making games I've been making games for
almost 20 years now if when you've been
doing something that long professionally
one you think you know everything and to
you you know what you know and what
works and so now all of a sudden Intel
comes in with this curveball of like now
you're going to try this new thing and I
think a lot of the growing pains for us
as a studio were figuring out what was
the appropriate amount of Wiggles stuff
and like like skeleton reading and
emotion reading because the realsense
camera can do all of this stuff right
and as we were designing the game we it
dawned on us that this tech is
relatively new and I mean there's stuff
like connect and PlayStation Move right
that use 3d cameras as well but as an
industry as a planet this kind of
gesture interaction with a device is
very very new and we made the decision
early on and I'm glad that Chuck Chuck
is our executive producer on the game
I'm glad that he realized that this was
the right way to go as well we made the
decision to do something very very
simple with it so that's why you're
grabbing and then steering and then at
the end you're wiggling your fingers and
that's it and that's because none of us
in this room know inherently how to
interface with tech like this
you know we know when you pick up a
button or like a controller there's
buttons and a button will do something
one of these buttons is gonna do
something but so that was a challenge
for us for sure yeah understanding with
a controller that you have so many
buttons and you know what the buttons
can do you know is like the jump from
d-pads two analog sticks and getting
people to learn that it's not just on
and off and this is an even bigger leap
yeah than that yeah so you have to not
only make a game but you have to teach
players how to play the game right we
have to teach are so and teach yourself
how to play and what you know what feels
good what feels right having your hand
up there how much you're interacting
with it all those things you know we had
to learn as we still are as we make it
and tuna yeah so I mean because a lot of
games have tutorials or at least this
introductory sequence that I got to stop
moving the mic in and out an
introductory sequence that kind of eases
you into gameplay and it you know using
more traditional controls you could say
there's kind of a formula for that have
you found that working on this game
you've had to kind of reinvent that or
has it been you know things that you
learned from previous games apply it
here really I think there's not much
that we've learned from previous games
that's applied here other than like like
design flow and you know getting getting
players to be engaged that kind of stuff
falls still those rules generally still
apply but there's a huge amount of
teaching that we have to do with this
game and I don't think we've done it yet
as well as we could and I mean the
game's not done thankfully so we've got
time but those tutorials you're talking
about like I think we basically have to
say like hey this is how you play with a
gesture thing you know and like oh yeah
that's how and like really really hold
their hands through it but then that
affects your narrative right I mean the
story you wanted to exactly and that's a
big issue that i have personally as a
designer's i don't want to dork with the
narrative or ruin that flow but i think
at the beginning here but before humans
really get used to this kind of
interface we have to yeah yeah it's just
like even something simple like telling
someone to grab something well grab is
something we do in the physical world
usually interacting with something at
the end of that grab and we're not doing
that right they don't actually touch
anything they don't run into the monitor
so how do we give them the visual
feedback on an action that the physical
grab but watch for something to change
and learning what's too far and what's
what's not far enough and it's it's
super challenging kind of teaching
people a language all over again that's
a good way to put it yeah so going in
kind of a different direction you
mentioned a minute ago Alex that you you
already had the concept for laser life
before Intel came and and screwed
everything up for you I but you also
said that you know you looked at the
technology that that real sense offers
and you mentioned like face and skeletal
tracking and emotions and we also have
voice record there's all kinds of stuff
in the in the SDK you know heart rate
tracking all kinds of stuff how did you
how did you said that you tried to keep
it simple right you know how did you
take something that might be a pretty
cool feature from from our SDK or what
the camera can give you and even though
you're really interested in it how did
you make that that line of I we can't do
this even though it's neat right I do
this there there are a few things to
consider actually and and you're right
the real sense technology has all these
cool bells and whistles and stuff that
you can do and I think if we tried to do
all of it there there are a few
considerations we made when we went into
it one was what is too much for the
player what is too much to expect the
player to understand so if we're
tracking your heart rate we're tracking
your emotions we're tracking your hands
your voice and all of that has feedback
in the game it's just going to overwhelm
the player and they're not it's going to
become muddy it's going to mud mud mud
up the game so that was one thing and
that was where we primarily where we
started but another consideration and
this is you know speaking frankly about
the real sense tech is or lot of friends
here so it's what's it we're all friends
so there's a lot of
processor intensive stuff that happens
when you are tracking somebody's facial
you know movements and skeleton and
everything and and making video games is
incredibly processor intensive and very
difficult and it's hard to even get your
video game running at a good performance
benchmark let alone when you're doing
all these other processor intensive
things so by necessity we had to pick
and choose and then I think it it really
just benefited Intel as well as our
company and as well as the project that
we wanted to go with something touching
feeling and minimal anyhow let's talk
about some of the because you said I
have been involved with the the project
so I know a little bit a bit about what
you guys have had troubles with when you
guys were watching the the video that
they had up you saw Matt's blue
silhouette hand popping into the screen
once in a while and since like I said we
are all friends here I know that that
has been a tremendously controversial
bit of design so Matt why don't you talk
a little bit about why this has been so
difficult well the yeah the the blue
kind of human silhouette goes one way or
another one it's great because it
cements you in the game world you see
yourself oh great I know I'm getting
feedback that it's registering me that
I'm picking it up but we also noticed on
the flip side that it causes really bad
habits you start moving closer to the
camera the camera loses track of you
because your way up right on the sensor
so recovering too much it's it's
detecting too much I you yeah it starts
detecting your whole body and maybe
it'll start tripping off things that you
don't want it to so it's this weird
balance of how much feedback do we give
the user and how much you know how do we
keep them operating within the
parameters we want them to because
building a game you always want to be in
control of what the players doing right
you always want to know what they can
and cannot do and with this technology
it kind of opens the door a little bit
they can do stuff that you may not be
prepared for them to do and the blue
silhouette thing kind of ties in that
well okay at least this is we can give
them feedback with this little person of
make sure this is on the screen or make
sure it's a certain distance away so
it's been kind of a blessing and a curse
having it there and not sure if we know
what to do with it entirely they're
figuring that one out make it an option
toggle on or off oh I think we will
actually make it an option but it'll be
default on until people get used to it
kind of thing okay so i do want to give
time for the audience out here to ask
any questions that they might have but i
do have one other thing it's not so much
a question more of a more of something
for you guys to kind of mentally explore
when i look at this game and i hope when
a lot of people out here look at the
game they also see elements of res or
child of eden hopefully you guys are
aware of that and i don't know you know
what are those game one of those are
those video games so how much from other
games are you drawing on this one being
inspired by I mean I think we should
probably both feel this because it'll be
different for each of us but um
certainly raise and child of Eden are
you know very very big influences res
more so than child of Eden to be honest
but everyone in our studio has played
them both and you know we're big big
fans of res but I think this game is a
little bit more like a bit trip game
than it is like a res or a child of Eden
you know which is good for us because
then it's familiar but but yeah I think
it's things like like those games that
are abstract and floaty that's what
we're going for for sure and those were
influences for sure it's really though
in what ways is it more like a bit trip
game because you know having played the
bit.trip games i'm not seeing a lot of
similarity at least on the server uh
well if if anyone here has played
bit.trip games you may understand what
i'm getting at in the sense that there's
a there's a deep story about an
individual a human a very there's a very
human story underneath all of the bells
and whistles and the fancy and the
glowing and whatever right and and you
don't need to know that to enjoy the
game and many people have played our
bit.trip games and never knew it was
about anything other than beeps and
Boop's and making stuff happen to the
beat of the music
no and so this game I think can be a lot
like that and also it's we've got a lot
of similar design flow where as you're
doing better it layers more music and
more tones on and that kind of stuff and
so whereas res I think was a much more
linear thing you you start the level you
go to the end you beat the boss that's
all done and here it's like you start a
level you start building up your your
whatever your modes and your layers of
music then you go to another section
that's using similar music that layers
on themes so relating music or layering
themes then when you come back you know
those those layers have become permanent
well and also the place it really is
similar to bed trip is how we build
mechanics you start out simply running
jumping running jumping ducking and here
we're teaching kind of basic movements
and then adding to them and then the
phase after that one you're moving in a
more 3d space and then in the end you
know kind of Wiggly fingers just how we
build those mechanics were not just
throwing them all into one area so kind
of teaching people slowly over time as
the game builds and kind of evolves that
way and in that sense yeah I think it's
very much like bit.trip ok so to wrap up
I want to like I said give the audience
some time but for each of you I have one
question so let's have Matt answer the
first one if there was one lesson to be
learned from real sense so far one
either amazing thing to learn or one
like make sure you don't do this you
know what would that thing be I think
it's more of a overarching
recommendation is never assume you know
what the player is going to do the times
we have thought something would be
extremely obvious to do with something
they've gone and done something totally
different we've had a little gesture of
a hand going like this and we see people
going like that like don't ever assume
you know what they're going to do and it
maybe be a little more blatant than you
think you have to be because it keeps
they're going back to that same thing
you're teaching people a different way
to interact with something and that
takes a lot of hand-holding yeah and I
guess my answer would be if you're going
to work with real sense
I would say keep it simple stupid that
old adage pick a few things you want to
focus on that you think are unique that
real sense offers don't try to do
everything because I think you'll have a
more pure game experience and you'll
also have an easier time working with
real sense because it is still so new
and we are all all learning this new way
of interfacing with devices and whether
you're super genius or not it's new and
you have to learn it so start simple and
go from there all right does anyone have
any questions for these guys so in
history a lot of the different input
technologies that have come out like
that we mowed the Kinect and other
things that rely more on natural human
motion you've seen over time that they
tend to resemble the motions that people
the things that are successful in the
use cases that are working or things
that resemble that type of motion so
things where you're swinging a sword you
know you're holding something in your
hand when you're using the wii u dance
games were very successful for the
kinetic sports that kind of stuff what
is your prediction for the great use
case that real sense is going to provide
for us I think it's going to sort of
like we have in a way as in going way
far back is the introduction of the
mouse it was an abstraction of movement
an abstraction of a behavior you know
like when did humans ever do this and
drag around and I think with real sense
it's at least speaking to the parts of
it we are using is its abstraction of
things we're used to doing
simplification of them things like that
I think a lot of full body movement or a
lot of very precise tracking it's
difficult because of that lack of
physical interaction so I think just
abstracting and simplifying is where
it'll find that kind of sweet spot
hopefully at least that's what we think
right now and then that'll be a good
foundation to build upon I think you
know to get more intense or or obtuse
you know with what what you want to do
and so down the road we may have the my
already report stuff we don't have it
yet because nobody knows how to get from
here to there you know but it's coming
so I was just told that we don't have
any more time for questions wyd oh yeah
great question yeah it was a good
question i'll give you tickets i was
going to say don't we give the raffle t
yeah but i do want to encourage
everybody these guys will be around for
a little while and definitely don't
leave the next session which is going to
be great but come around the wall and we
do have the game over there if you get
an opportunity and you can feel free to
ask these guys questions over there yeah
we're happy to talk with you so so thank
you everybody thanks thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
