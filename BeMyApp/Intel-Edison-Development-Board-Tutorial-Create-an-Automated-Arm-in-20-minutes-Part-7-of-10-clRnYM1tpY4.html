in the Edison we're going to communicate
through Wi-Fi for this we're going to
use an iphone ios app and for that i'm
going to show you how to download the
sources and how to modify them to
recreate your own functionality you can
download the source of the application
on the github with this button
downloaded unzip the file then launch
Intel X project
for those who are familiar we can find
plastic items a storyboard with our
different modules on it and different
Swift files
most of the core
up is in the file view controller dot
Swift you can see that the first part
allows them to set up the IP
so to check out the user entered an IP
and these functions are the ones that
are called when you modify slider they
are all going to call request to make a
request on the server with this line of
code
it is like in the previous video we do a
gay request giving it the idea the
servos we want to modify in the valor to
reach I really hope you're getting some
great ideas on how to create your robot
and give them some really great features
and functions otherwise you can check
out the next video where we're going to
go further and how to bring improvements
and really bring it to the next level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
