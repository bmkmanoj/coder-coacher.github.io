application
based on an existing Android application
before you start you need an Android
application a mirrorlink
developer account and a developer ID the
developer account gives you access to
the causeway and the ACMs portal
causeway the platform that allows secure
collaboration for the car connectivity
consortium here you have access
documents tools and tutorials that will
help you in your development and
certification process
the application sort of
your management system provides
application certificates and certificate
status information to client devices its
purpose is to respond dynamically to
safety and security problems on deployed
devices so let's start
for the Lincoln
option to create a developer account
once you have your account the next step
is to get a developer ID from the ACMs
portal
here I'll login with my Maryland
developer credentials and go to view
profile this is where you can request
the developer ID you'll need to agree to
developer agreement for it
next you have to add your device's
International Mobile Equipment Identity
to your developer ID certificate this
will allow the device to verify the
validity of the developer ID upon
application launch
go to view developer certificate
select request change
add your device's IMEI for samsung
devices Yoli need to add the last four
digits of your IMEI and select update
request
then wait for the request to be approved
this should be done automatically at the
number of devices less than 100
I'll now go to my Android application to
turn it into a mirror link aware
application first I'll add intents to my
applications Android manifest file
terminate allows app termination from
the head unit
annc allows app launching from the head
unit I also add service permission for
the common API
you
that's it for the manifest file the next
step is to make your app a mirrorlink
test application and for that you need
to build a self-signed certificate I'm
using the certificate generator provided
by the Mary link for this which you can
find in the documents section of the
Kazi platform
I'll start by opening my applications
apk I'll add the versions code and the
package name and then I'll add in the
applications XML
to generate applications XML a user
application certificate generator and
the applications P ICS which you can
find using the Cosway platform
I'll copy and paste it here
generate the application ID and update
the XML I'll now add the developer ID I
got from the ACMs earlier in the
issuer's name
you
for developer certificate be sure to add
developer as the entity names
saving my certificate it can take some
time
I'll save it in applications asset
directory as self-assigned dot CCC
remember to regenerate the self-assign
certificate each time you modify your
code and want to test your application
with mirrorlink finally I'll rebuild a
project to complete the process you can
now start using common API and test it
in your application so let's check it
out I can see the application inside the
mirror link settings on the device
I'll connect my device to the test bench
the application
you
now I start mayor link inside the
testbench I can see the developers
application and started
now I can interact with it thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
