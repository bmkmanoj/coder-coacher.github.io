would like to talk a bit more about it's
a terrible long title growing a
partnership in mutual respect the indie
company and the chip manufacturer giant
yeah this is like so I prepared 120
slides filled with a lot of infographics
photos of me and my family and friends a
lot of texts a lot of Germans expression
that you want to said no it's actually
this this is just basically it it's kind
of a working working title for me
because it was kind of hard to express
what I actually want to talk about but
most what are you going to hear most
about over the talk is basically about
how you can have a mutual business
development relationship with a big
partner as a small studio and I'm just
going to give some examples how int'l
became that partner for us and what we
did over the last four years just a
quick yeah good okay so I'm just really
really quick who are we I found it with
my friend six years ago a video game
studio in Hamburg Germany and we did a
game called beat body which was rather
successful not all the time most of the
time it flopped like hell but at some
point it got very very successful now
it's actually doing more than ever two
years ago just being out on xbox one and
Wii U which is actually really really
cool so never give up yeah so never give
up so and the basic idea is that we can
work in very very hard on this title and
the title won a lot of awards as you can
see it's really really hard to read it's
so funny i mean we could have written
everything here this is also like a
trick for marketing just right in no
meanie and nobody will ever read the
award because i think i mean this could
have been nominee for best site actor
and a porn movie or something like that
in 2011 nobody will give a shit no no
but those are real Awards like actually
just going to highlight two of them that
are the most important ones
winner in to level up award 2012 for
best art and best sound and this is
actually the first time where we got in
contact with Intel because we saw this
Awards where you can hand in your game
it's called the interlevel up reward and
they basically we're looking for demos
and they had a super cool jury and they
still have guys like John Romero we're
in it and it felt like okay let's try it
with just a German nobody studio with
our first demo so let's see what we can
do and actually the jury liked our game
which was back then like a very early
alpha and we were we won those two
awards which was like super super crazy
first because they're all glassy and
shiny and everything but I think the
most important stuff was not the awards
and it was also not the prize money
there was a little prize money laughing
it was like one thousand dollars per
category or something like that which we
immediately spent for flying over to the
award show which was at e3 in Los
Angeles and what actually happened the
cool stuff is that we got a distribution
deal on steam by accident like nobody
knew that it was not advertised and back
then in 2012 there was kind of like a
big thing for an indie developer to be a
published on steam but since all those
demos that would eventually win they
would be on the steam front page as the
level up with us oh shit was that even
2011 ok might even know whether it
doesn't make any sense the test 2012 so
either steam army is lying anyways we
got the awards I can prove it I
definitely have them anyways the point
is that we got our first first chance
actually be real independent but not
only having a game but also a
possibility to self publishers and like
as you all know steam is a great
platform for independent developers and
there's an awesome audience out there
looking for interesting games and fresh
new content the other thing that was
extremely good was the prize money
out the flight but I think I already
said that and the last thing that I want
to talk about is this recognition that a
like like we were nobodies like like my
grandma once said wolf you a very nice
guy there was very nice of her but this
doesn't really help me to get any
advantage leverage in my career as a
game developer to actually get the trust
from people to support you in your game
that press writes about it like you need
some partner that believes in you also
you don't have a track record inside the
industry so this track record basically
int'l and the jury helped us to get this
recognition and after that worked out
which was extremely cool because we also
met Austin Wintory on stage or actually
backstage he was conducting the score of
journey and we basically asked him hey
mr. wintery we are those german dudes
with the sound technology pet and
patent-pending beat body audio game
could you imagine doing music for that
instead okay I didn't understand a word
but I'm intrigued so and then basically
that's also when that started which was
extremely cool so then basically what
happened how we got engaged for because
I thought it was just a one-night stand
right that Intel would give us those
awards and there's like okay bye don't
call me anymore thank you this awkward
moments that happen in life but actually
they wanted to have a real relationship
with us and I was thinking like wow why
what do we have what can we do what do
we need to sign and basically we get
approached over something called the
inter software partner partner program
which isn't the first step basically
which is in the first way basically that
into the supporting your studio with a
new hardware and stuff so you can
develop on related platforms so I was
actually looking a bit deeper into the
soul Intel stuff what is into doing
whatever they want what is their
background and I was just thinking okay
so so what interest could they have
working with us and now I was like
trying to fly comparing camp
he's like okay so they're not really
start up there yeah they're long for
quite a long while as we are yet it's
just five years then also about the
employees it's not really I would call
them a little bit corporate compares
compared to our five employees and then
also from the revenue I think I got this
right 55 billion dollars sorry compared
to us with three hundred thousand dollar
so so it felt a bit like him okay so
who's playing the rules here but
basically how it all started in 2012 was
first with this Hardware partnership
agreement if you can call it that that
mmm that that into the would basically
help us with the new ivory bridge
laptops at that time which was extremely
cool because as a small studio sometimes
you do you don't have the right systems
to develop or to showcase the games
which is really really crucial to get
attention for your product most or like
more important actually was the
visibility that we got from int'l
because they were calling us from time
to time avoiding us emails about stuff
which sounded like way too good to be
true so for so for example oh this is
the wrong photo this is the right photo
see there was an artist joke you know
yeah I ever x 2 i'm to german to explain
it i'm so sorry for that there was
unintentionally right ok so did and i'm
actually going to tell you the reason
why I'm smiling like a like it just took
a lot of crack it's basically because we
got invited to the int'l Extreme Masters
they had a intel is doing this road
roadshow of big eSports tournaments and
I think it was the the League of Legends
final and they needed somebody to go on
stage and make it sound out of
themselves for 10 minute between the
half final and the grand final and I was
just thinking okay mm-hmm nobody knows
us nobody cares for us so what could we
do to entertain the crowd and basically
what we did then
and this is also after we did what we
did we basically had a slingshot on
stage and I brought our Dutch game
designer which also didn't introduce he
was just a slingshot guy and I was just
telling some stories and whenever
somebody liked us on Facebook Lawrence
would shoot beatbuddy plushies in the
audience and things got in a bit wild
and I think in eight minutes we got two
thousand facebook likes that was really
really cool because like the the first
150 facebook likes of tina fey's flight
took me like two years of one and a half
years and the other two thousand took me
eight minutes so there was always
something okay interesting interesting
like worldwide stream slingshot that's
definitely a system that I should keep
in mind for further ideas and then of
course GDC San Francisco as we all know
is a very export very very important
show for all developers it's basically
where the industry meet each year you
can meet everybody from Reggie fils-aime
yamoto to a lot of people if you're
lucky but you committee bump into
anybody and it's just like this big
festival of game developers each year
and Intel gave us the chance to showcase
their at the booth something that we
could never afford on our own but we
were able to talk to present to a lot of
partners and that was really really cool
and also he is like awesome entry that I
talked about we all said a chance to
meet there because like yeah he's
obviously from the states so there was
another example of visibility and then
this HD i just found this on the
Internet isn't that crazy if you google
my name or if I google my name I found
these pictures it it actually looks like
I just had a coming out with beat body
saying no I never touched him this is a
lie really I never touched him that was
he touched me first and then I I have
yeah so so this was actually from this
year there's a TV show in the stage like
an Internet TV show called vesicle TV
and they were like like Intel was
basically bringing us together because
they were looking for certain interview
partners and there was another thing
we're in till helped us quite a lot but
we also been to Australia
because of Intel basically because they
offered us to be part of their show
space so beatbuddy road to Australia
that'sthat's my artists work by the way
it's really crappy but I think it gets
the message yeah so so there was another
really really cool thing that happened
about the visibility part so that was
like kind of like the how the
relationship the partnership evolved
first from hardware support and since we
seem to like each other we took it one
step further to publicly go out and hold
hands and which was really really nice
but then they actually of course more
it's about actually didn't know that it
would turn out so sexually like that it
the elephant in the room is that I'm
comparing us and Intel of being like a
couple taking it from one step to the
other so so collaboration yes of course
the next step if you visibly show that
you're together with somebody you
collaborate intensely there was in 2014
so we I wouldn't say we took it really
slow but it's you know it's good pace so
I'm basically one of our babies wow it's
so easy really it's just I have planned
this but it's it's really easy and yeah
okay so one of the coolest collaboration
was that we were asked if you wanted to
do for beat body since we have a touch
version but also keyboard and the
gamepad version if you want to do
something with the two and one
ultrabooks and basically you can play
beat body / keyboard and if you turn
around the screen it would say touch
input detected and then on the fly you
can change the complete controls for
example if you're in the subway or
whatever and you can still play it by
touch and since i would say that touch
controls like i lighted touch controls
more than the keyboard keyboard controls
but that's up to everybody's opinion we
think that was really really cool and
combined from that we've also showcasing
at the Indy mega booth at Gamescom last
year so into the wall
putting us with you know like getting
getting def gets aligned and getting
yeah I think they even supported us with
the banner yeah I think their supporters
for the banner as you can see here but
you know I mean this is all stuff a
small company doesn't have or they can't
afford but it definitely helps quite a
lot to be taken seriously so that was
really really cool and actually from
that level to the collaborations what
would be the next step getting married
or getting oh that doesn't make any
sense for my sexual no no anyways the
next step because this is not based on
some ya love story so the next step is
basically enabling oh you can't read
that oh wait interesting yeah it could
be can you maybe help me with that ya
know hahaha that is that is also good
show okay so so it says enabling
basically that after we've been I'm like
getting support from a lot of developers
and partners like Intel and a lot of
people over our first years we wanted to
give some of this loft back to the
industry to the young developers and we
wanted that they have better chances
than we had when we started I guess
especially in Germany it's not super
super easy to be a developer because
germany used to be for a very very long
time just about german people develop
german games for Germans because our
house market is 84 million people strong
which where you can this is I maybe not
one reason but maybe also the reason why
you why via the country of simulators
the bus simulator the hospital simulator
the the I don't know how many simulators
they are so so but but it was always
like the German industry was able to
survive on its own because they had the
Germans buying their product and so like
a my opinion we are kind of a bit behind
of getting the international trend that
forest Germans is not so easy to compete
on
international level we are quite far
behind when it comes looking at the
Dutch or looking at the finish or
Swedish developer they never had a house
market that they can just focus on so
they always look to the states they
always look to other region and they
always network together so and the best
networking that I learned from the
industry was the indie mega booth and
2013 in Seattle because it was basically
it was also a bit hard to explain to two
people that are not in the industry is
basically 90 competitors from all around
the world that are fighting each other
for sales and steam this is how people
from outside the industry would see it
but the problem is like we're not
competitors each of our games are so
unique that and we all love games that
were actually supporting each other and
teaching is out of the way how to behave
in front of other developers to cherish
the game development cherish the game
production and I was really amazed by
their so and I want to bring something
back with a couple of friends who
started the indie arena booth which is
the german-speaking forum or the India
arenas the german-speaking forum for
game developers and I wanted to bring
something back and we had this
opportunity to make a big booth in 2015
so this year at games games come but we
only had like two months or three months
or something like that so it was very
very short time and I basically asked
until then can somehow help us with I
don't know like like hardware screens
however and I think after five days and
four days and believe me I talked with
everybody after four or five days they
already said hey we can give you screens
hardware whatever you need and we even
since you have bringing a big diversity
of people to get at your booth we can
support you with some extra money for
your deaths and it's like wow this is
like but you don't even know if that's
gonna work out yeah yeah we trust you on
that it's going to be cool we welcome
together with the indie booze the indie
megabusa in the state since a couple of
years and they never let us down so and
I
I was really really happy that that's
into hair trust trust in us because I
hope we could give them after five years
something back because like people that
were they would never think that a
company like Intel just like we did four
years ago would have an interest in
small developers could meet them in a
person level and could find out that
they actually do care for developer that
they're super interested to hear what
young developers doing with their tech
so I hope okay I mean they gave us pcs
and we could also give something back to
them just by introducing them to so many
great developers that are so passionate
that they came from 15 countries all
around the world so yeah I'm very very
thankful for that and I'm really excited
to see on the enabling collaboration
level what we can do next year together
and just really really quick about us
for next year it basically freaks until
a new beat buddy real sense game which
I'm we're currently working on and we're
very excited about that so thanks so
much for listening to my sexual
references
