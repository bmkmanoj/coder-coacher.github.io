we have two more people taking a rest
right now after three days of work so I
just want to apologize for that and also
there is another reason why they are now
eat here so i would mention that to you
okay so what we want to do is we want to
teach people how to do acupressure
pressure but by then if you take me to
the pressure then you can get a cube
pleasure okay by the way i'm a chinese
english my second language so i have
difficulty distinguish between RNA oh so
if i say wrong one way another please
excuse me ok so our body work wonderful
first of all but most of the time
sometimes we just cannot force three
right and never marry research we find
out that from the steep research
institute they say fifty eight percent
of people they actually have difficulty
for three or you know stains three so of
course we can take feel right take two
and call me in the morning by sometime
we may be taking one too many right so
what we do is that we want to know how
we can use acupressure to help you to
relieve the symptoms and there is
actually one thing that you can do now
this thing is this we don't know how to
do this kind of thing so we think that
oh the HP will really help you is sprout
why is it because you have to screen
number one is that you can have a screen
that you can scan your hand and show you
how to do and then you can learn from it
from the other screen so you have the
mat in order and you can practice and
the other person can see it too so
that's what we think we not only can
help the beginning of to learn but you
can also help you to keep reviewing it
because after why we may not remember
maybe you better if I we can you come
back later on so so this is how the in
the detail how we do things the user can
touch the screen pinpoint a point and
then you guide them to the location
request for tutorial information and
then you can use a monitor screen to
show you by step now you can also have
the teacher to show you a detailed
information and we also use the titles
for analysis okay thank you
what we're trying to do is this is just
a partial prototype initially what we
really like to do is do a 3d scanning of
your hand and then the other person will
be able to see your hand and you can go
through the scanning however we also
would like to see the pressure point the
pressure point has not been released yet
so that we change our strategy using the
picture as a point the touching point to
make you to go sleepies actually coming
from here all the way to the wrist so
this point and if you have some issue
you will press it down you ask you a few
little bit sensation and that's the
party to make it relax okay so what we
do is we here we show you that if you
started touching this you will start to
get no response no point on that and
then what we will do is we're guiding
the user to the real point which is
right here area okay when you do that
you will get the right spot okay so
that's what we do and then one thing
that we are integrating the two the idol
portion is to get the sentiment because
we believe that many people and may have
different feeling about the response so
we want to get a sentiment in the rating
125 we will say that this is what you
feel about it and then people can
actually do a discussion about things
like that so that's what we have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
