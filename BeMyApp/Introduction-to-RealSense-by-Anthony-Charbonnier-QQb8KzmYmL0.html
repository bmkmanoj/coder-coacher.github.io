do it video game developers so something
you might not know that Intel works a
lot on how you interact with technology
when since yours so couple of years ago
we worked and said okay the future is in
touch no touch screen so we work to be
PC manufacturers like HP es cetera to
make touch happen in your laptop so
that's why today you can get really
really nice device with touch screens
and you can do like you know you make it
a tablet you can remove the screen etc
this is because of a work at Intel did
couple of years ago once touch was done
we say okay what's next what is the next
interesting thing that we could work on
and at this time you know connect was
actually going on and so many developers
hacked connect to play with it and we
saw a really really nice stuff done with
the clinic and say this is the next
really interesting stuff but we want to
work on as a couple of years ago we
reformed the team called the perceptual
computing team so now real sense to work
on this project and what I want to tell
you about what is that you know we are
going to focus today on two cameras so
you know 3d cameras but real sense is
more than that it's also voice you know
because it needs to recognize you and
you know understand who you are real
sense is really a new way to interact
with your laptop so you know it can be
as I said with cameras with video
cameras but also we voice and understand
who you are first it actually needs to
feel as natural we don't want you to
stand in front of your laptop doing
really weird gestures and feel stupid
that's not our job we all really want we
want to make something natural and what
you would like to do it also needs to
understand you better you know what are
your feelings who are you you know this
kind of stuff that pc should do for you
and the last stuff which is really
important to is have brie and the world
better so in you know which area are you
with whatever what is your room
measurement etc so all the world can be
apprehended better with speedy cameras
so what I learned from my job at this
previous shows is that the most
important thing is to be honest with
developers because well if you lie to
them once we are not coming back so we
want to raise expectation rights reasons
cameras today are not going to make you
look like Tom Cruise in Minority Report
doing really weird stuff and you know
you know guessing who's next murder will
be this is not know this is not make it
happen today what it is no opposite side
so this is the first camera we want to
talk about so this is e the user facing
camera so on on this slide you see the
peripheral version of it but the idea is
actually to integrate it directly into
laptop so this is the camera I have
actually in my laptop replacing the
webcam so this camera are going to be
replacing your webcam in a lot of device
really really soon and some brands like
has a razor sorry for the French accent
will actually make peripherals out of it
because yo so you won't have to buy your
full laptop with the camera to sense
what is real chance we'll just be able
to buy a peripheral and make you know
make a game of it so what are the usages
for this one so the range of work is of
course you know when you are in front of
your laptop so it has to be close range
contrary to connect which is really
really long range so the range is 30
centimeters to one meter range so
basically when you're in front of your
laptop menus is a gesture control as I
said you know for example on PowerPoint
you actually what would like to switch
slides like this you know this is really
natural so gesture control but also
freely reconstruction so you can take an
object and scan it with a camera and
make it a 3d mesh of it so if you want
to sell something on a website or
something like that you could
reconstruct your object and put it
online but also face analyzes you know I
said before that real sins need to
understand who you are and you know what
you want so facinelli this is a big part
of it I don't know if some some of you
install already Windows 10 in the room
but one of the biggest feature we
actually came with with windows ello we
know that what does windows LOL it can
login instantly without any password we
can easily organize your eyes so it's
you know it's natural so i have it
actually at the office works which work
and it works in like in the tenth of a
second
so it's very impressive it weird at the
same time to come in from your laptop
and say okay hi Anthony and it's
actually pop up so this is very very
nice and an Australian website and add
fun with it and put exact twin in front
of the camera you see if it could
differentiate it you know so for one
twin sister not to be able to log into
her sisters computer see if it's worth
and actually the camera could
distinguish the two different you two
twin people and then it works with
everybody it work with every so we
couldn't actually trick does he have
arrived and with twins the last one is
free defaced capture so I'm going to do
a demo about it after but basically what
it can do is scan your face and put it
at somewhere else so we could actually
scan your face and put it in an avatar
for example something like that at Intel
we love to actually show a lot of names
and conflict of OMS so basic all these
brands other brand new sign to get
Wilson's cameras into their laptops soon
so some of your brand's you can actually
already buy the laptop through the
camera inside since couple of months and
we have I think it's an asus device on
the developer showcase where with a
camera inside so if you want to see it
it's already there and while already
selling these devices but all of them
all of these OEMs will come with a
divisive with a camera you know before
the end of the year so this is not only
two people working on some side project
all the industry is working behind it so
this is really important for you game
developers to understand to make
something with these cameras a lot of
people will actually be able to use it
but what yeah I think it's section but
yeah that's better but why real sense in
gaming how can actually go together we
worked on some actually nice use case
for your video game developer well five
of them for gaming especially with this
user facing camera the first one which
is very funny actually is a face
analysis and emotion tracking so as I
said the laptop would be able to
understand what you feel and yet yeah
and what you feel so you could imagine a
game that understands that the guy is
scared and making even more scared oh so
this is if you already setting like me
you can actually have a lot of fun with
it the another thing would be if
guy is very stressed maybe we can play
in all the nice music to make him cooler
for example stuff like that the game
could understand you know what you feel
so the second part is a facebook under
construction so as I said I'm going to
show it you to you after but basically
scan your face and put it in a free
avatar in a game easy as well the third
usage is about streaming so it's not
directly into video games it writes more
for people who go to on Twitter for
example today if you want to just have
yourself on top of a game you have to
have a really big green background to
remove to this rug removal thanks to
this camera you'll need it anymore you
just put yourself in front of the camera
and it will automatically remove the
background just keep yourself on top of
the video game so forth which people
that's very very interesting the first
one is 3d avatar so here's the idea
would be to you know scan your face and
apply all your emotions to an existing
avatar so in a game you could imagine
having you know exactly what mimics you
do with your help your face on a very
very popular video game avatar so this
could be done with the camera and the
last one is motion and head tracking so
you could actually the SDK be with this
camera actually allows you to understand
how the guy is turning his head you know
up down left and right so you could
actually imagine that it actually tracks
your movement in the game and I have a
video just after it to actually explain
well so can you see it okay you don't
have the sound unfortunately and the
video games we actually is a developer
who developed this plug-in is not isn't
should be in the room I don't know where
is exactly now he left was the other
side yeah anyway so here's the idea is
that it tracks the movement of your head
and actually change the point of view in
the game so if you turned on as well as
they had left then you know the player
as you can see will turn the labs ur
head so it change the point of view
completely and completely change your
experience of the game and this is this
is done with a tracker I don't know if
you know about where a track I are but
it's more than 500 games are enabled
today so if you buy this camera and you
plug it into this game it already works
and its mobile favorite games in already
available if you want to talk about this
implementation the developer is on the
other side and it was a guy doing a
presentation on Android sokka's have you
developed it so as I'm actually very
adventurous i'm going to show you the
demo live so something you shouldn't do
at all normally so frida me oh yeah no
so this application would actually as I
said before scan my face and putting and
putting it on an existing avatar
okay so this is my face and freely with
my mic which is weird sorry so I'm going
to accept it call my name Tony because
it's almost my first name and this is my
skate boarder myself so I think you get
the idea so you know basically you take
a face you put it an exit in-game
character and make yourself the game
character so this is going to change how
you play video games you know a lot
because now you all 20 you know you
don't have to actually fit to an
existing hero you was the Europe that's
very very nice so this is the face
scanning option and now i'm going to
show you the gesture mode so why wave so
why I wave the game with you know we
develop at Intel with side chick in a
developer video game developer to show
what we can do with it so you can see
what my hand actually creates a blue
stuff in it okay and I can actually
interact with the guy inside and now I
have to look at what I do because I
notice i will lose and yeah and you can
take them and actually grab them in
point where so this is quite easy and
very interactive and it really shows how
you can you know interactive video game
in a new way so I'm not going to do
whenever you know if you want to play
with this come after me in the demo
section gonna play it's actually very
very fun you can and actually get in
cheat and make them die etc that's way
funnier by the way yes sorry hey you're
falling sooo bad so yeah as you can see
we have a lot of fun working at Intel so
so yeah this was both demos I wanted to
show you we have way more we can show
you know even showcase the SDK itself
because this cameras come with a
dedicated sdk for developers you want to
play with it so please come to us in the
video game in the showcase section and
we're going to talk about it
so the second camera now is the a
different one and four different usages
it's a world facing so basically it's
for phablets and tablets have you heard
about something like Google tango you
know this is you know the kind of stuff
that you can recognize you know your
environment etc with so this is the idea
so today it's a USB sorry I'm going to
steal that from my laptop so today this
is a USB peripheral but actually in the
next couple of months you'll see device
with this integrated into the camera so
the user is very very different they
said and the range of course is
different it's from one meter to 3.5
meter so it's four different use it went
to before when before one big part of it
is of course 3d capture so how can I
capture my environment you know the
people and the objects around me I
talked about before you know scanning an
object but with the tablet is actually
easier because you can turn around the
object of a pc it's a bit difficult you
can also scan people in full people and
food full body I think you already so
bad you know if you look into the news
you can scan 3d people and print it so
this can be done with a lot of cameras
etc tomorrow you'll be able to do it
with this kind of you know a tablet or
consume a tablet and for the same prices
or you know a regular tablet one of very
very cool stuff is augmented and mixed
reality with mixed reality is coming a
lot right now in the news so and this
camera can make this kind of stuff done
I'm going to showcase a really nice
video about it yeah just after but
basically is how you interact with your
environment and play with it this is
very very interesting one of the key
features is also ends photography so i'm
pretty sure that you're well but stuff
like Instagram and know this kind of
application when you can apply effects
on on your photos here for example 3d
could help you to you know a change
change the focus you know or maybe blurr
some part of the photo etc as you have
the depth data in it you can do whatever
you want to the photo and the last one
is actually a bad english but its
measurements so what you could do with
established in this camera is that you
could actually scan your room and
Monsieur
so basically if I want a for example
right now I'm looking for a new flat in
Paris you know and I cook I cook lots i
want to reduce kitchen reveal with this
i could actually just can make kitchen
and say ok this is 2 meter 4 by 4 meter
so i need this kind of furnitures etc
and really really easily just by
scanning my room so this is a kind of
use it is that we want to work on so
this is a concept that we showcased for
a couple of weeks ago at IDF it's a it's
a google tango enabled the camera free
tablet so if you are about google tango
we announced publicly that we are
working with Google to make these
cameras working with tango and we are
working full type IDF so I can't tell
you way more about it because I honestly
don't know more about it but we'll get a
come pretty soon with plans we good so
how does it work actually thats you know
all like us so it's basically it works
the same way as eyes work we have two
infrared projectors you know on the
camera which works exactly the same way
as humanized work ok that minutes method
perfect so so basically as you have to
point of view and you look at the same
object and then you know the distance
between the two point of view can
triangulate you know there's a distance
of the object so it's very very easy to
create a depth map thanks to that now
you can add we also have an LG v camera
so like a regular web the regular camera
with colors so and we know we've is
infer red plus the RGB you can do
texture so we with that and they'll give
you create a complete depth map but you
can use for developers but why Intel why
why does it entail do camera that's a
very good question in fact all these
video streams actually need a brain as
yours to actually combine them and make
it useful for it if I give you a depth
stream completely raw you won't be able
to use it but if i give you like you
know radio depth map so how you know
afford it from the object or etc then
you can make it work so this is why we
working on it intel is working on the
chip analyzing all these data and make
it available to your developers and the
middle where is also
out of it so you know we work in a
complete suite of and I can so get a
croquette eat afterwards if you want of
tools to make it available to you and of
course we have quite a history to
integrate stuff with the pc
manufacturers and to make it available
for the most people and so that's why I
want it also to work on the camera part
on the l200 part is the world facing
camera we have different usages for
video games the first one is as I said
