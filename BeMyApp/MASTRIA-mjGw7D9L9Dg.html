unexpected is happening on line 5 the
Metro has come to a standstill at the
Metro Control Center the security post
has triggered the alarm a camera has
detected people on the tracks the power
is immediately cut the traffic will be
stopped for at least an hour five
streets away at the master e'er
Operations Center people already know
about it indeed when the Metro agent
stopped line five the alert was
automatically triggered and this message
is blinking in red on the screen here
they keep an eye on all the city's
transport networks coordinating them
like a conductor in less than a minute
masked areas algorithms had already
devised steps to prevent bottlenecks
adapting the city's traffic reorganizing
it and managing the incident itself the
masked area operator receives the
procedure to be followed he just has to
choose from among several options he
selects bus commuter trains passenger
information maintenance for any damage
to the rails police and the fire
department
each of these players receives an alert
in real time through their operation
center connected to must really bus
frequency is increased and the commuter
trains get ready for a massive influx of
passengers at the station the agents
provide passengers with updates and
alternatives maintenance is already on
site in just one hour thanks to mass
tria Metro is finally able to get going
again 10:30 a.m. on another day mastiha
receives a message from the city's
weather service heavy snow is expected
in three days time with temperatures
down to minus ten degrees Celsius based
on the data it collects every day master
er knows that commuters will be
reluctant to drive their cars so the
algorithms prepare a crisis plan this
process involves increasing transport
capacity the bus Metro and train
companies are alerted and Mastry Alette
s-- them know how much they must each
increase their traffic mass tria
prevents a disruption even before it
happens it can also plan in the longer
term for a concert scheduled in a city
or a major sporting event thanks to mass
tria to the bus metro and tram services
we'll be forewarned that they'll need to
provide extra capacity mastiha also
alerts private ride-sharing and city
bike services so that all contributes a
smooth traffic
more than a simple tool mastiha is
becoming a real partner for cities it
guarantees all of a smooth traffic in
the city now and in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
