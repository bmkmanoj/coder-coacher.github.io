congratulations you made it to step 6
for this part we're going to start no GS
on our Intel Edison board and we're
going to send request the in tourism
board itself for this we're going to use
an iPhone app that we're going to use to
change the position of the actual
servers but relax we're going to share
how to make that appt in the next video
so for now let's get started let's now
take care of the server code you get
downloaded on github press the barn it
copies the link on the Edison SSH we do
a git clone and we paste the link then
we validate it it will automatically
download all the sources that are on
github then go in the file Edison arm
for / source you will see on that file
fgs exists for everything to work you
have to install the same modules to know
GS NMP install express dash save
then the module serial port
and request a Phi
then the open cem card is connected to
the edison by OTG we can see it by doing
ALS de force / dev we have a TTYL a CM 0
that is the port serial then in the file
fjs we have to change the port come to
dev for / TTYL a CM 0
we save the file and we can start it
the comport was open without problems
and the motors turned into a vertical
position we can even send a command to
the motors from your browser with this
command IP colon 8080 for / to move ? ID
equals 20 and value equals three hundred
close the parenthesis and now we can see
the motor moving let's now explain the
code or starve explaining the basic
functions first we have the classic HTTP
function made of Express on the 8080
port it enables us to retrieve
everything that comes from the telephone
with the move that takes two argument
IDs and values that are IDs of the motor
and the angle value between 0 and 10 24
we use serial ports you have to put the
right port serial on which the open sim
card is connected as soon as we retrieve
data on move we're going to write on the
serial port with Freight
the poor cereal should be the same for
you because you only have one connected
to the edison so now that everything is
working let's move on to the next step
and work on that mobile app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
