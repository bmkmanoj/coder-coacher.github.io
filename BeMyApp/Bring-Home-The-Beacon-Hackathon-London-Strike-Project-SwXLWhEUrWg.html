and we have an app that is going to
reinvent social life I'm dating when
around exactly so we bought a single and
you know the thought that came to mind
was there should be a better way to meet
and greet and there is an issue with
tinder that there are so many matches
but then takes effort to planet and you
don't really talk to people you need an
icebreaker and if you meet them and it's
a bus mike is not successful night so we
thought why don't we make an app that
actually enables people to meet singles
right there and then at the bar mr.
Riker guy yeah oh they're usually know
them we're all friends here this is only
accelerate commuting physics that cuts
out talking no talking meeting so what
you do is it helps you plan your night
out now again what's trending what's the
hot singles bar in town and what it lets
you do is pre-plan and saying say that's
kind of interesting maybe maybe maybe in
thats that's trending so that's how you
pick a venue and you go in there you
register and that's how we're using
eclipse and it's just hello welcome to
club much advertising but anyway going
the ladies ladies get to see a selection
of then we're at the event on the ladies
see men and then
ladies they only see that there's some
single women out there like flipping
cards so this is such a power plan so
when I get to decide you may like first
and only at that point with the guy
actually get to see it with them she
becomes a person if he likes for back
yes and she said oh oh she liked me to
agree to meet I'm great thing is that
we're using weekends to help people to
find each other within a venue yep so it
will indicate to both herbs for example
go to the bar or back to the lunch meet
at the bar right now let me guess like
if it's about you might just a moment I
already having fun having a drink and
saying well nice to be talking next and
you're a cheat worry i'm already met
there we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
