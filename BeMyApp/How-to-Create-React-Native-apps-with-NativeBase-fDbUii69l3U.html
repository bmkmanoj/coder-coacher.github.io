one second oh it's Larry guys we go yeah
perfect
so we're up we're up and running you're
all set to begin thank you okay Thank
You Lou so hello everyone I'm going to
be talking about creating react native
apps with native base in this webinar
my name is Iman shoes a teacher and I'm
a software engineer at Kiki Jack's which
is our product and services company and
I have eight months of experience in
react and react native and I'm the
co-author of native pace about which I
will be talking shortly so if you are
going to build it to do app using react
native native base and redux so before
we do that I'd like to talk about react
native so our company started working
with react native one year back when
Facebook relays react native for Android
before that we used to build mobile apps
using ionic or cordova so but that used
to wrap our app inside the webview
so those apps were slow and it just did
not feel native so after we started with
react native we were happy with it
because it renders a native UI so the
performance is good and we have a
component based development like we can
have reusable components and best of all
we have JavaScript so you
do not need to learn another language
for iOS or Android you just need to know
JavaScript
but soon we ran into some problems like
there were two low-level API is to build
the interface so we wanted to have
something which will allow which will
allow us to start with the app
development easily so we started
building a product called native starter
Pro that was a premium product we had
different components in that which are
usually used for mobile apps so then we
decided that some of the components
inside later starter Pro should be like
most of them should be open sourced so
we created a library native base so
native phase provides a set of reusable
UI components and it is also highly
customizable and it is variable driven
like bootstrap so it is easier to change
the theme of your app very easily just
by editing some variables in the theme
file and we have built this library
based on the design guidelines of Google
and Android and and for iOS so with a
single codebase you have a platform
specific look and we currently have 23
or more than 2,300 github stars so I'll
be just pulling up the native based
website
okay so what native base is trying to
solve is if you have some code to create
a button component it will look like
this without native base and with native
base you just need to use the button
component in JSX and we also have
platform specific design so like for
this header the same code will look
different on Android and iOS according
to the platform guidelines so I think we
should start with the to-do app actually
before we start with to-do app we can
also talk about readers which we are
going to use for state management for
building the app so redux is a library
which allows you to have state
management separately and it will help
you to write your state management such
that it is easier to debug and your app
will behave consistently because all
your data is inside a single state tree
and also the state the app state is
read-only so whenever we want to change
something we omit an action which will
create a new state that will then be
used to render the app so the functions
which are used to
transform the state are pure functions
which means it
they both mutate the previous state
they'll create a new state based on the
action and return that state so what we
have here is or app will be provided
with a store using the provider
component from redux so that way our app
can access the state reader state and we
have a app container component which
boots up which contains our whole
application so actually we have two
types of components in redux
presentational components and container
components so container components are
the components which actually interact
with redux directly interact with
readers so all the actions that we want
to do or be perform on the state are
written in this component and all the
presentational components are only used
to build the UI so we can first just get
started with the like reducers which are
used to modify or create a new state so
for the to-do app we'll have
some actions like add to room which will
get the original state and just it it
won't mutate the original state and
we'll use the es6 spread operator to get
the original state and add extra
properties that we want like in initial
state we define the structure of our
state so it has a to Do's array which is
an area of objects of type this so we
have text inside that which will have
the text of to do a to-do item and it
will have a boolean value completed
which will be toggled and we have a
display type which will decide which
items to show so actually I can show you
on the app that we are going to build so
this is the app
so there are two two items and each of
them can be toggled and we can filter
these items it shows all the items this
button shows completed items and this
potential is active items you can also
delete things so each of the actions
that we are performing here
corresponding to that we need to have an
action in redux so for adding the item
we have add go to action and we have
removed - - action we have toggle and we
have a set visible if set visibility
filter so I legs I have already
explained ad - direction so for remove
to do we modify the state such that the
item which we want to remove we receive
the index of that item in the action
action object so the action object for
our goggle to do looks like this so we
receive an index and receive the type of
the action so based on that this
function modifies the state and returns
a new one
so our app is connected with the these
actions so this container component apps
container will dispatch all these
actions and all these I will just make
these actions available as props to the
to this to do component so to do
component is just a presentational
component so I will just get to this to
do component so this is what it looks
like looks like and inside the render
function this is our view layer so we
are using native based components here
so this container component contains all
of the view all of all the components
inside the page and as you can see this
header component for this header
component we have used header from
native phase we have a title and all of
the content which need to be scrollable
inside the page is inside the content
component and for
to do items we are using list component
from native base inside list components
we have this function rendered to-do
list which will return all the items so
we'll have a look at this function now
based on the display type it decides
which items to show so this reader state
is available as prop drops to this
component so inside this process we have
display type based on that we return the
to-do items like this so we have created
a new component here to-do item to which
we will pass these drops so I'll also
open the to-do item component so this
returns a list item component from
native base and we just have a check box
inside that we have the text which has
Holly the to-do item our text and this
icon which is this icon used for
deleting the to do tasks so that to-do
items are available in this array so
using the map function will turn the
area of to-do items
and for these three buttons we have used
knitted lace buttons
and each of these buttons has an action
on on press so this action modifies
dispatches the action set visibility
filter which modifies the display type
variable inside the state and based on
that we render different Tula items in
this function render to-do list
and for input we are using input group
components from native place and a
button so this input group component as
you can see living we can modify it very
easily so this has some default styling
from native place and if we can change
how it looks
based on this prop water type so if i
write together here and see curved
rectangular border or i can also have
hundred border with this
so it is very easy to customize all
these components and I'll just give an
example how we can modify the header
component and customize it like they can
have a button here
both that so I just added a button
inside this header with the prop
transparent and we have an icon inside
that button so it shows up like this and
we can also have another button inside
the header which will show on the right
side
so and now
like to show you are some other
components from native base so we have
this Anatomy which has container header
content and footer so this defines the
layout of your page and we have badge
component we have button components
based on different drops you can enter
different types of component buttons
component and this is the checkbox
component that we have used with our
to-do app so we have this list and list
items inside that each list item has a
checkbox and text and we have a
component deck swiper in native place
this component is just like tinder swipe
so you can have cards which you can
swipe on left or right and we have
floating action button
we have this footer tabs
you
component that we used in our to-do app
you can customize it in different ways
like you can see in this screenshot you
can have icons with that
you
then there is a
component which looks different for iOS
and Android
and the searchbar component can be used
inside the header so that's it and I
hope the to-do app was clear enough and
so for this to-do app we have the source
code available on github so you can pull
that up and get the source code
so I think I'm finished with everything
you alright thank you well thank you a
