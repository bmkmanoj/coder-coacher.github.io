trying to solve here is the problem of
hand hygiene in UK the problem is that
line 16 people are at risk of
contracting hospital-acquired infections
and the problem is currently being sold
by the NHS by spending trillions of
dollars of pounds on campaigns that are
encouraging hand hygiene and hospitals
so we're building sandy trax which is
the mobile tracking app of hand hygiene
and hospitals so to start off we have
built an MVP using to beacons
proximity-based technology the two
beacons would be installed in the
hospital ward one at the entrance and
one on the hand sanitizer and if the
doctor is not utilizing the hand
sanitizer within 30 seconds of entering
the war they get a notification on your
phone reminding them that they need to
do that your behavior is actually
monitored and tracked so by the end of
the day they're able to compare their
performance yes other people's hand
sanitization behavior and get real-world
feedback and be able to improve their
behavior as well as a result so our
technology is really
it's unexpensive it's cost effective
divides and measurable data and we even
went to present your idea to a local
hospital and a synopsis if they would
use the app and they said that they
would love to so we know that our next
step would be to address the infant
infection control the army and try to do
a demo in a real real world environment
and we know that this app can say we
images billions of pounds every year we
know that it can improve hand hygiene
and it can ultimately save lives so this
is our team to have everything that we
need in our team we have ensemble which
is a product who is the product
development person of the idea person we
have aidan and Julian our developers
myself and Eloise working on market
anxiety perfect thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
