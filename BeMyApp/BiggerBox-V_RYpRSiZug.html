making the ikea shopping experience
awesome so right now it's already kind
of fun while you in the showroom and
you're looking around products it said
this problem is as soon as you start
actually willing to buy any of those
products the experience goes right down
hill you get that little stubborn paper
and piece of pencil you've gotta write
everything down in soon numbers when
you're done shopping you're not done
shopping because you've got to go into
the warehouse you've got to find all
that stuff on the shelves drag it onto a
cart just to spend 20 minutes in the
checkout thinking about alright so what
we're doing is we're getting rid of all
of that replacing it with the I with the
Amazon style experience for real-world
shopping and we're going to show you
what that looks like right now okay so
mom shopping and the bushes card around
I don't like the person
we could you know find a car while I
didn't have to do any of that that'd be
fantastic
each they instilled in even all staff
so what did you think of the digital
shopping cart
see what the line looks like it is a
little bit of a longer line not a big on
like shopper either but the idea that we
could be in store and everything kind of
ready for us to go right
yeah the store would def lines yet you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
