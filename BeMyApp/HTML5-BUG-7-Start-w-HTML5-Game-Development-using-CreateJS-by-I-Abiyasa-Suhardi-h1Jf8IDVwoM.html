talk about game development html5 game
development is in kgs so first of all
i'm going to introduce myself so I'm
Abby so I've been doing a lot of
programming but I have a hobby making
games so I fried everything's not
everything but lots of basic Pascal back
then and C++ Android by the last five
years I've been doing flash the flatland
and but now I'm exploring stem l5
because it's looks they're more
interesting things going on there so
this is the outline i'm going to
introduce the key ideas first the
components and the end we going to do a
little bit life coatings so we're going
to make a game maybe not not not from
scratch but you will see how it is in
action so before i start how many of you
guys have doing our game development
maybe for hobby okay not so many how
many guys are doing JavaScript I guess a
lot create GS ok so it's good so why
squid yes so it's a package libraries so
it contains for libraries actually so
there's a canvas rendering graphics
there's also sound playing and also
preloading and you don't have to use all
of them so you can
so you can you don't have to use all of
them feed yes so you can use some gs1
sound or you can use the graphics
library so let's start the first
component it's called easel yes this is
the graphics components so it handles
canvas easily for you you can download
you can download bitmap create simple
shapes spreadsheet animation packs and
mod I also handle Mouse and touch oh by
the way creatures also mobile so its
support for mobile so you can it also
support is 6 for example so it's pretty
cool and the second company in sound yes
you probably know what it is so very
sounds and if it's it can automatically
download some files and this is the
feature that I like so you know that
audio in HTML files it's a little bit
tricky the format I mean so it's mp3 or
OGG or AAC so using sound yes you just
provide all of them and sound es will
automatically load the right one for you
and this is priligy s so this is
basically only loading all the assets
which is pretty cool for again so you
don't want your games stop in the middle
because it's loading big image or
something so you want to download
everything before the game stock and the
other tools called to India's and clay
just also have some toes we probably
will use spreadsheet tools and because
crazy is also sponsored by Adobe it has
some exporter for photoshop /
illustrator and there's also another
tools if for example is six does not
support canvas it will have flash rubber
fall back
so why cages for game development
because I think it has enough components
for game development we have graphic we
have sons we have input so and then it's
free and open source it has mobile and
it has political documentation and
examples so if you go to create years
website you can see how to draw shapes
and making sons and they also have some
game examples inside so that's probably
the introduction 4 kgs so we can see we
will see how it's in action so so we can
see again do you know fa e guys know
this game probably not so in two
thousand cigarillos the game called
typing of the dead so you're running
around there's a zombie running around
so you have to type in order to kill the
zombies so basically it's a teach you
how to type 10 fingers and it's really
fun you time you can I know is from Sega
okay so this is the game we going to to
make so it's alka night so that there
will be a ball bouncing around and there
are some bricks that you have to destroy
so can you see the code so this is the
HTML for html5 as you can see so there's
a canvas and it's this t the ISA yes we
are using and the main GS basically just
empty so I I this is the basic structure
pro if you not familiar I choose this so
you don't pollute the global variables
so you have a model well it's simple and
if you google you know this is pretty
common
so how does it look like oops sorry
let's start with step zero so it's
basically this is the canvas you will
see ya this is called and you go so the
first thing is you have to do is still
create a stage which is a canvas rapper
so first we get the canvas I'm not
really by the way that the slice and the
source code urn is available on github
so you you can download afterwards so
don't worry about it and then after you
get the canvas you just create stage
and refraction yeah it's like a headless
you got no error message okay because
the stitch has nothing so let's diss
display the ball okay maybe we have a
ball radius which is probably good for
lay down up you don't have to declare it
so let's make a simple shape and then
you have to add the shape into the stage
by using a child after you add to the
stage you have to call this in order to
redraw the canvas let's see yay of
course it's not there's no error but we
just create empty ship here so we have
to draw what kind of shapes we want to
show it could be rectangle or circle so
if you are from flash you're probably
going to be familiar with this because I
hope the code will explain what it says
so this is how you define the color this
is how you draw the circle the location
yeah maybe let's make it a eight pixel
and yeah looks good pretty fresh I'd
stop Connor there so let's move it to
the center so as you can see the the
shape has x and y da see this couple of
lines you can already see something so
so static ball is really boring let's do
some animation so let's do animation
here so you can easily create animation
by using object call ticker so what you
have to do is to listen to the event
which is called thick and basically what
we have to do we have to
they're cool so let's move the drawing
to hear so the ticker will call this
aunty every every frames so this is you
might want to animate the ball here so
let's maybe let's mix full speed
so you can easily this is the is this
way so you update the position based on
the ball speed we forget to us to define
the speed okay this is how you start the
animation and one tick is the function
which will be called everything let's
see how it work ok so the ball left it's
really fast because the balls move like
150 pixels everything which is probably
good or bad because if the animation
really slowed and your blog your ball
will move really slow so you there's a
technique not to use frame animation but
you you define the ball speed in use
depending not depending on the frame so
I'll show you with it there's even delta
which is containing how many
milliseconds since the last on tech call
which is in millisecond we convert it to
this is containing seconds and if you x
this so this means that our balls will
move 150 pixels per seconds so you have
stable yeah sorry for men few developers
now you can see it's 150 pixels per
seconds believe me so the nice thing
about using delta so if you change the
one per second so you can easily change
it to tan by default is 50 I'm sorry as
if is 15 you can see or you can change
it to 60
see it's smoother and it's 150 pixels
per seconds so as you can see where we
already animate the ball so we can make
the ball bones ok so I'm going to do
some cheat here because my typing speed
is slow so I just copy this bouncing
stuff so if you see there's nothing
special here you just check the ball x
if it's outside the canvas with you
balance here by inverting the speed and
if we refresh it right now we already
have it so so as you can see with this
simple we already have a bouncing balls
so we can start with the the other one
let's go let's make our hero here mmm
I'll make it here my typing skill is
slow today it's probably the beer I
don't know so I'm going to do some chit
again I just display you how it will
second step will be so if you see the
code here this is the ball initiation
and the hero is almost the same but I
make a rectangular and then since its
rectangular if I say hero X to this
position this is a top left of the
rectangle so you can change it by using
register pine-sol the hero X and hero
why means in the middle of the rectangle
set off the top left of the rectangle
and then if you see this code this is
just a normal JavaScript to handle key
up and key down so if you see the code
here basically what I did if you I press
key or I really sucky is just to change
the boolean and we we move the hero on
day on tip here so this is the
commenting and then you change the
exposition and you make sure the hero is
moving inside the the location and as
you can see it's already moving the only
missing is the collision between the
hero and the ball so create GS does not
include collision detection so you you
you are lucky to have you implement your
own collision detection you can use
circular or rectangular detection but on
this example I'm going to use the
secular here another cheating so I
implement us sorry the next step is not
about detection but it's about using
bitmap so if you see here I add a new
background so you can easily make a
bitmap by using New York Regis bitmap
and the ball you can easily replace all
these graphics just replace it with a
bitmap and this is the fun part the hero
well it's actually not the hero is a
monster so as you know this is our hero
this is a spaceship
going to show you it's not so spice
is a technique for animation so in one
image you have several pictures which is
useful for animation and in clear GS you
define splash it by using gazer so you
define the the image file and then you
define how big is the each frame in such
bad shape and you define how many
animation inside the spaceship and you
created by using bit bitmap animation
you add it to the stage and you call
gotoandplay walk this is the name of the
animation and if you see the stop here
they're slow we have it here so you
could see the the animations working the
key also change I'm going to show you
something here oops if you open the box
if you open the this is the the part
where you move the hero so I have to
invert the hero when they move to the
left if not I'm going to show you what
happened oops it's gone not a good idea
so if i don't do this so we we have this
moonwalking godzilla here which is
probably fits with a Michael Jackson
today like the sound can be like yeah
and we have this Vikram is a BD door
don't stop okay i'm going to show you
the next step is the coalition so this
is the result for the coalition i
implement a function call is collide
basically this is this is a simple
detecting if two circular is colliding
this is the part where the ball and
heroes collide so if the balls coli and
basically you just bounce after yep so
there we have it is it is still boring
there's still missing policy the thing
in the middle so i'm going to show you
the result first lovely we have puzzle
are destroying the city here so lovely
so so this again this building since is
a sprite ship so you can also use splash
it not only for animation so you you
basically store I don't know five
buildings here in one image and if I
show you the code here this is the
building system array this is 0 blah
blah click buildings here this is where
we make a spreadsheet from the buildings
so they are two ways or many ways to
make a splash it so you can define it
using frames here
or you can define it in it's an array so
there are tools where you can define
these points of the sprite sheets and
this is basically a simple making an
array and and you can use bitmap
animation you pass the sprite sheet and
instead of gotoandstop a dot n play you
just got and stop here I'm going to
modify this so instead of animation name
you pass in the frame number so if I
change this this is the first building
from the spaceship and if I change this
this is the second building and since we
know that there is five buildings we
just randomize number zero to four and
you will have a different building every
time you refresh so this is a cheap
trick to to make a lot of buildings here
so we have Godzilla destroying buildings
so what else missing let's see the next
step will be I'm going to show the
pillory so this is a necessary so what
we did before we always load the image
every time we want to make a hero or
ball so we can also load everything
before the game stop so this is where we
start using preload GS they have lot Q
and then you listen to the complete here
and another Jason here so you define
this is for the background for the ball
and the sprite and the buildings when
it's done I just show it back
and then which basically showed this and
you can every shapes in the kgs can
handle click for example so if you click
this button the gimbal star so when the
star games call basically this this is
our code before except we just call
preloader get the background reload or
get the spear this is the brush spice
 instead of having the image you
just pass this one and also this
building so there you go and the last
step as the sounds so the nice thing
about using priligy is you can just
include the sound when you loads all the
image so these are the difference so as
you can see i download bouncing son
effect you can define mp3 version and
also the OGG so the Sun GS will
automatically download ogge if the mp3
is not supported and vice versa so this
is the explosion again if you see the
the antic animation there you go this is
how you play the Sun effect so if you if
the ball bounce let's play the song by
using this so you just pass the ID and
then if you see the collision here
explosion so let's see
ok so now yeah I hope you guys can hear
it so then you have it so you can so you
can also play background music so not
only sound effects so as you can see
it's pretty easy and bonus stage and
this is not including the presentation
but you can implement mobile or touch
support you can also support an
accelerometer maybe instead of touching
button you tilt the mobile to move the
dinosaurs and since this is JavaScript
you can implement the game UI using MVC
frameworks for example you can have your
web designer designed UI using CSS so
this is the good things about html5
gaming because all those web development
tips and tricks you can use it inside
your game so that's the things that I
really love about html5 game development
so this is the links to the slides and
do I have time maybe I can show you one
more games this is from Crete GS and
it's playable in mobile so the guy this
is a factor actually so the guy create
the SS using adobe flash and
they exported to the JavaScript so you
can shoot you can go down okay so as you
can see the graphic was canvas but this
is also Dom you can select and I haven't
tried on ipad bad yeah yeah so this is a
dumb you can see here this is so thick
okay I don't know how to quit this way
yeah what okay I'm getting better now
that's that's not good I'm let you get
me tula killed okay so so yeah you can
also download the game here the planet
carry and yeah that's it
so any question yeah so i will post it
to the meetup website and also the
twitter so you guys can download
everything here so seven steps so you
can make your own games you can replace
it with Michael Jackson's or so what
made you use create GS and not just in
pure JavaScript you can use a jquery but
I mean what was it for you because he
I'm came from a flash so it's kind of
similar the structure so the stage
calling the bitmap the shapes everything
looks the same have you tried in our
game or game others for html5 before I
before yeah i tried Quintus for example
are there's a lot of a framework pair
and what I like about clay Jesse this is
a kind of like minimalistic so you can
combine with whatever framework you like
so for example i combine kgs with
there's entity base component framework
so this is just rendering engine so you
can combine with angularjs for example
our chicory you explore against using
phony or anything else and not yet but I
talked with the guy who made kgs they
they said is the performance they have
kinda likes a little bit performance
issue but it's it's doable maybe spawn
get for fedora
you show again the pre-loading and I
thought it was cool then reference is to
images that no i think it was in the
code ok and there's a secret level also
yeah there you go so yeah so those
function calls to images get our URL
enter their motive yeah okay yes because
if you don't use the pillow so when you
call create new GS bitmap the URL it
will be so it will do lazy loading and
actually you have to take care if it's a
loaded or not otherwise the game could
start without even waiting the the image
to be loaded first so it could be
problems if you have slow connection but
it's not a huge issue too low like this
price for for level 2 or something later
ah you can do that too so maybe if you
finish one level and then before you go
to the next level you can do another
bailout to load the second level data
and second spreadsheet and you can also
use priligy else to load JSON data and
even to those javascript files so it's
pretty nice so i think on the game
planet carry that i showed before i
think it loads the easel GS using pre
loggias so it's pretty nice yep
framework files so kgs has CDN so you
can choose to use the whole klages
package or just use the easels on GS one
by one but i think all the 3gs run 200
kilobyte minified but i'm not really
sure how big very 10 30 that's the old
radius
okay and it's a CDN somewhere so you
don't have to put it on your website
some might you might get cash summer do
you have any really bad experience of
Korean yes yes yes like the the the one
day three key things is the the mobile
support because yeah it is canvas it
might get upward acceleration but i
think it's not kts issue it's probably
canvas problems in mobile and desktop a
javascript HTML 5 problems for sons yes
san Giacinto of fall back so you can sub
mp3 ogg and if everything fails you can
even set flash fall back for loading
songs so it's kind of strange you use
html5 but you use flash for playing
songs but in some cases you have to do
that yes it there's a object called kgs
touch so you can make it enable
multitouch for example and it can also
handle swipe touch here yeah it also
ended up but you can also handle just
like normal javascript like the key up
down yeah I know there are some divers
now like pixie that as a WebGL 2d
rendering yes over the Arctic is this do
they have anything in the park for for
WebGL vendor
oh yes that's the one thing that I
talked with the T creator they said it
use canvas at the moment but there there
is some plugins which allows you to use
WebGL instead of canvas but this is
still a mental and you can also use dom
dom element so there's a plugin so
instead of using emphasis you stop to
the drainage so I also eager to get abs
website you can see the organization
