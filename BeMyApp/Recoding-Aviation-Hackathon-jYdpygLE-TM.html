hopefully some good new ideas that we
haven't thought of before the ideas of
developers which are not caught in
within this airport thing they come from
outside they are passengers and they are
developers and they have great ideas I'm
really looking forward to some new ideas
and solutions that we can take home and
implement within our Airport
I think for an airport it's very
difficult to to find a spare moment to
to look at what is happening in the
world around us so we are involved in
our daily business and we need to find
time to have a look from from the
outside
innovation is connecting people
connecting an idea
to the ten steel atmosphere killer of
people getting ready
and what's really fantastic the
developers are working for 48 hours and
they're making a lot of stuff so imagine
what we can do in two months
