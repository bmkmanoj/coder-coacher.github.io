here hosting the entirety Roadshow
everyone gets an insult Edison developer
kit so that surprise within itself
people come here they don't know each
other they have great ideas 24 hours
that's a layout and they come up with
some really cool stuff we want to create
awesome technology that people can use
to really change the world we are making
a smart mailbox so it'll tell you when
you have mail when it was delivered when
it was picked up the ibar cab is like is
what's making your dog smarter safer in
April time our project is called meet
sense morning air quality anomaly
detected please check on tricky and
maybe Bernie by using our smart add-on
module you'll be able to track the
status of the trash can so how much
trash is in the trash can recently we
had a lot of that talk about unarmed
shootings and things like that
something I came to mind was a smart
holster it'll detect when our gun will
basically be withdrawn from the holster
so it would provide like analytics for
different law enforcement departments
give us an idea of how often cops are
reaching for lethal weapons you have
three minutes to demo your project will
then go into a one-minute Q&amp;amp;A with the
judges will deliberate and then we'll
announce the winners of the roadshow
you guys this is awesome
winning team marcos we made something
cool happened i think it has the
potential to impact you know so i think
really proud of that i was like when
teams like that win because he didn't
really come with his whole team he kind
of came alone with an idea and he met
them here a networked and he won and I
mean it was a great idea and that's what
we love at hackathons is when that
happens and it happened today
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
