India a girl started traveling from
Hyderabad and she went missing and after
two months of search they found out she
was half burned and she was tagged out
already but they found around the world
somewhere in the suburbs finally when
they figured out how she died it was a
taxi guy who basically polluted with
others people and killed everything so
this is a big problem it is lot of
countries so that's why we I came up
with this half we're in we'll have
beacons in each taxi and each taxi
driver will have a profile which will be
associated to the beacon and whenever
that actually approaches you you will
get to know whether it's a good or bad
guy and once you get into the taxi you
checking automatically in the
application and once you're like inside
the application you have a button it's
something like a SOS button you click on
it it will send the SMS email or a
Twitter message with your current
location the taxi drivers information
the taxi license later and even the East
license number so all those things will
be sent across and then if at all you
reach home safely you can say I regional
quickly rate him and in future you will
be able to profile them just like yell
it will be I no safer taxi or not safe
around you you can go ahead and make
your dish
in the back counter here so I can
basically say I don't want to take this
taxi I ignore him so this is good
ratings he has a 99.8 so but somehow he
thinks of misbehaving today so what I do
is I click send images in this age</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
