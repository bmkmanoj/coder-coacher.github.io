whomentors.com incorporated as a
scientific research organization i'm
also an air battle manager for the
united states air force so i wanted to
concentrate into environments air
traffic management as well as those
persons like myself that do air battle
management over different countries the
opportunity here is the FAA is actually
looking for what we refer to as a
class-3 environment where we want more
interaction between human and machines
in this case touch screens are
dominating the field right now but the
HP sprout provides the opportunity to
provide a look down or top-down
perspective right now the screens or
monochrome and it's very hard to
distinguish our what we say discriminate
between identifier us but it'd be great
with the new device to actually be able
to use both displays as well as allow
for interaction for touching directing
aircraft and so on either with gestures
or through touch my team excuse me as
made up of Pedro where is he somewhere
near I over there Michelle we all had
actually learned WP windows presentation
foundation and so it was a great
immersive learning experience for all of
us involved and then the demo later demo
for we can actually use both screens you
can touch a maneuver the aircraft so the
intent here is to offer simulators as
well as a game and it also makes for a
great screen saver and then lastly the
intent of this we do want to work on it
further because my corporation we do
things not just for hackathon but for
commercial needs and so on again the
idea would be to build off of this both
for simulating flight training as well
as for those four in the air traffic
environment thank you what we want to do
was to recreate the environment that an
air traffic controller or my case inner
battle manager would have to do our
stations are no different than laptop
monitors or actual desktops so it would
be nice to actually be able to use
commercial off-the-shelf technology to
actually recreate the environment so we
wanted to do here is replicate instead
of radar returns which would be amber
green light against the dark black
screen and the data or the symbology
overlaps in this particular scenario we
have the 2d representation but as you
can see there's no spatial separation so
the mat a horizontal matt would actually
allow for the air traffic controller to
actually see the separation and you can
actually click and actually move the
different aircraft
in the next versions we're going to have
it where you can actually direct an
aircraft and send information digitally
to the aircraft so that can make
correction and so on if anyone familiar
with the Asiana air traffic crash that
happen couple months ago there wasn't a
side view they were you the instrument
landing system was down that day so they
didn't have a lot of information it
would be nice to a bit of seen the
approach to that particular runway and
then someone could have reacted in since
formation to the aircraft anyway you can
actually do multi ching at the same time
so that's the display questions in terms
of the air separation its own or yeah so
we can the intent is there's a grid
actually if you look there's a light on
each one to show the altitude so this
would be the altitude representation and
this will show what we call the bubble
in terms of separation between the
aircraft but yeah we can overlay it and
you can actually change the Nimba night
plate in and change the direction in the
next version you can actually send
directions and so on and then it would
communicate digitally to the aircraft in
an air battle management station we
actually have consoles to communicate so
that we wanted to do that as well but we
learn two different limitations of WPF
so is a new thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
