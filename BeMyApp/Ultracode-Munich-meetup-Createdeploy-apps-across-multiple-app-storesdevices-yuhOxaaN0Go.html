English okay um yeah HTML HTML 5 this is
a big hype this year but he used HTML
years ago with google and ebay and
amazon and so much HTML is so great that
HTML works everywhere on every device on
I pants on other tablets iphone
smartphones but we work nothing all this
only a ship it works the steps for the
different of HTML depends when H can
arouse on all systems why we don't use
only HTML so different from HTML it
apsis except for better performance on
each device the Arabs enter X has a
better access to hardware assemble
sentence competence or accelerometer GPS
NFC and get light yeah as go better
interact notifications as the user of
the ad carry notification on the icon is
a new information for you when a browser
you can only give the title of a pet and
the user can see it ok so you check
message although yeah it's a different
of HTML apps and we have a big problem
as this absolutely we have the market is
too big we have
much device so much us have Windows 8
you have apple android Enochs and more
and each day each us have a set of
guidelines set api's to access the heart
bear and on Ethel you used object II as
a coding language windows you use C
sharp visual basic c++ top Nets linux
c++ it will boost on each the device or
os are other us language and AP ice this
is a big problem then you like you know
one solution for all devices and a big
solution this one market phonegap
phonegap is running on every device and
you can make this HTML and CSS magic
apps and deployed this apps on every
spot a little story will play and so on
I like show you quickly
then home campus our project from Adobe
this for free to use photo below and you
can download it here from from web com
and here between movies office that
sound
ask because
okay put those on okay the idea
background work so you have our
JavaScript SDK from Tonga and estacada
through an API to access to listen to
the hardware compost and law or what you
like and you can upload this HTML
package this you use this JavaScript to
a phone kept with it server in the cloud
and phonegap creates for you I Nexus app
form every spoil you like so for each
story like windows dog and so on I can
have your problems this phonegap
but longest to have many the center
chase you must pay for building and
deploying when you like deploy our app
for your video store and saw your must
pay it then you like testing this tonite
Molitor you eat form your each platform
provider SDK you must install on your
mind machine and must a lot the package
of foam cap and yeah and then you can
test it and yeah you need for each
target system are all our structure and
it's not so easy this young you need a
height and itachi that is so many
problems this phonegap but in turn has a
solution for you this free building
deploying of this app package that is a
big big benefit you can you get a free
development environment the Intel XDK
desert has for you a code editor
designer for the front end and always
important to know laters big a PE for
everything you need the same or phonegap
as an in behind the technology is not
over a soldier but inter if you are a
better interface for young 5a easy
induction yeah and to get some cloud
services integrated cloud services for
analyzes gate development push messaging
and so on and the next big
benefit is the html5 community from
internet and find it under html5
half.com okay you can free download to
Intel XDK preview in the next month a
counselor full version inter works on a
bike you can work today now this html5
def software in total ok show you
the team
okay long nose I'm swear that I tell you
here you can download it the 83
megabytes is only a XO file item click
once deployment on your machine for
windows and mac OS this I like not big
frameworks and so you can use it's very
simple the Intel XDK a Salafist in HTML
Javascript as a loud chess and this
running us window software owners that
kit asparagus knowledge es that kid
combination and denser development of
our environment XD can you see it first
you must go for free register on hitters
also create account and here you can
start this project okay Stan you rotate
xscape rotate truck approaches okay I
get hello world okay and here you see
five structure the solution folder image
index.html and here you get a free HTML
editor and when you see what created xdk
and background is nothing us html5 one
image file and yeah one picks an elf I
460k that has the information yeah what
for settings you have used a business
the dissolution and so on as a very
simple here you can see the default
html5 as a chip five page with the
excess of the internet xdk JavaScript
API and you can use your free app
designer so when you like used your HTML
editor you can open file it directly
here in this photo and working this xtk
together and interact desire then you
open it the first time the question what
you like for at fanworks a default app
framework from interviews you have your
the standard design Twitter
bootstrap from Twitter a free JavaScript
framework for you I or check very
warrior
I use the default app framework select
and quickly Lord Ram okay and here you
can see is a happy as default us
smartphone view you can change it to a
tablet or tablet or a center control
image
okay a snacks dropped a button
and then you select do I an event on the
designer get a property's view on the
right side I can change the label with
take picture can change the icon or the
ads are icon we see a bottomless cake
picture and this media very support and
all the things you can set it here okay
this is a designer and when you see what
creates you the HTML code is button
you're a tape for the button CSS
definition too much fire and here we
have a next time emulate and here this
is a big benefit to care for a big big
awesome devices a simulator here is
default nokia lumia 920 the circus home
you can testing young or you can use
galaxy tablets this is the finished
result and very quilters on the
simulator you can emulate ear location
on every place you like it device events
devices offline online or as push the
button Hauser reason and all the
settings yes up more examples is XD came
a better sample is for more later
features
and you can we create a new project
start the steamer and your brother can
next okay I just
rolling sample
it's a very close up and extend
yep Cesar a pin can exert effort and
here in the left side from maletto you
can move the target as a device or shape
and it's all in html5 so for example the
next thing is testing
you needa account a free account with
Intel and so contesting entity bar in
the episode dip dye reckon so device i
have here are lenovo android device and
you need to let f
and can you have the first push fights
next is
my hips
I tears rolling sample run from server
launch and you see the same sample
quickly and knowledge only available
this direct testing for android and
iphone iphone you can see
let's put
this phonegap only needs only
configuration time much configuration
time and kisses oil in one quick
solution environment XD Kate and then
you liked employ this app you go to the
build tab and you see if some of your
story enjoy windows store because a
store you can develop windows 8 eps
Windows Phone apps android apps iOS that
app or facebook app with one coat I like
Sean next sample or the connect to the
camera I have created a solution take
picture and let me go to the develop set
section we get our free JavaScript help

javascript fire creates an instance of
object camera and here is the direct
access to the Intel's SDK ECMO be and
this is only our help or javascript file
you can write directly of AB movie on
every place in our effort and thus in
utilization of this Travis clip5 creates
automatically are yeah a button

Finnish partner but don't like icons I
like used my button and not the
from this high-profile i can open ears
