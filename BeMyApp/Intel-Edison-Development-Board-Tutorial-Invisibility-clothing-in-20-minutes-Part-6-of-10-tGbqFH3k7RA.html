now I'm going to show you how to capture
a live feed using the webcam to display
the feed on the LED panel we're going to
have to control and change the original
feed doing that we're going to downgrade
the quality of the video to properly
display it on the LED panel so let's get
started the code is available on the
github you get downloaded as a zip or
directly clone the repository to explain
the code simple the thousand seat with a
bit of C++ because we imported it from
opencv explains the c++ here everything
we need is included in the include
folder at the very beginning it is the
initialization for the SI report that we
explained the next video let's start
with the main we open the serial port it
will be used to communicate with Arduino
board we will explain this in just a
moment then we open the camera flux with
opencv we open any camera as we only
have one camera it will be the right one
for sure if the camera can open an error
message will display just exit the
software or restart the next
instructions it's an infinite while loop
because the run variable is at one we
need this because we need to show image
at any time of the LED panel retrieve
one frame so one picture with the opencv
function then we resize it so the
function resize it at the very top it's
simple it takes one image in the
parameters and returns another image
here we need resized in 64 x 32 because
our LED panel have a 64 x 32 screen the
resizing is made by the opencv function
once the image is converted we need to
send it by the serial this function will
be explained just after the next video
here we have over 500 millisecond break
we can display two frames by second it's
enough for this project and because the
Edison is not powerful computer don't
you think you can analyze 60 frames per
second as we finish we close the camera
stream correctly otherwise next time
you'll have an error when you reopen the
camera flux</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
