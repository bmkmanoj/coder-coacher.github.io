is Jacob Perry Daniel Jeremy sure i'm
working on an html5 canvas phase two
dimensional maze game using an easel
jsin box2d web originally wrote it for
the github game off 2012 and i'm porting
it for Tizen at this event I am working
on an expense tracking app seem very
simple very easy to handle and kind of
pretty good i'm working on a web app
that i've been working on a long time
and burning it to being
I didn't know that I'm working on the
in-vehicle infotainment system with
Tizen 3 i'm working on an indentation of
the trimet transit tracker verizon so
that you can use your phone your phone
its current location or give it a stop
ID and figure out when the next bus or
train is arriving i was able to
successfully get the application
deployed on here navigate through two
separate screens both of them canvas
based and then control the plane wrapped
are through the maze and complete
everything i also have like a menu
button and back button integration so
that you can back out of the gameplay
back to the main menu screen so with
that it'll be using all the native UI
it's designed around touching everything
from the web and now everything's files
and so except for
webservice stuff so having to change a
bunch of little things around this is
three-point oh ryan on intel core i5
2500 and with intel HD graphics and
basically the idea is to get some of
these Tizen apps that are running on the
phone to run on the on the screen here
it's one of the one of the few apps I
use on my own phone every day so trying
to get that same functionality on to a
new platform and you're doing a web app
right I'm doing web app okay it's going
pretty well um spent the first day
getting the build process dialed in so
that it was packaged up in a way to the
idea you could consume it um I'm
innocent we got the phones today I was
able to deploy to the phone and get a
running decent performance no I've
identified what some of the new events
that I even to listen to to to make more
responsive interface' that's what I'm
focusing on changing now so here's the
daily allowance this is like what you
can spend each day based on how many
expenses you have to pay
simple keeps it good I am when the
paintings near happen one of the other
things we're working on this week is
getting this HD radio which is a USB
radio and it does is it actually works
we're moving this from removing this
from a C++ dotnet version over to nodejs
which actually has been partially
converted already and we're finishing
that up and creating html5 interface so
that you can use html5 to basically
connect through a hybrid app with the
Tyson and it's supposed to be the list
of videos and then they click on one and
it plays that video and you can add a
new video by pasting in a URL there's
going to be a search box so you can just
like that videos by searching for those
are dragging them into playlists so once
you're in there you can get your current
location as it pulls up um stops that
are within 250 feet of you one of the
next things i'm going to add is a
setting this panel so that you can say
well actually i want things that are 500
feet away or a mile away if you want and
then also after the search by ID if you
go here I'm it's up to pomona bits on
the UI it takes you to a screen tracking
the next two rivals I'm cheating say
there's this bus in two minutes there's
this bus in 15 minutes it's been been a
pretty positive process of fun okay but
things are coming quickly so yeah so
pretty straightforward trying to keep it
simple um given the constraints this but
that's pretty cool good thank you thank
you
