hello my name is David I'm the
representative for group three um we
actually had to focus force abroad for
gaming one focus was really taking a
board game in digitizing it for a sprout
format but the other part of it was
really how do you learn to make sprout
API work with JavaScript so for us I was
a big challenge and we love the
JavaScript environment and I think the
end result we have experience was very
immersive and bearing death I'll go into
some overview but later on I'll go back
into the server and how we kind of
approach that first of all it is a fully
functioning game so you're going to have
a three-player support for king of Tokyo
one of the basic premise for king of
Tokyo is you're throwing dice once you
make a decision you kind of have a scam
feature that allows you to recognize
understand what the dice is and then the
users the player stats change
accordingly there's also another
component that is player cards so for us
we actually have cards that you can
pinch you can move towards in your
proximity which will associate with your
character going back to the dice it is
really about the object segmentation
like we're able to take the data and you
know using API go back and forth of
course another thing fun thing for this
was of course the ematic audio we really
wanted to make a feel like a monster
fighting game so when we do a demo
you'll kind of see and hear that
experience and going into the text side
we do have a local server that's running
that the chrome app in essence talks to
the server sprout API gives data back
and there's a little bit of back and
forth and in a nod to idle we also do
have a rebrand experience so if you scan
in an HP logo the interface itself will
change to each precinct Rick thank you
so here's a demo for king of Tokyo once
more this is a full stream chrome app
and it's talking to the back end with
API calls so I'm going to go through a
few scenarios so you can kind of see how
it works but overall it's all crafted
this weekend so it might be a little bit
weird here and their overall experience
for king of Tokyo is that you do take
turns we have a cinematic you know oh
here's the here's the monster coming
through Sandeep it's your turn so you
have your options you have the you know
your health you know your victory points
you know your energy so you want to
pretty much throw your dice so just to
streamline to this little bit with this
do you throw your diet you make a
decision which ones do I want to keep
which one's the one on a reroll but then
once you do then we have a scam feature
that we've built into the UI so pretty
much this monster keeps on screaming at
you until the results come through adds
a little bit of flavor here we showing a
little bit segmentation awareness of
what you scanned we have six dice come
through so this goes back into the game
engine and you know outside of this demo
it augments their experience and then
another cool feature of courses that be
able to see the dice that you thrown so
this really shows the fact that we are
linked back into the API yeah it's
nothing in another scenario if we let's
say jump to Bruno and now we want to
show you know after your dice roll you
can move move cards around you can you
know move it closer to you and of course
in the actual game you can move it to
here and it will lock into place so that
of course augments your stats here and
there the on the flip side one of the
things we thought was really fun is I'm
going to I'm hoping my reset code works
is you know the brand experience so if
you were in the setup that you want to
have a branded experience if you throw
you know like an HP badge down there and
you want it let's say branded it goes
into idle it takes it back and then you
know because we're using javascript is
it's very simple to reskin it's as
simple as you know putting a body class
so here we create a separate assets that
in essence you know makes it an HP
centric experience but we could
definitely see you know a rebranded
board game like Nike where
athletes are the monsters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
