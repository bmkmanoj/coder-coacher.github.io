joining us today we have a few slides
just the sort of kick things off on some
of the background material we suspect
probably most of you may have learned
some of its already large ships in case
we wanted to have you to be able to look
at something as you start to formulate
your questions at Alex said if you have
any questions in the meantime please
feel free to put the questions into the
Q&amp;amp;A box and we will start to getting to
address immediately have quite a few
experts already on the phones or
standing by ready to answer your
question so first and foremost a little
bit about me i am the community manager
for our developer outreach for intel
realsense I did used to be in the Navy I
could study physics and I am on Twitter
so there's that if you want to know
anything about me that's pretty much it
in a nutshell so what we're trying to
hope wish to accomplish here is we
really wanted to get two things one
obviously we want to educate you guys a
bit answer any questions that you have
addressed any issues or concerns that
you may have or anything you come across
so far it does look like about ninety
percent of youth and already got your
cameras which is great that's super
super exciting to see I'm sure the rest
of you will will be any moves to 90
they've been you can get it shipped out
as fast as they possibly can and i know
some countries have a little bit longer
customs processing others so if you
haven't got any up to patient sure
they're on their way any other aspect is
as i'm going to suggested it we do have
a new initiative coming out or not a new
initiative but a sort of a side
initiative right we're really trying to
get it into a situation where we can
show that developers able to do a rapid
prototype of intel realsense technology
and get it done pretty quickly alright
so I believe Z the deadline is December
17th and there are some rewards are part
of the contest if you get a good solid
prototype in before the date just to be
clear if you get it in before the
December 17 deadline that's not your
final entry so we'll make sure you don't
understand that you still have the full
length of the other deadlines to
continue to polish and improve
move on your app but we want to really
be able to show the world that yes
developers can do rapid prototypes with
intel realsense technology the sdk is
ready for that and supports that and so
that's what we're going for so hopefully
you've already gotten all of your
information by email we're not on that
but if you have any questions on that
aspect we do have Joel on the phone and
you can answer any of those questions so
with that just a short overview for
those that may not have seen it before
but there was a big thing that we're
dealing with here in terms of intel
realsense technology is that there has
been a continuous evolution in computers
for the last 30 years right at one point
over here on the left you actually had
to write in words and that was the only
way you communicate with any computer
was to you put in words and it would pop
out words and that was the
back-and-forth and eventually we got
into a graphical interface right where
you could do things like Windows or the
first mac OS is the one on and use
keyboards and mice which is great and
then eventually we even got these touch
screens over here on the right which is
also another improvement and in some
ways a little bit more intuitive in the
mouse and the keyboard but in other
words it's still a very specific user
interface right it's a situation where
you're having to do something very
specifically on the screen and it's
definitely not what you would consider
natural by most people's recollections
so what we feel the next step is going
to be gesture recognition right and by
gesture recognition if there's actually
a lot of other things in there a whole
natural user interface be able to just
speak to your computer the ability for
your computer to watch your head watch
your face watch for movement right so if
you talk to a child and you ask them a
very simple question before they even
start saying words they'll probably
start to shake their head or nod their
head depending on whether they're saying
no or yes all right so people have
natural ways of interacting already it
wouldn't it be great if if your computer
you could just nod or shake your head to
it and have it react right so this is
where we're beginning with you think
this whole natural user interface is
going to be a whole new area for
computing just like the GUI was 20 years
ago or something but I want make sure
that the SDK itself is relatively easy
for people that are just going
all right and you'd also have all the
details that the expert need to make it
really full and robust opportunity for
them currently today we are working on
the windows 8 1 all the camera that
you've got have gotten everything
involved in this challenge is involving
windows 8 1 the will be versions of real
sent coming I'll show a slide here in a
second that will support Android but we
do feel this is a great opportunity for
you developers that are getting into
this market early those that we've
gotten your cameras already you are one
of the first just few hundreds of people
maybe thousands at most in the world
have gotten access to this camera right
and so that gives you a significant head
start inserting to develop apps and
games for this new and budding area so
we hope you're excited about that and as
I mentioned there are a couple of
different forms of real sense coming out
here in the middle right we have the
front facing that's what we're talking
about today that's what's using the
challenge that'll be the first
commercial versions I'll have the full
gesture recognition and whatnot over on
the left is something called intel
realsense snapshot which is you may have
seen it from the last intel developer
zone that's going to be using on android
tablets dell is the first one that has
announced for this and that's going to
use 33 different cameras so that you can
basically do a lot of post-processing on
a picture but it's not going to be able
to support gestures and things like that
so it's it's kind of like some people
have said like Instagram on steroids
right you'll be able to do a lot of
really cool post processing on a given
picture but it's not going to be the
phone it for the user interface and then
the third version of real sense coming
down the road in 2015 will be this rear
freezing this world facing version which
we will allow you to do things like make
videos and still capture gestures and
scan full full objects like look at the
entire person or verbal or not so there
are some of the realsense technologies
we're going to be dealing with the first
one here or the middle one here today
and that's what you're dealing with in
the town says you've got the canvas for
but we want you to know that this is
part of a much broader and wider
opportunity right this this this one
camera that you have here isn't really
what we're going for we're really going
for a full market effect if just for
some specifics on the camera just
optimize things right you should really
be looking to go between a 20-centimeter
about eight inches out to about a 120
centimeters or about a four foot range
is basically the maximum that you should
deal with in general your hands would
like to be closer than your face so that
the hands or more optimized a little bit
closer some something out to say about
60 centimeters or so or about two feet
or something in that range and the the
actual depth sensor right is is an IR
sensor and the code for that is about 55
degrees horizontally at about 70 degree
there a little bit wider vertically so
these are some of the details of the
camera so when you're making your apps
go and make sure that you you try to
make sure that you you allow for
gestures that stay within that volume
and whatnot and as part of what we're
talking about right we really are
expecting this to be a full fledge
market shifting and opportunity this is
the actual board itself all of the intel
realsense aspects that you need the
devices that you've got chef the cameras
you got said shipped if you if you pop
them open and please don't pop them open
but if you happy or whatever this is
aboard you'd see inside this is actual
side this is a u.s. quarter and down
here are all the OEMs already had a full
commitment to producing systems with
intel realsense technology in them so
this is going to be a market shifting
opportunity this is going to be a
widespread opportunity these things are
going to get built directly into the
bezel of laptops and all-in-ones and
other platforms so it's not going to be
something like the cameras do you guys
have gotten are purely focused for
developer work right these these
developers you've gotten is really
intended to give you all a head start a
jump ahead if you will before the full
systems are available specifically I'm
sure you guys have already gotten a hold
of the SDK
actually it's not invade anymore sorry
that should be cold I didn't update that
my apologies but the the full gold
version is out obviously the the depths
itself is a VGA resolution the camera
the full 1080p RGB and it does require a
full USB 3 interface so when you plug it
into any of the systems that you have if
you're not using you know provided
system or something please make sure
you're looking for that blue tab inside
of the USB port or it really it does
have that kind of bandwidth that kind of
throughput and you need that USB 3 to
handle that kind of traffic flow also as
I'm sure you've been told a few times it
does require the 4th generation or has
well there's a code name for that intel
core processor and as we've mentioned it
runs on windows 8 dot 1 if any point
obviously we're great we're really happy
you guys are here on of the webinar
today but if when you're done with this
or if you need any more help we do have
this one URL here software and telecom /
real sense which is a single point so
you guys can go to for all of the
information you need we have a forums on
there we have blogs in there we have
code samples other type of case studies
went on all the information that we have
pertaining to real soon it's contained
in one place to make it easy for you
guys to find so again thanks for
attending this webinar but what it's
done and over with feel free that you'd
still have an area here that you can go
to to make sure you get more information
if you need it so real quick will muster
this obviously it will look at your
hands and look at your face there is a
speech component and coming down the
road in early 2015 will be an
environmental component or object
scanning or exactly right specifically
when we look at the hands if you if you
hadn't seen some of the documentation
yet it will support a full 22 points per
hand right and up to 2m so it can need
to be left and right left and love well
I didn't write some of these and play
rock paper scissors with each other
whatever it is there are nine static and
dynamic pre built in functions or
gestures that are already recognized for
a facial standpoint right we can do up
to 78 points of landmark detection
we are working on emotion recognition
it's still coming along and it can even
for example look at pulse estimation
right speech recognition is fairly known
it's not too similar to what you've
probably seen in the past it's much
better for commanding control than it is
to dictation citation is still an
evolving area but one important
difference between this and maybe other
technologies you've seen it is actually
local speech recognition meaning it's
entirely contained on top on your
computer it doesn't access any server
farms over the web or anything else and
then as I mentioned we will be bringing
in this environment or object scanning
available down the road and that will
probably be in early 2015 hopefully
around january or so so we're quite
hardware just to recap quickly write
that fourth-generation core processor
the code game for that was a has well
obviously eight not one to 64-bit mode
the desktop will be the first version
that comes out to modern UI will be
something supported on the road
languages we support our c++ c sharp
javascript and java so if you guys want
if you have other languages that you
want to see us adopt or support you can
also put those into the Q&amp;amp;A box so i
don't know if anyone's had a chance to
write in questions yet but yeah it's in
there and then oh i see if maybe a few
questions guys were there any questions
that you want us to start answering yet
or just there was a question about
earlier generations you use or AMD cpus
I think you'd be check out before you'll
see that there are people trying it on
earlier cpu's with some success but only
if they're on Windows 8 1 or later and
then only with certain parts of the SDK
we just don't have the ability to catch
all the cpu intel made or all the OSS so
we are only saying we support
fourth-generation cpu because it has
functionality that aren't in previous
cpus and windows 8 1 yeah
good question in fact with one of the
engineers that we have an iphone magna
did try to use the 3rd generation Intel
Core processor and it did work to a
degree but it really swamped the the
capability of the processor so when we
say the fourth generation into a
coprocessor it's not just a marketing
thing of whatever it really is because
you need that kind of power that kind of
processing power to crunch is very
detailed amount of data and get it to
not only be able to do all of the
gesture recognitions and whatnot but
then also allow you to support a game or
a nap on top of that so that is the
other thing and obviously processors by
other companies aren't going to be
supported because so didn't tell
technology then should be probably
pretty obvious so anything could just
add to that i would say that there are
specific instruction set requirements
for some of the modalities that would
also impose some amount of constraint on
the processor that we would have to use
to support intel realsense so
performance is one and instruction set
of the other so those are the two
criteria no that's a good another
question that we just get asked here is
is if they were they bundle with eclipse
and the honest answer is no other really
really isn't and we're specifically
doing it that way what we've what we've
done is we've said that we're supporting
visual studio and we're also supporting
eclipse but i will tell you i have
actually seen developers and some of the
hacker labs we've ever already conducted
used other platforms for example the
Intel XDK actually got used in some
cases as we mentioned javascript is
supported so we're purposely not trying
to bundle any of the ids in because we
know that offers have their clinical
comfortable shoes or I mean we know
there are ideas that you guys like and
we're trying to make sure that the sdk
see separate on that so so that's one
question on the live another question in
here is the intel realsense sdk web
server open source so just to jump ahead
a little bit yeah here we go so this is
some of the content that we have when we
talk about being able to support html5
with the web
so I can definitely say at this point
the webservice server is not open source
I don't think we plan to Brian Colleen
magno you guys know however her ever
heard anything about that no yeah no I
wouldn't I don't think we're going to
make it open source we will continue to
make all the SDK were not free and open
and available to people well we're
certainly not going to try and make
money off of the SDK like selling it or
whatnot so that is definitely the
direction we're going but we're probably
not going to open source it at least if
not for the near term I've heard no
plans to that another question was if
this will work with the intel core 2
which is I'm trying to think probably
five generations ago so I can pretty
quickly say no it won't it simply won't
have the processing power is there any
way to get unity Pro for this
development um yes so unfortunately at
this point we don't have any prearranged
set up with unity to support pro
licenses for developers in this contest
Joel I haven't heard your voice yet but
you on yes I'm on and to my knowledge
terse nila yeah there's no courageous if
you needed to provide free license in
order for the pro version yeah sorry
about that he is done to orb linux and
general Iroh dark expand a question on
the horizon I think the answer is yes
when like I said we've gone around to I
know I've done at least four hacker labs
myself and that is one of the key
questions that we get asked is will
there be support for linux and will
there be support for windows 7 I think
the answers to those both of those will
probably become yes down the road it's
not going to be available for this
challenge this challenge will continue
to be exclusively I mean on windows 8
dot one but it will be something that is
definitely strongly being considered in
the future because outside of the
consumer approach which is what we're
doing here right this is what the whole
challenge went out is really about
talking
consumer than getting people develop
apps for laptops and all the ones and
ultrabooks and whatnot down the road and
the embedded market things like airport
kiosks or whatever else you might want
that'll be areas where some of the other
os's are probably going to be needed
just because of the very nature of the
the long tail of embedded usages meghna
or or anyone else just want to give some
context on where information more
documentation is available about the
superhero side here html5 will server
the SDK actually comes back with the
instruction manual as well as a lot of
code samples um so if you see that up
the processing framework is actually job
all right so you will have C sharp C++
unity samples and Java samples all built
into the manual so that would be the
first place to start okay so if you're
especially looking at certain modalities
they actually show you how to walk
through different api's and include them
inside your application and there are
also fully developed sample applications
that come bundled SDK that you could
just play with and see what it is doing
well that's good that's very good soap
awfully you can find the documentation
from the SDK I know if you also go to
our website we do have information there
as mentioned software install com we
have all the documentation also
contained on in that area so that's a
backup if you don't pull all the SDK
itself you want to up so marina you were
asking about more information about how
to work with processing framework
libraries when I uh you know I need to
sound redundant again this I believe all
that information so we have to correct
me if I'm wrong but I believe all that
information is in the documentation also
on the website we have other things like
code samples and case studies when I
where we may have walked through even
greater detail of these things but that
that's where i would i would send you
first for all additional information
all right um no it's okay Paul so you're
looking to implement your own drivers
that would be really cool we do
definitely have a form and you know from
the form we can probably if you post a
question in there if you can't get the
information you want what you probably
follow up with you more directly to help
you with us so you know we're really
excited about you into the island we'd
love for you people to be making new
drivers so yeah that would be be that
would be awesome and we will core to
work with you or not um and the web
server JavaScript support for speech
synthesizer ah i'm going to open a
question to my experts I feel like the
answer would have been yes but I don't
want to say that be wrong because we
specifically say gesture and facial
recognition here guys the world of web
server support the speech synthesizer
part of the f ck oh that is checking
more into that in just a minute we want
to confirm okay we're going we're going
to take a pin in put it pinion out come
back here a little bit and try the exact
question so these have been really good
questions so far thanks to that so if
you have more questions I have them keep
them come in will try to address them as
we go along in the meantime just go back
to the presentation that we we did
mention that we do definitely have unity
support it is a pro version of it but we
have seen that some people can
definitely use it and get get going
pretty quickly and so just recap quickly
on some of our developer programs this
website I keep talking about software
done in telecom / real sense we
definitely want you guys to be very
aware of that that is we're going to
contain all the information including
blogs informs everything else obviously
we do have in select places hacker labs
hackathons that we've been doing i know
i've done four of them myself first i
know another five have gone off in the
US so we have these events and we'll
also go be going to trade shows of
appropriate and then one of the big
thing we want to make sure you guys know
about ears at once you double your app
right this
is this webinar specifically in support
of the challenge so obviously we want
you guys together than that but once
your app is done we do have a sherry rap
showcase right this development is not
just about the challenge not just about
going up to the prizes you can submit
your apps into this share your app
showcase again it's suffered on complex
real stunts and look what that means is
you get all kinds of great exposure for
real sense just as the market starts to
emerge right just as the first systems
are coming online you'll be able to be
one of the first people after turn
corner quote showing your wares if you
think back to the the early days of the
smartphone market wouldn't it have been
great to be one of the very first people
to make even a simple solitaire app for
the smartphone market now we're not
advocating solitaire for real since up
about my point but you know what I'm
saying there's probably already kind of
all kinds of great apps out there for
wherever else and just making that in
the real sense area maybe maybe
solitaire would be a fun app i don't i'm
not a big solitaire player myself but
yeah that sucks that is something that
which is a great opportunity gives you
great exposure just to jump back to some
of the questions one person asked if
there was pie thon support and as
colleen mentioned their agent yet but
will use something that we've gotten
asked for several times that's probably
the most popular language i've been
asked for in all the travel that i've
done so far so that is def a feedback
that we threw them back to the team to
other languages that have also been
requested our math lab and labview are
the other two that people have been
looking another question folks is if
there's hacker support for opencv i
don't think i know the answer that the
lion right now Colleen yeah they're
people have demonstrated the ability to
use opencv with it with the camera or
particularly with the color with the
color stream and the we don't really
have
vacation that it covers that level of
support but yeah opencv and m gu cv are
are able to use certain aspects of the
camera okay great all right so what
other thing I want to mention here right
it obviously out everyone on this call
worked for Intel or supports Intel
directly but you can go get reviewed
some other people right this is a
particular gentleman out of gizmodo and
he's got he was able to get one of the
first exposures to this technology
obviously back in 2013 and he was super
excited I won't use his it's potty mouth
of the language that you can read it
there but he thinks it's pretty awesome
and we do too so you know there are
definitely people outside until that are
really excited about it and we hope you
gather enjoying what you've been able to
do so far the episode joel is a question
on the board here in terms of can i
update my project and i assume the
question is it sounds like maybe Paul
may have submitted something and you may
want to be looking to update a previous
submission you want to handle that one
yes yeah so you can you can take your
project or different direction again it
needs to be related to the original idea
but as you guys probably know you're
submitting more details about the
project right like descriptions and so
you can take it to definitely take it a
different direction they've been some
people done that in previous contests
thanks for that so there you go Paul
we're hoping we're excited about
whatever you're working on it sound like
you're doing great things I'm trying to
read the question from Ricardo and I'm
having a little trouble my app will
involve many types of components one law
when I upload the app will ever be
interaction so i can if necessary
troubleshoot the installation mmm i feel
like the answer Ricardo is
is hopefully going to be the I think the
whole hope is that you can actually not
only develop your app on your systems
but also run the apps on your system and
and use that as a QA I I don't maybe you
can just upload whatever you sent to the
into the challenge on to a different
computer may be able to do it as another
type of QA I don't believe that any
component though you corrected for long
as a component to be doing any sort of
remote running of the app off of other
systems I don't think that's part of it
Rachel edit if I can just after that i'm
george the department would be to
package whatever would be necessary for
us to install it on systems here
all-in-one executable so that way we
wouldn't have any dependencies and
testing out the application I think I
think that's probably oh okay yeah sorry
I did yes that makes more sense yes I'm
glad you insert magna I was going in a
different direction to the question all
right so yeah yeah any submissions you
do they need independent libraries or
not jquery as an example or some like
that right yeah you should be bundling
all of those required dependencies all
together so that we don't we don't have
any missing dependencies sorry I misread
that question joint data are there for
different objects for coordinates what
are the ones you suggestions why
recommendations um yeah Gavin the punt
on that one too I sound like he's asking
is oh it may be is the joint maybe this
is the joint data or in the joint data
there are four different objects for
coordinates guys yeah I love kinis
nobody answer I don't stand what he's
talking asking about in terms of yeah
i'm actually quite understand the
question i do perhaps the ones at
bidwell ways if you could clarify the
question a little bit there are hand
recognition in here tracking joint
recognition is
we also something called blob or contour
mode which can be used with sub gestures
such as fist or side of hand to get a
better read of what the user is doing
but I'm really not clear what your
questions covering so you could type a
smaller enjoyed intimate in the meantime
Lord what I have up here is a slide they
go through the different points of
articulation that we're working on today
in terms of Dalton tracking so when the
system is scanning your hand when seeing
your hand these are leave early the
points of articulation that we have Joel
if I send you a presentation are you
able to send it out to everyone that you
invited to this webinar yeah yeah
definitely okay so so Ricardo we can we
can definitely when we're done with a
flub it obviously I'm not gonna try and
do it during the webinar but well we're
done with this webinar I can definitely
send out these slides if we root for
your review I will say this is all
taught entirely based on the work of all
of the documentation we've all read out
but yeah we'll definitely send them out
if it's helpful we're happy to do it
yeah so so I'm going to jump ahead from
they asked about faces so I'm going to
jump ahead to faces doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo as my computer crashed
okay there we go so what no no no no
sorry hit a wrong button there we go
alright so when you look at when you
look at the the facial recognition right
these are some of the details online
mark tracking we've talked about there
being 78 different points right and you
can see some of them here right we're
going to be looking at things like the
eyebrows and it's very important for
emotions or detecting things things like
the eyes we are able to not just look at
faces in terms of
looking at the faces but also be able to
track the entire head and/or the
orientation of the head so just to go
back a slide I sing but if you and we
talked about this a little bit before
right the we're saying the word pinch
which is a very technical term but the
normal layman would use afraid not right
when we say y'all we mean shake right so
when someone nod your head yes or shakes
their head know you can can actually
make that an interaction of your app of
your game right if there's a simple
yes/no question for people they can
literally respond just with our head
motions so that's one of the things that
we think is gonna be very interesting so
so Albert hopefully we answered that
that question for you if you have a
different angle on that please let me
know which joint detection did you use
for your gestures so I hate to be like
this but I feel like the answers
probably at the least most of them right
I can go through some of the specific
gestures themselves right for example
you know the big five and the feasts on
when you look at the differences between
those two here on the left obviously the
the middle finger the pointer finger are
exactly the same so we're talking that
and then we watch the other fingers curl
in to into that all the wake of Nissan
so I feel like we're trying to take a
holistic approach the whole skeletal
thing I don't necessarily think in the
situation where we we count let's say
hand of the of the 12 12 22 points of
articulation I think I think it's a full
hand watching when we try to look for
the gestures because when you start to
look at some of the other possibilities
and adjusters by things like this one
especially the difference between the
two finger pinch and the full hand pinch
and the two finger open or you know kind
of like the okay sign pinch right these
things clearly we're losing a lot of
different points of articulation to
differentiate between these adjusters
alone which are obviously very similar
to each other oh gosh magnet you do you
happen to know off the top of your head
what's the
latest version numbers of the SDK I will
you not have this week I pinellia sizing
that answer Canadians are the good cuz i
do not want to be sitting there trying
to remember that one okay we are getting
it nobody i know potted I knew existed
but that probably won't help all right
can can we please make a sample make a
sample code here for a simple
application maybe like a small demo um I
feel like we definitely so so what we
can do is brian i think we had some
sample apps that we've been showing at
the at the hacker labs well maybe I what
we can do is send those those sample
apps over to Joel and so when Joel
follows up with this webinar and he
sends out the slide presentation he can
maybe include some of the sample app you
sent along to help them with that so
moderate good yeah Erica we can
certainly do that we have been
developing sample apps that that
demonstrates the different modalities
like head tracking and hand and gesture
tracking we will be publishing these
shortly on the real sense zone and so
some of these will be available over the
website and we can certainly some over
to Joel as well okay great so so so
mahtoree there you go that's the we will
definitely stand out said all sample
codes Albert casino I hate the busy is
spoilered here right but this slide deck
that I'm showing you is effectively the
exact slides that i've been i've been
presenting at the hackle ab minus e you
know welcome austin slide or some things
like that for local events but yeah all
of the actual informational content that
we've been giving it the hackle outs are
actually in these slides that we've been
showing so far today and then we'll be
sending along Ricardo's asking if he
should update the firmware I I believe
I've senior to this which is in the
camera in the box that you got
there should have been a getting started
guide and I feel like one of the first
steps in that of her call correctly was
actually explorations on how to update
the firmware Magnum to that son right
yes so the firmware that would be
required for the camera that you
received in the kid is to dot 38 dot
five this one where is actually
available on the software at intel.com
flash real sense website so you can use
the tool that is available there to
flash the firmware onto the camera the
instruction should be available on the
getting started kit okay so so Ricardo
hopefully that answers your question if
you need more of them let's please
follow up with us and we'll definitely
try to support you I feel like we're
catching up on these questions so if
I've missed something guys just speak up
and uh Oh Paul asking how do they report
a bug I feel like the form is where the
bug reporting is going currently that
sound right guys yep yep so yeah just
politics we find a bug please post it
into the the forums on software doesn't
telecom i'm sascha real sense and we'll
get those addressed as quickly as we can
sorry for any bugs obviously some things
happen yeah some information about what
about the context of the bug would
definitely help dental team analyze what
is going on so intestine though there's
also blogs and articles as well as the
forum which some of those will started
the next few weeks to cover tips and
tricks or though the issue so it's good
to watch not just the phone but also the
articles yes absolutely um so alberta
you may have not been on when I we're
asking answering the question about
linux and whatnot um so the current
answer right the very very technical
answer right now is all the all the work
that we're doing and development on
intel realsense technology the version
you guys are working on is called SKU
number is f 204 forward and 200 millions
of using the ir technology all this work
is currently on windows 8 1
and it's really focused towards helping
these guys get a jump start at a market
before all of the consumer systems come
and hit the market starting late this
year and certainly filling in more in
early 2015 in terms of Linux and other
os's and things like that it's
definitely something that we're looking
at exploring down the road but for the
purposes of this challenge we won't be
supporting stream OS or we start steamos
or or any of the other Linux's of this
challenge and the early efforts here are
firmly focused on window they've got one
because that's where the first Oh actual
consumer platforms are going to be right
it would be great obviously down the
road if valve were to bringing out real
sense enables seen box or whatnot
obviously we'd love to support that but
if and when that happens I was going to
try and talk about other companies
roadmaps but just from a pure you know
logics and board we'd love as many
companies as possible to support this
technology we'd love fourth this year
grow would explain why not so definitely
something would look at supporting if it
was something that the other companies
were interested in but for now again the
focus is on Windows 8 1 so all right so
while other questions may or may not
come in we're just you know looking a
few other things and in terms of and
this is one of the areas that I've
gotten a lot of questions I want to fund
these hacker labs right is when you know
one of the questions if can you make
your own gestures and the simple answer
is yes you absolutely can the more
technical answer is you can with caveats
right it's definitely not a trivial
thing to start making your own gestures
we have one of the companies that were
in a challenge last year called
chronosapien's and they've worked on an
early prototype and they have a gesture
and I can't do it here you can't see my
hand but it kind of looks like like a
swimming like you would you would show
like a fish swimming if you're mimicking
that was your hand just a little wave
pattern and a suggestion that he created
specifically for their game and you're
not phase of gaming of eternal you're
controlling
swimming up and down and trying to catch
balls of light while he avoids predator
is the one off so creating new gestures
is definitely possible if you want to
start to look to do that some of the
things you want to do is try to avoid
what they call occlusion which is
basically a fancy word for one part of
your hand in front of another part right
because the actors can a cape go through
it's now an x-ray and and and so
obviously other things like holding
objects and whatnot is also not going to
help because it will confuse things as I
we showed there are a skeletal modeling
that it's doing when you hold a pen or
something it doesn't make the computer
obvious to them at the pen it may think
that you have a sixth finger or
something right because it's seeing
something it's getting something
actively that doesn't doesn't seem
likely so either there any way for
participants to get a second camera for
other team members located elsewhere at
a timely manner other than the
reservation way on the site drawl I'm
going to jump in and say the answer to
that is probably no but you want to
correct me now that's correct yeah
that's correct the only application for
one camera / / guess we have sent out
basically thousands of cameras for this
challenge so we have put on a lot of
effort to try and enable as many people
as possible but to make sure that
everything is very equitable week we're
only sending out one per entry so that's
that's where that is yes I'm sorry so
Albert of the New York half of hacker
lab I'd rather not call it canceled it
it's probably going to get postponed
until q1 we had a bit of a snafu happen
and we're looking to do it in q1 will be
doing a hacker lab I believe later this
month in Orlando its current plans but
we'll be trying to do the New York
hacker lab hopefully and like I said in
q1 so sorry about that if I've been
convenient it anyway as mentioned decide
that you'll be getting after this are
exactly the sides that are going out and
hacker lab and exactly my same voice I
have not changed my voice from the
hacker labs and also you
you haven't really missed out on much
believe it or not picked up like coffee
in the morning that's good for custom 3d
objects it looks like Colleen you may
have already answered that but probably
if you have other questions or please
please let us know Paul robots we love
robots we absolutely love robots if your
question is would it be really cool if
you were able to do intel realsense on a
robot the answer is yes if your question
is are we going to be supporting apps
and games or not for the challenge on
robots I feel like the answer is no
because again the whole focus of the
challenge is making games and apps for
the consumer systems the all the ones of
the laptops that are coming out so
obviously you know right be there but
that's what every Chris for now yeah let
me cry for Eric you can song you observe
last year's challenge we have played
some winners controlling like a note
like a modified version of a Roomba
right robot as well as a lego lego robot
so that's that's actly allowed for this
challenge right Yes I definitely use
still the the controls of those robots
are you know windows 8.1 systems running
on as well so it's not really a fully
fully autonomous robot with all the CPUs
internal to the robot itself but almost
like I was like a tech demo but yes
there have been four winners of that in
previous challenges so that allowed yeah
and I and also I've seen people
controlling quadcopter aerial drones
with real sense but the actual app
itself is going to be running out of
windows 8 not one computer and then it
controls those drones or whatever also
remotely so those are those are really
cool i love when those happen hey guys
so Android asked a very detailed
question and I think Colleen is
directing you towards the form oh that
sounds like a very very specific
questions so I'm I'm thinking we're not
going to be able to get to the bottom of
that here so we'll ask you over
very politely if you would mind posting
that in the form and we'll try to follow
up with you and get that resolved as
quickly as we can I appalling I'm gonna
say Kelly manship I love her but and it
Paul and Paul sorry as Joe mentioned if
it's you know if it's a keep up on the
mask maybe you follow up with Joe I feel
like yes we definitely love robots and
when I and we've done a lot of remote
control with the robots if you were
going to make a full fledge autonomous
robot on the system that still may be
very cool and if that's the idea that
you submitted it you got accepted then
i'm going to say go with it right if
joel and the rest of his crew liked your
idea that you submitted and that means
that's it's not the green flag so yes
please go ahead so we got Karina here
asking or mentioning that she hasn't
gotten her camera she's in Mexico I
assume Lester she hoping if it's not I
pout does and I'm doing the best I can
hear so Joe maybe that would look into
Karina's so so this is actually the
email address to ship those two are
posted here to her question but there's
an email contact you could write to to
find out what happened okay yeah yeah
we'll follow up just one click one in
here some of you makes you make sure you
check your email because some of the
requirements for shipments of the
cameras accuracy required to accept that
camera a loner agreement online on your
own no contest website on your profile
and kind of websites make sure you do
that and that triggers the agency to
ship the camera so once you've done then
it's a matter of now are tracking the
camera through fedex to reach you but
but definitely near yeah we'll follow up
on your camera the other question that
got asked main memory is that it is the
firmware right if you go to our website
there you'll see these the driver than
the update it's pretty clear it should
be pretty easy the there a suit sensor
fusion for support of other input
devices such as I am you gloves using
opencv
I don't feel sorry I don't feel at this
time we've been able to support that
ourselves obviously I think if you come
up with things that would be really cool
but yeah I don't think any of our SDKs
support any other external technologies
of economy gloves or any other kind of
cheap gesture technology but so that put
Joel question specifically on the early
deadline all right so if Ricardo submit
something for the early deadline when
will he get notified that hey
congratulations you you won one of the
rapid prototypes awards yeah so
officially we have to wait until the
final judging right because if remember
it goes only to the top 80 submissions
so let's say 150 submitted so we'll have
to wait we're only we're only going to
judge the most one time to depend this
corset is that most men will say okay
this top 80 which is 15 the pioneer
track and 30 in the mat in the
Ambassador track will be the winners of
this thousand-dollar early sufficient
bonus so that's around no March
timeframe the March time frame next year
so Joe not to get myself in trouble
hopefully but just so make sure I'm not
confused myself I felt like that what
happened is if a developer submitted a
rapid prototype before december 17 then
the rapid prototypes would all be giving
compared against each other on a level
playing field and then the final judging
would be the final submissions and all
of those apps would be getting compared
to against each other to find the grand
prize winners and whatnot am I am I
wrong correct they will not be competing
as a final demos right so it sounds like
you think of think of it like there's
two pools of it demos for judging one of
the mr. early admissions right and other
ones are the final submissions so right
think of it that way so that Eric
mentioned you can definitely submit
early then you can take the same idea
the same product I've been continued to
refine it and submit
for the final deadline of februari 15
good okay I won't make sure I wasn't
steering people wrong yeah so so if you
submit something in terms of rapid
prototypes in before the early deadline
which really hope you do because we
really excited about showing the world
of all these rapid prototypes then you
can continue to refine it and that will
not be what gets judged in the final the
final part of the contest for the grand
prize is you can continue to improve it
and refine it and that will be would get
judge but in terms of finding out which
is the best app the prototypes all the
rapid prototypes will be judged against
each other so you don't have to worry
about doing a rapid prototyping and not
winning against a fully polished app so
um let's see here so it looks like a lot
of the questions are answered I just
want to mention really clearly if you
guys get a chance we do have an email
address that's put into the answers
right so intel realsense challenge at
the game agency and so that is the lot
of the official email just so if Peru
specifically for you but for anybody
else who who needed that email address
it's actually in our answer column so
please go there and look for that I'm
sure Joe lab that's the follow-up email
as well but let's see the trying to hit
some more the questions in the last
eight minutes so whatever all the things
that we need to submit for the demo is I
feel like we went through this a little
bit before but just to reiterate
effectively if you if your app or game
has any dependencies and a library is
jQuery whatever it might be that it
needs to work please make sure that you
include all that stuff in your
executable right so what we're doing
with all of our judges is they will get
your app or game as as the file that you
submit into the challenge and they will
install it just like a user would
install it right those over on the
executable and if they get into a
situation where for example right
something pops up as an error and says
dll not found that's not a positive user
experience so if you need anything
bundled in please make sure you do that
and we'll go from there yeah so Joel
kareena saying that she she did sign the
agreement with the email so Korea will
take that as a look up to check on the
status of your camera going heading down
to Mexico and will the game agency will
follow up with you about the the tracker
status or whatnot sorry sorry about the
inconvenience at this point uh yeah so
Alberta clicks I think until educate me
here if I'm still not right what we're
saying here in terms of what how much of
the early submission prototype has to be
completed we're looking for you to have
it be usable right so I'm going to make
a really bad example right if you were
doing some sort of let's say a real
sense pac-man game right where you just
use your thumb instead of a joystick
right I think we're looking for it to at
least run to a degree even if all the
colors aren't the right or the even if
to go start in there even if it's just a
situation where you can control pac-man
around a an empty screen with the somme
I feel like we're looking for just a
monocle of work and then obviously that
will get compared to everybody else Joel
that's all right yes yes it should rush
a big bits of games are playable maybe
it's only one level maybe pieces only
one without TV versus to that you plan
your final submission the things like
that you can take but a sec mention it
should be it should run the demo should
run and just a follow-up for those
people asking for what's recording the
demos make sure you include the video
right of the that's that's one of the
minimum requirements that it has a video
showing the demo running or you playing
the demo for somebody else playing the
demo so that's part that's an important
pieces yeah sorry I was just thinking
about the actual executable South my
apologies yeah so so Albert you know
another example is if you were doing
some sort of some book app right like a
cookbook or something where you can
control the pages with your gestures you
could literally just make the app so
that they're the blank book that you can
control the gestures and then fill in
the rest
PS or the the travel guide or whatever
the type of book it is you're doing down
the road you know for the final
submission but at this point with the
rapid prototypes are exactly that
everybody's showing that yes we want to
want to show to the world that yes
developers can can do things in just a
few short weeks and actually make things
usable we want to get people excited
about this so that's what we're shooting
for here um so Joel sorry to keep
harping on you parsers asking a question
in terms of several ideas were submitted
and unfortunate part is not sure which
one got accepted so I'm going to ask
that the game agency followed up with
MRSA and clarifies which of the
submitted ideas were the ones that were
approved to proceed bright for the final
list so just quickly in this one I think
things about the week more before the
final list of finalists are identified
so but some of the early analyst have
been already been identified that's why
they got their cameras already reached
by that they're just some discs liffe
occations going on right people are
never having agreements people said I'm
not going to thank you but I was
interested in space to anymore I got
other work to continue and some of them
below 18 years old so the some
particular vacations going on so we're
still pulling another other additional
finalists based on their scores during
the ideation phase judging thank you so
hopeful that they do answer your
question Martha yeah so judges said it
saves one more time the the early
generally the rapid prototype that you
submit before december 17th is not going
to be judged as your final entry unless
you don't do anything else with it
obviously if you don't update it than it
is but yes even though the december 70s
comes quickly you can continue to
improve it polish it add new levels add
more color better graphics whatever you
want and all the way up until the final
deadline which saw it on how often top
my head but I feel like it's in 2015
right febri 15 there were 15 sorry day
after day after Valentine's Day because
we don't want to miss this Valentine's
Day
so yeah up until that deadline you can
continue to improve your app your game
whatever it may be and so don't don't
feel like trying to go in for their own
submission is going to hamper your
chance in fact in any way it becomes the
forcing function helps make you try to
get things done quicker and earlier oh
boy so there's a question about oculus
rift and wii remote I don't feel like
the SDK is going to recognize any of the
other external hardware's if one of the
engineers wants to correct me feel free
but at this point our SDK is is very
firmly focused on the realsense camera
that you guys have gotten and the
realsense boards and technologies that
systems will have we don't currently
support other external technologies
obviously those things like opencv and
whatnot are getting supported as we
talked about but in terms of other other
companies hardware that's not where
we're at at this point um who Joel I
don't know what the legal question is
here the final judging will take into
account whether an app was made by one
developer or group I feel like the
answer is no all the entries are just
being judged on the pure you know
there's a pure app or game submitted is
that correct oh yeah right yeah we have
no visibility how many people are behind
the demo so just one the one person that
submitted it and they obviously they put
their experience right because their
developer experience as part of the
submission yeah so uh oh ha sorry about
that or not we're not taking account on
any of it whether it's a big team or
small team with over the final product
is the final product it looks like we're
getting a lot of these questions
answered some of them are looking for
follow-up right so again the the email
address where the challenge is fairly
long with simple intel realsense app
challenge at the game agency.com that's
our main email for interacting do we
have to use the camera only on well lit
rooms like an office room or can the
camera work and daytime without
electrical light so
the answer that really honestly is yeah
it kinda lean re answered it can't be
direct sunlight the IR sensor will get
swamped by the natural ir component of
the Sun the other thing is to be honest
is the IR itself can actually work in
the dark technically right and people
have done like quick demos of basically
what do you call it the like low-level
light or night vision goggles and things
like that obviously you won't get any
color you'll just get the depths and
things like that but yeah you want you
want to be fairly well in if you're
actually looking to take into account
let's say the the color component of
someone's face like you're doing things
like that and then that will be that um
Joel when is okay Joel's already
answered that question about it we have
any the new prices are being announced
we're running up on ten o'clock here so
Alex what where do you where do you want
to go from here it looks like well we'll
try to answer these questions or follow
more people if they continue to submit
questions but it looks like we're at the
end of our time so at this point Alex I
think I'm going to turn it back over to
you as a final you know thank you to
everybody they attended but we hope that
you found this this webinar useful we
will be sending out the slides and some
sample apps app to where Joel will have
that sent out by the game agency at some
point later and I'll turn over to your
office all right sure to use the forum
to and warm yes give you the forms all
right thank you very much Eric thank you
very much to to the whole team to Joelle
Brian Colleen magana thanks for your
support thanks to all of you guys who
took part so just to let you know there
is another there is a last webinar
session on Tuesday alright so basically
I'm just sharing the link right now okay
so feel free obviously if you have more
question okay I guess you guys are going
to work out on the weekend so feel free
to to join us and and ask a more
question to the
the Intel team I'm going to put all this
session that i've been recording I'm
gonna add it online and send it to
everybody okay so you should receive it
like probably in six hours approximately
so yeah I've a nice weekend to everybody
and and see you on Tuesday for some or
otherwise see you later and good luck
for the follow up with a challenge bye
