used with this right and so there's a
lot of competition vying for attention
as consumers but the problem is TODAY's
Ad &amp;amp; provo methods are just out of date
and they're not effective if you look at
web display ask seventy percent just
don't work so we need something new
something that's going to be changing
that the landscape we need to have
something that's going to take advantage
of these statistics right we know that
social media is a really strong thing to
do we also know that we use a lot of
time on our smartphone so we got into
rehab then finally gaming and
gamification that's a huge market just
in the US alone so who can take
advantage of that and really change up
the scene on the advertising promo
market well that's where we come in and
that's good luck we have a couple
personas with hoopla one of them is our
consumers one of our most important
personas and basically for customers
they're incentivized because they get to
pay to play right we have themed
missions that are engaging them and in
doing that they pursue beacons and get a
lot of good stuff so imagine this
scenario because this could happen in
any venue it could be here for all we
know right but in this particular use
case let's take the new 49ers stadium
we've just distributed beacons all over
the place in the food venues and the
merchandise areas and other places so
now as consumers we r there we're going
to go on a search of my mission every
time we go and find it be going to get
close to it we got special offers and
some exclusive content but on top of
that it's a game right so we need to get
some points and those points are going
to do
something for us later on to get some
good stuff with our most favorite brands
but now we're going to have a hackathon
moviegoer and let's pretend that she
already has yeah so she goes into the
theater she's going to see this and she
wants to play mission number one to
locate the satellite and here it goes in
this case the mission is to locate the
satellites so we wanted to show them a
brief clip of the movie to get user
engaged quicks a movie so now that the
clock is counting down so I need to get
to the New York vegan so let's see that
is not the vegan so it could be in other
beaches and as they get closer the sock
sedating the urgency of the truth gets
kind of satellite okay so I just located
the satellite it doesn't look like a
satellite but this is a little
social media is big so you get to tweet
yourself and that's how we gave</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
