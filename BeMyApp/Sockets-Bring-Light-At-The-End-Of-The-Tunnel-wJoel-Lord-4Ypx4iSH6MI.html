another be my webinar will be starting
shortly once again we're very short
okay ladies and Jeremy local for coming
I'm gonna be my webinar on instrumental
is a pleasure having all of you again
well for those who are going to be
joining us after as always you can just
watch this video after you have any
questions is too afraid it let us know
in this in today's episode we actually
have revolving loan back end so with
that we have John Lord well he's gonna
be speaking about socket i/o and node
and without further hesitation I let the
man speak for himself so Joe you have
the platform thank you for now though so
hello everyone welcome to this webinar
about a about soccer thought I or and
slip pockets in general essentially so
I'll take a few minutes to talk a little
bit about me what I do and then I'll
jump right into the subject which are
web sockets and I'll think about maybe
half an hour just to go through some a
little bit of theory and then we'll look
at some examples together so hopefully
you'll be able to participate in those
live demos because it's real time
information so it's you will be able to
participate with us and we'll see about
that awesome so let's get started so a
little bit about myself I quickly so I
work for a spear where a custom software
company we are based in Montreal the
headquarters hard menchville I am
located in the Ottawa office and this is
what our office looks like and I have
learned today that we are a fishel whole
case pop I have no clue what that really
means but apparently that's the case and
I mean I thought it was a very
interesting picture so this is what our
office looks like so like I said that we
do custom software development and we
play with our wide range of technologies
and and that's a very interesting thing
that we can do so we can build
applications whether it's in JavaScript
which is my mail which we also mobile
native development we do this off
applications and so on
like I said I'm mostly a JavaScript
junkie whenever I can do something in
JavaScript I usually try to use
JavaScript to do it which is just about
anything now I'm a bit of a tinkerer I'm
involved into the indie maker movement
in the Ottawa area so I do different
things there and I'm a technology
enthusiast so I really like to read
about new technology and try to share
those information when i get so web
sockets what are they so the first time
i have encountered a web socket it was
when i was i was working with a trailer
i think most people are familiar with
this tool so i was using Trello and all
of a sudden one of my colleague up they
want their cards and I noticed that
actually changed apart on my screen life
as I was blended so I did whatever a
programmer would do so I with another
source code opened up my network window
and I was quite surprised to see that
there was no real traffic going on or
nothing that I could see my network
window so I did not been to the source
code just to see what I could find find
there and dance that's when I first
encountered shocking that aisle which is
pretty much what I should brought me to
the o JX world as well so I started
pouring and I know I started reading
about those web sockets and how I could
use them in by different projects and
this is what I would love to share with
you today so in a nutshell web socket is
a protocol providing full duplex
communication channels over a single TCP
connection and it was standardized in
2011 this part in our RFC and it's not
being sanitized by the w3c but what does
this really mean so essentially what
that means is that web sockets our way
to basically create a tunnel between a
client and a server and then you can
send information in any direction so
what is your client sending information
to your server
were used to do in the web world and the
world of rest I interactions but you can
actually send also send data from the
server to the client which is not
something that we're used to but when
you're trying to do real-time
application or when you need to update
some things in real diamonds it's a very
very valuable asset that you can use so
how do we typically simulate real time
in our applications up to obtain a lot
so that people use are chewing the
typical application you would just use
an HTTP request so if your user is doing
something on a web page clicks on a
button you need to display information
your client sends information to the
server and the server sends a response
back and then entry that response you do
something with it and there's another
impression on that another point in time
saves users role as certain limit the
server deployment will actually request
more information from the server acer I
have that keeps saying get out server
sends back information so that's how we
typically do applications with a rest
sir now if you want to display something
in real time so you have a dashboard and
you want to update the data on your
graphs in real time as things are
happening if you use more or less the
same principles as we've seen in regular
applications you do polling so if you
lose you'll ask the server for more
information so you just basically keep
on hitting the server hey server is
there anything you and your server just
know now it's there anything you know
and so on so that's what I call the kids
in the parson arrogance it's a little
bit like having your car and your
children and your car if you have small
children and they'll just keep on asking
you are we there yet are we there yet
are we there yet and they just keep on
estimate so there's actually something
to update over there yes you're there
so you can just get the response back
the point so that's one way to do it but
obviously it consumes a lot of bandwidth
I mean you are requesting a lot of you
are doing a lot of requests to the
server and most of the fire pit will
just return either the same answer that
you already have or simply nothing so
another way to do it is using long
polling so in this scenario that you can
do is that you tell your client to ask
the server for data once and the server
will will keep that and Phillip actually
has something to respond to you so
that's a nice way to do but you also
have to implement some sort of ways of
that negative connection times out you
need to recreate this connection and you
still have all those ongoing hedge takes
every time that you want to do a
connection like here so those work it's
a nice fallback situation but what we
want really is a way to have a
communication that is full duplex
communication that been completely
bi-directional that you wear this server
connection just decide to send data to
the fine if it actually has some data
that change so as you can see here with
a WebSocket I have sorry with WebSocket
I have some data that comes in from my
server is just pushed to the client and
if the final amount to send data you can
just push it and server can react to
that data is sending an answer pack and
send something else at the same time you
had a client canceled so all the
communications are in both ways and they
can happen at basically simultaneously
so you might have read about server side
events as well so how do they divert
from web sockets while my first might
develop this presentation is not to go
into details on server side events
there's a lot of pros and cons to server
side events but in the case that we are
interested in the main difference is
that server side events as described in
the name obviously are only triggered by
the server so it only sends data
from the server to the blindness that
the fine cannot send data using service
elephants you would use you would need
to use HTTP requests at the same time in
order to send data Twitter so should we
use them well obviously as you might
have guessed i really like web sockets i
mean we definitely should use them in my
opinion wherever we can in this time in
the time and age users are used to have
almost immediate access to information
so you need to find a way to send
information to the user rather than
actually asked or having a user to
request that information you need a way
to push that information as soon as
possible and web sockets are great way
to do that it delivers a much better
user experience and by adding a this
value to your product you will have you
will have a better return better user
response and obviously better user
responsible probably leaving tomography
so it's something that you definitely
should look into a piece if it makes
sense to your solution and see how you
could use it so let's look at some of
the pros like I said it's bi-directional
data transfer it not put enough emphasis
on that it's it's a way to push the data
to the clients which makes it much much
much faster to get the data on the
screens also the fact that it
establishes a funnel and and keeps that
connection alive makes it much faster to
send data from the server to the client
or from the point to do circle so that
communication is is fast and uses a very
very low bandwidth so you don't have to
bother with all the handshakes well the
browser takes care of that for you but
still you reduce the time and bandwidth
with useless data that you don't have to
send anymore because the tunnel is
already established another nice thing
about it is that it detects connection
and this
actions so you can see who's online for
example or who's not online so the cons
well I don't really want to give you any
condoms because I really want you to use
web sockets as much as you can but
obviously there's still our son so you
do lose the caption capabilities which
are built in your xhr request so when
using typical HTTP there will be some
caching the browser keeps your responses
so you kind of lose that on the other
and most of the data that will be
transferred users web socket is probably
something that you don't want captioning
you will most likely need to do some
architectural changes in the application
as well because you're now listening for
data that comes from the server you need
to build a event based application
rather than having an application that
requests for data and then reacts when
the data Princeton so it's a little bit
of a change in the way that you build
your application but if you do it right
from the start it's much much easier to
employment so some of the real world
cases for web sockets there's a lot of
different applications that use them
although I would argue that there's not
enough but some examples that we can see
that we you've probably been using on a
day-to-day basis without even openness
noticing it but real time
synchronization between updater between
a group of users Joe is one such example
but we've built different applications
hear stuff like ensure you sure that all
the actor is Amit Singhal process all
have the same information at the same
time so you want the data to be
synchronized you want as soon as one
user changes something it gets pushed to
the other users that are connected there
that's one okay things like life fees
for example where you want to keep it
stream of data on a web page or on a web
application things like Twitter streams
and I will show you
example of the Twitter stream in a few
minutes long server processes and a way
to provide an ETA to users so I've built
an application not so long ago where we
had to aggregate a lot of data from a
lot of very big house we're talking
about terabytes of data that we had to
crawl into and then provide a nut day to
do yet the users so they had this
dashboard they could launch this process
to regenerate although of that data and
that would take a very long time but we
knew how many files we had we knew the
total size of the files and so on so it
was easy for us to when we launched that
process to go see the number of the
total number of files and then based on
that you would push information to the
customers that to Aquinas that were
connected as if we crawled from the
files so accurate did the first file out
of 10 it would push notification to the
clients saying okay we're ten percent
them and then it will start would be the
second file and so on so it's a nice way
to provide an ETA to the users based on
what is actually going on on your server
if you play with multiplayer html5 games
and obviously are most likely it's using
WebSockets as well so that the
information is synchronized between all
the clients better connected many chat
clients things like slack which almost
everybody is using nowadays especially
in our sphere so all the data that well
obviously is sync between all the
clients so whenever you're sending into
a chaplain facility as well as the
presence data and being able to see
who's online who's not that other thing
they all come from the chocolates and I
will also show you a quick example of
that chat applications are essentially
the hello world of web sockets or any
real time communication as a real good
so how do you use it well it's fairly
easy with most modern browsers there are
built-in and by modern browsers I mean
everything which is not a 9 but
everything else is working so
essentially you just create a new
connection by instantiating a new web
socket and you give it to you are it's
as simple as that unless you have your
connection you have a few events which
are on open which means that your
connection is established you have a on
message event which will be triggered
whenever the server pushes some data and
you have an on clothes whenever the
others the connection gets close whether
it's because of a server server failure
or because the customer actually decide
to disconnect Lee so those are the main
event so how do you send data can you
serve now fairly easy to just use the
same method on your connection so you
can send strings by using a simple
screaming you can send array buffer as
well so if you want to send an image for
example you said that you can send a
blogs so if you want to send a file to
the server you can use this and how
about JSON objects well unfortunately
you cannot send json objects and I said
you can not send them but there is a
very easy workaround where you can just
train apply your JSON objects and then
send that string to the server so it's
still fairly easy to do you do have to
be careful though if you're using that
need to be sure that you are parsing
into a JSON object at the other end so
on the server but you also need to make
sure that you are not trying to parse a
string so you have to manage your errors
there or to catch snares so if you want
to get started with WebSockets there is
a good number of alternatives that are
available there's cloud solutions that
are available
I've seen them in the past they work
really well you don't want to be
bothered with all the architecture that
is needed or the infrastructure that is
needed they also include a lot of
different things that you can get out of
this and that solution things like
security history of messages things like
that are built into those cloud
solutions obviously they cost money then
depending on the amount of traffic that
you have in your application you might
want to consider having your own
implementation that runs out your answer
so nerd in order to do that there are
various frameworks or libraries that are
available if you're into PHP a ratchet
is solution that I've used in the past
and it works really really well if you
aren't in Java jetty is an
implementation of web socket for Jenna I
have never used it in the past so
unfortunately I cannot provide you with
information but I know that is there and
because we're talking about nodejs right
now and because javascript in this my
preferred language I've used socket
thought I you'll mostly and Sokka
thought I 0 is my favorite one so let's
look in a little bit into socket height
so what's so cool about it well out of
the box you get your server and clients
on implementation so I'll show you some
goat to see how what this actually means
in a few seconds it also falls back to
long pole and when necessary so if you
are unfortunate enough to have to
support IE 9 into your development
aisaka thought I you will take care of
falling back to other solutions if it's
not supported in the browser also it
adds a lot of features like artbeads
time as disconnection support which is
not necessarily provided in the web
socket API and also it supports the
sending and receiving JSON objects out
of the box so you don't have to bother
with the string of eyeing of your JSON
objects and then Parsons
back and the most cool thing about it is
that it's very easy to use so here's a
full example so this is the final site
for my sake I'll application which is in
this case a very basic checkpoint like I
said chat comments are the hello world
of websites so let's go quickly through
that code line by line so i have my body
so it's a it's an HTML page I have a
text view which is a text input I have a
button and I give it an ID and then I
have a big message box which is a text
area after that I include this socket
i/o / pocket I ojs file which is
automatically created when you include
the socket i/o on the server on the mode
server child show you in a second and
then we add our hope so I just creating
a new socket here and then whenever a
user clicks on the send message button
then I do a socket in it and I emit an
event which is message from client and I
passes a JSON object which has a text
property and it's essentially whatever
there's inditex builder and then I asked
my socket to also listen for events so I
asked it to listen to be a message from
server event and it receives data thinks
that data and it depends it to the text
area and that's all you need on the
client side for track line so there's a
way to send the messages and then we do
something like we receive a message now
if we look at the server side
implementation and here i just use
Express as the as the server and just
start the server listen on port 80 day
and you start it and you serve static
files essentially that's all we do for
our web server
the socket part of it which is the part
that we're interested in is right here
so here I require psycho da da I oh and
I pass it a server for instance that I'm
be using and that will take care of
creating that pile that we've seen here
which is subtitle / it all your
budgets then whenever there's a
connection I can get the socket and I
have one event here so whenever there is
a message from client event that is
triggered so whenever there's a client
that sends a message to the surgeon and
this thing could be anything oh I five
chose those but it could have been a
fruit instead so whenever there is data
that comes from the client I just think
that data and then broadcast it to all
of the connected sockets into the
message from serve ribbon and that's all
you need in this case whenever there's a
message that comes in i just broadcast
it to everybody that is connected so
that's all there is to it really i'm
into web sockets it's a little bit
complicated so or it's a little bit
abstract so what I'd like to do is to go
through some actual demos as well as to
some some code and hopefully this will
help you to understand how it actually
works so I'll just open my hole here to
air with me for a second so I have a few
at first demo here and if i look at my
client here and we'll just look at the
javascript part of it and the HTML is is
not very relevant for now so what it
doesn't here for this first demo is that
i declare my socket the way I didn't
candy I despise that I just shown you
and I'm assuming it you can also see my
screen still writing
so I think they're my saga here I had
account that i keep locally on this
client and then whenever the user sticks
on the send something button I will just
omit the actual count that I have a
right here so now I'd like to invite
everyone to participate in today's demos
so if you go to web sockets with a net
I've JavaScript everything up on you
should see the fourth demo that I will
go through in the next few seconds so
let's go to demo one and it's on here
acoustic takes a second to get loaded
okay so here i have my my client which
is just connected to the to the server
and if you look at the network window if
i refresh it you will see that it which
is a socket i/o and it has a WebSocket
that is open but you will never see any
more data that goes through the traffic
went to the network window result of the
traffic goes through this web socket
only so it's not using any more
connections so you won't see HTTP
request signal so what happens here if I
pull the server all right boys
absolutely nothing which is kind of
expected this on a coat and as you can
see there is no more network connection
start gate not if I think a look at the
server code what I do here is that
whenever I receive the event from the
client I just console.log the data that
was sent from the clients so if i look
at my logs like i said i'm using group
who forgets demo so i'll look at my
locks and you will notice that if I poke
the server by clicking on this button I
see this dated I'm setting and
see that somebody else just connected
and just pulled the server one once and
twice there you go so you have it 12 if
I do it another time you should see a 13
appeared there you go so whenever
whenever whenever somebody clicks on it
it sends the data so it sends the count
that is local sense that to do sir so
yeah we can send data to the server
which is completely useless I will agree
because we could have done that with
rest as well so let's kind of use the
real power web sockets and try to have
something that is bi-directional now I
will just fill it this one so for my
second demo I do the same thing so i
send my count that is for locally on my
client but I also listen for an event
which is the circ account updated event
which I've created in my nose grip and
that just uh it just listens for at this
event and it will update one field are
the text in one of the fields on my on
my page I'll just open the second demo
for now if I look at my JavaScript code
in here you can see that i do the same
thing as i used to do so i went to
produce an event that is triggered by
the client i just logged that event but
what I also do is that I have a variable
on the server now which counts all the
clicks that I haven't done and whenever
there's a click from the client then I
just increment this server count and I
trigger an event which is called serve
account updated and I just send the
actual count to all the connected
clients so what does this look like so
right now if I click on the boat server
I have this her account that is updated
now if somebody else was to connect to
the demo to
include WebSockets trust with everything
they know too and it would click on that
server as you can see all the clients
that are connected are now being updated
and they're updated in real time I'll
just wait for a second oh and there we
go as you can see it's actually
incrementing right now so there's
somebody else connected that's very good
for my ego I know that people are
actually listening in so that's great
thank you very much so somebody else is
start poking the server people actually
implement this all of my web pages as
you can see right now so that's great
all right there's probably a few people
connected this is actually going out
fast that's great well alright so we
have a second demo that is working
that's great happy with that so we can
start to see different ways to use those
WebSockets now we can see that
information gets pushed through all the
clients and you can see how fast it gets
pushed as well so as soon as I hit this
button you see it updated on all of the
plans almost immediately and you can
probably see it if you're clicking on it
on your own browser you can probably see
this life getting updated and the delay
that you might see is probably more
related to the actual feed delayed more
more than the actual web socket okay so
we've got another fairly easy demo
that's great but it's fairly useless i
doesn't really give us a sense of how we
can actually use those application or
those web sockets sorry so as i
mentioned earlier the chat clients are
the hello world of web sockets so what
I'll do now and I won't share this quote
if you're interested I will share them a
share it afterwards so we can actually
take a look and see
so in this specific demo I've built a
jack pine sol a full check mine so
essentially what we do here is that
whenever and I've use jQuery just for
sake of clarity so whatever the document
everything is loaded I just prompt the
user for their nickname and then there's
a lot of bells and whistles but the
important part is here so whenever the
the user clicks on the central on button
we just omit to the socket and we omit
this event from you chat line from
client and we send a message and we send
the nickname of the connected user and
now we also listen for the new chat line
form server event and whenever there's
data that is received we will simply
append that to a table that is on the
iWeb bitch everything else is just
formatting and see stuff you will notice
that here in my dated I'm sending from
the client I have messaged and nickname
but in the data that I received from the
server i also have a constant property
that's because it is this specifically
example i've decided to modify the data
that comes in from the clients in order
to show you a little bit more complex
examples oh this one is very similar to
the one that we've just seen so
essentially i just listened to in
advance so you chat line from client i
receive some data but i will transform
that data by adding an x 58 x them
property to the data so I data about x
down I pick up the current climate and
then I just omit the new chat line from
server and i omit this new modified and
transform a data object so this is what
gets picked up by appliance in here and
that's why we actually have access to a
timestamp property here
alright so let's give it a try open up
my hopes this is lose my incognito
window so call me mr. X and this is my
main window to excuse my name and now if
you want to connect to it a separate go
you have it so we now have a web live
chat client as you can certain send
message and it gets a sense of all the
clients almost right away and that's so
we now have a full chat lines we go they
all get updated so you essentially have
a new stock phone if you will obviously
if mrs. a few things we could use
presence detection and jagger wounds and
a bunch of different things and there's
a lot a lot of securities with obviously
whenever I broadcast something it gets
broadcast through every one right here
but you get the gist of it the gist of
it so we have the basic track client
that is actually usable
right so that's it for my third example
so I'll move on to the fourth example
and this one is it meant to show how
fast information you can actually be
sent using the web sockets so a good way
to look at it look at those is by using
Twitter so when there's something
trending on Twitter you know how fast
information goes and everybody starts
thinking about it and I haven't even
looked it up this morning but i'm pretty
sure that pokemon bow is one of the
training keywords right now and today
because it was released a few days ago
and seems like everybody's talking about
so i'll try to track that a specific
keyword so what i'm doing here is that
I'm using the twit load module which is
used to listen to this dream API that is
available term from Twitter so whenever
there is a tweet that matches whatever
keyword that we're actually tracking it
will trigger an event on that screen and
I'll be able to do something based on so
I've changed that I've changed like a
little bit so now yes so I'm tracking
here and what I do here is that whatever
that I have my connection and I have a
second thing as well which where I
wanted to demonstrate the long processes
so I'll show that in the devil in a
second I'll come back to that but
whatever essentially what I do here is
that whenever i get a tweet that comes
in ice cream i'm using the quits or
whatever there is something that matches
pokemon go i will actually get that data
and admitted to all the connected
devices or connected clients
so if we look at the actual quote I have
a tweety event that i'm actually
listening for I have some data and all I
do here is that I simply append the data
to the page so this process is mostly
only server vodka or only data that
comes in from the server thank you very
much whoever that was ok let's look at
that for now and as you can see it is a
trending keyword right now so you can
see how fast the data actually is come
again and I'll just close this one out
use this window is dead all right so you
can see how fast the information is
coming in and you see here that I am
downloading some stuff but it's on the
images so i do have the link as part of
my of my feet wheats that I get so I get
the link all right so I still have to
follow the image but you see that and
there's no traffic apart from whatever
is going on this web socket that is
going that is in my network window right
now so all is done through the use of
this specific connection which has only
been established once and then it just
keeps on getting the information from
the server and you can see how faster
that is actually going so it's not
lagging or anything and interestingly
enough a twitter is not using such a
screen problem for you to go through me
since I mean it's really hard to beat
them but yeah so we can get the
information like I said really really
fast that's a great way to actually show
it's working
alright so that was my last demo yep so
that was my last tunnel a solo I'll just
to switch back to my heart punches for
the sake of going to my powerpoint but
as you might suspect my last night is
thank you very much for attending so you
do have my Twitter account here so if
you have any questions or if you want to
follow me I will share information on my
Twitter account in a few seconds of
these four sites as well as decoding
samples you also have my github link if
you want to take a look the code is
there if you have to make it my
repositories and I believe we still have
about 20 minutes available for questions
so I'll hand it over to Fernando if you
want to go through some of the questions
in there in it thank you very much

appreciated everything very nice i was
going out to try it out to a server i
