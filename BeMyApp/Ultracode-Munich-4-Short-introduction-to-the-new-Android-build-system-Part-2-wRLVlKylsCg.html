resources during the test you can get
activities and there's a special
functionality to to create please just
leave the class at your activity and
roll electric bills this activity and
your transit and it's set up in this
text angular context what I told you for
that you also can access resources so
you can little bit like your application
is your application context and
therefore all of the app from you can
get the resources and you can work
sample chest if the color red which is
in your resources at the library and of
course you can also work with
preferences so we have this shadow
reference manager which can get the
default threat in your application get
out here and this is just a standard
preference editing is all support so we
can set up different preference setups
and just look how your application
reacts them so typical test preparation
staff
but unfortunately the Android Hendricks
you integration is not yet available all
right it's very you can manage somehow
to develop but it's not like really
integrated the good things that from the
great insight for the big script is
working very well and set up different
sauce paths there you can have a test
salt pass around the test was the
lightning i showed you before but for in
garage it's the authority gets difficult
so the the command to run the local unit
test from grain is just great next and
at the end hopefully everything's right
and as i told you there are just ugly ex
at the moment I don't know what the
plans of Google are to support it I hope
but a lot of people really want you at
the feature because it's you don't
always want to do simulation tests you
also have some logic in your
just very quickly but we don't want to
start the immunity so I come to the
summary this is our whole talk now what
do you see that the new build system is
really a lot nicer lot easier to use a
special combination and art studio when
the old you can easily start a new
problem without having too much
knowledge and have running application
online blog from that home and I let's
see you a space of IntelliJ I don't know
how the capabilities compare but it's
your little factoring stars pretty cool
stuff IntelliJ brings with it and that's
a nice too because I get it for free and
of course although the SDKs to decide to
download attackers you can solve and art
studio and you can immediately create a
new project and have an Android
application and say you sure some are
you certain it's I don't want you to
very easy and as we have seen occasions
version odot suite of five I think at
the moment so it's still in development
stage and things are changing
release every week at the moment and you
already can use it so therefore to the
good news by the closet will improve
summer we're seeing that it's very easy
to turn to choose your juicer your
application to get the batteries of
dependency injection in your project the
still is maybe not that important in the
smaller but if your app is growing and
growing at some points mice to think
about what about introducing dependency
injection to make this more classic
illusion and please more flexible and we
have seen the power robolectric can be
used to create unit tests photo messages
and so far as we have seen we like
Bennigan's system very much Nexus
mushrooms okay thank you very much
