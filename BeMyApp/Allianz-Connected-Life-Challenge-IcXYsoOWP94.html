people to think more expansively and
creatively maybe a little more playfully
we've got people that approach problems
with a different angle and that sort of
perspective is valuable the hecka tones
are very interesting for us because it
simply brings fresh blood into our Bell
old established companies come to hug
phone I mean it's fantastic you can't
wait with lots of people it's about
inventing new projects which can be used
in real life seen you and equipment as
it gets issued developing new ideas and
pushing pushing technology to its limit
at a hackathon there's no you don't have
any expectations we come to build
relationships with big partners because
that's where there's resources and and
potential customers some of the team's
really worked hard during the 49 days to
implement things so that was really a
big advantage it's special because it's
such a long hakkasan 49 days that makes
sense for IOT because it's a very
complex insurance is not our scene so we
have to understand them or by
fortunately we have a lot of mentors to
help us along the way because normally
just lift the Lord to just hack on until
you come up with something when I was a
constant feedback and is a constant sort
of mentoring
so there are some really great ideas
which made me really think about how we
could change sometimes our solutions to
something the the people really need the
first prize goes to a team which was on
stage already it is dry opportunity here
especially coming from a third education
college so know that the students are
like 18 19 and everyone this is just
absolutely amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
