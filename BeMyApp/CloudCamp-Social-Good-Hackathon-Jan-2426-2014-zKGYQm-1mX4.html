and have something that have your idea I
come to life and it's made a lot of cool
people you learn a lot from the
experience and actually surprisingly
even though the hours are really long I
I don't feel tired it's a yeah I'm
enjoying every bit of it it's a great
environment to network find developers
really talented people to help work on a
project if you have an idea this is the
best way to just put yourself out there
and discuss your idea with other people
I think you know people are afraid of
getting feedback and it's a really I
think constructive way to get that
feedback and work with other people and
see what it's like to actually put
something into action really quickly
it's a bit of its my first tech nine
hours of a bit stressed out because I
don't know how everything fans out
eventually but it is it is fun to to see
this come to life so can't wait
I would definitely encourage a lot of
people to come and in fact I already did
on facebook earlier today so whatever
you think you can't bring you probably
can like they're like like what's would
stop me is I'm not a programmer or I've
never done anything like this before
it's recognizing that it takes multiple
different types of talents to pull
something like this together and that
it's fun and you'll learn more you'll
have you'll have less sphere of this
realm of the world and and because
everybody loves apps everybody loves you
know like oh I have an app idea well
everybody has one can you step out from
your comfort zone and start to look and
I'd say yes
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
