Giovanni Pilate I'm the mobility product
manager for emea for HP and I welcome
you to this session so let's get started
when we look at the computing needs into
the IT industry we have to look at the
workplace right because we're talking
about commercial product so we want to
focus to the war added to the workplace
and winter standing is now populated by
a whole generation of people that are
now conversant in technology right so
they grew up with a day they have
different expectations of how it can
work for them and so to be successful
companies today have to dress their
needs right so it turns out their needs
are also the same needs of others ray
we're talking about convenience we're
talking about speed and productivity and
mobility is simply critical to how
things get done in two days were so but
there are some real pain points that has
to be at rest in a more elegant way and
the first pain point that we can easily
identify is the people today I have too
much discontinuity between their devices
their data there are apps in there
accessory just look at this table so so
many vices I don't know about you guys
but I have constantly with me my laptop
my tablet my smart phones and all of
them have different accessories
different chargers I have headsets as
well memory sticks seats is really a
mess today and of course data has to be
synchronized somehow between all those
different things and without talking
about security right so even secure it
is a big concern with all those devices
to manage so recent studies are actually
saying that the average user is using
three different os's on average right so
let's look at Pine Point number two
because it's really linked to this and
it's about IT departments of of
corporations and
and companies so the IT department needs
something need advice that is secure any
secure in a frictionless way for the end
user right so current devices are
centered around the consumer evolution
of the bring-your-own-device and they
don't address the IT needs well enough
through the design because it was
designed originally for consumer right
and so this is generating a lot of
friction here between end user
experience and IT experience so that
there must be something that can be done
in this area as well and this takes us
closer to point number three right so
desktop applications are very hard to
endl in a word that is focused on mobile
well not only because of this screen
size but also when we look at the number
of applications that are available today
on mobile devices right so we talk we
can talk about iOS we can talk about
Android and we know that there are
millions of applications like 25
millions of applications available on
those stores but let's face it through
with right when we talk about legacy
applications and those are still the
most used apps in the world we talk
about hundreds of billions of
application so there is still a lot of
work to be done in the application word
right
so why we're here to talk about your
doctor about all of these right so what
is different out why are we talking
about those things first we see that the
mobile system-on-a-chip performance has
been increasing edit incredible rate so
in the last 36 months the processing
power is increased three times and so
have the network speeds they operate on
so we're seeing three times the speed on
wireless one and Wi-Fi that we had 36
months ago second thing that we can
notice is this data is now everywhere
right so the sources of data used to see
just on a PC but now we've cloud and
mobility data really goes beyond the
device to the cloud the pc and the data
use to come rub together and now it's
clear that the app and the service
simply needs to be wherever you are so
just think about Dropbox Google Drive
onedrive all those cloud storage
services that allow you to get
synchronize data wherever you are just
with a click right so just with a top or
your finger then the seamless user
experience so we talked about so many
different devices so having different
devices means today having different
user experiences but I don't know if
this was covered in the in the previous
session with Microsoft but really thanks
to microsoft and windows 10 today we can
have the same experience on all those
different devices and when i say all
those different devices are really mean
every device that is running windows 10
today as a similar and a seamless user
experience windows 10 is running on so
many different devices from smartphone
to tablet to convertible to ultrabook to
desktops servers to hold a lens by
Microsoft to the also to the xbox for
example so
and it's all the same experience on all
those different devices so here comes
the first question then what if I could
have a device that fits in my pocket
that is as powerful as a pc mission will
be what if you had one experience across
all your devices
and last but not least what if your
mobile device was the only device that
you need
so we're introducing today the HP elite
x3 we claim the HP Latex 3 is 31 device
that's every device you see here in the
picture very visually it can be desktop
it can be a laptop and it can be of
course a phone i swell right enough a
blazer given the screen size which is
six inches it's in between the tablet
and the phone and smartphone segments so
it can really be any device and how we
do that so we're four pillars were we
base our value proposition on first and
most importantly this is a killer device
we have top-notch features there is
nothing on the market more advanced than
the HP elite x3 today and I go into all
the details of the specs later on then
we should talk about the integrated
accessories ecosystem as otherwise would
would just be talking about a phone but
it's not this is the one device it's
every device so we'll see how we can
transform the phone to into a desktop
and into a laptop and then when we talk
about the apps that you need here is
probably where we really really need
your help guide because as I mentioned
the applications are critical in today's
mobility and earth t let out a lot a lot
of applications legacy applications and
data application is there not available
on a mobile device and so here we see
the opportunity to draw for you and for
us looking for after the applications is
it companies are looking for and to
deliver those applications to them in a
mobile way and then last but not least
HP we have to recognize that we're
number one in commercial computing and
we should leverage this dominant
position
to basically to push the transition from
standard computing to this next
generation computing concept so let's
dig into the respects and into the fact
that this is a really advanced device so
we can identify four main areas so we
can serve the performance then we will
look at the collaboration features
security and to the fact that is a real
device that is built for business
so in terms of performance if you want
to build the ultimate device you really
start with the best chipset we put the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core
processor on board with plenty of RAM so
you see we have four gigs of RAM on our
device streets ahead of what's gone
before and a real watershed moment for
us in driving a full PC experience
connectivity of cat6 LTE modem and two
by two Wi-Fi and of course we have SD
memory extensible up to two terabytes as
well
onboard memory by the way the storage
brightly fold is 64 gigs so plenty of
space for all the apps that you need all
the documents that you need if you have
to have them offline of course we talked
about data everywhere so you always have
the choice you see in this icon onedrive
you always have the choice to store all
your data documents and pictures and
music and everything really on the cloud
also so when we look at collaboration
and across all the whole do with a real
focus on building the best collaboration
experience and the of course the elite
x3 is no exception to this rule we've
worked closely with piano so we're Bang
&amp;amp; Olufsen to ensure an optimized audio
experience with dual front firing
speakers you see them at the bottom dual
front firing speakers for improved audio
also we have three different microphones
with active noise cancellation to
deliver really a crystal clear audio
even in noisy environments then we have
our cue HD super amoled six inches
diagonal display very bright super high
resolution here almost no bezel this is
a masterpiece we also feature a
high-performance 8 megapixel
front-facing camera and a 16 megapixel
rear camera with low light sensor and
LED flash
when we look at security then first
thing that you notice is tool biometrics
so dual biometrics allow you to login
into device with your fingerprint we
have a built-in fingerprint reader on
the back of the device that it will be
available for users with next major
release of microsoft windows 10 mobile
so it's not supported today but it will
be supported later this year with the
next major release and on top of that
for vertical use cases somehow you can
picture somebody using this device with
gloves because our screen is so
sensitive that it can be used with clubs
as well so you can picture a guy using
gloves so it wouldn't be able to log in
with the fingerprint reader if a if he's
wearing gloves right so we can use the
IRS camera and you can log in with just
his pirate so we have an Irish camera on
the front they will scan your eye and
will let you log in
we have hardware encryption we have fips
140-2 cryptography as well this is more
for our American customers because it's
a standard using the US and in Canada
and we have secure boot image encryption
and you roll back TPM 2 point 0
BitLocker with 128 bit encryption VPN
with SSL and reset protection to
and last but not least this is a device
that is built for business so talk about
beauty and the beast so this is design
to withstand the stress of your average
workday so it's designed to pass
military standards if we have the 810g
testing including four foot drop but it
also is designed to pass ip67 testing so
for those of you were not familiar with
this the first digit is for dust
resistant and the maximum is 6 so we
have come a completely sealed device so
it means that not even a single grain of
dust will ever enter the device and the
second digit is for water for liquid and
it supports liquids merchants of liquid
immersions for up to one hour and the
dev talk about half a meter and a half
on top of that we protect our screen
with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 the best on
the market today when it comes to tough
screens and also we have a huge 4150
milliamperes battery which is today the
biggest battery on the market to ensure
that you get through all your meetings
all your calls with no issues we also
support what is charging there are three
standards currently on the market we
support all of them it's also a dual-sim
device you can have either to the two
sims it's to nano sims or you can have
one nano SIM and use the others load for
the micro SD card so is exclusive either
one or the other and then we use this
standard the USBC connector which is of
course the most advanced connector today
that basically allows you to get a load
of things
I'm passing through these ports you get
power you get video you Cade oh do you
get everything passing across one single
port and of course is also reversible so
it means that there is no more need to
push and try to fit the USBC and they
USB cord in it it will always be the
right side let's talk about the
accessories when we talk about the
accessory we should look at the
continuum experience that comes with
windows 10 mobile and how we can in
ain't that continuum experience right so
first we have the text doc so the
desktop allows you to go big when you
need so when you go to the office for
example or to the house you only have to
carry your elite x3 device and you go
big when you need it so it comes with
USB see and use be a it is an Ethernet
port it features also rapid charging so
you can have it on your desk it will
hold your phone in a portrait mode so
you can easily monitor whatever incoming
call Texas everything really I'm at the
palm of your hand and it's also allowing
you to sub 2 to connect to a screen of
course and with that you can go big and
take advantage of continue the continuum
feature so you can use the applications
on your biggest screen if your written
to work with continuum and
and how can you take all that we've seen
just in a previous slide and make it
portable so we created the lap dog what
is the lap dog the lap dog is is
basically allowing you to take the best
dog with this play that you have on your
desk the keyboard and mouse all together
in one single device with a 12.5 inches
diagonal screen near borderless display
and an incredible battery of 48 but sour
it will allow you to to face
transoceanic flies without having to
worry about battery so you'll be able to
move from San Francisco to Amsterdam for
example and it would land with hundred
percent of battery on your phone because
this laptop can also charge your phone
because it's using USB see that passes
power so that's one of the biggest news
here on the market where the first in
the industry to provide this kind of a
device and when we look at all the other
accessories we have in our portfolio
with tyler's we have a USB otos where a
car adapter for power with
anti-fingerprint antiglare anti
shattered screen protectors web qi
wireless charger web wallet folio
protective case wave a stylus old or
older and were ragged and a silicone
protective case as well so just
sum everything up the elite x3
difference we talked about the fact that
this is a killer device we talked about
the fact that we have a comprehensive
ecosystem of devices accessories that
can really expand your experience as a
user and take it to the next level
allowing you to go big when you need it
when you need more space to create or
edit applicator documents you can take
advantage of the bigger screen with your
abs to really be more productive and
then we talked about the number the fact
that we have number one in commercial
and that we should take advantage of
that position and we've better really
thank you for joining I don't know if
you're any questions for me the speaker
the if the audience wanted to know more
information about it about the hardware
specs and I really deep dive working to
find more information so we have a web
page of course dedicated to this product
on ours on our HP com website so it's
easy to find and results to a data sheet
available so with all the specification
really exact specification of our device
or you can find all information there
and if not you can always drop me a mail
at giovanni di Lottie at HP com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
