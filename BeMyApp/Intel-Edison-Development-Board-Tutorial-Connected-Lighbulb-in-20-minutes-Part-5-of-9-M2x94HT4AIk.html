about the app how it works and i'm also
going to show you how to develop it
using Swift and for you lazy devs out
there we have the code fresh and ready
for you available at github so without
any other interruptions I say let's get
to it so there's the testing area and
for what we have set up right now is an
a cool little app that we created an
Xcode which is connected via the Wi-Fi
to the Intel Edison board which also
connected to the breadboard now the app
itself as I mentioned earlier is a light
changing app so I could change the blue
I can also add green and red and so on
and very simple but very cool to make
and that's for the next part in Xcode so
we just finished downloading the files
from github and the iOS app folder
you'll have the Xcode project I'm going
to present to you now now we have all
the project files main thought
storyboard is the file containing all
the screens over app in this case we
have created a single page app which you
can see now now all we have to do is
enter the info Edison's IP address in
the little text box and you'll have few
options on how to change the light bulb
there are three sliders one for each
color and low previews on that shows you
the previous in changing color and view
controller that Swift will have the code
I just showed you in the storyboard in
the view did load function will
calculate the color that will display in
the preview zone when we launch the app
you
and red oak will calculate the value of
the slider which will apply to all the
other remaining colors we now will
display it in the preview zone using the
output color
you can now see here that we used its IP
and we connect to port 8080 we add a
message change red with the value that
we want
this is the part
so send a message directly to the insult
Edison hope you enjoy this part and see
you soon in part 6</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
