assembled and the boards are connected
let's program the first steps that we're
going to make our arm move so let's get
started in this part of the tutorial
we're going to send the main program on
the server controller boards working
gather information from the Anderson
board and apply them on the servos let's
start by describing this program briefly
we have a first defined which is used to
refer to the type of board connection as
we're using an open cm for a 5 board we
connect on the USB 3 then we indicate
the idea of the first and last circles
of the chain we create a dynamic so
object then we launch communication
number 3 indicating that we want to have
the maximum speed in this buckle we are
going to initialize information on the
USB bus which will extract information
sent by the Edison
this function we called upon each
vent with USB and it will collect
information we need such as the angle of
the servers to contact and we will
execute the orders given we will
download the code on the board
this download has succeeded so we will
check if everything is working by
sending our own frame at the beginning
we always start with the letter s the
one meaning that we're in servo control
mode the dirty to show that we will send
a position to the servo then the three
digit servo ID for the third servile the
02 to for example then the angle the
server here it is 05 12 or four digits 0
5 12 is the position of the middle click
send and the server motor starts to move
as you can see after uploading the code
the robot moves now we will try to
control it to do this we're going to
need to install a web server on the
Edison</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
