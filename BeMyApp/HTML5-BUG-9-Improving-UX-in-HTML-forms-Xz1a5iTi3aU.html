guarding curry user experience each male
corpse and gold I'm sorry developer a
bunch of ears sometimes I usually travel
this year I've been traveling more than
I'm voting so my coding skills traction
quite rusty i should add code under
something today is i guess most asian
2011-2012 when i was working for swedish
government respectively as their end
city of toronto respectively living in
sweden I don't know bro there oh yeah I
like notes
so you have while preparing this
presentation ended up matching the
presentation software what more than
actually so out of this picture because
the whole into reminding guys ask
questions does anyone in heaven does
anyone have a crush okay and importantly
not and I wish it was it's called half
bath according to to enjoy your meeting
my figure reflect a nice pretty picture
and any other questions while we're at
it there is a magician proposed that and
you start my time at burge Lighting's
not advantage there I can talk a lot
about lot and so there M improve what
user experience very relative thing to
me usability some of the confusion
complexity stuff that ordinary inserts
are not thinking about us how are you
sir
and by adding some logical leap at work
during such heightened feels until
they're needed why not no like
everything is not on screen at the same
time optimal and and smaller things like
overriding the attendance behavior
browser or thrust attenuator and it's
not good for the users always it's
actually good for support people like
voices never happening like you overrode
it because supports didn't want to see
that be different in different browsers
other things that it's not so you just
comment to think about and user
experience I think its inputs eat and
but I've been working mean ending in
codes the place of the rain boots speed
is quite important a normal web page you
think might reduce number feels you to
reduce the number of steps for someone
to purchase or register right but I'm
talking places where you have a lot of a
lot of fields and people are sitting in
these fields the forms hours per day and
should totally have included that XKCD
about how many minutes or days you save
saving one second per bump about tests
but these inputs need things they're a
little bit trickier anything that
because you need existing data or
existing rules are you talk to your
users you can release it will free music
you talk to your users they're going to
get and i'll show you a little bit later
and as well automatic formatting might
not go well with everyone unless you
talk
but one of the first things to do is to
embrace html5 own for validation you
guys season so far that's up 13 of us in
here I've use html5 for validation
seriously ok impossible don't worry and
I do you guys recognize the first part
here and I mixed up for the last line
like pretty much less line since data H
by variety like the required part part
of the html5 specification as to mark a
feel is required so the browser knows
that you have to input something in this
field in order to pass and an important
place holder and yeah just to put
something pretty in the box of people
know what enter pattern records patterns
match against em titleist usual one but
it's not you with for validation if you
fail for validation he says official
teaser these are building things
medication elf items they've been around
since at least a dozen 99 rate and most
barristers totally work find them sex
old IE and current safari / sizes and
I'm sure the example one reason party
and
but because these things don't always
work so great across all browsers you
can use a little bit of scripting to
think Spencer's so you shouldn't be
bowser's with for example h by validates
and these things will work better i'll
show you one example sure
so I actually prepared all of the code
so item I don't have to type the code
would you rather see me type the code
then that's like this this is what way
what kind of type and the most important
thing here is to form each vitality
thing at the bottom there bit here devil
step 1 and i'm reloading this and expect
to see just a standard administration
for me this is the kind of form i'm
thinking about when i'm thinking about
for when we need improvement i did not
make this pretty but if i can make
pretty so don't worry about that now i'm
thinking about the kind where are people
sitting all day long as staring into
this boring is held for filling it out
there taking conquer call filling this
out
and it's just not great this is the
reality for a lot of people has anyone
here worked with this kind of system
like Dave day in day out none one two
three maybe and I'm happy to hear that
you might recognize sort of this boring
ass job I would work in working filling
out of order forms from paper to to
computer it but which is why I built
some of these scripts in cells my job's
name is safe this is a step 7 I'm
actually going to work backwards because
they were able to pull a full thing and
every boots thanks step by step so step
7 is the one I'd remove the most from
this is a basic and semi-formal a dated
thing if i enter things here there's no
error message this is a channel bike
bell dinging and
here
and counting oh yeah I'm sure this is
Chrome um here so this is an error for
phone numbers um it's hard to read and
annoys zoom in right but it says like
customers phone numbers required and in
a phone water kind of system might not
make sense and but as you can see are in
chrome and pressing enter thank you and
it doesn't submit an important and this
is kind of important because failed
validation like they'll fail in a
covered couple different places here
like name should be okay folks of
personal name should be required for
example if I affiliating phone number
here it jumps his name and this is part
of the standard of the problems with
neighbors non-standard unposted in this
far here
so this is the same page here and the
same html5 validations here this is the
latest version of Safari on maverick so
it's not like last year's version or
anything if i press enter here it will
submit the form the submitting of the
form in this case makes at least a blank
page so it means nothing and if Lady
Safari doesn't have peace html5 centers
implemented then it's time to do it a
bit of scripting
so this is step number six s or seven
seas 6 add a bitch page 5 validates i
hit enter and with a little bit of
scripting that validates all the kids at
the same time instead of just one at a
time also highlights ones first are
erroneous and displaced this title but I
mentioned earlier has a separate element
lot better user feedback lot fewer m
does it seem better than having to see
validation for either single control at
a time or having no validation at all
it's the part for example well I say
Saudis and you guys never use anything
like you just quite valid a flash in
with this which 10
Jagran buggin all right this is a day
for plugging as well agree and it is
pretty good but i must say that my fork
has a lot of improvements or trend
improvements that I prefer over the
original maintain errs version so I
heard usually look at it but every guys
you go for something else in HP 5 a late
today unless it's my own version so this
is a simple example hy validates as this
readiness of course configurable it CSS
to the forum engaging works and here's
one thing and that is not actually in
the user ever sees this is a developer
library to understand i mentioned
because i am using it in the next two
plugins I'm sure I wrote this 2011
worked out apart from other things it's
quite useful anybody ever wanted to
emulate at a dinner party like tabby sir
it happens and I remember this little
plugin of course I mean it doesn't do
very much it's actually like a two-line
operation unless you're taking account
like firefox firefox i think like 10 had
some bugs regarding focusing file inputs
which would mean that you'd end up in
nowhere land because instead of pilot
but you're in sandbox mode and that kind
of broke everything in terms of
anyway to tally first tool built with
this is skip on file with this not the
same as tacit index equals minus ones
which I'm pretty sure you guys used at
some point your echinacea do you
actively use tab index equals minus 1
currently anyone anyone uses time
advances at all nicest zone are they
useful cemex implementation sorry it's
the legacy implementation in order to
change and early perspective of a swamp
thing but I tried to maintain one site
and using tab in this once i was like
i'm going to optimize tab order the
problem is every link on the page is
it's possible so you need to in order
for someone to tab to the form elements
you start with the form elements you
said time an existing those and and then
if you start doing that for form
elements then you'll push all the links
to the end of it so all the good people
who need usability will not like ever be
able to reach the links and mobilize the
whole mess actually but what I really
wanted to do was to skip what you
usually want to do is to skip a field
with tab matrix equals one it might as
one to 10 tablet but it turns out but
you can't reach it by any other means
clicking the mouse and if you are doing
this input daily and how we're in hour
after hour that actually turns into a
problem that you need to reach with a
mouse and let's say temper some cases
because you only need to skip a field
with temper some of the cases I'll show
you what an example because I your left
in my looking at arriving before like
this and if you're using it all day
every day you might not use you might
not care about every feel every time
check this nut out of line two optional
it would be faster if you didn't really
have to tab through that one every time
i mean i'm using this is a very small
example and here if you can skip this
one every time and which means 90
version of the cases when you can skip
it ninety percent of the cases it'll
save time and when it comes to larger
things that are usually default well i
could by default like delivery options
and you have a couple more tabs to say
and on a longer form you will have 20
tabs to save it doesn't sound like a lot
but seriously it it increases user
appreciation of a system if you're able
to to talk to them and choose which
fields are not in apartment
yes are you sure about that skipping the
tab that pressing one more type 90 x is
more expensive than moving the mouse 10
times including and haven't done you the
tiny slice but I'm talking to the users
and they appreciate it and I mean as a
as an end product if you talk to the
user she asked me to be with like eggs
and they would like it that's the way
and the system that me and I pulled all
the developers implementing this the
first time for as for eight full-time
employees and who eight letters have
been sent to the wrong address in Sweden
I mean all the letters and sweet
medicine to the wrong address enough
their hands they have to open them up
and parse the address version download
then parse all the continent and in put
this into a computer system searchable
to imagine you're you're opening letters
all day long and you enter addresses and
you have this play I mean the biggest
part of their job is entered addresses
so skipping second hiders line to them
was a huge win I mean like I'm talking
at in like small cases here for life for
the second Tigers line for eight people
all day everyday year-round they were
happy
surprisingly happy and because this is
improving a little old system also smell
the same fields we just kept us on a
bunch of course mrs. yeah again in some
time and but the thing that makes a
difference in skip on down compared to
the tab index equals minus one is good
see I tapped past it from here one time
and it just skips up optional thing is
that you can you should have and go to
it but you cannot do where the Asian of
x version sr HTML tablet is equals minus
one it actually just removed from the
tab order there's no way to reach you
that with me and so the shift tab thing
is though so big improvement using this
library over using Saturday Chanel
features and again not big but if you
have these people entering the addresses
they actually appreciate being able to
go to that address line to Google chef
top mindedness and in the in the bigger
scheme of things let's say here and I
have a state province essential Ontario
because that's where it was good and I
have the delivery options gift-wrap and
delivery like speedy basically cost for
that and have a water notes down there
if you want to go to the order notes
instead of one two three tubs and logic
for tops you can do one time if you even
know you're hardly ever going to say
let's change
same problems you never going to change
gift-wrap or delorme normal delivery or
hardly ever I mean skipping too long is
not great because here's the counter
example if I shipped up here and to save
change the state province instead of
shipped having once I have to talk
through delivering your crap options so
a lot of like ordering issues in this
security planning and really a real
assistant does anybody think that skip
on tab might be useful in some cases but
you have to have like eating people 24-7
see if you pause with the use or
something like it I would say it's a win
I don't care as much about the
milliseconds in many of the cases the
people who are talking I'm talking about
people are actually doing the letter
thing they're if they are an average
something like five sixty year old women
we all of the husbands are working like
in in an iron mine and all of them have
ended up in office jobs I know like
their husbands have a job you know
like people like ruin their muscles and
backs and whatever but these women were
equally worried about bringing their
shoulders with extra padding here's me
and it sounds a little bit weird when we
listen to them we do this and we got
paid so right mmm that's one side so
let's get one tab good for something oh
sorry implementation details here you
can put it on like a single employers
and put it on containers for example
checkboxes you can have a hundred
checkbox to say you always want to skip
them that's like the vicar I don't wanna
skip through violent tab 2 100
checkboxes even though I will you have
the most yeah
okay so i told you guys about the
wonderfulness about the latest version
of Chrome this happened a few days ago
this is a css3 transform I've seen a
similar bug on another website I can't
think of anything else than the den
version of Chrome doing this for some
reason and that is a pain I think I
hadn't prepared this picture ok so I
totally get it in force and get some
problem so okay yeah
ergonomic will work stations also
important for wife's of iron mine
workers you've seen this picture before
it's like the most basic picture there
isn't have you seen this person where
you see any something from a boat I've
never seen this one I've never thought
about it really that much until I was
implementing the system and but stack of
papers on the left hand side of pencil
and I'm not going to look at it right in
the person because it says right in
person to leave the website right and
there's a folder left hand side of
couple books there's a red swingline
city of red swingline tables staplers
okay and there's one problem here and
the tightest pluses have the one problem
I see and I've experienced myself being
a data entry person for a couple months
is that a tab key is the left hand side
where you should hold a piece of paper
reading off the bed a little bit I mean
like a total of doctrine holder but if
you're doing as these latest you they
open like envelopes and they have like
three pieces of paper need to shuffle
all them or whatever you don't have a
document holder and doesn't work and the
tab key is in the far left-hand side and
the kind of entry i did at least and i
know that several companies I've worked
with do is largely number oriented none
that i know i'm in a laptop I don't have
enough had in years but the entry staff
they have none has especially if they
work with digits there's some
interesting symmetry as message here but
it's not real sentry the plus key on the
right hand side you can also choose
minus key and is on pretty much the
opposite side of its have to eat so if
you're working on the digits they're
right for fast data entry and you can't
use injured always problems in web pages
and you can use the plus key with a
little descriptive you don't have to
reach over to the left hand side down
like put down within your reading tab
pick it up again or whatever small off
Playstations again but this one I'm very
happy with myself if you have a fast if
you know your thank you know your
numbers
we'll make good use of this numbers
because you should also using emulate
tab it's also configurable in such a way
that you can set enter keys or arrow
down or parking on Ted plus as tablets
and kind of useful to meetings the guys
are working in data entry would you see
this as useful as well as like keyboard
distance is not very long but crispy
potentially useful razor let's see this
is so much fun with that so again the
same form here we have products I've
chosen to skip these products in this
demo like if they're not important
because usually people calling in here
at to TV shop they're always ordering
the basic product but product insurance
and and you know the basic product is TV
shop where did this arrow to sever our
guarantee like jewelry sorry Junior we
see leaves something again in like those
things people call in order those things
all the time
they usually sell like everything like
they have more than one product but they
probably have the one product to sell
all the time this week and scared and so
if someone is working entering numbers
here all day long and if someone adds an
extra products it make my case I'm going
to use entered my map is instead of
tapping it might lead to win or
something the minor thing again the
numbers enter well interconnection
instead of tab tab space or something
because enter would be submitting the
form in most cases if you accidentally
hit enter here and set up here then you
submit form or you'd end up somewhere
else working around I guess afore was
not done it I mean like I prefer the
plus young nun but what this works as
well oh um i'm going to show you this
here and here's actually one thing that
is a lot of the time this is for the
next vice and the delivery address the
same as in boise others that's usually
the piece for so much
one of those at home or small business
they don't have a separate invoice
canvas basically this part here this
entire block of text should have the
same values as I'm here or I mean that's
yo remember way of doing it I say is
I'll copy the values from one part of
before with other and in terms of user
experience and said I would rather not
have these tools at all let's see here
oh this is a simple way of adding
following precious ore swamp to follow
up questions light for this question
it's not a really relevant to show a
text area and text areas are pretty big
for someone who's never seen a UFO we're
never encountered as REM and let's say
that only five percent of those are
wackos and actually have had Close
Encounters
and that only times I've ever used like
this text area box and it doesn't make
sense for it to take a lot of space and
why not hide it why not hide the second
part of Thatcher's like a delivery
address reduce the invoicing address and
binder things 10 minutes nice minor
things if you look at it like as a small
example of course but if ninety-five
percent of us are saying let's see for
right
and here so you saw in step 4 I did not
imply the bowl then mean I've now added
data has polyps and the asphalt sibling
and this is a whole of Christian or
walkable oppressions to this to this yes
no question and is it the same address
yes then like skip it like there's no
use in and showing all these things if
it's not the same show them and then
having here is done as per usual
I mean we're talking small speed
improvements again this is a rather big
one if you have a lot of questions and
it's pretty useful I mean that for you
info questions with only one type of box
is pretty big or four for these type of
box type of all law questions for it
should matter of a bunch of inputs and
these could extend to anything like is
the customer does the customer want to
customize a product whatever they're
calling it for them that that TV shop
deal and they want the product in red or
they want the project and red and blue
and whatever rate you have a bunch of
checkboxes you can actually hide them
unless the customer wants customization
small
and all the clean call that on hand
cleaning and have you guys used to need
jQuery plugins for this before like tidy
nothing moody feels automatically me too
but like the months where you see like
the wall like underscore we're supposed
to understanding right I didn't really
like those so much they have their have
their wins but I've heard this version
instead it doesn't show anything this is
it doesn't it put like underscores in my
text box it's what I see it just helps
me see Apple and like for example this
is a regular for north american phone
number and i wanted to look like this
all the time and it just cleans it up
reel two questions one
this phone number for example with those
remaining some of my own poll numbers
but let's just type on in it's always 10
digits m.a sadita and rude person I
don't want to sit there and do like
around that says number number number
space number number number number number
number and whatever because it's company
policy to format it like that and I also
don't want to wait with formatting until
like I'm done with the rest of the port
I wanted to have it right away and so it
is created this small plug in to form a
phase ii LP down or on copy paste
there is fast enough to be unnoticeable
and it saves a lot of small things
that's one of the things that ladies up
and enormously again the user case we're
talking a lot about because am problems
they had actual internal political
problems in their groups because some
people would enter ok I'm going to
contrive this example to something that
here some people would enter enter their
information with the parentheses first
of dash in gear and others don't in like
that it's such a small thing junit who
cares I meant something to them because
they didn't have anything else I don't
know and but not like we actually saved
them a lot of trouble a lot
interpersonal problems by applying
automatic formatting to some of these
single fields i mean i'll take another
simple example is not available for the
swedish ladies but here and a canadian
zip code you have letter number letter
number letter bubble a loss and if you
enter these things in lower case because
it's faster than some people are going
to get pissed off because it's not
correct so you automatically upper cases
in escape mode Thanks right and that
saves problems in an organisation I
never would have thought of like the
political things about implementing like
auto fee but data and I mean they can't
be like they can't really complain
anymore
have us automatically this is a valid
Canadian take on there oh it's much more
if I remember and I mean uppercase and
the space in between groups they're
simple as that but if you lower case
today you dont have space someone's
going to go well and of course this I
built a couple of things here that's
like a lowercase uppercase normalize
whitespace numbers only about a month
and also some Canadian specific things
actually our plug-in that I just dropped
into this form that all cleans
everything Canadian style if we already
marked it up Canadian side nice you're
not so the skirt I mean that's nothing
in particular is going to say but it
does everything on my page and I say
this one for last because this one is
really annoying have it dental something
like demo bugging me what happens if a
user accidentally presses the back one
custom one of those kinds analysis for
that one you are like a keyboard of that
button or or like the swype you thing
here whatever and they lose input data
sure usually doesn't matter like if
you're building a system where want
people to register it kind of matters if
you're building this is where people use
it everyday it managed a lot and simple
plug-in drop this into a web page one
more view of one more preferably I mean
not many because this will interfere but
you'll change one for any bit more
another form so this is exactly one
thing I make a change here and I try to
leave the page I make a change here too
and I try to leave a page where money so
I don't forget to say small thing ever
I'm sure you guys I don't remember this
man you lay before I just figured why
not make it into an automated script
does it with no questions you just blow
description it's done curse you can
customize the text for you want to also
customize say to happiness and how to be
Jackson backends you need to modify your
sub mix order but apart from that all
that what its work the first time em I'm
here actually it should have worked if
you ask me I would not going to try to
do that and make myself look silly so um
those are the things in a demo for are
given up time or should we do yes Oh
time looks good
oh my didn't get all right mmm questions
on that stuff I've had so far it's all
been that what a nice all the Devils are
online already I think we all could
ascend y links on that for running like
we want two times and men's faces etc
and two of them for they don't go yeah
but what did it for you later bye so
then one party has won by default
because changing systems so Alverson
interview for me yep ok well and they
won as in ok we never heard of anyone
losing obviously as developers as
developers when a product manager I
certainly had a project manager to take
care of us developers and he was talking
to the product manager to take care of
the users so like we were couple of
steps away from the actual politics of
this but we were visiting that maybe we
solve some of these small things but
they were in the same room like me a
little bit bigger than this but eight
people all day long just shut them
letters and some 11 someone some lost
but as a team with a lot of consensus
there they all gain
you have this all like yeah it's already
linked on the media pics and other
comments and I could have run this
online it's all there pretty I mean the
changes I could have made in code
writing this are pretty minor they're
actually like part of the fact that in
floating the scripts come from the
correct URL but things you saw the
slides were like three or four changes
tops or plugin that's all you need
plugin then again it gets your pendant
if you have a lot of young but this will
not cease us for you and so I could
mention a few more things like auto
completion in text areas doing Auto
completion on the fourth line the text
area where you might have a sip code or
the third line you don't know like it's
usually a third of the port line don't
look back to find out some of the simple
fixes as our differences this is not a
difficult this is a tool to find out
where a keystroke wins that's not a real
different tool I'm using it to
autocomplete in text field s or text
areas and check out number two did this
on find out if it's been the line you
want to the autumn thing on and run a
procedure for auto completion on the
third or fourth liner
however useful right it's actually like
my own demo code for this doesn't work
so the actual until then encode actually
didn't really work well for the again
the census people believe these
entrepreneurs and they didn't they got
Auto completion of the database full of
millions of addresses and they got
millions of addresses and they put them
in a single text book may God's like the
statistically relevant for the past year
for the past two years correct address s
based on the first few keystrokes to
start with if there's a match and I mean
like the invasive addresses was picking
on for us to use solver for indexing
adversus like that level of input and
Olga meeting addresses in a free text
field is a huge win of users I don't I
mean setting up an address in to me in
the street of Allah has its way before
the data kind of guy and like I'm an
engineer I'd rather have them in
separate fields but for input or it
doesn't there's no women having been
centerfielders me they would they're
just as fine with a simple single text
area and this was stricken use but where
again it's also where
break sometimes this is for when other
people don't right there to go problem
this isn't it Oliver tool if you happen
to have a jquery plugin that would like
to that doesn't do change things
properly seen that a little bit negative
change Polly instead just whatever
simple plug-in with us yep this is for
work back in place if you're working on
forms that are huge and my favorite form
had favorite 14 pages 14 print pages of
input I mean like writing handwriting
input 14 pages they want to convert it
to a single HTML page own image not two
separate HTML pages on them I'm not
talking about like the research style
where you can actually I've some
potential applications but the back end
had a limitation you only have a single
a 12-page curve perform and in that case
use this tool in order to extract all
the fields so that someone dragged
intimate knowledge about this paper
forms could see what default values
within put mrs. and they in a digital
version of this 40-page form and they
could sit and compare the screen actual
or more easily this is like underscore
implementation combined with the jQuery
implementation or extracting it than
filtering out forms a sort of orbitals
it's also I used for tons of days that
is automated extraction which is just a
little bit too hard abortion
in case you're doing a lot of for work
and 21 peoples are very plain and I'm
going to skip through these these are
the questions this is the questions page
really questionable attention as i
mentioned ultimately around the elastic
search user group and there's always the
question how do neighbor search is
better and one strange suggestion is
implement off complete in your folk
tales because the best way to make users
getting better queries as to hit them on
what's there and ultimately really
raises the level of proper questions
posed to your systems by percentages
that you can never reach by i know many
embedded query language yeah and you can
take care of spelling mistakes as well
the study mistakes that you straight
away yeah that reduces blood or
frustration of everything and you
usually have the while spending these
things ironed them out by some way of
fuzzy matching in the search questions
and all the people building solo in the
messages so that i will just all set to
suggest the correct spelling and
includes the much more than 50 ways of
doing anything yeah i don't know it like
solar posse stuff is way better than
anything on a program I mean the stomach
and everything for short so you have a
solar back in please use it for auto
complete as well and not just searching
but like prefetching suggestions for
service
alright
as I said already uploaded taking care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
