that's cool third or whatever please of
course ever I be compact on nowadays
that's good sometimes hi I am Jordan
with coming and we are building cottam a
app for iOS and Android that solves two
use cases tourists number one it
streamlines artists discovery feel a
life law and second it enables
interactive art over bluetooth low
energy status oh and it's doing all of
that with design constraints in mind
around like Nam bian computing things
like that so all these things are
possible without people ever taking
their phones are in their pockets and
getting torn out of the experience of
being at an art gallery or event like
that to dive into the first use case of
artists discovery the app can track
whatever art somebody sees when they go
out to one of our events so by having a
beacon behind every piece of art of this
transmitting an idea we can collect per
user what got what aren't they saw how
long they sit in front of it and how far
away they work from the arm um that's
just raw data so what we're doing with
that is distilling it into a clean
timeline something like path or moves I
have and then combining with the artist
discovery aspect of something like kuba
I'm in addition to that will have artist
bios and like contact information things
like that so people can learn more about
me and get in touch with artists that
they care about the second use case
which is interactive art you switch it
around an app is transmitting an ID so
that each use each attendee at an event
has unique ID and the army respond to
them uniquely for example if there's a
gift Lutheran photo goes after a user
takes the picture it cannot
go to the application um and I guess
it's a good time for the demo now since
here's a piece of art that was made by
Micah okay scanline one of our hood my
future artists and when I was a beacon
in my pocket run and a half walk over to
the art in 10-1000 that i was around and
tits changes those being displayed now
this aggressive good concept very basic
something changed but once we gonna
spend the hands of people that are more
creative decisive limits um and
I know the judges are interesting some
particular criteria such as to begin the
stickiness this is already in demand
running our events one of the number one
feedback we get is people went to our
event they saw some amazing art and they
come doesn't is it I remember some art
but I don't remember who made it or
anything else that happen because
there's alcohol um so this application
directly solve that problem to be from
attending school um we can also ensure
that people will be downloading and
installing a half by requiring it as
attendance and we're committed to
long-term engagement we've been running
events for five years and we've got a
lot of exciting opportunities in the
future and just celebrate our technology
and get people to install this will be a
nap um I know that you guys also care
about innovation over the weekend we
made the first piece of Bluetooth Low
Energy enabled art which was pretty fun
and exciting and we do doesn't love
melodies come on get around person thank
you um we're also interested to be sick
open source library so then artists and
easily pick this up and incorporate it
into their work was like very long um
also in the future we would love to make
it so that traditional artist people
that aren't digital artist can sign up
with us and we'll send in a kit of
bacon's and they send us their artwork
so they there aren't which is like
visual or non digital stuff sculptures
paintings and things like that can live
in our ecosystem um you guys also care
about business potential after a pilot a
drone events will be we are going to
engage with art galleries and art walks
to get this out there in the bay area
around the world and we can also reskin
this for museums zoos aquariums
conferences any place you definitely
want to measure engagement but you want
people to remember what they saw we're
measuring that our users don't use the
app at all in there at the events
totally passive in those cases it's when
they get home at a minute they can go
back and remember the cool experiences
and yeah that's it really
to continue working on this app and
thank you for your time questions
questions yes and he's all right yeah
yeah yeah so the design of the app I was
like like MacGyver path where the
timeline and um that timeline each icon
is a piece of art that user come and
belong to I stood in front of it that
tolerate is so you have a base
eliminator then the legs will be
represented by Windows I'm so like it's
also like one metric the with a bit of
color so forget it easy people of
homicide by yourself others when you
zoom out your hair like all the bigger
than we want my game is again
underscored covered are you planning to
sound too vocal artist wrong color
because you mr. our product yeah
absolutely i got a tooth on base and
yeah we had long questions yes okay so
it can be both when with the when people
have the application have unique ID so
the art can know that just anybody is
Maya or it could like show a color
palette that a user picked out or
something like that or give an image
back to the user specifically so it can
be per user and it can also be like
however many users around like you could
do a piece of art that changes that
there's 10 people in front of it instead
of
prison or people have been there for two
minutes or three minutes do something
different than if there's nobody there
questions questions timer ticking easy
now ninja in the time everything ok so
quickly catch myself this when did you
actually go next after ninja fight and
design after all the cash flight log
will be next connectify oh it's a good
before you where is your budget I'm sure

things everybody felt funny people 30 I
neither market will 1 / 1 cool and when
he supposed to go to LA I over for us
but on somebody's he
perfect anyway rofls elsewhere that will
affect our if picture flight that's a
she's going with virgin america and
underneath you'll see there's a
reliability rating this rating just
indicates how many times this company
has washed bugging us right there's
chooses virgin and she goes on like to
live bag and the garden vault right
there that's why and hazard we cook we
collect a fine line what's happening
with it we know when she checks in LA we
know when her luggage is on the flame
with her we know when she leaves LA
Airport in head over to SFO right now is
information right I'm looking at your
eyes at SFO knows the luggage on it and
he goes to pick it up she's happy she
got her first bag first pretty luggage
and she's he's wondering where the next
11 SFO has no answer she doesn't know
where it is and she's livid she's angry
another a for SFO development this
actually drops fault here at Hawaii
freaking a little bit too much can he
loves the luckiest back so now this has
happened a lot of times if Jackie and
she doesn't know was it but she opens up
her out she goes to bank tag and I bag
tag you can click on the bank that
scoffs and she clicks on the bangers
cloth and she'll see what was the last
known location of that bag and what time

boy finds it in la delivery boy David
come to her rescue flies all the way to
SFO to give job Jackie the bank now he's
made Jackie the happiest woman in the
world as you serious the second ago
if this is bag tag you bring people no
the other thing you can see with data
about the airlines and their liability
score is you can actually start being
how good is virgin america vs air canada
risk Emirates for sticking out of
Airways you can start seeing the
reliability spoon we call it the GT for
delivery spark now this information is
also useful or websites HIPAA expedia
that is / training the airlines that's
it also going on from a species where my
face another back now what we've been
able to do over the last couple hours is
hot tonight but we can actually detect
210 in a venue library it's wrong spread
and we can actually have to where they
are internal application 10 * Mentalist
our app is pleased a little bit more
polish it but increased previous yeah so
as long as as long as you have to be
confined as I as always the other back
there just for music you can even in
supplication awesome hi music aah buh
hey Jack he's hot hello they must know
so I'm united airlines and I have a
terrible he scored what's amiss me from
taking your data I'm glad other horrible
ah here I mean it all Alana's they
should be stationed storm is pulling on
information on Nina and guarding
regarding baggage finish does not miss
Hanlon that's what they were both right
now it has to be whether it is built on
it as we lost art has enlisted the
united airlines are actually out of the
gun to adopt this technology if we get
funding we're hiring and also tomorrow
and I can go to lose another ninety
thousand naira find us today right now
we have filled this real roads and up on
deck when I Schmidt escape on those
ships aid
is almost
that's all
oh well mark exactly like this we've
outfitted a beacon and it has a
temperature sensor and so the idea here
is as if temperature goes up Lena in
silent crack all the reason that neat
bars now how they did me wonder prints
up so for the playing the role of bruce
dern today we have a you have some
heineken for him and he's going to get
it started what it is we're almost
beautiful
because I have one of them that is but
out as a hot drink another one has a
cold rain the other ones haven't been
served yet so if you can pass me another
bottle and imagine we open these these
guys up let's get real and it's you know
what is interesting is I great lot mate
and instead we are you and get all seven
of a woman who's not positive oh this is
going on back about the shade mary 0
which is when you get to feed yard when
you get the philosophical bleeding gums
in digital asset ended up on desert
welcomes you to the festival app but
yeah you look again brings that
finishing a nigga go back and come on
the back door
this if you can get em Fred they'll
write down if you look at Sandra he's on
the hunt is on the off day now the bar
high and meanwhile we take one off and
Bruce this cold go ahead you start
drinking and speed it up for this last
two seconds demo we'll just warm it up a
little orally but it that than with the
car door and everything they actually
make entire is it a lot guys just once
you go
where's that pushes you please yeah yes
please so far yeah it was Oh far
maybe not are they know that's a poor
assignment art this is art it like let
me be the past lots of ways by using the
using the thinkin it really kind of
freshness and in a bigger part there's
there's a lot more we can do with it
once we tie yeah he is or which we will
notice registration and they're located
to the bar and so the other question I'm
just wondering what would be the
distance upgrading to change yeah so the
limitation is the first being polled 23
seconds and when the guys all come from
the shake is you never know enough other
girls walking that information and
create a decision but I'm sure that you
know other freaking technologies could
also do that that would that would
certainly help and it just does it the
algorithms and spells cookies okay so
right now we have seen written up on
deck bigger box upon your boss

he's had a few members who does your
house final estimate because negative
but just to spend 20 minutes and happy
so what we're doing is we're going with
all of that you're basing it with me
like the arrows in style experience or
we're walking and we're going to show
you what that looks like right now
ok videobox around is first of all of
chap and you can see that i'm over here
is is is a chair i'm here and i can just
have to pass check in here i'm gonna
walk around sport and curation on your
head toss it over here I've you'll see

pull her over to the lovely mini mark
and as I curse the minibar I all right
come more faint clapping especially this
big TV n over here so it's come under
the TV um and it will actually pop up as
well make enough yes able and then
finally some of this beautiful program
practice I firmly to the binky lever
down there is ok beautiful republic is a
oh my ki f OU still at this point you've
included the car and he would see this
items at the part and I would complain
when he hit the checkout button and then
he would complete the Spartan product
then one of two things that happen
either he would say yeah Logan it was
funny happens blur and I can endure my
meatballs for 40 minutes and it hovers
over or you just say you know here's my
cooker invitation just bring it to my
house tomorrow and I can leave the store
right now so I'm grand and over
screaming so
what did you think of the digital
shopping partner what Homer fine another
so as you can see we've sold the real
goals this little influence on it out we
just hold the massive problem for
retailers they're installing right now
the way I give it up into analytics is
they actually get a person to shattered
the demographic groups I go ahead
physically record their shopping
experience I think we can all agree this
depends scale it's not particularly
representative and it's not particularly
rigorous but what we know is we actually
built an integration with Google
Analytics we've brought google analytics
into the real world shopping experience
and what this allows us to do is we're
able to do things like how long the
choppers come in your store what exact
path do they dig through your store were
killed playback are this part other
store or even able to do things like
saying how long do they spend in
individual parts write down how long do
they spend in front of individual so
last year alone I kid at 27 billion
dollars in red if we're able to deliver
inside
without people Analytics integration
that leads to even a one percent
increase in conversions as huge
so he has really done a lot of audits
how are you going to deal with that
making sure that walk around them
ignorant I'm support report on it we're
pretty confident at yeah well that's one
another really no yeah we realize that
we could pick up this big ol to give it
an enclosed approximately any test for
them yeah not we also want I mean they
would they come at this time so we were
not very incredibly challenging a year
of in the bathroom area and then you can
just pick on one of those and it blows
up but any other question please when
you finish Holies don't you hate that so
we have two options and we both are
really trying to reduce or eliminate Q
because that's really tedious and
unpleasant so you would submit your
order just like the virtual shopping
cart you would go to the cafe you'd wait
a few minutes maybe 10 15 minutes we
could also incentivize you that the
coupon to ten percent off you know join
relax in simultaneously employ a key
employees are going to fetch met or for
you then bringing it to you it's kind of
equivalent to when you go to a
restaurant and you sit down a little
deeper on your table there's buzzes with
the food's ready other questions okay
well thank you very much and again check
out a bigger box
no we have probably there and look up on
their gears early their thang khuu
septic get very hot weekend did anyone
think about lake now but us this morning
when you woke up some of you
pull it so inviting my name's three-time
in fact fifty percent of the 1.1 billion
people but people seem to be very
passionate about this week but that's
fine but we issued additional speed a
patient world being awake next evil very
nice waking up process which is a very
unpleasant sensation no way and many
companies have tried to get into the
industry and tackle the problem then put
a silly remark but in general those
problems will just make it also if you
turn it on and anything out there will
give you the same problem you are filled
by yourself you with problem getting
through painful process of waking up all
by yourself now the solution is simple
as a person that used to be a child can
imagine the solution is having someone
in the morning just like your mom did
back in the old days
which is the exit end of the movie
 perfect one we we continue
institutions in CGS be said but people
like people people that are weight on
one side of the world how people that
are hard to wake up at a legislation
making time of the making use of the
time difference while doing so there's a
personal photo through the application
one lesson that is boho and in the
morning Anna from his early with a
message differences mostly funny nose is
before would wake comedy in San
Francisco making the waking up process
more enjoyable as a whole
you
now this is the idea we had before the
weekend all the weekends we had around
and
and rail to work on the app and turn our
idea into a beautiful design now it's
going to do is write how the app works
pedigree it's going to kick start your
day and take the same time to do that
well we have we had certainly ideas many
crazy ones so the two technical people
just crash northern and we kept down the
air to the main key function which is
scheduling a wake-up call which you can
do from respect looking here and by
scrolling your finger on it would change
the time after holding down that you can
confirm the sign and the app will show
you that you have not activated your
wake-up call at whatever time you please
to do so well we have added another
feature which is prowling through the
community as you can see when the next
bear wants to be waking out for example
we have enables wake up in seventh I
want to wake up night for me because I'm
thirsty and you will also see
preferences you will read about my
interest and this will help you to have
the conversation the morning which means
30 seconds in three minutes and I would
also be wire and let's let it be a
marketing major so because I'm a
marketing professor and I feel it is to
wake these students or because I'm
interested in marketing in general I can
give you some ideas in marketing now
the real beauty comes with a bigger
kitchen can we have the beacon over here
awesome so basically the last up news on
next to the bed and in the evening when
it's time for the bad news on for the
phone goes to the bad weather app
recognizes that you enter the bathroom
it will tell them hey you're close to
them you want to schedule a wake up on
you say yes then you go to bed in the
morning you will prove after you spoke
to the proof in the way that community
if you woke up removing the phone from
with that you need to prove to the
community that you woke up I walk away
but a loser they will hear Frank popping
up saying congratulations you woke up
now you get to a percent discount at
your favorite coffee store or pumping
and that's where the revocation powerful
say please this young is good can't even
engine its place among me when you
capture the texture of a customer first
in the morning you will have the
attention to the whole day the market
potential is yes well maybe that is
early then is going to change the world
worried but hello how does it work but
the people were making me join The
Colbert the hitter is any kind of
screening process it's like oh well
there's a rating process over here would
be amended this present pointed lab
write him and say you could be deleted
probably after and the real thing is
nice making friends around the world
which could connect the countries and
you learn about it a lot of companies
which would give you an extension on
calling other people and helping them
get up if you lose you lose if you
designs do not answer the phone go
disappointed also on the outside of the
club following you to wake up you said
this person 99-cent just whatever of the
other hand and this is for me wander
over there not to sous the 99 cents it's
a loss it's as promised but it will hurt
you and therefore more lighting together
at the time that you decide about
slicing it just came by the
international com I can afford it
actually that's the deal it over going
invite for the questioning pushing guys
don't answer station yes and actually
employees implemented it over the
weekend and its function and the other
oh we forgot to update somebody this
morning wake you up from the Ukraine you
now learned about the youth claim and
understood the political issues
particularly when you have been used you
will have a very different situation
with this it will change through the
world
I don't mess it up good luck run along
you hear real mother perfect for all
right so that's in this new year what
people think is enough to kind of here I
see her to offer our top I mean play in
mind oh oh yeah right you I no matter
under white boy for attention you so
much plus I'm off the problem is honey
hey Sophie news affair musica by Phyllis
laughs I must be super the wrong risk
