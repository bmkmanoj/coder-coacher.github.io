Bri caesars well if you do then you're
going to love Jessica's it's essentially
the love child of chess and sodoku a
one-player puzzle getting the objective
is to have one one piece left on the
board every move has to be a kill move
and you start with traditional chest
moves so if you know how a rook a bishop
and nice moves then you know how to
start the game if not we have tutorials
taking through anyway but it gets really
interesting when you can earn the
fantasy pieces as you move on fewer
levels and the first thing that I would
say that in terms of innovation is there
is nothing in either app store in either
Android or Apple that is using what a
technical fairy pieces but they're
essentially new moves each other so
here's a really simple example I
challenge one of the judges with the
first as they have to solve this problem
it's the last man standing that's the
really simple yeah exactly so there's
story easy for us to make level up to
level up to the level and surround
proper difficulty to keep you engaged so
the next level is just a very simple on
again but it's using similar to pieces
anyone can see it yeah yeah exactly so
the ruckus yeah there you go
and you back in so the reason that I'm
only gets exciting is that we have lots
of extra pieces of that in now if we had
time would have been I'll give you a
demonstration and tutorial that says the
gesture which the game is named after
goes likely night but instead of going
to buy one he goes to buy two we also
have a Lancer an Admiral's and lots of
other pieces that go different
combinations to keep the puzzle
endlessly entertaining endlessly
engaging and actually later on we can
start doing some really funky stuff like
having space walls and for texts and
lots of different ways to make the
puzzle more and more computer so I would
say it's very easy to learn but it's
impossible to ever end so the gesture
goes to x 2 to x 2 and then another
example of how the jet ski runs around
is you go to site 2 by 2 and then the
night takes him as well it's very simple
very short levels easy to play keeps you
engaged and you can get extra levels by
paying or you can do a little by
socializing so we got marketing there as
well go back year I like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
