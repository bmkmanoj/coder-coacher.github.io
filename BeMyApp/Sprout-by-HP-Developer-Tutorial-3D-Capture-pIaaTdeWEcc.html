capture 3d objects with the sprout one
of the features of the sprout is its
ability to capture real-world objects
not only in two dimensions like a normal
camera but also in three dimensions we
can capture three dimensional objects
with the 3d capture app which comes
built into the sprout in this tutorial
we will be using an HP 3d capture stage
to assist in capturing the object while
not required the stage makes the process
more automated and easier
every time you use the capture stage you
will have to scan the background before
you scan your object this is because the
stage is not fixed and we don't want our
end model to have the stage as a part of
it the black and white lines that you
see being projected onto the mat are
part of the method that sprout uses to
understand 3d space
you can set the capture stage to be flat
or tilted at an angle as benefits the
object you are scanning in this tutorial
we will be doing a flat scan you can
easily change the settings of each
capture to allow you to do a greater or
fewer number of passes the more you do
the more data your program will have and
the more accurate your model will be in
this video I will be doing only one pass
and that pass is divided into six
segments each time the stage moves to
the next segment a new moment is
captured and the 3d information is saved
at the end of the process the
application will stitch all of this data
together to form one model
as you can see there may be a couple of
holes in the model due to us only doing
one pass for this example you can choose
to leave these sort of gaps if they are
intentional or if you wish to repair
them yourself alternatively you may
choose to have this software close them
automatically this model turned out
really well for only doing one pass
typically you may need to do two three
or even more depending on the complexity
of the object once the model is fused
you can use the 3d viewer to manipulate
it to a certain extent changing its
material its color or exporting it to a
different format allowing it to be
edited by another 3d modeling software
before saving it
once you are satisfied with the model
you can save it and it will appear in
your 3d capture models folder
a primary use of this would be to scan a
real world object that you own make
tweaks to it as a model and then print
it out using a 3d printer
