am the project lead for Aurilia and be
my app asked me if I would do a little
Q&amp;amp;A for some of its community members
answering just a couple questions that
had been sent in about Aurelia so let me
go ahead and get started just jump
straight into that so I have the first
question is from Kirby and Kirby asks
from the perspective of someone with no
JavaScript framework experience at all
what is Aurilia and also can it make
development time for complex
applications faster for me then
handcrafting HTML and JavaScript well
let me that's two questions obviously so
the first part is what is really well
orillia is an application development
platform the goal of orillia is to make
it easier for you to build applications
that run across various platforms and it
really is built on top of web standards
so you can run these apps of course in
the browser you can also use things like
PhoneGap to run them on mobile phones
like android or iOS and to deploy them
through app stores and you can use them
in combination with technologies like n
wjs or electron in order to deploy them
as desktop applications on Windows OS X
and Linux and the experience of it
really is very much like what you might
know from something like ruby on rails
for example it's heavily inspired by
those ideas of convention over
configuration and so it is in fact
designed to make development of complex
applications much faster and easier and
not only that but to kind of help
shuffle you down a path of success so
that the code that you're writing is not
not only can you write it easier and
faster and build your app that way but
also the code is more maintainable it's
more testable it's more extensible and
it has a lot of positive characteristics
which are typically a bit more difficult
to achieve especially if you have
a time constraint involved in the
project which most projects in fact do
so that's what it really is about it's
really about building apps and it's
specifically the front end of your app
the user experience kind of part of your
application and it's designed to make it
easier by giving you a convention over
configuration approach similar to what
you might know from platforms like Ruby
on Rails and and it helps you kind of go
down that path of success and lets you
build both simple and complex
applications faster and easier than you
would normally be able to do otherwise
so the second question we have is from
Krishna Krishna has will I really have
UI components similar to angular UI
targeting mobile and desktop and it's so
when would it be available and the
answer to that is yes absolutely and in
fact there are three major component
libraries already available to use with
orillia so we have a UI bridge project
that is being done by a team within the
Orillia community and they are taking
all the popular component libraries and
basically making them into aurelia
components that are very nice and easy
to use and that work with our data
binding and templating systems natively
out of the box and so as of this moment
we have component libraries for
materialized CSS for kendo UI and for
syncfusion so there's already these
components available that you can use
today and we're also talking with
various other vendors about additional
component libraries and we've got some
things that were working on ourselves as
well so you'll see even more of this
coming in the future and we'll have some
announcements about that coming up soon
but we do have several major component
libraries you can use today and also
things being built by the community so
definitely check out the UI bridge
project for Aurilia a question number 3
is from raj and raj wants to know what
are my opinions of you jayus and
secondarily can view specifically view
components be painlessly integrated with
orillia so you know regarding my
UJS I mean obviously you know as the
leader of a different framework project
we you know kind of feel that what we've
built is uh is you know the best
solution out there and we we built it
according to things that we principles
that we believe in and things that we
like you know view GS I think it's a
great framework you know some
differences between it and Aurelia is
that Aurelia is much more unobtrusive so
you know with view Jas when you you have
to construct things using the special
view function and when you do that your
objects have to have particular
structure to them and you kind of have
to build them in a certain way whereas
with the really app you can just write
plain JavaScript classes there's no
notion of even having to create special
objects in any way I really it really
stays out of your way and let you use
plain vanilla JavaScript as much as
possible whether you're building whole
screens or the app or individual
components it's very unobtrusive and so
that's a big difference and we think
that's really important especially for
the lifetime of your code base to build
ability to migrate across versions and
different things like that to stay out
of your way and help you be rapid and
keep your code clean and testable
maintainable and I would say probably
Aurelia is keeps a really solid
separation of concerns probably better
than most other frameworks and stays
really close to standards as well so
those those are probably just a few
differences but you know that doesn't
mean that bjs is bad these are just
different values that we have and things
we've done differently can view spits
you know specifically view components
can they be integrated with Aurelia
absolutely one of the things that it
really does that I haven't seen any
other framework of library do is that it
implements what we call an extensible
resource pipeline which means that
everything that you use inside of a view
is kind of scope to that view and
there's this pipeline by which things
are imported into a view and plug into
the Aurelius view engine and so you can
actually write little adapters that plug
into our resource pipeline that teach it
how to understand different type
of code or different types of libraries
and to give them a of a native surface
or API inside of Aurilia and so for
example we've done this with react Brian
Smith one of our team members has built
a resource plugin that allows you to use
any react component natively inside of
inter alia view it actually transforms a
react component into a custom HTML
element you can use that inside of inter
alia view and even use data binding from
orillia into that component and in
internally under the hood it's all pure
react and whenever a really is data
binding system changes a property it
automatically tree triggers the react to
rerender that component in you know
internally and so that gives this
seamless integration where we can
literally drop any react component into
orillia with this plugin and use it
instantly with no changes to code either
in the on the Orillia side or on the
react side and we have some experiments
doing this with angular 1 as well
angular 1 you know it has there's about
a million ways to do the same thing in
angular 1 so there's a lot of edge cases
and it's not as clean but we have a
prototype up up from that but something
like view Jas is much cleaner than
angular 1 it's much more consistent in
its component model and so I haven't
seen anyone build a resource plugin for
Aurilia yet for view Jas but I'm fairly
confident that it could be done in that
it would actually be an elegant very
clean solution and I would imagine then
you could then take any view component
and seamlessly drop it into a really at
the same way that we have that
capability with react so it just takes
someone to to go ahead and actually do
that work and write that pipeline plugin
and it should it should work flawlessly
so Raj maybe that's you maybe you're
interested in that want to give that a
shot we'd love to have you collaborate
with us in that fashion and build
something like that out because I think
that would be cool and it really it has
the architecture that is designed for
exactly that scenario question number 4
comes from Peter and he says do I still
have a day job or I might fully focused
on Aurilia
well the answer is yes to know you know
our team we have a team of over 20
technologists that work on Aurilia and
all of us together operate in various
capacities in terms of our work on
Aurilia so for myself for a period of
time I was consulting while working on
Aurilia and then for a period of time I
was working on a really a full-time and
I'm actually starting a new job now so
for you know for the next period of time
I'll have a day job while working on
Aurilia also in various team members are
in similar boats some of them have
full-time day jobs and then they work on
really in the evening and over the
weekend some of them are consultants you
know where they have flexible schedules
but in there working and interleaving
they really work in between a various
consulting work and some of them have
even taken time off or work down a
really a full-time or dedicated a lot of
extensive time between projects to
Orillia and so not only myself of the
team it's kind of operating in different
capacities there but what's amazing is
that you know that our team is really
solid and very dedicated so regardless
of kind of the day jobs scenario that
each person has we all are well
connected and we all are collaborating
together and we've been able to be
amazingly productive you know it just as
an example I mean we you know built
released and released a one-point oh
really a you know faster than the
angular 2 team did and they had you know
say let's just say for example the same
number of people working on it full time
as their day job so I think it's
important to realize that if you have a
team that's experienced and that is
using the framework in their day job and
that is dedicated and that collaborates
and works well together that team can be
highly productive even more productive
than a team that is working full time on
the framework and the important thing
about open source i think to recognize
is that open source and the strength of
open source really is about that
collaboration it's about community
working together and with orillia we
have a fantastic community we're
approaching now just I think we're about
20
will shy of 500 contributors to the
project so aside from our our core team
you know there's you know 400 another
450 460 people that have contributed to
Orillia in all sorts of ways from bug
fixes to documentation to new feature
implementations all sorts of things and
so the group that's working on it is
quite massive very enthusiastic very
motivated highly skilled and passionate
and we're able to all work together and
we're all using orillia itself in
various capacities and our day jobs or
in a side business projects or different
things like that and that's an important
aspect of the team which is to say that
people who build the framework should
use it so sometimes when you have a
full-time day job where it's nothing but
writing a framework you actually end up
building the wrong thing because you
don't have that experience of having to
build apps that use your framework and
so you miss critical things or you're
over engineer or you go in the wrong
direction or you think the wrong thing
is important because you don't have that
personal experience building apps with
your own tool and so I think that our
team is you know in a great advantageous
position with everybody that is actually
building apps and working on the
framework at the same time so that's
just a little bit of the makeup and how
we work and how that relates to our
various day jobs you know and as time
changes these things change as well some
people come in and out of their day job
into full-time working on the framework
or in and out of consulting gigs or
different things like that so we shuffle
around it's very adaptive process that
we kind of have in order to maintain and
continue to advance orillia itself so
question 5 is also from somebody named
Peter but from a different Peter and
Peter has what do you think are the
biggest problems with orillia and are
there any scenarios where you wouldn't
recommend using it really oh so there
aren't there aren't a lot of huge
problems with aurelia itself it's only a
matter of you know there's more features
that we could add I mean if there are
problems it's it's mo
mostly the same problems that other
frameworks and libraries have which is
just the general churn in the ecosystem
and just the insanity of the JavaScript
world and the way tools are changing on
libraries are changing and nothing is
sort of stable really in in that part of
the industry right now and that's not
really a problem with really itself but
that is a challenge sort of in the
environment that it really it has to
live and we've done a lot of work to
mitigate that in terms of you know
aurelia itself not having any third
party dependencies and our command line
tooling not having any third party
dependencies so we can stabilize those
things and make them really solid so
it's really a matter of you know what
our new features that we could do that
we think the community would really like
and so that comes down to the second
part of this question which is what
wouldn't you recommend using orillia for
so the main thing I wouldn't recommend
using aurelia for right now is on any
site website so it's fine for apps
mobile apps and desktop apps and many
many many websites but if your website
requires a lot of search engine
optimization that's not the best
scenario for Aurilia right now because
of one feature that we haven't completed
yet which is our server side rendering
and that actually brings me to question
number six this was asked by two
different people Graham and Ben and they
said are there plans to include
server-side rendering for Aurilia and
the answer to that is yes absolutely in
fact before we even hit beta we had what
we called our platform abstraction layer
or PAL in place and that was a core
infrastructure piece with an orillia
that would allow us to swap out the
platform that really it was running on
so that it could run on the browser or
it could run and say no Jas instead and
that was part of an architectural
decision we made in order to enable
server-side rendering in the future and
we've been doing some other work and we
have some new team members that are
working with us on server side rendering
right now and so we've done a lot of
work to implement the platform
abstraction on top of nodejs without the
browser
being there and we've got additional
work that we're doing right now with
getting the binding and templating
engine running on the server and so in
the next few months I suspect you'll see
some really interesting announcements
from us regarding server-side rendering
but yes there are plans to include it
it's being worked on there's several
phases to that and development is in
progress right now and that will course
all a Peter's question about you know
are there any scenarios you wouldn't
recommend using it really afore because
that will solve the SEO issue and after
that you know you'll be able to use
really even for really SEO critical
applications and in fact you know one of
the team members that we have who is
working on server side rendering is
working on that technology for us in the
context of a couple of apps that he's
building that require that to work well
for SEO features that are critical for
the apps and so we're not just working
on this even in theory you know or in
the ivory tower or just designing this
outside of the context of relapse we
have core team members that have very
important critical scenarios where they
need this and the same people that are
building those apps that need this are
actually working on the feature itself
so and that helps us to be confident
that our server side implementation will
actually work for the broad majority of
our community and work well and solve
the real world problems so that is kind
of where we're at with that and that is
all the questions so I hope that gives
the community some feedback and some
ideas about kind of where we're at how
we do things what really is the
different component libraries and our
plans and things going forward and we
would love you to check out aurelia we'd
love you to join our community you know
be another another one of our
contributors get involved that's really
the power of open source and one of the
things that's so exciting about it is
really seeing all these people come
together to work together and help each
other prosper really because when your
business
dobson really and you contribute you
help somebody else to succeed as well
and so it's it's a very sort of cyclical
self-feeding positive characteristic of
that ecosystem where we can all kind of
continue to lift each other up and help
each other to succeed and accomplish
great things together so would love you
to join us not not just be a user of the
technology but really join us in
building it and helping each other to
succeed in the industry so thank you for
this time thank you to be my app for
giving me this opportunity to answer
some questions and thanks for the
community for submitting these and I'll
see you around thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
