issues with all societies being
concerned
Alstom has for years taken part in the
environmentally responsible approach of
developing comprehensive non polluting
solutions for the sector of rail
transport today rail operators mostly
use diesel trains to operate passenger
service on non-electrified networks now
Alstom offers a co2 emission free
regional train and a silent alternative
Caray dia island powered by a hydrogen
fuel cell it's only emission is steam of
water and condensed water while it
operates with the lowest noise levels
Alstom
is one of the first manufacturers
worldwide to develop a passenger train
based on such technology thanks to this
technology
Caray dia island enables sustainable
train operation while its performance
matches that of regular regional trains
Caray dia island is special for its
combination of different innovative
elements a clean energy conversion a
flexible energy storage capacity and
smart management of the traction power
and remaining energy the principle
relies on a fuel cell which produces the
electric power it's the core of the
system the fuel cell is supplied with
hydrogen on demand by combination of
hydrogen with oxygen from ambient air
inside the fuel cell produces the
electric energy needed to supply the
vehicle
the efficiency of the system also relies
on the storage of energy in
high-performance lithium-ion batteries
they accumulate the energy not
immediately used in order to later
supply it as needed this results in a
better efficiency of the fuel
consumption Alstom has also designed a
smart power and energy management system
in order to instantaneously deliver
power wherever needed in the Train
resulting in greater independence of the
vehicle the fuel cell is mainly used to
provide traction power during the
acceleration phases with extra support
from the batteries if any extra
acceleration boost is required at the
same time during the braking phases the
kinetic energy is generated by the
traction inverter system making the
train nearly self sufficient to power
its onboard equipment it's the secondary
energy production any surplus is
redirected to charge the batteries this
system has an additional consumption
advantage as it saves hydrogen during
coasting or low acceleration phases the
batteries supply the energy necessary to
power traction as well as onboard
systems the fuel cell remaining
constantly available to recharge the
batteries whenever necessary since the
electrical energy produced by fuel cell
or recovered from braking is
intelligently managed can radio island
matches the range and performance of
similar conventional regional trains but
with nearly no impact on the environment
to make the deployment of the Correia
islands as easy as possible for
operators Alstom provides a complete
offer consisting of the train itself
it's maintenance but also the whole
hydrogen infrastructure out of one hand
Alstom develops Co radio islands in
partnership with renowned German and
Canadian companies boasting many years
of experience in the fields of hydrogen
energy and batteries this synergy around
Caray dia Islands enables ask them to
introduce this technological
breakthrough in the near future as early
as 2018 the first Carrera Island would
be effectively in service in Germany
today with Katya island Alstom is taking
a considerable step towards the rail of
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
