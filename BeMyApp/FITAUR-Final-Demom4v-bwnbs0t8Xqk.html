I'm going to use what fits our is how it
works and how it's going to make some
money before I do that like to tell you
how this piece came into being so my
friend and I we like to work out
together we push each other make sure
the fish we can be but we can't always
be at the same place the same time so we
came up with this idea using our mobile
phones to send challenges to each other
no matter where we are so fatar uses
game dynamics to make fitness fun it
uses your mobile devices smart sensors
to record and capture all of the motions
exercises that you perform and then post
them and make sure you've done correctly
so you can't cheat the system and so as
you're working out if your avatar
increases its capabilities and it looks
stronger so you can see that you're
getting better and if you're not being
exercised it will remind you and you can
see your avatar of shrinking so it after
peace so I like to invite broke out here
to demonstrate how it works is going to
select the pushup workout and he's going
to hit it
all right go Brooke it got in cheating
our initial which will look at different
vertical self or different segments of
music which we can benefit and we found
that the Rostov members may be the best
our best bet will know what the cost it
is it's a international brand for
people's which we work out together this
kind of open source community for
people's actually exercise together it's
been quite successful over the last few
years there are over a billion members
of why they're one of the three thousand
club would actually practice that and we
think this is great but not onions
because first of all their fans ask
about the workout so they pay a lot of
money every month to actually be members
of the club secondly they're very
competitively and we think that that's
preventing is going to introduce this
petal dynamic so it actually going to
make one club member challenge another
club member to download the app and
actually start tongues in each other so
just to give you a taste of how much
money actually made works we actually
came out with very little model so let's
say adoption is twenty percent which is
I think low for
those optimist not spiritually across
the numbers of arms so and it actually
gets better ocwen six million users
let's say only twenty percent will do
in-app purchases and that's assume that
they going to be ten to fifteen dollars
a year for being that purchase you know
pay a dollar for a workout routine here
big a dollar for you know a challenge or
an award there it actually gets us about
four million you ready however this is
not we don't want to start on just
crossing rivers I mean the opportunity's
huge from which old level buckles way
complete thinking about reaching 80
million users like you ask people make
sure you can work out into acetate would
like more but Greg over there are
different verticals like weight loss
monitoring for you know physical therapy
or conditioning so and our vision which
we have this system that allows is not
to just utilize those challenges but
also create others we wanted to come
youtube or challenges exist and of
course which we want to make it sticky
so age that have this avatar you keep
developing the other dark you can use it
different games you can actually provide
about it it's going to become your
second
persol so so these are geniuses John
helped to design everything Josh
actually if our sensor that currently
knows how to you you know do all these
creepy things which I atomic devices but
during actually helped us to integrate
with the facebook and he's got you know
all the knowledge about how to make it
social and meaning helped us with all
the music and all this okay we use them
a push
the app is awesome design
whiteout it really second check it out
very cool so just find a word like in
play design design app good demo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
