am the head of engineering at telltale
games and I've been there about five
years mostly doing you know various
engineering and working on the engine
and automation and things like that so
I'm here to talk to you guys about
multi-platform asset kind of preparation
automation and how exciting that can be
when you're like telltale and you make
games that run on a lot of platforms
this is a huge part of your life so I'm
going to kind of tell you what we do a
telltale and you can admire my wonderful
clipart that I made myself okay mm-hmm
so let me start a little bit about
telltale in case you guys aren't
familiar with what we do so telltale
makes games like this this is a walking
dead game we made a little while ago
basically we make episodic narrative
content so that means we're going to
make a game that's about two hours long
that people are going to you know get
five of these serialized over the course
of a month six weeks something like that
and in addition to that we try to run on
every platform we possibly can so you
know we're basically going to run
anywhere that art the game is going to
run and as opposed do kind of a
companion app or anything we generally
try to sell the exact same content on
every single platform so you know being
able to do that kind of presents a lot
of challenges in terms of build and
automation you know this is basically
what we try to do we humans we make our
wonderful games and then we get them to
mobiles desktops and really fancy
consoles the actual numbers of what that
means for a typical year in telltale we
are generally going to try to do about
three seasons that have five episodes
run them on eight platforms and
typically you have 13 skews that use for
that between European versions steam we
sell it through our own site is
basically what we're going to be
building every year this generally with
a bunch of math equates to about a
hundred and eighty shipped builds a year
that we actually submit to partners at
least 120 different asset packages for
these and generally at least 9,000
builds or
to be done every single year and it's
this is probably on the low end of the
number this is not counting any of the
patches and any other kind of things you
don't expect that comes up during the
year it's probably well over this number
and to support this you know we
typically have about to build engineers
and recently we've been building out
producers dedicated to it and things
like that but in general most of the
heavy lifting for this we rely on our
technology so obviously this is really
challenging to do some of the big things
that you're going to find when you're
trying to hit the same content running
on every single platform is you know
every platform is going to have a unique
resolution and when you're trying to get
you know a certain style or look across
what you're really talking about is what
is the pixel density on over those
platforms if you've got a 640 you know
you know pixel tall screen you know
that's not going to need the same
content that you're going to run on a 4k
screen you know depending on if the
characters face is you know distance
from the camera you know you're only
going to see eight pixels on that face
depending on it and you know therefore
it's not going to need the same texture
measures resolution and things like that
also obviously all of the different
platforms between ps4 and low end
android and iOS devices have
substantially different GPU and cpu
capabilities and many times they are
optimized in very different ways that
you know on some cup platforms like
mobile you know i owe is really easy
because it got fast SSDs but on you know
something with really high-end GPU you
know i owe is a challenge because you're
pulling it off of essentially a you know
5400 RPM desk another important thing to
optimize when you're going across so
many platforms and to not kind of forget
about is your game download footprint if
you look at the quality of devices
versus how much actual hard drive space
they go up those curves do not always go
at the same rate so this means that you
know certainly a lot of the mobile
phones are capable of packing in really
really high-end textures that are going
to look really awesome and run great but
you really don't want users downloading
you know a terabyte every episode if
you're going to have five episodes
because you really easily bro through
five terabytes on their phone and you
know my phone has about
480 Meg's free at this moment so I
wouldn't be able to play in my games
additionally with mobile obviously as a
lot of people are experienced lots of
different hardware targets and with the
exact same build is usually what you
have to do on mobile unlike some of the
others when you're going you know across
the different console generations you
don't have to worry about this but
certainly with mobile you're going to
have to the other challenge that we have
when we're trying to deal with this is
just the sheer scale of it you know we
have about 20,000 assets go into every
single episode of a telltale Game which
really means we're building about 180
million assets are going to be built by
our server farm every single year and
these are really conservative numbers
from from our estimates episodes could
you know easily have a little bit more
depending on the complexity of it so I
think I don't know how many of you have
ever experienced this with a common
method I used a lot of times was
basically hand reduced and alter content
/ platform this is something that i
think you know if you've got a lot of
effort and you can handcraft something
for a playstation or for a pc you're
gonna it's going to be a common way to
go about it however obviously this is
really difficult when you're trying to
get identical experiences across on
every single thing if you were saying
you want to have you know a really
particular experience on an episode you
know and you have a director that's
really passionate about that you know
he's going to care a lot about having
you know the trees in the background
that are shaking in a certain way you
know trying to get trying to kind of
from a technical perspective or you know
arbitrarily reduce things to make the
platform run better really hurts your
ability to make you know content that's
going to feel a certain way or look a
certain way or things like that so it
never is going to be work obviously it's
very time intensive for art that's the
easy one you're going to always spend a
lot of time that's kind of the Prophet
part of the fun and profit if you can
get automation to handle this you're
obviously going to spend less time for
your artists having to spend
handcrafting custom assets it doesn't
scale well if you are going to rely on
solutions that require humans to
interact with things you'll really
quickly figure out when you have to do
more content that it's never going to
scale appropriately for what you're
trying to do humans are terrible at
scaling we just we can't hire enough
people and you got to manage them and
it's
it's all bad so with machines super easy
to scale another really one that I think
is is worth mentioning just because this
is something that I've experienced quite
a bit when we do when we are unable to
actually automatically get something to
run and you have to actually go back to
art and say can we can we change a scene
can we reduce something can we take out
these background characters that are too
expensive that that system is
exceedingly difficult to judge if you're
actually doing something that's going to
be effective you know when you look at
GPU profiling or CPU profiling or you
know when you're trying to estimate what
the problem is often times that is very
tough to then have the conversation with
art about what they can reduce in an
intelligent way for the game and then
you have to get the art done re-export
it get it through your game get it plays
remake the builds test that out on
device all of that is going to take time
and you might have during that time
completely shifted where the thing that
was slowing you down is so it's again
just very difficult to do oops I go back
there we go so what does telltale do
about it I hope we get it fixed
typically but we don't really have any
magic build organization software
Jenkins buildbot batch and bamboo
teamcity all of this is kind of
irrelevant to what I'm talking about
these are great pieces of software we
use several of these and I definitely if
you're going to have a lot of automation
you need something to control it scale
across multiple machines but in general
I don't think these are the interesting
parts of what kind of gets you the power
for running on multiple platforms really
the most important thing is you just
need to pick something that you're build
engineers know how to use because
they're going to be debugging it so when
it goes wrong these are the people
you're going to need so you know forcing
one of those down to get automation is
not going to help you just pick the
thing that you guys are going to
actually be able to use like I said this
is not where your time is going to be
spent is on off-the-shelf software
though you do need off-the-shelf
software or you need to build your own
because you're going to need to get
vision into when your automation breaks
the real thing that you know that we do
and that I think is important for this
effort is asset defe defe definitions
and preparation so making sure
that you know what you're capable of
adjusting for every asset and making
sure you can prepare it I'll dig into a
little bit more about how we do that to
solve this problem so the very first
thing we do is we have a pretty complex
system for specifying what are things we
can tune for every asset type so really
obvious ones are obviously like if you
have a texture you can reduce its size
that's a parameter you can reduce by 50%
you can reduce it within parameters to
say go no less than 256 x 256 you can
say reduce it with a particular
algorithm there's there's parameters you
can do to do that there's different
audio compression levels you can do
there's software you can do to reduce
polygons sighs there's you know level of
detail soft there's a bunch of different
things you can do to kind of categorize
how your assets want to go and so this
is something that for every asset type
on our engine we have a series of tools
hooked up and parameters that feed those
tools that tell us kind of what we're
capable of doing and that's that's an
important obviously an important
component the second part around that it
turns out to be even more complicated is
kind of organization and / / priority
around all of those different parameters
so this is kind of for an asset like a
face you want it to be a really high
resolution asset you have assets that
are you know background characters you
might want them to be really low end
assets kind of whatever it is you're
going to need ways to prioritize it
you're going to do ways for people to
alter it you're going to need ways to
categorize it when you're talking about
20,000 assets this organization gets
pretty intense and you know it's going
to change episode episode game to game
sometimes depending on you know your art
style is all very different for instance
you know the wolf among us game we did
substantially different way you're going
to reduce or texture in that then you
would in you know the game of thrones or
the borderlands series because of just
you know the art style compresses in
different ways and then the last piece
that we that we have in this mix in
addition to organizing it and then
throwing it into you know the actual
parameters they do the work
is the tuning tools that humans do to
interact on this process so at some
level you could say you know all of my
textures for this game get cut in fifty
percent and then you're going to send it
to QA and they're going to have it
they're going to play through it they're
going to be like half this game looks
bad here's the textures that don't look
good here's like you're going to have
stuff that isn't working and you can
generate list of it you can go through
it but that's going to waste a lot of
time and you're gonna have a lot of
people that don't spend their time you
know looking for the really good art
trying to make the decisions on that so
this is where the part that I think is
important is you need to have tools up
front while you're deciding what to do
that allow you ideally dynamically to
decide where assets are going to go and
what they're going to look like on the
target device so we can have tools that
live in our engine as the content
creators be doing anything can for
instance scroll wheel down through you
know resolution sizes can automatically
you know compress the voice on the fly
to determine what's going to sound like
when you go out so that when we you know
we can take all of this kind of
wonderful automation and technology that
keeps to compress things and gets it
down but without some ability to really
effectively and quickly choose what you
do and don't want to tag it can it'll
get out of control really easily and for
us you know because it is a really an
artistic thing the best tool you can
have is something that is in in in your
engine and you know you're kind of just
dragging and clicking and touching
objects in there to to tag them and so
that's the last piece of the tech that
we use to kind of get this done also
just as an aside obviously when you're
talking huge about the assets heavy use
of cashing those assets so that there's
a giant system to make sure that if you
have a certain asset that hasn't been
touched out a certain size that it gets
it gets compressed that at a certain
level this came up for us when we
integrated simply gone last year which
was something we did and within about a
week and a half of integrating it they
gave us a call and they asked us if
something was broken because in the week
or two that we have been using it I
think we had used it a thousand times
more than they'd ever had it accessed
because we just started running it on
every single asset and the caching was a
little broken it was just constantly
running overnight on all of our games
and like literally millions of calls to
their system to get it done
so really important that you're not
doing that unless you want to burn out
your computers and CPUs and everything
building these assets all over plus with
this many assets and this many parameter
some of these take some time so
obviously you don't want to have bills
taking hours you know ideally depending
on how fast your team's work the bilge
can be you know 10 15 minutes if if
you've if you're just changing what's
needed that can get very complicated
though of course with dependent assets
so like I touch a scene that has it has
a texture and so you need systems in
there to do that this is basically what
this looks like for us is that we have
basically people that go in and decide
kind of what the texture tuning is going
to look like you know basically make
specifications off of the default
parameters for all the different asset
types and it's really not a lot of
people it's maybe one person to
depending on the timing of the project
who's going to kind of make those
decisions somebody kind of you can get
people that are combo'd of good with
quality assurance and art that's good
people to tune we have obviously a bunch
of humans making game of thrones and
putting the game data and getting it in
there and every night that's going to go
into our big server farm that's I think
about 16 machines that just takes all
this data and just processes it every
night it's not particularly super
intelligent server farm shared across
multiple machines or anything like that
it's if you've done caching correctly
and your tools aren't you know crazy
it's not like baking out lighting or
anything it takes less time than that so
we're we're typically able to to just do
it on single machines and it works fine
anyway that gets us out built so um this
may sound really interesting to you guys
I don't know so you know where could you
start because obviously there's a lot of
time like this system has been in place
for probably eight years in some respect
and I've worked on it a lot in the last
five years and you know it takes a lot
of time to get going and if you're like
us build is also a really crazy hectic
you're always getting stuff out so you
don't usually have as much time to
dedicate toward future automation as you
would to the problems at hand so any
amount you do of this helps really like
even if all you're doing is have a way
to visualize you know some of your
assets and be able to play the game on
the different platforms
front and know what they're going to
look like that's going to make huge
benefits because the amount of time you
know people spend custom crafting it is
its extensive so it's worth dedicating
the time to do oops visually and
dynamically adjusting parameters would
be the thing I would say is really good
to start with especially because most
engines already have this you're already
looking at assets you're already you
know looking at them so just what you
really want to do is look at them as
they're eventually going to be when
optimized for a platform one note 2 i'd
say is that the organ a shim plea with
this like we don't use something crazy
complicated we just have you know flat
file system and star underscore facial
character foo underscore star a.m. and
then be like okay great all of those
assets get processed in this way and
that's that's you know it's not super
elegant there's a cool visual tool that
drags and drop things but you know as
long as you've got some tools to look at
it it's pretty easy for people to do
their so you know we had systems in the
past where I've looked on them where you
know you try to solve too much up front
and this is a good area not to do that
because because i think it you'll have
to debug it later the other thing I
would say is that if you want to try to
do it make sure you're not spending your
time and spending you know the the weeks
it takes to tune something to tune and
impact something that's not going to
impact your games you know for us every
game is a little different but you know
we didn't do you know mesh tuning for a
long time because that was never an
impact on the on the on the game like
you want to look at your bottlenecks and
be like oh yeah this is where all the
game is spending time let me give myself
an ability to tune that or another way
to think about it is this is the area
people are usually going over budget
we're usually you know going you know
it's hard to predict how many effects
are going to go into a game because they
could be heavier light so that would
mean that's a really good place you
should start by giving yourself as much
leeway as you can to tune that on the
back side if you know that's an area
that you're going to have a lot of
you're going to have problems with you
know you don't need to spend your time
tuning stuff that isn't going to be is
it going to make a big difference on the
target result or
something that's going to be consistent
no matter what so it's not something
you're going to ever have an effect on
you know that's that's kind of the the
main thing I mean many of them will
affect its complex so you have to work
with engineering on it when you have
less animations it might take less
memory let's CPU hit there does get to
be each thing you decide to alter can
can change in big ways so usually get a
bunch of wins by doing a few things so I
wanted to run through one quick example
because i think it's it'll show you guys
what i mean by once you've got kind of
the baseline of this established that it
isn't really that hard to extend it and
make really big important impacts to
your studio if you if you are if you can
commit to this and really make it so you
can go to new platforms much easier and
you can and it's not a big mission to
get to you know to add another set of
you know mobile devices that you didn't
previously support well for with just a
couple of weeks of engineering and some
automation could make a huge difference
in selling to those phones or to you
know hitting the ps3 from the ps4
whatever whatever it is that you want to
be doing so when we did Game of Thrones
which this is a picture of it was
definitely the highest geometry game
that we had done before you know most of
the the scenes like this one was
particularly complex in the amount of
just geo going on and so the cost of
that ended up being much higher than we
were kind of expecting that was not
something that you know just as the
episodes come together we realized that
you know you're going to have crowds
you're going to have fights you're going
to have areas that just need a lot of
geometry in them in order to be
effective the intro scene in particular
running through the you know the the
wedding was just a lot more than we done
so when we didn't have a lot of tools to
alter that you know you can you can
reduce all of the texture costs
associated with these things and make it
a little blurrier or you can reduce the
animations a little but none of that is
going to impact if there's just too much
geo to draw so one thing we did was we
integrated simplygon to the pipeline
like I'd mentioned earlier to tune
existing asset categories for our
current games you know we did this over
about a two-week period it was kind of
shockingly quick all we really had to
you to get that working was you know
they have a system if you guys haven't
used it where you can kind of throw a
mesh at it and it will try to do its
best chance to reduce it to a mesh that
looks just about like that with us
within a certain error percentage and
you can specify the error percentage and
you can tag areas you don't want reduced
as much and things like that so
basically you know we hook that up to
our system where again we already had
our mesh format we already had the
tuning system doing some alteration work
to get it into the final mesh format and
so we just kind of hooked that into the
middle so we would have a new tuning
parameter that was you know error
percentage or we just kind of called it
there's like a magic number for it and
basically just kind of hook that into it
so that our internal mesh format before
going into getting package for the
engine would run through this you know
simplygon process and simplygon
something you can use on the art side as
well but we wanted to do it in an
automatic way so that nobody had to kind
of think about what it looked like the
real key of course was we already had
existing tuning tools that allowed us to
go through and tag you know textures as
you know we don't want this texture to
be at this quality with this textures of
face you know we already had a bunch of
stuff that determined that characters
need to look better than you know the
ground and things like that so we hook
those same things up to say that you
know if your texture is touching a mesh
you know Polly the edges that's touching
should be higher quality because that
textures are really high quality and so
is a way that really over just a couple
of weeks before the project shipped we
were able to integrate this into our
system apply the automatic tuning and
really you know probably save you know
five to ten percent of our frame back
that we were spending on GPU it
basically pushed the bottleneck out of
there without having very much visual
impact on the game because we can apply
it holistically and then go through and
actually you know tune it to what it
should be um drink there we go so in
this scene in particular you know after
it's been tuned you know it it had
definitely things where you know these
should be more curved and there's some
stuff like that but you know stuff like
the characters and his edges and things
like that can still maintain at the
higher quality because characters could
be tuned to be high it could be tagged
to be higher
and and the rest of it could could be
less so some future work that we have in
this area so definitely the part of this
that that I've like personally been
spending a lot of time working on and I
think is really interesting is that you
know tuning parameters the area where we
have humans go through and kind of
decide what looks right what doesn't
look right I still believe we could
probably get something fairly automated
to do that at least in telltale games I
think that's very possible and probably
in a lot of games you guys work on it is
telltale games are very you know camera
predictable like we know most of the
time except for free walks where the
player is going to be at all times how
far a background is going to be for you
this is all things that we know so
developing ways that can automatically
play through the game and determine that
you know certain textures are only going
to ever be between 15 and 40 units from
the camera at any given time and then be
able to take that and then calculate
well that means on a target output
device that's 480p you can calculate
that to hit those two it should never
get smaller than 128 528 and try to most
aggressively do that based on what the
texture is so it's not something we have
right now but it's something where we're
kind of piecing bits of that together to
basically give a first hint toward the
tuning to try to match as close as it
can to the actual target platform and I
think that's going to open up a world of
really fun things for us because our
games are very because they can you know
you can play through them know all the
different paths that will be able to
make a lot of really fun decisions on
hand crafting the assets for certain
platforms based on our knowledge of kind
of nightly running through the game over
and over again you can imagine having
non-deterministic you know animation
compression that you know the animation
compression looks really bad if you
looked at it close up but in reality the
cameras such the only see the back half
or you only see part of it and so the
compression can take that into
consideration when it's compressing it
and not compress the areas that people
are going to see and I think that's
something we're really close to doing if
I can kind of get the support and kind
of build it I want to you know we have a
lot of data mining platforms we use for
our current games out in the wild where
we know how users are making choices and
we aggregate those and there's kind of a
whole field that that died
into this I'm really kind of enamored
that we could use this for build
engineering so that while QA is playing
we can automatically be detecting the
scenes that are having the low frame
rates what's on scene when that is there
and be able to drive those toward where
we need to look at more aggressively
sooner because we know those things are
happening I mean all of this is kind of
feeding that like the development team
is off building in our tools and we have
a whole separate set of systems that
kind of nightly are trying to adapt the
actual output content to what they're
building on the fly and I think this is
the way we could pretty easily do some
of that ultimately one of the things
about this as I mentioned is giving
greater latitude for artists that you
know our tools if we can do all this
stuff really effectively what this means
is I can tell them just make the game in
this beautiful tool make it in the way
you love it make it what you think is
awesome and we will make sure that
nobody notices the difference between
that and something else based on the
capabilities we have on the platform and
they can kind of be freer to build
better assets bigger assets make it look
really nice and not have to worry about
what it's going to look like on this
PlayStation and things like a are you
know or whatever console what it's going
to look like they can just make
something awesome and and that's a lot
of where all of our technology a
telltale resolves around that but in
particular this is one area where I
think it's it's been pretty effective
I'd like it also extended to new systems
you know a fax is one that I think we
could use it on so kind of sum up here
because I think I'm running out a
multi-platform episode development is
hard takes a lot of time a lot of builds
lots of fun stuff going on there takes a
real deep dive into some of the tuning
and automation but it can make a huge
impact if you're willing to take that
dive I think it really can save just an
incredible amount of time and really
allow you to reduce the all-important
time between content is done and your
shipping can be less and less if you if
you can get this to be automated a good
system can start small and expand as
we've done in the past we've expended a
lot over the time and also there's just
lots more to do we have lots more stuff
so cool I think that's my presentation
is it time for questions or are we well
cool so we're starting to build our game
on PC and we're not sure what platforms
will be going to what are like the
absolute minimum steps that we need to
be careful of if you want
building these kind of systems what's
the baseline um I would say if you're if
you're you're unsure if you want to go
there eventually but you want to have
your assets you know kind of ready as
you can you know I think I think like I
said make sure that you're going to be
able to preview them in those
resolutions at the very least like
that's like the easy really start thing
right like a PC already has variable
resolutions so like in our tools we have
a little drop-down that says make this
look like an Xbox make this look like a
ps3 and all it does is turn on the right
level of rendering for that platform
which might be turning off some after
effects or some other features sets the
resolution to be like that even that
small step allows you in a very kind of
a way to to start looking at what it's
going to be like and then you can start
integrating other parts of that in and
being like oh ok now i want to start
preparing assets for what they're going
to be on that platform in an automatic
way and then and then look at those
there guys thought about like we are
like doing games who isn't thinking
about PR PR is awesome yeah I have no
idea VR is super cool though I
personally like it it seems neat um
possibly I mean it depends on the target
platform I think that's like mobile
where there isn't one platform so I
think as platforms get established you
know we add new platforms a lot we added
ps4 and xbox one last year that was a
pretty easy switch for us because it was
just a higher-end version of some of the
stuff we've done already but you know as
we get new platforms you know they all
drop in pretty easily there are new
bucket of platforms and you set a tuning
parameters and you and you kind of set
it up and go so if there's a VR platform
that exists and that's something where
that we do then then it'll just be
another platform to drop in so version
control I've used many things over the
years you know we use mercurial for
assets we use plastic for raw assets we
use I've used perforce in certain areas
like I think it's you know kind of like
the build bond and that stuff it's all
kind of as long as nothing's broken and
it's fast it's somewhat irrelevant to
the to the hard stuff like it you know
it should be stable it should be fast it
should be something your people know how
to use
it's probably the most important but
most the time that gets integrated into
our tools anyway so people are kind of
working in the tools so you know I think
those all just you know whatever
whatever works for you cool cool well
thank you guys was fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
