and on various sources but after
the day I go back home and I wonder wait
but I want to keep this my own
collection can but it's a huge hassle if
you know all my friends can you guys
post his facebook and you know it to me
just so I had on one place the photo
booth photo glue it allows you to posted
at the very moment peaceful is being
taken on to a digital collage on that uh
turn up so it's being stored right there
saving the house on a minute later but
or focusing on more photo booty is the
social aspect because let's say I
started the evening fun app for the top
right was the team and I'm working hard
and Saturday you can book you my app but
then people in the city were considering
oh so someone was out at the bar someone
was having a birthday sometimes we had a
concert but then I get to see the whole
collective social stitching so what
photo glue is its photo blue is a social
photo collage application allowing you
to capture all those key moments but
with your friends in the rest of the
community so what Colonel apps are out
there right now an Android platform
there are quite a handful photo Plaza
out there but the big picture is that
these apps are integrated social
capabilities for all these apps i
modified photo that they all value to
make your own personal photo collages
out of your albums and dance into your
friends hook photo glue allows you to
share with your friends right at the
first point so that all out
being much more sociable so we kind of
our launch our initial out next month
and I focusing on driving loser music
row that has the actual engagement a
scope you're basically important social
apps and then the business model aspect
adenosine billion features where i can
buy additional claude rains in the
closet layouts as well as different
plush types so plush types game let me
create the collage waterwheel or i could
create the one night but everyone else
ads that so it goes not in a large motor
wheel i can export to my facebook ravine
or Twitter etc so i mean these these are
a lot of a threatening photo are very
important social a stick and put the
glue so i'm going next to apple pie it's
like a click on that and then host and
then like I to open up my existing
library horse on the floor at the
current point so I want to put on remain
from the Grand Canyon added there so
let's see I want to combine us with
other fun activities or other people on
the team as well so maybe i'll click
right here
it's loaded seemed so now maybe Jessica
so how'd it go with their frame and so I
can also be taking this on my photo as
well maybe what I like one who wants to
see the same some time but we got
another one but the basic structure
hierarchy of how the app works now i'm
looking i create my album shirt and they
go to populate on the recent photo photo
collages development then I also see my
my friends to live as well as most
popular but then if I want to share it I
got to share it to Facebook and Twitter
and other various social media items as
well to share my actual creation to the
export they are saving all that time of
having to ask my friends as well and
also we have the standard enough you
could like the photo but we also like
the individual
and then we're getting another feature
for we're allowed to vote on these photo
individually so then that kind of adds
the whole group collage ranking
methodology where the best photo gets
the biggest amount of space and it's fun
to see below the best photo I'm bringing
that user engagement of the community we
could go to this hyperlink and try to
hack off 37 snap your own photos so
that's motor loop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
