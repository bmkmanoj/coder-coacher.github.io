to be using an LED matrix these matrix
are used to display images captured by
the webcam behind the sweater to display
the illusion of invisible or at least
some adaptive camouflage so let's get
started we are now going to use 38 x 3 2
matrices to form one big 24 x 3 2 matrix
the wiring is very easy the matrix are
connected via terminal strips red on red
and black on black for communication
we're going to use the white wire on the
other white wire the connection to the
Arduino is very easy as well the
information the end windows pin number
600 here on the ground we do the same
with the power this one on the 5 volt
output with the Arduino and this one is
on the ground now we're going to have a
look at an example code to check if our
matrix works we're going to use the
library in neo dash matrix and neo dash
pixels we create a new dash matrix
object with the right dimensions 32 x 24
and the pin value that we indicated
above here the number is 6 a setup
function in which we do the matrix begin
it creates a matrix here we use a very
simple code we are going to set your
random color to each pixel of the matrix
now we're going to show the matrix we
put a small time laughs so it's visible
here we launch this code here it is it's
going to send you'll see it's a really
interesting code it gives some random
colors to each of the pixels it should
start to blink
it works you should now see a matrix
lighting up in several colors now we'll
check that everything works by uploading
a test code which should display short
animation to test all the LEDs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
