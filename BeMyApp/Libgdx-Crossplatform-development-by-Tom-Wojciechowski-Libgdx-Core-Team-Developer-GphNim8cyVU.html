we're on github if you can't read this
that's 300,000 contributors no I lie we
are an open source project and we're
very active I tend to ignore the issues
and pull requests that come in and
delegate that off to other people but
here's some statistics just statistics
oh great those bars go all the way to
the end I don't know if you've heard of
outbrain's but basically they're a
statistics website that kind of trawl
through google play and look at what
kind of engines and frameworks go into
the apps so take it with a pinch of salt
but these are market share for the
google play store we're trumped by unity
3d and cocos2dx anyone use cocos2dx do
not I joke so we're a relatively mature
project to PI up despite our developers
we're at 1.7 point zero at the moment
snapchats built built on every commit so
if you have an issue when we solve it
put yourself on the snapshots and you'll
get the very latest and best and you're
free to focus steal all our code don't
do that and then push back we really
love people to contribute to the project
so an overview of libgdx we are a game
development framework most of the
framework is written in Java but we have
a lot of C and C++ components for the
performance attentive parts so things
like aha bullet wrapper and our and
box2d and we've got a lot of native
libraries as well for each of the
individual platforms and we have some
JavaScript or God the web back end so we
are a framework rather than an engine so
a lot of people have their own
definitions of what a framework is but
how we perceive it is that a framework
should try and do everything for you it
shouldn't force design concepts on you
on patterns you have the foundations you
can build on that and just go to town
with it so bear in mind it's not going
to do everything for you you have to do
a little bit of work saying that as well
come on to in a second we have API
layers and at the highest level you can
basically build a tiny engine
of it so it's very fast the development
and prototyping lots of people use it
for game Jones because of that you can
use any JVM language that you want and
there are some Cabot's for that it's
super fast especially on Android and we
have a multi-layered API which is
ranging and difficulty and complexity so
you can go in at whatever level you feel
comfortable you can target multiple
platforms with a single code base we did
that before it was cool everyone seems
to be doing that nowadays and we have an
extensive community of developers and
the form is very active not just for
libgdx specific problems you got any
game design questions there's always
people out there to help you so what
platforms do we support Windows Mac OS
Linux oh ho you can only see a little
bit of them Android iOS and half of the
web so if you have like a blackberry
device or Windows Phone does anyone have
a Windows Phone one person has a windows
phone that's about right all right
that's Windows Phone view you can use
the web the web port for for those and
it works pretty well depending on how
complex your app is so people people
tend to code with libgdx with java java
is great who would Java developers here
pretty each one person ok ah are there
any like hipsters out here who uses like
closure or something weird scholar
Python no one Python that's surprising
well you can use any JVM language z1 so
if you are hips that you'll be ok as
long as it has proper Java
interpretability and you'll be great
your lose support of HTML because of how
we compile for the web more on that in a
little bit so here's an example of some
API usage with Python and with boring
Java so it's very similar so when you're
looking at other source code you can
just copy examples and the sin taxes is
an identical so the development
environment are set the tool generates
yeah set up tool generates gradable
scripts if you're not familiar with
Gradle as you aren't jobs of others
basically binds the project together
with all dependencies and fancy tasks
and things like that but it allows you
to use any ID that one so IntelliJ IDEA
eclipse NetBeans or if you really want
you can go to the command line and use
Emacs or vim or whatever hardcore tool
use so the standard development
environment is that you would test your
game or your app on the desktop platform
it's faster to launch then after upload
apks or I PA sto to your phones and you
get to use all the fancy features of the
JVM like hot swapping if you want to
fine-tune things in your game and then
you can just deploy to all the platforms
with it an easy to ask so has anyone
used Java before ok a few people so
Gradle is a build tool it's a dependency
management tool and it basically handles
your projects for you maven is very
similar and ivy although great does the
best it's open source you can use it to
build your libgdx problem project you
can use in the background or you don't
have to use it at all we don't force
that on you it's just the default way to
generate a project if you use Gradle it
makes it easy to keep up with the latest
release of the droid x we always making
changes always pulling in new features
so it is really good to keep up to date
and then you'll avoid API breakages
later on people always come to the forum
with a weird problem and we ask them ok
what version of libgdx you running and
it'll be one from like three years ago
because they're too lazy to update the
jars but now we have this nice thing so
you just put in a new number in the
build script and away you go so one of
the really cool things about Gradle is
that you can extend the script that we
generate for you to do tasks that really
I hate doing I don't know if anyone else
hates doing this but for example if
you're deploying to multiple app stores
so if you've got the Amazon Store or
Google Play
I hate their web interfaces so much when
you upload an apk you have to go to
every single site make sure the version
things right push it like manually I'm
too lazy for that so I write script that
will use their API automatically uploads
every single targeted store that you
want it really is the lazy way out so
same goes for descriptions and assets on
multiple app store pages and if you want
you can push your project on to
continuous integration so you can build
it live with commits so one thing that i
did with a game jam was that every
commit that I'd push it with all the
live HTML version so anyone that was
lame enough to follow my development
could see a live version of the game as
I was doing it broken or not so how do
we too how do we actually target all
these different platforms so on Android
we get a stock Android has something
interesting about that we use native
libraries for GL es bindings it's GLS 2
point 0 under the hood for the desktop
platform we use the lightweight java
game library or on 2.9 point2 i think at
the moment and that helps to support
windows linux and mac OS we use openjdk
on linux and that's opengl 2.0 and 3.0
under the hood three-point actors in
development which is going to support
Vulcan so that's going to be exciting on
iOS we the project called robo vm has
anyone heard of robo vm nice so roba vin
is really awesome basically it compiles
java bytecode to native arm and x86 code
so these guys actually magicians they
can compile a small vm based on android
with your with your package and it's
still in like 10 megabit when you when
you push it to the store for the web we
use the google web toolkit and that
compiles java source code to javascript
ja reflection isn't supported on google
web toolkit so we've actually got a
rapper in libgdx to help you use to help
you target and use reflection without
breaking the web and we also have a
headless back end which is really boring
it's just a standard Java so if you want
to push it if you want to perhaps have a
server-side component to app people use
headless or you can just run your own
java java applications so the library
can be roughly split into API levels
we've got low level mid level and high
level these range in different
complexities and and the features really
so at the low level we have all my
graphics interfaces so opengl es 2.0 in
and 3-point are there we've got all in
for handling so keyboard mouse touch
accelerometer gyroscope all those lovely
mobile things we handle all audio
reading and writing and decoding and
encoding thank most the time it's open a
all implementations but on Android we
have Android pools as anyone that had
like a flawless go with Android Audio
because it is terrible I don't know what
they're doing with that we've got
networking TCP and HTTP and also HTTPS
silently we have all file file i/o
reading and writing to your device and
we also handle the life cycle so on
Android when your device gives in to
pause when it gets destroyed or when
it's resumed there are certain contacts
that need to be reinitialized and that's
handled for you and our reflection
wrapper so the next layer we have the
mid level so the mid-level is built on
top of the low level most people use
libgdx at this level it has most of the
useful features people tend to use so we
have G ellipse abstractions like mesh
shaders texture sprites all handy
objects that are easy to manipulate and
handle we have matching of sprites and
polygons so this is one things that
helps keep libgdx re really fast and it
saves you lots of GPU instructions we
have sport for bitmap fonts and texture
Alice's no more texture swapping Pam and
it makes it a lot easier to handle all
your assets we have the asset manager
which handles synchronous and
asynchronous loading of assets that
sound textures you can write your own
loaders for different
formats anything that will be loaded
asynchronously will be some things
require the main thread still so
textures for example we have custom
collections because Java collections
tend to generate a lot of garbage and if
anything Android hates it's garbage so
our custom collections are really quick
and they generate new garbage so the
internals of liberty x are really quick
no garbage keeps Android nice and happy
we have Jason on xml serialization and
deserialization bulton if you want to
save game data entity States getting
stuff and networks as you go to we have
utility glasses whole math library and
shapes library so that's vectors
quaternions intersections collisions you
can make your own tiny little physics
engine with to Java classes and if you
use these you two classes and then we
have the high level so that includes
extensions which I'll talk a bit more on
later so some of those are box to do in
bullet physics we have a full 2d scene
graph and UI toolkit we have all the
widgets they do belong to us we have a
Maps API for loading tiled maps if
anyone use tell tiled application for
tile maps and any proprietary tiling
software and you get support for we have
the 3d API and the localization bundle
so you can translate your app into those
different languages really simply so the
3d API its relative in you and it just
got re re refactored so we've got
support for environment said it's cube
maps reflection specular normal mapping
normal mapping directional lights point
light spotlights shadow mapping there's
actually a giant PR on our github at the
moment they're not reflected but got a
whole new lighting system and it's a
really cool system probably one that
we're going to pull in relatively soon
we've got a full node tree and including
animations they don't have to be skinned
but GPU skinning is also also there
we've got d car batching 3d particles
and probably the most complete Jarboe
that wrapper for 3d physics bullet TM
don't quote me on that so extensions
they're more like libraries but we call
them extensions there's no format that
you need to do if you want to write your
own extension you can stand load and
plug it in and they'll work so we've got
boxed ed everyone knows box 2d 2d
physics engine we've got bak city lights
which is a really awesome ray casting
lighting engine built on top of box
today I've got bullet physics which is
3d physics really awesome 3d physics
look at all the balls we've got Ashley
which is a really lightweight ending
component system if anyone hasn't tried
entity component systems before I
definitely recommend it really cool
stuff we've got a tools collection more
on that in a bit we have controllers
extensions so support for Xbox 360
controllers ooh yeah any controller that
you can provide a mapping for we have an
AI extension which includes path winding
decision-making state machines behavior
trees messaging movement formation
motion and we have a pay extension so
this will handle in that building on I
think they support eight different
platforms so Amazon iOS wallet is web
wallet google play and this all does it
so you can do it from your core code
without handling any at any platform
specific code so some of our tools we've
got a texture Packer which allows you to
pack all your textures into one big
texture rather than texture swap all the
time this is really good because you
just hand it to artists sorry artists
you just hand it to artists to run and
they don't have to worry about doing
this we've got a model converter so that
converts 3d models into libgdx friendly
models so it supports way from obj and
FBX and i think a few others we have
free type so dynamic loading of true
type fonts to bitmap fonts on the fly so
you can generate any size bitmap font
that you want and for your specific
device so if you want really crisp fonts
this is the way to go and we've got to d
and 3d particle editors and as you can
see that lovely so
interface yeah it's great so we have
third-party extensions we have loads of
them these are just a few of the
examples so if you're more into the hole
what you see is what you get editor when
you drag and drop things make compound
objects over that 2d is really good for
that so it's an open source getting you
I content editor and you can make all
sorts compound objects join sprites
together add script to them send out
events import skeletal meshes from some
third-party skeletal framework whatever
it's really cool we also have this UI
which is a a UI toolkit that extends our
inbuilt do I talkin our default skin for
the UI toolkit is awful so I'm not going
to show you what it is but this one
provides one so you don't have to look
at it so the QuickStart guide it's
really simple you just go on our website
make sure that your development
environment is set up there's a lengthy
guy on this if you need it download
choose the extension of things you can
see a little bit of a desktop Android on
the font tiny and all the extensions
that you want and there are third-party
extension there as well so all you have
to do is take certain boxes and it will
generate the project for you and then
you import it and run and it just works
so he says documentation and sauce so on
github if you import your project into
ID it's also attached so you can just
scroll through your ID as normal with
Java applications and just run through
the source the wiki is the ultimate
guide for everything definitely
recommend you doing that and there's
also a starting point for documentation
which includes videos if you like videos
and all that fun stuff so licensing and
costs it's absolutely free it's apache2
you can do what you like with it you
don't even have to give us any credit
you just use it if you do release it and
let us know that'd be cool and give us
credit if you want but it's not
mandatory
so some of the games that are made this
is Alchemist awakening but it's Aras
games I think they're a Polish
development team they just recently got
greenlit this is like a procedurally
generated 3d open-world game where
you'll like this wizard and you set fire
to cats and things like that I think
they're armed I think they're adding
online support as well which would be
kind of crazy ingress is anyone played
ingress that was a Google startup they
use libgdx for their Android and boo boo
and wave of em and iOS build halfway by
robots ality guys from Germany has
anyone played halfway anyone like XCOM
if you do I definitely recommend this
you can get it really cheap really cool
game spine everyone must neck spine who
knows mine ok a few of you if you're if
you want skeletal animation spine has
been much the software to go to this is
actually built by a lib GDX developer
I'm not getting paid to say this and
it's built with the libgdx framework as
well but this doesn't just export to
libgdx you can use it in unity I think
Broner there's like 10 different
runtimes gun slugs to buy orange pixel
procedurally generated platformer
shooter runner really cool from and
Delvaux by priority interrupt so it's a
3d 2d decal row game but that's really
cool as well definitely is out so
there's lows in those are games we have
a game submission on our site which has
I can't remember saying like 900 but
hardly any people push to that there
were loads of games out there this is
just a few so that's the GTX you can
find us on that l but just google it
takes down these elves anyway and if
anyone uses IRC we're on freenode so if
you want to pretend that you're working
definitely join us and you can follow
the pdx on twitter and that thing if
Twitter's your thing is on
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
