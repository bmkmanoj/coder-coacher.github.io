things we can do in the next video we're
going to show you improvements and all
the possibilities that we could possibly
go with this our robot doesn't have many
sensors for now but we could think of
adding a few movement sensors so I can
react to its environment for example
make the arm lift to the right when we
move our hand to the right and similar
system for the left hand side the DMS 80
distance sensor can be used to develop
this functionality by creating a small
digital map connected to the open cm we
could transfer the information from the
sensor to the edison in the same way by
adding microphones we can get the robot
to react to sound or music and like a
snake charmer we could control the arm
of our snake robot you connect the
electric Mike's to the Intel Edison
board using a breadboard or by wielding
once the sound information has been
collected it can be processed on the
Edison to trigger actions function is
that doesn't require additional servers
choreograph thanks to the power of the
electronics and the dynamic servers we
can actually record the movements of
each of the servers of the automated arm
so we can develop a function that
records movements when we press the
point using the mobile app or an actual
physical point by recording several
positions we are then able to set the
robot to execute a choreography the
other functionality we thought about is
copying movement from another automated
arm when you move an arm the other one
makes the exact same movements this is
the functionality which we are going to
develop in the next video it allows to
grab a pen and at the end when we draw
something the other arm draws the exact
same thing we have decided to develop
this functionality because allows you to
see how to get information from the
characters and send them and communicate
them between the two Edison's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
