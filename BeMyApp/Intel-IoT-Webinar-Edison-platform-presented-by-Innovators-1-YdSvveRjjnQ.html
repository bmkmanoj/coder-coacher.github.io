this first IOT webinar I'm here with a
couple of speakers and Nurik Integra
presentative so my name is Alex from be
my app we organized this webinar with
Urich I'm really happy that to see many
many connection here on this webinar so
I can definitely see that there is a lot
of interest on the Intel Edison platform
so just to let the Disney for to give
their presentation to Urich I'm gonna
give you a few technical details
regarding the technology so feel free to
ask question on the chat panel all right
so on the on the on the GoToWebinar
dashboard you have the opportunity to
ask question all right
in life along with Urich there is Duke
hojae ok we're here to answer your
technical question
ok so feel free to interact we are here
to answer to your question and and
present you nice very nice project so
also if you have if you have any kidding
about you know a technology please send
us a tweet on H tag make it grow okay
just share some feedback or feeling you
have and end up pretty much it I hope
everybody has the clear sound and the
clear video as well if not please let us
know okay we'll try to figure out what
happened
Eureka you here with us yes
hi Alex okay thanks for the introduction
go ahead so hi everyone and thanks for
joining us for this coyote innovation
webinar so my name is Eric chef Ian and
I work for Intel I'm in charge of the
AMIA activities around IOT inventors and
and makers more generally so in today's
webinar
I will start with an introduction to the
IOT environments how it looks today and
then go through some of the details of
two innovations out there the first
innovation is wrong
more motivation and that will be
presented by Nathan and the second
innovation by Patrick walks us through
the use of Intel Edison as a robot
control device we will then wrap up and
provide links to more information on
these topics so the internet of thing is
a massive opportunity I don't think
anybody out there debates this if you
look at some of numbers IDC is reporting
15 billion connected devices this year
and an exponential growth of 50 billion
connected devices within the next five
years so these connected devices such as
every segments of the markets from
consumer to industries home automation
healthcare industrial sectors need
cities transportation these are just a
few examples of the sectors in which IOT
can bring valuable transformation so the
interesting part to me in this whole
movement is to look at the innovation
process and also more specifically at
where the innovation is coming from
there was a time while of the innovation
was coming from large established
companies those large enterprises are
definitely still in the innovating but
there's a major trends out there for
startup inventors and entrepreneurs of
all kinds to fuel more and more of this
innovation this trend is driven by the
accessibility of component and building
blocks necessary to on to innovate and
you can look at it from different angles
if you look at this software if you look
at it from a software perspective you
have higher level developing tools from
a hardware perspective you get cheaper
and more accessible compute that forms
or things like 3d printing you can also
look at it from a financing perspective
with access to crowdfunding platforms or
even from a go-to market
it was with the availability of online
sales tools making it easy to go to
markets so all these elements are
reducing the barriers for inventors to
innovate and bring those new ideas to
markets so what are we doing as Intel to
support inventors in this environments
if you look back at 2013 we introduced a
product called Galileo which is an
Arduino compatible computer absalom for
quick prototyping now in the second half
of last year we also introduced a new
product called Intel Edison development
platform the objective here is not to
provide a full product training of this
that's one bit but I did want to
highlight a couple of points before I
hand it over to Nathan and Patrick the
Intel Edison platform is it's a full
compute module in a very tiny form
factor it has dual core CPU with one gig
of ram it has four gigs of storage on
the boards it has embedded connectivity
with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and and finally
it has a micro controller elements
allowing to connect to all the sensors
through 40 GB is the interesting part
about this is really beyond the size and
the form factor of this compute platform
because all of these functionalities are
provided in something that is about the
size of an SD cards so the purpose of
this obviously is quick prototyping like
we could do with something like an Anil
but then you can also move your
prototype into a production ready
solution but by using this same Edison
development platform so a long ways the
the compute module itself there's a
couple of expansion boards available out
there there's two expansion boards
provided by Intel the first one is a kit
with the Arduino expansion board so this
provides the easiness of the Arduino and
for really very quick for the typing the
second one is a kid with the mini
breakout board and and this one is
really sort of the next stage in the
development and Ben allows to really
take full advantage of the size of the
Edison compute module in addition to
that there is a couple of partners out
there that bring of all suits of
expansion boards to bring additional
capabilities to the Intel platform and
also we've seen a couple of customers
actually starting prototyping moving to
something like the mini breakout board
but then eventually building their own
optimized PCB for Intel Edison and then
bringing their develop product to market
business so with that were always open
to questions so that there's the chat
for further question on the product but
I did want to hand it over to two of our
innovators out there and I believe Natan
is the first one here Alex can you over
to Nathan yes I'm here I'm just unmuted
Nathan Nate II now you are here with us
now yes thank you very much okay I mean
thank you very much Eureka super okay
well it's your turn then Nathan there we
go
super well thanks very much hello
everyone and and welcome so yeah my name
is Nathan Carter I've actually been
developing software for for a while
having actually had a career as a circus
clown before this but that's actually
another story what it means actually for
for me and for
I work with the Edison is but actually
I've fairly limited the experience in
hardware I've built projects before with
pic microcontrollers and and of course
Arduino and my Arduino experience in my
electronics they were getting pretty
good becoming things online was it was
always a problem for me so I mean there
was the time I bought a wide fly
to connect to the internet and realize
that I would have to write my very own
web server from scratch so there's a lot
of difficulty there and I still wanted a
community like that a big community like
Arduino community but with more
straightforward support for for IOT
projects so when I heard that Intel that
the Edison supported nodejs natively I
just I had to go to the hackathon that
was here in New York City it didn't
matter to me that it was a new product
back then that Intel was still building
their developer community around Edison
because I knew that the node community
is just super strong and that would mean
for someone like me who's strong and web
development that I could feel very
comfortable programming what had been
for me very difficult online projects
the focus for the Edison on size and a
single Wi-Fi setup meant that this was a
platform for IOT which had really been
an interest for me and I wanted to build
projects that were able to hide the
hardware and make things in the home
come alive in in new ways so teeth
stands for a timer encouraging everyone
to health and this here the picture on
the bottom is how the project looked at
the hackathon you know to be very simple
about the technology it's a timer
connected to the Internet and I'll show
a video next of a demo of it
but you know with the Edison platform I
was able to build the prototyped and
really truly less than a day and it was
all so familiar to me
right the Intel SDK is is pretty good
there xdk is what they call it but I
could also work in sublime just like all
of my other JavaScript coding so it was
literally minutes with no programming no
writing my own web server to get on the
Wi-Fi and be on the Internet
adding the device sensors even the LCD
which has always been sort of a problem
kind of a chore it's well documented in
the Intel templates but I knew that this
is a platform for someone like me when I
wanted to add an email feature because I
simply did a require to an existing node
j/s library for SMTP and in a few
minutes and four to five lines of code I
was sending email so so that was just
incredible for incredible for me to be
able to take a hardware device to the
internet add futures quickly so I'll
show a video here of of teeth
I guess you had a lot of fun mate I'm
doing the video quite good
I've done I've done
you're a great actor Nathan
very interesting you'll already have the
old question good is so thank you you
know I I'm not sure how much time I have
left but just in terms of next steps
Intel has been super about helping me
sort of reinvasion the project beyond
just the technical they have a lot of
resources to to look at things like even
product story and Bill of Materials
potential revenue so that's out there
for any entrepreneur and it's meant that
I've started to come concentrate on on
other bits making sure that I can
concentrate on the web services behind
the social interaction but I wanted to
provide this link here for anyone who's
interested in building their own version
of teeth I posted my original model up
on Instructables
and you can always use the forum feature
there to get a hold of me if you have
questions or to work through the folks
that be my Appa
it entails so thanks very much for
listening and and yeah I can take a look
at a couple of questions here folks
tasked about a wall plug and a battery
so in this picture I think you can see
in the bottom the the black square there
is a battery so that was my sort of
original the battery is a rechargeable a
it's one of those that she would use to
recharge your phone and there were a
couple of problems with it one was that
it gives about four volts and I really
needed five for the screen and the other
was that it lasted about about a week
when I wanted to want it a little bit
more so in some newer versions now I'm
looking at a wall plug instead but the
Edison itself was able to to work off of
that rechargeable battery for her
quite a while I think it was really the
screen that was there was taking so much
so much energy from the battery a great
Center thank you very much
yes thank you very much for well me a
chance to present well thanks to you I
have to say you're a great actor Nathan
seriously you're acting you're acting is
really good so indeed as I was as you
were reminding to everybody feel free to
get in touch with the speakers okay they
have several instructable run of
applause yes thank you thank you very
much to the week asking you a round of
applause for you Nathan so I'm directly
going to head to Patrick Patrick are you
here with us yes I am you gave me oh
yeah we can hear you well I'm directly
sharing the screen with you now so you
will feel free and go ahead the crowd is
a well excited afternoon confrontation
so you can go ahead so this is about my
project which I called Edison which is
controlling a robust appian from the
Intel Edison so of the spring the intro
page and actually I should introduce
myself as well my my name is Patrick
Barr Suzuki my professional life is I've
had a career in finance as a
quantitative analyst and software
developer so very different from this
and I'm actually taking an hour off work
to go to a cafe to present this though
apologies for the background noise but
as you can tell this has nothing to do
with finance so the Robosapien is a
low-cost humanoid robot and if it's as
bipedal walking motion and also Edison I
thought finally we actually have the
hardware to make chief toys of the kind
that you might have seen in Toy Story
and I also listed some some more some
other movies child's play well as some
of my colleagues thought it was like
that and the one that my kids thought up
was five nights at Freddy's which is
independent independent computer game
that's very popular kids so they eat
named my Freddy fazbear some of you may
know what that is
anyway these are just some of the
popular cultural references to
intelligent toys and they haven't really
come about yeah the Robosapien provides
the ideal hardware in terms of robot
mechanics it is really cheap but it's
not you know it doesn't it's not
programmable so the next component was
an idea of an during yuan which is
Swedish for walking bear apparently
teddy bear it's very robust it's very
cheap I paid $15 for it
it's large enough to hold a Robosapien
but the stuffing in the head is a little
bit heavy so I'd replace it with packing
peanuts so maybe I will show you a quick
video to see what we created out of
these in there this so sorry this is
better okay so here with any new remote
control commands this is to the i-5
command sorry I think his head needs to
be attached a bit more tightly at the
back and then we're gonna kind of walk
forward and then we're gonna send a walk
back and then we're going to Sanders
white bright which is one of the little
robot martial arts commands that's
programmed in
so anyway back to the back to the
presentation so this is the Intel
Anderson of course I actually kept the
packing box you need it for this project
and it's in the Arduino breakout board
you could probably now do this with
sparkfun blocks but they didn't exist
when when I when I was doing the project
I I also did it at the Intel IOT
Roadshow in New York and infrared LED
and resistor hooked up to the pins on
the Arduino the instruction the
instructions are all on Instructables it
sold a free so we're just using jumper
wires to connect the led to the Edison
breakout board directly so the software
is kind of interesting I so one of the
things that the the Edison has is an
Arduino sa compatibility mode so you can
run Arduinos sketches on the Edison but
what's interesting is that that sketch
environments actually very powerful and
it allows you to do things that you
could never do on an actual Arduino so
keep in mind that even though you're
writing in C you know with Arduino
libraries you have the full power of
Linux underneath you so in this case we
used it to call the shell command shell
commands to communicate with firebase
which is a easy-to-use real-time cloud
database which and so the backend
doesn't require any coding and the
front-end so I have that web interface
you saw all that does is it saves a
command integer to firebase and then the
Intel Edison retrieves it in the Arduino
event book so this is the example of
what the software looks like right so
this looks like Arduino code you see
this line here that says system curl
that's a curl command to retrieve
retrieve a path which has a command and
save it to a temporary text file and
then we start reading it just check that
we can access the file
check that the file is of the expected
size we then to convert the comma on to
an integer so the string to an integer
and then yeah we send the integer to
this send command line here sends the is
the command to actually use the infrared
LED and then we send another curl
command to erase the command from
firebase Orion then do the same command
multiple times so as you can see none of
this will actually work on an art you
know because the shell command is not
gonna work but then the rest of the code
is more or like classic Arduino sketch
code so send command center header and
then no sends ones and zeroes the header
one and zero also often still sending
pairs of the different length of a of a
pulse and then a space so a pulse is
where you modulate at 30 ok frequency
and the space is where you don't send
anything and then this is a you know a
tight loop that will send the modulated
in thread at the right right frequency
so hopefully that kind of explains what
we're trying to do I just point out a
few a few things on this code we need it
I don't know if this is still necessary
but we needed to do the timing via a
tight loop so we would just literally
spin the CPU for the timing for the
infrared cousin Fred modulation wise
fairly precise timing and people
actually told me that that they didn't
think it would work but it worked just
fine so I'm quite pleased about that we
use the delay microseconds for the off
pulses because their timing is not as
critical
so that is the end of the presentation
yet let me see if there any questions
hey Patrick
hi all right thank you very much looks
very impressive oh I like the high five
command so I think the point I kind of
wanted to make about including the
coding details is that if you like to do
if you would like to use existing
Arduino libraries etc you can do it but
integrate it into and connected you know
into a connected device for easily so
using obviously the built-in Wi-Fi and
also the ability to access the linux
shell directly from an arduino sketch
allows you to do things that are it
would be quite quite inconceivable with
a regular arduino so it allows you to
take something that was you know a
traditional arduino app if you will and
cloud connectivity please Allah so I
know this isn't that's the normal way
that people do are connected Edison apps
but I think it opens up the world with
existing Arduino code through the
Internet of Things very very so thank
you very much if you have any question
I'm addressing right now to the audience
feel free to type them on the on the
question panel okay on chat panel for
you thank you thank you very much
Patrick thank you well it was very very
interesting as Nathan project world so
we are we are now approaching the end of
this webinar just to let you know there
is all this webinar has been recorded
okay so it will be display on YouTube
and we'll send it to you through email
just before leaving Patrick there is a
question for you from Lidl it comes on
the chat so I'll let you type down
the answer so interesting project edison
teddy bear so also we just wanted to
share with you that there is another
upcoming Intel IOT webinar on some
platform ok it's gonna be on mate its
yep
so basically it's exactly the same
format you know half an hour sharing
experiences about individual and
independent genome project so it starts
at six first time so will very soon send
you the invitation will be tomorrow
batteries will send it to you before
leaving Eureka you still here with us
yeah I'm still here
alright do you want to share feedback or
say your goodbye word to the whole crowd
sure if you can see in my screen an X
now we can yes indeed II just wanted to
on thank again natal and Patrick for
showing what they worked on and the full
process behind it I just wanted to close
here with two references for more
information on this the first one is our
Edison online community which is maker
intel.com
and you will find all the information on
the product itself how to get started
and also a community of people who have
already had on Edison sharing ideas and
projects they've they've already built
and the second one is our Developer zone
on software intel.com slash IOT so this
is where you find more of the software
information and all the development
tools to help you get started on now
that's one such as Intel Edison so that
was it thanks thanks everyone for being
there and participating to to this
webinar
and with that back to now from from
millions thanks Alex
sex to Urich sense to everybody and see
you on may 5th for the second edition
and as I told you we'll send you the
recording tomorrow thank you very much
and see you at the next webinar bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
