Christian and Erica I'm
King for Intel and I support fujitsu you
may have heard about the company they
actually do have a big development
center west of munich in Augsburg they
still produce their own motherboards and
manufacture systems there so my day job
really is supporting that customer with
their IT development now today's topic
is from send to silicon circuits some of
you may have asked yourselves the
question so how are chips made how is
that done what is happening inside
internal fabs and I'm trying to explain
this within the next 30 minutes or so so
it all starts with sand most of you know
thats and consists mostly of silicon not
the silicon but the silicon's elysium
and it's purified it's actually melted
into and so-called in god that's
actually done by a third party company
for example south of bavaria vaca
selectronic is doing this and then they
create those huge silicon pieces I've
brought a pretty old one because that's
really small in diameter and it's just
the top of the silicon ingot and I hand
it around but I really need you to
promise me that you don't let it drop
because it belongs to a colleague of
mine and if I bring it home broken I'll
have big trouble but this is actually
how such a silicon in God looks like the
interesting part about silicon ingots I
had it still the is the interesting part
about silicon ingots is they are
absolutely pure and the crystalline
structure is also very there's no
impurities in it and the crystalline
structure is very very regular the goal
really is to get a monocrystalline in
God with the most regular structure you
can get out of those machines there's a
whole lot of electricity needed to do
this lots of heat and complicated
processes but again not done by Intel we
buy
products based on that silicon ingot and
that is actually shown on my next slide
so with that big in God what is
happening is actually cut in dishes or
we call them wafers very thin glass like
wafers those wafers are the material we
buy from companies like vaca and other
companies around the world and that's
the basis we start our processor or
silicon circuit manufacturing from again
obviously the slicing is a difficult
process because you want to have the
finest and cleanest surf as possible in
order for the Intel fabs be able to
build circuits on them now in the next
step if you have this wafer we actually
start by applying photoresists but let
me take one step back many people think
that silicon manufacturing might be a
very mechanical process it indeed is not
it's a chemical process mostly what we
do with those wafers is a whole lot of
applying photoresists applying different
elements different gases different
solutions onto the wafer so you could
view a silicon facility silicon fat
facility mostly as a chemical factory
which it really is so if one of the
first steps is to put on applying
photoresists the reason we do this is
they get exposed with light later on and
then parts of that silicon folder sorry
part of the photoresist that were
exposed with the light might Harden
enter parts that were not exposed with
light they might still be soft and be
washed away so parts of the wafer are
coded after the washing away with the
photoresist and other parts aren't that
gives you a structure and then you can
apply additional materials on that wafer
you can basically put it for example in
a chamber with gas and the gas will then
change the structure of that silicon
wafer but only on the parts
where there is no photo resist anymore
the parts that weren't hit by light okay
now you might think wow that sounds
quite easy that's a little bit like the
old slides projecting you know photos
that were taken with slides you have a
project that you project that image on a
wall and you can see the slide the photo
and that's actually very similar the
difference here is that the structures
that we're trying to build with the
photoresist and the lightning that goes
through the masks so Lucetta the slide
is actually quite a difficult process
because we're running out of light in
the process technology so in the past it
was an easy thing you had a rather big
chip the structures we produced on
silicon were comparable big but nowadays
we've gone down to so small structures
that the structures are actually smaller
than the wavelength of the light we're
using and that's quite a challenge and
my comparison for that one is if you're
supposed to draw a fine line on paper
you would certainly pick a thin pencil
maybe a point three pencil to draw this
really fine line but in this case all
you get is a fat adding pen and you're
supposed to draw a really fine point
three line with this adding pen and now
you have to find tricks on how you do
this and some of the tricks we do is
optical proximity correction which is
basically you you create a mask that
looks very different from what you
actually want to create or you do
multiple patterning so you actually use
light and the photoresist process
several times or and that is actually
one of the most complicated things we do
with regards to the Lightning process we
have masks that have a certain
determined depth and we use the
interferences of the light waves
that go through the mask in order to
reduce the wavelength of the light
behind the mask and create the
structures that we really want to create
okay so this is one first important step
to understand when we do start the
silicon manufacturing process a whole
lot of the processes use photoresist and
exposure through light in order to coat
part of that waiver now as I already
said one way of altering the surface of
the wafer and that's actually the first
step that we do is ion implantation
because we want to have the surface of
the waiver have specific properties that
we need in order to create transistors
we want them to be semiconductors so we
have to change the surface of that wafer
such as actually according to our needs
now ion implantation is basically
something where we put that wafer coded
with photoresist into an oven and then
the gas goes in with the ions and the
ions basically implant themselves on the
surface and that's one big step in the
beginning of the silicon manufacturing
after that I on implement implantation
the photoresist is being removed so now
you have parts of that wafer with ions
implanted and other parts that don't
have those ions implanted the parts that
were protected with the photoresist
don't have the ions the parts that were
not protected have the ions and that
actually is the beginning of the
transistor formation I think most of you
will know what the transistor is it's
basically a switch and that's the
simplest element in a processor in order
to do calculations we have many many of
those transistors in one processor
depending on the type of the processor
it could be up to a billion or even more
than a billion transistors in just one
processes so it's kind of hard to read
your head around that concept of having
you know 1.7 billion transistors in one
processor so those transistors really
need to be very small in in order to
show you how small they are I have a
little video that one of our elite
scientists actually did in order to
explain how small those transistors
really are let's see if the video works
and hopefully also the sound works I
think we restart with a little bit more
volume right
oh yes now possibly or but times more
passion sighs the sale price I just
okay I hope that gives you a good idea
of how small those transistors really
are if a red blood cell is as big as a
five-story building and that guy who was
shrunken down to that little size is
even much much bigger than a transistor
because what he's actually doing is he's
holding one of those transistors later
on in his hands the other comparison I
always like to make is if you think
about an influenza virus that is so big
that it could eat hundreds of those
transistors and it wouldn't even grow in
size so think about the dimensions we
have we're really talking about virus
sighs parts that we're manipulating
everyday 24 by 7 in our manufacturing
facilities now if we go through the
different steps and they're quite
complicated and I won't go into very
much detail but basically what we're
doing in the next step is we're erasing
parts of that wafer so there's three
dimensional structures growing and with
the newest generation of our process we
actually build so-called three
dimensional transistors so it's not just
on the surface of the wafer we actually
by etching away parts we're creating
fins and then when we remove the
photoresist there's another step where
we would plant the silicon dioxide gate
dielectric which is the heart of the
transistor that actually makes the
transistor switch or not switch we do
have poly silicon gate electron applied
to that one and then there's an
insulator on top of it I won't go in all
of those details if you want to we can
discuss this later on in the networking
part of this evening but just so you
know there's hundreds of steps that need
to be taken
in order to get to the transistor level
and the transistor level really is the
very bottom level of that way for the
first layer where the transistors sit
and then there is more steps applied
where we put in for example and hike a
gate dielectric and there's also a metal
gate applied in order to make this
transistor switch the way we want it
with the features we want it and
obviously then once the transistor is
done we also need to connect it
electrically electrically to the outside
world or at least two other transistors
on the processor and that's done by
electroplating and post polishing and
eventually creating the metal layers
which are several story high electrical
wires that connect the different
transistor connections to each other
transistor from transistor but also to
the outside world through the package
there's any questions by the way in
between you can always ask now so we've
actually fast-forwarded through this
manufacturing process and what I brought
with me is one of those wafers in a
modern size so may have noticed the in
got that I handed around was very small
in diameter the 300 millimeter wafer
size is what we're currently using so
going back to that in God that would be
an ingot with this diameter and about 2
meter high that's what we get then they
slice wafers out of it and after we
process it in our febs the front side of
the wafer gets this colorful picture and
you can see here a hundreds of
processors on the front side of this
wafer if you take a close look and I'll
hand this around as well please don't
open the box don't drop it you'll see a
whole lot of regular structures in each
of the regular structures is one
so-called die also one processor one cpu
obviously
not a whole lot useful on their way fer
we need to package it and that's
actually than the next man if any
manufacturing steps that I'm explaining
so the left hand picture basically shows
okay on the wafer we're starting to test
those dies because the process is so
complex and it takes so long that not
all dies are good so we work towards
so-called perfect wafers and we
sometimes get them but unfortunately
most of the time they aren't perfect
waivers there's a few chips that don't
work so we have to test them if they
work or if they don't and then they're
marked good or not good and then they're
being sliced into the little rectangles
and then they're the bad ones are being
taken away and the good ones are
packaged the individual die is packaged
into CPU yes and you have a question how
do we differentiate that's done with a
testing machine that hooks up to
connectors on that wafer so the wafer
that i'm showing here doesn't have balls
attached to it so it's nicer to look at
in reality the front side actually gets
ball connections on it and then you see
test points that you can use for those
testing machines it's a good question
thank you and there's another one
so in this step it's mostly checked for
does it work or does it not work but
then and that's actually I think I'm let
me see maybe it's showing on the next
slide there is a so called a process
step that is called speed binning where
there's more test applied to the product
in order to say okay what is the
characteristics of this individual died
and how fast can it run not necessarily
so across the different marketing names
we use for our processors you might run
into cases where an i5 has the same die
as an i7 but it's more likely that
within the i7 family processes used the
same die and within an i5 family you
will also see mostly the same die as a
general rule you could say that
depending on the number of cores that's
a good indicator if it's going to be
from the same die or not so if you have
a four core i5 processor and a four core
i7 processor chances are pretty high
that this is actually from the same
silicon die but different outcome in the
manufacturing process or in many cases
when our yields are really good and
yield is basically a number of how well
our manufacturing works it's mostly then
just naming them differently in charging
charging differently okay good questions
so we've packaged this individual die
into a housing and the housing is here
to protect the processor and it's also
making it a little bit easier to handle
it and it's also Purdue is also
connecting it to the outside world so if
you look at the front side of this
processor package and this is a desktop
processor you see that there is this
metal cap on it that's the so-called
heat spreader it protects the dye which
sits on the
so if you look at that wafer one of
those rectangles sits underneath the
metal cap the backside of the processor
has those so-called lens in the past we
used pins now it's lens it's basically
contacts that are used to connect the
processor to the motherboard and to
connect it to the outside world okay
yep there we go there's the class
testing that I've referred to and the
speed pinning that determines what type
of frequency a processor is able to run
and then for the fancy parts it's
packaged in the retail package and good
to be sold in computer shops big
customers like fujitsu they don't get
the CPUs obviously in the funny in the
fancy retail packages they get them in
trays in much easier to handle when you
have more units to handle now this
silicon manufacturing is no easy task
there's a question so first of all if
you look at the different process of
emily's there's different dyes different
product really so if you have a dual
core process or if you have a quad core
processor that's actually a different
day and also if you look at the
different processor generations or the
different process of brands we have like
an atom processor that's a totally
different dye from say a core processor
but then within a certain families
within a certain range for example a
core i7 with a certain number behind it
might be from the same wafer as this is
the next processor with a higher
frequency and that's determined by how
well this processor was baked if you
want to use the term bake and how
capable that processor is in regards to
either for example power consumption
which is a huge significant metric for
us because notebook processes are
supposed to consume is less power as
possible or if you look at for example
the K series of processors um there are
tuned towards overclocking capabilities
and for those we look at certain
parameters those are actually the most
power hungry processors because
typically what happens is a processor is
capable of consuming a lot of power then
you can run it at a higher frequency at
the cost of a higher power consumption
yeah so the comparison I'd like to take
and that's a very simple comparison
obviously i think my manufacturing
scientists would let me on the hand if
they hurt me but i always like to use
the pizza analogy think about baking a
pizza in an oven sometimes it actually
goes really well sometimes you have a
heart black edge and sometimes you have
a very wet middle and that's kind of
similar with the wafers if our process
is too nicely you get wonderful pizzas
even the edge is you know nice soft
everything works out nicely and the
middle is not wet still even in such a
pizza you can use pieces that tastes
really good and that's what we do and if
everything works out nicely which is the
perfect way if I was referring to
earlier then the entire pizza is top
quality and you can eat everything most
of the time when we talk about those
yield rates or the speed binning we're
doing we can use a big big portion of
that wafer it just depends then what
type of product do we get out of the
wafer
no no the idea really is we always want
to have perfect wafers and sometimes
manufacturing is tuned towards a certain
goal so for example if we want to create
notebook processes then the
manufacturing process is tuned towards
low power consumption and then what
happens actually is you don't get a
whole lot of processes that run at high
frequency but you get a whole bunch of
processes that consume very little power
and then you have to make your decision
in product management where you say okay
if I want to have a low power
consumption noble process I might have
to sacrifice a little bit the frequency
i get so what you notice in our product
portfolio is that the desktop processors
that are allowed to consume a little bit
more power have higher frequencies
whereas the notebook processors might
have lower frequencies now if you look
at the features in the processor
portfolio we have meanwhile we have
pretty dynamic frequency scaling so we
allow our processes to actually speed up
on frequency for example if they are not
hot or if only one core is used and
that's kind of a technology to offset
this physical law of that you would have
to have a high power consuming part in
order to achieve high frequency so with
the so-called towable features that we
have in our processes we offset that a
little bit make sense okay so as you can
see it's been quite a complicated
process and you can easily imagine that
this is a very costly endeavor a new fab
for Intel is about three to four billion
US dollar and the new fads that we're
going to produce they're more in the
order of five billion each fab so that's
a huge capital investment in order to
make that happen but then on the other
hand that's probably the only place on
earth where you manipulate
products on the at-home level and I when
I say Adam level I really mean this some
steps we do here use techniques where
each an individual atomic layer is
deposited at the place where it should
be the tolerances in one of those
transistors I was referring to earlier
then there's parts in where there's a
tolerance from three atomic layers to
seven atomic layers and that's where we
have to stay within three atomic layers
to seven atomic layers that's quite a
feat in order to to get that well as you
can see it's an expensive endeavor we
usually don't allow people in our fabs
because they're very clean and if you've
seen if you've seen pictures from
silicon manufacturing you see people
wearing those suits often time them is
taken as protective suits for the people
that are wearing them from chemicals or
whatever that's not the case actually
its protective suits for the products we
produce because the people with
everything they lose the cuffs they make
maybe the makeup they're wearing but
makeup is not allowed in fabs that would
actually bring so much dirt into the
fact that people need to wear those
suits in order to protect the product
from the people what I brought with me
though is a video that gives you a
little bit of an inside of how a fab
looks inside oops that was too quick
that's a fair from the inside
it's one of our biggest stage in Arizona
the little compartments transform the
way through the automated system that
carries waitress throughout the head
go to be able to see that they carry
those packages the horrid package and
it's got a whole bunch of weight and if
they're always carry one
that's the best
and you can see a paper how they handle
from the prosecution
you can see coding applying or
solution polishing
I'm
now you know it's for me always quite
impressive to imagine how small the
things are that my colleagues manipulate
and effect in a manufacturing if you
look at how things evolved since inter
started it's even more impressive I
think so if you look at one of the first
micro processes the four thousand eight
from 1971 to a processor of today the
performance has increased 3500 fold the
power consumption efficiency has
improved in the order of ninety thousand
times and the cost to produce this has
been lowered by about sixty thousand
times so what actually happened is that
the processor cost over time roughly
stayed the same could argue going up and
down a little bit roughly stays the same
but the number of features we put in in
the number of transistors we invest in
one processor now has increased
significantly so have the capabilities
that we obviously hope you're going to
use with the software that you're coding
and that actually is the end of that
introduction to how processes are made
how you get from send to silicon
circuits I hope you enjoyed it if
there's any questions I think I do have
a few minutes more but obviously I would
be here later on as well I think there
was one from this gentleman behind you
had one right yeah
so the lithography were using is 193
nanometer it's not extreme ultraviolet
yet we would love to use extreme
ultraviolet exactly for that reason I
explained in the beginning because that
would shrink the adding pen
significantly actually now to append
that is smaller than the lines we need
to draw unfortunately extreme
ultraviolet light is not powerful enough
yet there's a whole lot of research
happening I were trying to implement
this but the introduction into mass
manufacturing has been pushed out pushed
out pushed out and there is no date yet
when he is going to be introduced in
manufacturing what are you next class
well currently we're producing 14
nanometer processor that's our current
mass production note 14 nanometer
processors we have 10 nanometer
processors in preparation same
wavelength still that's the magic we're
doing with the masks with the optical
proximity correction with the multi
patterning and i was using wet masks now
which also helps the lovely photography
so it's getting more complicated the
throughput time to the factories getting
longer which causes a whole lot of
problems for us in order to produce the
amount of processes that we want but
these are all workarounds in lack of
having a light source of light that is
much smaller in wavelength than the 193
because couple days ago that into the
problem
well we've already stated plans for
seven as the next node after ten and I
think there's even a development roadmap
further down I don't know on the top of
my head what the next node steps are but
we don't think yet that we're running
out of gas that quickly Gordon Moore who
is one of the founders of Intel often
was asked the question with all the
upcoming challenges how long do you
think you will be able to shrink further
and Gordon had a really good answer to
that one he basically said think about
it as driving with your car in fork you
can see maybe 50 meters you can see
maybe hundred meters depending on the
thickness of the fork you're driving
through you can always see something and
what you hope is that the road never
ends sometimes you see a little bit
further in times when you have made a
major research step sometimes you don't
see as far so it really is has been the
same throughout silicon manufacturing we
never knew where the end would be and
obviously we're really spending a whole
lot of money to extend that that wrote
currently our spending on research and
development each quarter is about five
billion dollars and you had a question
right
here
it was
14 is almost 90 victory that is a very
good question but it's also very
difficult to answer question because
really what those numbers mean their
technology nodes the memory
manufacturers they actually had a
formula on how they derived their
technology note from the actual
structures that they produce for
processor manufacturing it's a little
bit different the really significant
part of a transistor for example which
is gate length that is significantly
smaller than the technology know you're
on so if we use gate length we would
actually have much smaller nanometers
today but what it really is is some sort
of a whether you say comparison to what
the features are within a chip but it's
not targeting a specific feature on a
transistor or on a chip so if you say
I'm producing on the 14 nanometer
technology node you'll be hard-pressed
to find a feature on a chip that is
exactly 40 nanometers but it gives you a
good idea of how small the structures
really are
so that was her he built into Russian
clean air
actually it's already built clean
because if you build it dirty you would
never be able to clean it afterwards so
obviously the concrete structures and
everything that's built dirty but when
you start to equip the clean room you
start clean it's it's a very complicated
and difficult process also contributing
to the cost of the fam there was one
more question that's a good one because
if you go back I think ten years or so
or maybe even more than that one of our
technical leader said that I think by
2000 I don't get it right anymore he
wanted to go 25 gigahertz really quickly
and then we realized if we continue on
this path to have a small number of
course but very high frequency you would
quickly get to very hot temperatures and
you would also not control the power
consumption of the CPU so we actually
had a chart at the time that showed okay
if we continued on this trajectory that
we were on you would quickly get to the
heat dissipation of a heat plate in your
kitchen and then quickly thereafter if
we continued on that trajectory you
would actually get to heat dissipation
of the Sun obviously not a good thing to
have that kind of a heat dissipation in
your notebook especially if you think
about placing it on your legs so we had
to find a different solution for it and
the solution a big part of the solution
has been to go to multiple cores because
actually if you if and this is where
software comes in this is where you guys
come in if you're actually able to
program such your software is able to
use more than one core it's
multi-threaded then you don't need the
high frequency you can actually
distribute the workload on the different
course and it's easier for us to do more
cores and not go up with
frequency as high as if we would have to
go if it was just single course this is
answer the question okay cool I guess
I'm timed out so if there's more
questions I'm here afterwards but then
I'd like to hand over to Thomas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
