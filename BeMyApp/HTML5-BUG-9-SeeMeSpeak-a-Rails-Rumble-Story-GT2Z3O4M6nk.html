Fletcher I'm on developerworks number
and yeah I think I my body is a fixed
vital where you might be better to bring
people I say hello very tonight I want
to talk to you about simi speed that's a
project we go at this year's waves where
Zabul hackathon a couple weeks ago what
I see me speak so see me speak is an
online crowds of the dictionary for sign
languages so this works online well
that's obviously but it's a dictionary
for sign languages wishes hot sauce
bringing production together with water
and go in position painted in the front
and young big on us tonight isn't
cheating you can see the way down it put
in little way so this is camping your
wall may or may not be familiar with
dictionary n is really like meditating
so I use these pages a long as daily but
in some compared to this we can see
there is a bit of a difference if he or
if you speak of sign languages then
mistake of the odd considering online
dictionaries doesn't look look as good
as out there almost all good learning
resources for sign languages on internet
they're either not we all they're not
compel me to use not we being meaning
free as in freedom so what really what
really need is an a big online focus of
translations science the spoken language
and
yeah as I said most Mary material there
isn't available under three license or
licensing and help a hassle or is it
fully documented and if you have free
offer stands usually buried and not too
compelling to yourself for example this
HP so it's a wiki for the German sign
language there's air serve more down I
mean wiki is nice hot for stuff but they
are probably more technically compelling
some various activities whether it's not
a video that is a video is what this is
a review in silence creature make sure
that is thank you despite from probably
are you going to be there's the problem
of contribution so it is how it won't be
able to walk or how to sign language
dictionary because you have to produce
video sell you we don't need to be
something else but we need some kind of
professional recording wakening some
some video video editing already
conversion tools and they have to do
some vocalizations so there's actually
there's will be some friction and
speaking of categorization there are few
new but they are different difference I
name is the German sign language but
there's also the American Sign Language
the French sign language and another
another thing are there are course also
we've different regional dialects and
regional variations so for example there
might be a boss Tony there might be
different signs for all the same work
for science community funding in
different regions so a dictionary we
would need to account for these kind of
variations so we really need is a system
that makes the contribution of sciences
frictionless as possible it must
accomplish what should a compliment
languages both sign language and spoken
languages and the categorization needs
to be flexible and we ideally also
forward compatible so yeah HTML to the
rescue fortunately enough technology is
cool these days and what I'm browsers
have everything we need to do solve this
kind of challenge these days so quick
look with you as the prototype we built
a p.m. and the wise one like fun so this
might be the most innovative attempt
showing a good swing base phototype too
much fun that experts but never this may
be with us this is how I welcomes you by
showing you video today this case the
Sun forward noodles yeah
so Mike remember this is pictured our
way out we can search search for
specific jump specific words located on
the words in system
the German sign language and it's taken
from the dgs wiki beyond the paper so we
should have fun sausage isn't the same
yeah well here from ionno so these are
we kind of have imported on a corpus to
start with two to get without because
without translations to leave the most
viable popular system wouldn't be much
fun themes yeah they're already about a
on 5 50 ish translations in the system
but the most so this is kind of standard
we're really some some new comes in this
way as the usage of failure the webcam
to record new sons so we all wrong with
these devices that have a webcam Dogen
all day and language this to make
contribution as easy as possible
let's let's recall in your son maybe
so this foam long speaking of sign
languages but not very best we called
far back right now okay so i found was I
wasn't
correct yeah okay so as you can see we
have a video to be over here we had our
bone now with you our Constitution yeah
again some some texture so this all on
the iboga contrition don't think this is
an insole with his liberty over our
zombie schedule yeah German sign
language is my name's bus and this is
taken to a living with model videos in
the system are licensed under the
creative commons license in order to
start building this free copies of
translations that okay
ok so how didn't build this um there
with me some technical details following
but basically will be on where its
application the names wait long for
myself the technology is used for
recording the video that's against media
ati back and we use a wok box and
everything is retarded in bed by elastic
search for assistance and search
functionality so for recording the video
this is a bit of expected corn example
the first thing we do you may have
noticed this little this little this
application once you're welcome the
spirit of this as a security feature
first when you when you only get user
media then the bars are asking for
permission repairs obviously actually
think in our case here we just need you
can has done an object with
configuration parameters and all case
here we obviously
video and we can pass the corvex of they
existed at the bottom and the API is
available we then set up immediately we
got object over here and after that we
also pipe the output of the camera to
about the html5 video element so this is
the little quibbling functionality you
solve it after i hope the page i could
already see video GUI GUI of me
preparing for important yeah so what's
this and after that we then known can
purchase a call back with mini recorder
and start the recording with the weather
fixed time slice in my place across
three seconds there was a little
drop-down select the time so what's this
this weird media stream we don't think
that's actually a the way if we see a
working draft it's just uh it's just an
object that takes media streams or it
music if you the media non-ferrous and
provide some some methods to start
recording stop the recording or yeah we
call it okay sometimes last we did this
thing isn't currently available in phone
yes but there's a polyfill called mini
recorder which we we also use use a
couple of other libraries on into to do
the recording but
this gets standardized quickly what we
have in yoga here's a polyfill Linkin
Park I think there is a they're
developing flesh for bed mr. popper to
be interesting for Internet currently if
users use like we call when ejs under
the hood this is still like native html5
video but you would actually have to
deal with some nitty-gritty details of
capturing Keith wings on the camera and
building up and the block it's basically
a way of pictures to record and
basically must be you know what this
show doesn't employ okay and after you
actually didn't say whether video and
perform something successfully but
what's happening there is that we're
sending a nice HR 2 / jquery so what we
would be do here is we basically the
form for this one form for submitting
method that i shall plus the video data
and it's interesting gives the use of
the foundational Jason that's actually
part of the feeds HR 2 on substandard
and we initialize it based on the
existing form so we just reference the
existing key value pairs these of
at all willing to fulfill and we can be
legal off to it so that's the the video
game MVP from the media screen recorder
and by setting by scratching Jake I
really wide way we can actually make
sure that the the request is being sent
on the server just looks like a regular
file float so said we were using weights
on the back end and four ways it's
indistinguishable not whether they use
your header in wood type file kind of
blow or whether is collected from the
from the webcam so Wes has some for
example then it sees this kind of
multipath request and can it saves the
the binary file to temporary violins
that you can so you can we use your
existing infrastructure any impressions
of Tommy just service have a file upload
all that for nomination of five users
know how so we kind of Western in fact
that this was a prototype Go Go can play
eight hours so we didn't consider all
the technology will be much useful now
but as you mentioned like a body bullet
that uses flash would probably be an
interesting interesting alternative so
unfortunately up until now we also need
you see by foxy wizard some of the
warning on the front page although this
it's a bit of an orbit but as is
standard supports kind of you it should
have a usable in written format that's a
bigger it is recorded to we're recording
in is the standardized or freedom
prominent invasion yeah so the the video
codec supported versus a lot of West
Bottoms but luckily now the google phone
calls supported at least of course
firefox and chrome and yes a way to
record on this woman regulated trans
color on the surface side to to being
able to support mobiles and okay so on
the way back can we use it technological
coops it's a movie application server
that's go on the jegos project which is
a big kind of application server from
from the java so on you may know there's
a ruby implementation in javas kojayi me
and which is which is used in this case
and so server that that's supposed to
the web standards so you can just run
any whales fixation on Cena
education many more but it's not just
the services also platform that ships a
lot of a building services level for
example messaging scheduling and demons
and its production ready of the box in
sports for because its own it's a long
evolving watching from the on the dark
space Omega go and support for us
awaiting available for example high
variability clustering for doing all
that missing but was also nice is that
it it has been returned t experience for
small project likely handsome despite
its really fully functional beast if the
setup and the National deployment got
very fast very handy to the reason we
use it in our place was what's back for
messaging sighs I mentioned we doing
video first inscriptions in the
background and you usually don't want to
do that by the users of a waiting for
snow globes we likely for personal so it
was phoning that to some metal box and
Tom box has a nice set of abstractions
for this so it uses messenger
upon a kilometer hood and in addition to
the low-level messaging in cars it also
has this high level messaging
obstruction for background of movie
coding for you that should demonstrate
how it works so so much what's key here
is equal to always background she takes
which takes a wife once to a function
and yeah so like one will allow us to
cohabit ready methods in an asynchronous
wait what happens in the background eric
said that it puts the call on on a cube
and burst and possessive asynchronous
tree and instead of instead of
processing the method synchronous me it
just always background backs it so that
the function returns the future so we
are actually able to interact with the
results of the of the function call in
an async working in our case we we
didn't need to need to handle the
results from the video processing here
directly because we just finished ADHD
response and then so that asynchronously
but it's actually possible okay so the
last piece it was classic / so I
successor as a server for ya searching
in document or interest I'm unstructured
Jason documents basically miss Beldon
was seen and as a nice TV i thi sao us
it's only tenant for wanting a
distributed index for full-text search
it's it's nowadays also pretty pretty
usable for ya stowing scheme others
documents which is what we did so we've
analyzed six versus the only background
right back end without additional
database so yeah what's it intended for
big data purposes I was also kind of
usable force in this tiny data example
so again ve set up with each one key
case maybe ice pretty good work with and
also for the 800 ish we just we need we
index it had a very small name own
footprints which wasn't want us to
because we
restricted no only knows which said one
gigabyte for money and yeah so the data
we need to store watching Billy that's
complicated this was our data modem so I
see kind of well Esther I think Lex what
we saw in formerly a statistical
prescription which is the extra work
presentation of the office of design
yeah we can so these transcriptions
should be searchable I've happened that
we only we also use flagging and sagging
yeah flame means we have a fixed set of
criteria in our case that was a little
checkboxes Volga insult so somebody
submitted something like that we
probably wants to know in order to be
enough XP with that later but in
addition to that we also named said
taking so said we want to want a
flexible fertilization which is
potentially future proof we reused taken
to allow the user to as data birthdays
are filled with the NP so as I said let
such as otherwise it using Jace no wait
HTTP API this is some heavy that is made
in the background when we searched for
hello for example just give it a match
Querrey searching over the transcript
you filled with the content of hell and
we
so filter using the boolean filters
master must not so he owns that what we
do to induce you deal with video upload
and you probably want to make we get up
out of there and we also employ our
flagging mechanisms so we excuse
installs vago transcriptions and casual
works by default and yeah so this is
just a just Jason and if you're working
with dynamic languages like Ruby your
JavaScript that really allows for for
signals in top form your data models so
yeah p.m. we were pretty pretty easily
able to develop a small abstraction of
the searching process just civilizing
our data models and learning the query
like that there's still bit more some
some lab you love as we also use and
they don't just want to whoop dimensions
popinjay guess for the for video
playback with postpartum support on the
back inside you use the VSS gem or which
is a teaser for building main model
basically so which is a really really
nice thing it's it's been extracted out
of the retina program and some recent
events one by also to Ruby and beyond
ours to enjoy yourselves check it out
for and for doing the actual video
conversion
we just use the custom retro one debate
so known as ffmpeg and maybe you'll
notice on the only stock HP we show the
shop english translations for the german
transcriptions and I've done using the
business data API ok so that's so far
form for the technology step just won't
leave you with some impressions of ours
I'm spending the platform so the way
it's Rumble is a yield on that stuff
every year in a distributed master we
don't get together but actually happens
all the world's their customers love for
you and this year I think God have them
up the teams that is educated in edina
one ahem and because it's distributed um
it once basically once from saturday is
he won't be able to sunday protium so we
so this is what the schedule of boss due
to the internal differences we were we
were able to start on sunday morning
anything able to start and that takes
always humble me too i do its get access
to me to the production environment so
that give you like the little box ways
in boston destroyed if I have to do and
then get the y axis to the github we're
both yesterday what I wanted yeah so we
didn't but I say as well they said young
o our fourth team member he was working
 so cannot get with me guys I'm goin
we can't stuck to the goin schedule
started on Saturday was 9am and we then
did our final image on Sunday around
11pm p.m. yes holiday so young another
disadvantage due to the time zone
differences but it was so we didn't say
I can see we didn't use like all the all
the 48 hours because a low we still got
some sleep in between so that was good
but maybe if you want to do a full
workup on the clock a kind of scheme
just just shut up some people to some
other locations wouldn't be so some some
suggestions from our side for position
taking an exponent this better so it's
really something that we fully prepare
ourselves low to the best extent birds
the second imagine if you're near 48
hours cutting features early and
aggressive slightly important so you
could already think about what the
essential user-driven within your ok
this and then prioritize based on that
if you can to avoid complex features for
example doing user sessions right from
the start because they're going to set
your time forward for the more fleshly
of parts of the application and you
should also consider for the way to
rumble there wasn't probably volcania so
today's after the final for the
competition in it all the caps were
released to public audience for with you
and since yeah 250 apps were there
people didn't really spend much time
application so estimate about under 10
seconds that you have to amaze potential
quarter and therefore the possibility on
self explaining explaining at most many
many of the contestants bagels and kind
of guided tour yeah guide the user of
food a google journey they wanted to
have and yup equation for us also meant
for example be downloading the the
videos from the dts-wiki in order to
have some demo content available
although time is really limited which
suggests that you don't like fully drop
your your craftsmen skills even an
expression with boss men's integrating
movies so probably you useful feature
one all that work one coming giving long
morning future watches that's that's
maybe okay and in some cases but falling
for people and in 48 hours is for me
you everyone is just on master and then
you have much confidence where two
people are you up depending on the time
of the night also continuous deployment
is really handy so a lot of teams in the
West one will wait and see their rage
tweets what minutes before the deadline
when they are like hey Singley trying to
get that you first group running or
pushing out the latest changes and some
enough to not run into that situation
that you built your evidence all working
locally will be fine deploy a white home
start it is set up space and deploy
regularly even though that means that
your workspace from time to time but so
it would be we may believe you if you
look a little nicer and then just
because the deployment phase you cannot
show to the puppet and yeah we got in
testing I mean that's a photo time most
of the times and you probably make some
compromises there but if you feel
compromised then still you should focus
your testing on the only most attention
of functionality so it's all really nice
but if you push you up and then
after the deadline when what your server
excesses is lofted you cannot push
anymore that is covering like an
exceptional exceptional about directly
at the phone that kind of sucks and
wouldn't be just worth the EV 48 hours
you just spend and also seeing so in the
end is for fun so the vice yourself we
had a good eight or nine hours of sleep
in between and this was really woke me
at least pretty good as you get back in
the morning your wash mine you'll be
more protected me and acuity stuff I
would have sleep in defeat for us it
worked out pretty fine on the way that
we were able to get most most of the
essential functionality done on day one
so we have the day to for completing the
apartment for polish so if you can oh
that's pretty good I know just for one
 so summing up now we here with
this one type of the education but we
really really yummy to continue the work
on see me speak as online dictionary for
sign languages because we will feel
there's some there's potentially of
people programmers coming together with
so say the main experts of of sign
language to really build it up wherever
their city so if you know people then if
you speak sign language but if you know
people that speak sign language would be
also making pointed to two day just
because I'm size because not only
possible being able to have this week
office that's enough to Iceland's
to have and people can build to start
with a build a P ice on top of the cool
stuff that would be awesome again I
should all do yeah pretty just bootstrap
based phone and qualified any feedback
or any any help we appreciate it but are
we were just put in the need of coming
up with a better design basically we're
ramping aux and yeah I'm so if you like
check out the comments on github we're
eager to continue with that and given
three that's a curious on a project and
you are so much years yeah four three
two approaches we here for the evening
and no we didn't know what companies we
actually want our Austin so we may make
the ACE play and so with the hosting for
free for a year basically cover the
matter and we built a lot of the project
for fun currently
say one thing about media streamer
corner and all the polyfills currently
they cool so fun that hopefully I'll be
culture don't use them in production for
example the compression of the video is
for a ball so this three-second video is
about 1.8 megabytes that's where your
problem is not very snappy let's cool to
look at and it will definitely improve
in future and for currently enough time
to do on the side even know that there
is like more languages so it's just one
yeah that's the first thing I explained
everyone so I Makoto which means to
charge over death adult so my parents
are there and every time I speak with
someone about Simon sign language the
first thing I explained is it is
different even in Germany so I can I
can't a father or father this is the
same word but it's a different different
sign and all the coffee on your sponsor
me it's like a normal anguish Norman
languages have dialects and sign
language as well because it's a living
language also they someone invents a new
sign and it gets adopted somewhere when
it's changing and stuff like that
and why did you choose movie good point
I like more than 10 years 9 now I'm also
involved in the movie jobin 80 runs
rights girls now I was here is now I
think we actually didn't take too many
experience on the on the technology side
as i said i run the association groups
and thinking massive search was actually
just take something with you quick too
useful also with the torque box for the
reason that it has back and processing
built in immediately after the core
without setting up if you and stuff like
this and for four years and the boarding
thing i have to say or thoughts yeah
it's good for chemical element so the
psycho soldier was specific for for this
room here in Berlin because of the shape
is and the usual way is to say family to
one that's one way to say but that one
is physically to to the shape of the
building
in sign language you all you tried to
shave or thai language 44 countries it's
the things that are very unique for the
country for example Derby read it with
this for the Netherlands because of the
of the health of the Netherlands cheese
girl with the sign for them or you pick
very very significant things about
purses for some if he can search for
mirka yeah oh yeah I can show the
problem is you can't spell the name all
the time so the name would you can
pronounce the name with a little bit but
you don't do that if you would fluent
talks are you usually what you do is we
use you pronounce the name and let you
say okay this name is this sign and
usually take something that's very
unique to that person for example for
Merkel there are two possible sides
equal to one sign language speakers
would think about this as the language
because this is what she always does but
you don't want to do that because in
sign language that means vagina so you
don't
something different oh transamerica
do this because she she always knows
actually sad so the answer me sir
meeting a friend of my father has no
that far because of an accident this
sign language things this arms that can
get really really need which you are a
little bit other way to you can have
your sign language meaning to do this
you eat the fat guy or is the pin guy oh
yeah how it's doing it Johnny depends on
where you are but most of the times
Jeremy is what you found out the world
is really important actually reason why
I come on this project is because I try
to learn sign language and I did
yeah beside your technical and tummy
bomb is the same if you don't have a
look at the mouth yeah there were there
were four examples questions ways
whether with you'd use like motion
detection or user is a kinect camera
leap motion to kind of have time to text
translation stuff like that but as turns
out they were a research project
protocol and trying to tell time but as
the estimate is an important conveyor of
information for sign oh it's a conveyor
of context you cannot really do do that
without an end given the resolution of
these systems these days probably not
that easily yes so what you see I think
it 12 weeks ago when to press everyone
shown it to me it was a video of a
research project of Microsoft Microsoft
japan with their connect or they did the
sign language translation with with the
Kinect system and from for someone who
can speak sign language I can say this
completely it's not not working
it's not practical because of the it's
not only their hands that are important
and the Kinect is not the resolution of
the Kinect is not high enough to to have
the fingers in the system they only do
their hands and some of them if you do
two fingers it's big enough for them but
what simples fast movements of all
fingers the kinect can't do that so what
they do is they they guess with the
movement of the hands of the of the arms
to the sign language and if you have and
if you have passed sign language
with the fingers affairs and it also
fails if you knew if you need the demand
for it so sign language combines the
hands the mouth the yoga complete body
is in the sign language so if you want
to to be to show some angry birds you
have to have to take your body sometimes
or media in your mouth and your eyes and
stuff like ants it's a complete money
that's also some reason why this sharp
it were to really see the whole person
is one thing if you see if you have
through the videos it's also quite
interesting to see how the gestures
looks on the side so that actually be
fed away improving this so there are
some some parts of this cop is that we
have that
transform from anthem site at the same
time but our goal was making it easier
for people that just have enough for
their and some time to just hit the
button and make a video immediately
because I think the biggest problem of
the wiki page is really that the whole
production process is far too elaborate
you need a camera you need to get the to
get active need to get a video off you
need to convert it to something that the
D key ones and then for the tag and
stuff like this so this was the thing
they wanted to be both is this project
for that people to understand each other
or for us to learn or what is there in
you basically to provide what's there
for everyone else like a dictionary and
the dictionary I think most people I or
gap standard dictionary of China's well
although i speaking dictionary and also
to find like different I don't know this
then both German wisely saying in an
hour speaking of sign language what
would you guys used to create a 48-hour
you working day office and and I chilly
a guy called it via Skype and his agenda
connection both we were so okay um the
pup year we did actually present some
stuff for discussion so that he actually
no it's about he's not most because what
I would consider myself capable but it
was fun when we first got a recording
working and sitting birthday camera
isn't doing yeah we had on inside there
and held him against the white boy where
our first always wear it now because it
has some good features i can actually
tell you what else is doing tiny
features that make in more interesting
like translating all all only had your
words but we knew that most people that
you judge it would be english-speaking
so we that's the reason why we built in
the translation
all the words like this and also to
waste time on pitches it runs on five of
us except when he recorded all the
reason that I you know yeah just two
things the good thing is you're talking
about dialect but yeah I didn't actually
see like dialect like to box in your
videos define language books that you
can say okay Molly yogi okay so I mr.
Finney me but for another race i would
so we had a we had comes by fox40 on the
