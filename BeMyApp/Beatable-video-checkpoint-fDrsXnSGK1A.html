pieces are falling into place I sort of
have some gravity of the game and the
calculator around a bit nicer bringing
different elements the defect generating
the level from the song is coming along
as it's not there yet like it's going to
be a case of going to be playable you
know just before we have to demo but you
know it's getting a bit do you want to
show us a little bit yep
it's not the latest version but last
night's demo
there's some sounds like coolest thing
in the world I guess the demo isn't too
much further along than we so basically
we'll be adding to that is these stars
images that reaction is reclaiming need
to collect as hard as you can based on
the song positive random but w/e 10
songs and actually feel so so is that
what you guys will be working on before
the before the demo tonight ads will be
the part yeah that's what we get that's
the big innovation actual song
although we actually young you know we
decent night's sleep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
