talk about some terminology virtual
reality is a huge concept and it
sometimes gets mixed up with the
augmented reality so let's separate
those two virtual reality is being
immersed in a different reality just you
know with a head-mounted displays you
know jack all my senses up to the grid
sense touch feel everything as much as
you can and this is one school of
thought that's probably more geared
towards gamers towards people who want
to escape reality have completely
different experiences somewhere else
where it's augmented reality is a
different school of thought it's more
get out of my way I just want something
to to add to my day-to-day life but I
don't want anything to get in my way
Google glass was not a super success but
the idea there was also too you know
don't let technology get in the way then
another different axis is accessibility
and they're pretty closely related to
augmented reality and virtual reality so
augmented reality is often stuff that's
easy to use easy to pick up it's a very
mobile not clunky you don't need to set
it up a lot whereas virtuality is often
tends to more be the stationary and a
bit of a threshold to set up and get
started but it's not always the case
then we also have input so some of these
devices and some of these technologies
they they come prepackaged with input
devices and input channels so a quick
example which I'm going to get back to
cardboard for example Google's cardboard
virtual reality stuff where you put in
your mobile phone it virtually just has
one input channel that's one click
whereas the oculus rift once like it in
itself it doesn't have an input but you
connect it to a computer and you get all
the different input devices that you can
connect your computer and then the last
part is cost of course which is a no
brainer
so let me just do a quick run-through of
some of the existing technologies and
talk about their their main points so
cardboard most of you have heard of it
it's very easy to use the the school of
all here is really make it really
accessible I mean this is dirt cheap
that's the like main selling point it's
almost free and it's very easy to pick
up it's not intimidating it looks like
an everyday object but in fact it turns
out to be a virtual reality device it
only tracks rotational movement and as I
said it only takes one click which in
this version is the magnetic flipper
which they replace in a new card board
with a capacitive a little touch button
that you press on the proper your
forehead which touches the touchscreen
on the phone chango another google
project it's still very much in
development but I do have one with me so
you can all look at that later tonight
it is handheld it is a window to a
different reality and I would classify
this as augmented reality because you
don't get immersed in the reality that's
showed on the screen but it does track
everything and it's a basically can put
stuff in there in the virtual world you
can scan a room there's a lot of
different exciting applications for this
and intel intel science is very similar
technology so it's going to be exciting
to see how um how they play out i guess
each other this is definitely something
that's very useful it's very easy to
pick up it's not intrusive and can
easily scan your room and see how your
furniture fits and stuff like that then
where microsoft hololens we saw such a
really cool it project because the main
thing here is that it's a self-contained
system this also is very much in
development but
we'll see where lands in a couple years
it is augmented reality and from what we
heard from user stories who people are
tried it it's actually very good so
that's very exciting just by reflecting
light of projectors on these visors
there's different layers of glass and
plastic and it hits your retina and it
actually feels like a pretty solid
object it's not super transparent as you
might have thought when you hear about
the first time and the oculus rift we
can't have a VR talk without the oculus
rift it is the first flagship of virtual
reality of this generation of us reality
let's remember the virtual reality has
so long history there's not something
new it's not a fad I might be skipping
ahead of my slides here but virtuality
has basically I would argue has has
existed as long as photographer has
existed you can find old pictures online
of people taking stereo photography
photos from like the the 19th century
and you can view them still today you
know just cross your eyes or take one of
these viewers where you basically
cardboard and look at the picture it is
fantastic that people from even then
wanted to immerse themselves in a
different setting different reality I
think escaping from our day-to-day life
is something very fundamental to the
human experience and so it comes and
goes in waves but our expectation is is
very much higher than technology I can
deliver and so that's why we see in
these absent flows of virtual reality
technology has tried to like enthusiasts
to try to push the limits and make
virtuality come to us by technology has
not caught up yet and I think today
what's happening with this continued
peak of our elit interest is that
technologists finally reached some sort
of minimal accepted limit for what what
people are expecting it and what what
technology is delivering an auto service
was one of the first two to reach that
minimal level a different
virtual reality headset is gear VR which
is basically a super jacked up cardboard
it has more input there's a touch pad on
the side so you can get clicks and mouse
movements and stuff and you can navigate
menus with that it is a bit more pricey
of course that you can tell from the
image given and it's also only
compatible with one samsung phone that
connects with a connector inside this so
you take this plastic piece off and then
you plug on your phone and with the
piece back the phone recognizes that
it's connected to the gear VR and
basically you can start your experience
so a very quick sketch like trying to
put these different technologies on the
on the different axis and I was talking
about immersion input costs and
accessibility and without trying to be a
fanboy I think cardboard is very
interesting because it's marchand
extreme were both accessibility and
immersion it has almost the same
immersion as LSD oculus rift at least
for the first few minutes until you
realize that for me for the rift yes
tracking for for moving your head and
and the cardboard only has rotational
movement so that's definitely gonna kind
of it you're going to feel that for a
while but they still it's super flexible
accessible and yeah and also let's not
forget that we also have so this is what
all of these things are consumer side on
the producer side we have stuff
happening also we have the the newly
announced jump rig which is a super
advanced a set up of a lot of 16 16
GoPro cameras and the interesting here
is that they saw the super hard
mathematical equation or like i'm not i
don't know the teachers at please don't
ask me but what they've done basically
is that it's not only a 360 spherical
panorama that's being filmed they also
get the stereoscopic 3d at the same time
as a guy
the spherical 360 so this stuff you will
be able to film environments and film
stuff and then enter the virtual reality
with stereoscopic 3d and look around and
you will see the depth in any direction
you look at so this is definitely going
to be a big content provider and I'm
sure one of the first of many like it to
come all right where to start so it's
actually much easier than you might
think I think a lot of people they hear
about VR and this like okay whatever
it's like out there don't really they
can't really relate to it how it relates
to your everyday work but uh I'm sure
many of you know that unity has great
support for virtual reality and all of
these technologies basically they
provide a unit EST case which again it's
easier than you think it sounds at least
when you think about is the case in the
classical sense it's a bit clunky these
SDKs are just asset packages of some
scripts and a camera that you just drag
and drop into your scene and boom it
works so it's really easy and I
encourage you all to even if you don't
have these devices I encourage you all
to just dip your foot in it and download
the SDK stride with your existing unity
projects or open an example project just
drag one of these assets in and see what
it looks like you get like a fake
virtual reality rendering on your screen
what happens is that the the cameras
rendered to a canvas and with the right
and left camera on each side and and
that's what's rendered to the device so
when you look at half the like half
screen one eye and have half the other
eye so it's not something like you don't
have to trick the phone into like okay
this is a VR setup it's it's
stereoscopic node like you just render a
surface with the right and left image
it's not harder than that so I encourage
you all to to try that the fun thing
here which shall we touch upon soon
again is like I said the side
it up with this like zero scopic 3d
rendering that's easy what's fun
especially with the devices with more
limited input is coming up with cool you
is and ways for the user to interact
with the world and actually let me get
back to that for my showcase but the the
essence here is that loss can be done
you're very sick you have just one click
and the directional direct the direction
of the players I guess so you know what
what can you do when we all know that
restriction is the mother of innovation
so so that's fun fun to play around with
to the showcase so some of you might
have heard that there was a conference
or an event at kth a couple of months
back called tekla it was aimed for kids
to develop technology and just get
interested get them interested in
technology what Google did we did a
workshop on virtual reality where we
created a simple virtual environment and
we let the kids sit down and lap by lap
tops and play around with it do some
simple tasks like create a ball and make
it fall down try to try to walk around
in this world and see what you can find
they loved it it was it was a big hit
and well developed so we did a lot of
work like we didn't want them just get a
clean slate and then do everything that
was the first step but then we also like
booster them to chill more complete
environment so they could see something
more pretty which actually wasn't so
like dinner turn out what the way we
thought because they they had so much
joy and just creating their own stuff
from this clean world so we actually
ended up with a lot of different weird
worlds not just our own but anyway so
when we develop the that environment we
started thinking about okay so so we
only have the player gaze and we only
have this environment we want to let
them move around but how can we move let
them move around if we don't have input
for movement so one classical way to do
this in cardboard cases is to have an
object that the user can look at
and then if they look at it for two
seconds they start walking and then you
look at it again and stop working where
did the the big mistake or the ugly ugly
version of it is creative big ball in
the Indus guy that turned red when you
looked at it and was white when you
didn't look at it I'm not very proud of
that it was super undone creative but it
did get us thinking about how to how do
how do you be creative about these
things and and one thing that I started
thinking about afterwards like maybe you
could have something really smart and
try to see try to interpret that place
intent so you could look down on your
arm or your watch and maybe there you'd
see something come up to watch your gaze
onion you can look at it and then you
could turn you gaze away and it will
fall back stuff like that I think
there's definitely a lot of creative
stuff you can do there so and UI UI for
VR before limited input vr is I think
that's definitely one like huge thing
that we're a lot of things can will
happen so I encourage you again please
go go be those pioneers this is what the
world looked like that they and there's
the big nice ball in the sky that
doesn't make sense please come and look
at this on the showcase if you're
interested in more details is it worth
it I would say yes it is get involved
into virtual reality invest some time
look up the SDKs sorry I need my votes
look up there's the case like I said
virtual reality is it's not a fad it's
here to stay this time around I don't
think it's going to go away this time
around it's definitely reached
technology technological level where the
minimum requirement is met for for at
least the early adopters and that's
going to grow more interest more
interest grows more developers and more
developers grossed more technology so I
think we just now broken even on the on
the vicious cycle of no described i
don't know i'm not interested on like a
nervous time of this
and it never reached the critical mass
before this time around it does and
we're going to see like even even if
there's a lot more to do spit on both
the technological side and and on the
innovate innovative side with interfaces
it's definitely I think it's like
feeding itself at this point so it's
it's a race and yeah please get on it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
