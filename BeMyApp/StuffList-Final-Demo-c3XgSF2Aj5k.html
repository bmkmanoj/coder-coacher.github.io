what happens if everyone everybody own
stuff everybody who has a will or a
trust has to create crucial memory
cancel that Bullard trust that explain
17 years of a party
look the way I feel today 34 doesn't
even cover the world of technology next
thing I'm all your review their job is
pretty obsolete escape its pen they give
you a paper nigga home and say mate
every time an attitude to hear every
time flying the people you have to
update you have to sit back in is all
done with a dream so here comes the
stuff test so a stepless is a personal
app that it's impossible to build in
bridgemill property list and you create
a personal from target memorandum then
they spendin a key because you have
documented as that's in the documented
communi- so how do I make yourself let's
go around the house today and if you
have this bag of it from your lawyer
utility and foot or you can use stepless
cephalus lovely take your camera
whatever have school clique makes
picture uploaded click filter nation
quick Pancham by the way through this
personal property memorandum and not
only didn't a human family happy we make
your boyfriend your we're actually
building a platform that allows us to
store all our stuff on and so it's going
to scale all over the web database
tournament everything else is going to
scale up or the lawyer platform or
nursing facility and current facilities
as well as in the end consumer who wants
a snapshot the information that they
have within their home their possessions
so to speak so we're out today it's
looking at building a profile that is
basically your identity and it's
containing all the beneficiaries all the
people who are in your wife you want to
get your stuff to as what allows all the
items within your life and where they're
stored out what's in your safe once in
your safety deposit box who's getting
Brown is crockpot by all these different
elements and where the story at Andrews
gonna get them and so what we try to do
here
not do everything under the Sun but
simply provide a simple easy-to-use tool
people consider walk around the house
and capture the information and Kathy
Park a few moments ago about a toast and
jam packed with all the pictures we have
the big finale a net it's coming but we
have done this currency build our days
are framer our back-end that's going to
store the information categorized
where's adapters are going to then we
have the papers in outward because the
biggest and the more credit is this not
just at the pictures we have to scale to
any number of different platforms
whether it's mobile whether it's web
whether it's like ad then we also have
to be able to back though maybe I have
photographs up out of how digital
ventures I can scan those and so that's
when the problems that we're trying to
solve but I think what we've done here
is a very good progressive starting
point in getting in where we going to
sort things out we're almost through
more
we have these items in you know all
these items you think about you know
what something you have in your house
solve a problem to take an ancient
industry into a digital age god I like
for you when you leave her</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
