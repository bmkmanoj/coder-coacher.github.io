personal website so i'm a drupal
developer northern islands I've been in
brother probably for about a year in
total that only recently has it kind of
being programmed with some treatment but
I'm gonna stay in Berlin because I'd
like to do so I I kind of I do a lot of
drupal stuff all the time so he lots of
drew pecans to accounts and I make a
living free to do good but I i was at
rubicon Denver so that was maybe two
years ago we think and the the
chairperson from Mozilla was there
during a keynote and she was talking
about Mozilla and persona this new
silent system so I thought that sounded
pretty interesting and then after after
a couple of years I thought well I help
check it out and it developed into
something so i made a module for drupal
so you could actually sign into drupal
with with mozilla persona and two weeks
ago I was a bride for the drupalcon I
gave a session and crying with the
developer from from
persona so he actually did most of the
work I'm very was very nice because he
actually left two slides on my laptop so
I'm just going to use those
so this is a screen shot from 25 years
ago probably know why weren't you in the
password then that's a screenshot that I
username password doesn't really change
very much in 25 years and of course we
all know the problems with a caesarean
if you go to your website and you have
to give that website your password is
all all kinds of problems they might
just record your password and your email
address and that if they want to do
something bad they try and log in to
other websites with credentials and or
it may be there maybe they're doing the
right things are hashing the password
but still someone can break into their
database and most people have very weak
passwords which means of you and with
the password hashing you can still work
out the password so there's a lot of a
lot of security problems with just
killian password to your website so
these days we have other solutions so
you could have social social sign in
with something like Facebook or Twitter
and you know that solves the problem
quite a lot it means that the website
you're signing energy doesn't have to
store your passwords so that's that's
more secure in a way and there's
downsides to this so know what everybody
wants to use Facebook and maybe you
don't want the website you're signing
into to have access to your face 30 kind
maybe do one Facebook to have access to
the website you're signing into or maybe
you just want to you want to use a
different social service so you know you
can have a lot of buttons if you want
but hopefully hopefully the one you want
to use is there but it means that if
you're building a website you then have
to integrate your website with all these
different services so so this is where
and of course if you come back to the
website
you know you have to remember which
signing you used in the first place and
it may be if you're signing in with
something like Google you know they may
have restrictions so they might say you
have to use your real name what if you
want to you know go on to your website
and do something anonymously maybe you
want to ask some advice but you don't
want your insurance company to find out
of 5 so there's a lot of problems with
the social sign-on ok let me skip
forward a little bit in this
presentation ok so this is kind of a
sort of a brief a brief overview of
fireworks so this is your web browser
that is the website you want to sign
into and this is your identity provider
so that this is how I Mozilla persona
works first of all from the web browser
you type in the email address you want
to sign in with in the web browser it
goes and talks to your identity provider
and it your identity provider will
challenge you to maybe enter your
password or you know give a fingerprint
or something like that or it will read
your brain with some sort of
identification it'll send a certificate
back to the web browser and then the web
browser will create an assertion
cryptographic assertion and send it to
the website the website gets the public
key from your identity provider and then
it can verify the assertion and then it
can it can determine that you're signing
in successfully and once you've done
this once your web browser doesn't need
to keep talking to your to your identity
provider but you know a lot of identity
providers they they don't they don't
support the Mozilla persona protocol so
so what's the solution well Mozilla have
stepped in
so it's kind of the same so first of all
your web browser will go and talk to
your density provider but you know gmail
doesn't support persona yet so it'll
just say sorry I don't support that so
Mozilla will jump in your web browser
will talk to Mozilla and then Mozilla
will emulate it so they're basically if
you do is it can send an email to your
email address just do it the
old-fashioned way you've got to click on
a link in your email and that proves you
you owned it the the email address and
then it continues as before okay so i'm
going to show you demonstration so I
amid the Drupal modules with Drupal is a
framework for building websites and if
you want to if you have a Drupal website
and you want people to sign in with
Mozilla persona you can install the
module and it'll it'll work out of the
box so let's let's try signing in this
is just a demo website that I built okay
so let's let's try a gmail address gmail
doesn't support Mozilla persona so it'll
actually go to gmail and okay it it
happened all by itself I'll show you
another example
I'm actually just going to go into my
makeup my yahoo account and there are
some credentials okay actually this is
the spot okay
play this will probably for password so
there there is a fullback implementation
so it'll work with any email address but
if it's a gmail email address or a yahoo
email address then it'll go through
Mozilla and then they will use some
other technologies like a waft or open
ID to prove that you own the email
address so I just have to type in my
yahoo password
and as easy as that I'm signing and if I
want to sign it again maybe maybe I want
to sign into my my own website to post a
comment my web browser it has remembered
some of the email addresses i use so i
can just I can sign in in in one second
so i'll show you the the drupal module
so this is this is a very standard
Drupal installation I've already
downloaded the module I can I can enable
it
and immediately I gotta I gotta sign in
button just in the in the header region
so if you have a Drupal website you can
you can start using persona straight
away and then there's plugins for lots
of other frameworks so if you're using
WordPress or Joomla or whatever your
favorite is there's a there's a plug-in
for all the different systems and if we
check out the settings page so by
default Drupal has its own
authentication system so that does it
the traditional way where you have a an
email address and a password if you say
sad persona as the only assignment
method then it'll just remove the the
existing system altogether so if I
cyanide there's no longer any user name
and password the only thing I can do is
sign in with the persona
and there's just a couple of other
options so you can can change the button
style might have seen the fair died
effect when I'm signing in so that's
that's optional you can specify the
background color for the authentication
dialog
so if I try signing in it should
hopefully brought me with the with the
color so that's that that's basically
how it works there's a lot more
happening under the covers but it's
meant to be really simple and there's a
lot of advantages to this because you're
kind of you're getting the best of both
worlds it'sit's federated so people
aren't stuck with using which ever you
know whichever social network you want
them to use you don't have the security
problems of managing passwords yourself
so I think it's it's a really good
system and it's it's good for the web to
keep everything federated and based on
on open standards so that's that's about
as far as I've got with that are there
any any questions from anybody yep
constantly correctly that it works out
what email address you're using and then
go sleep on providing i think i think
email address is really the the primary
key of your identity so that's actually
quite a useful concepts in general and
what is its some proprietary email
provider so there's a fullback
implementation so it'll just mozilla
will just send an email to that email
address and you click on the link in
that email so that just does a deal
fashion way if that's the only option
that's that's available
yeah um it's it's really up to the the
website so for example if you've got an
account on a website you might be able
to add more than one email address yeah
in general and you know your your email
address is your identity and so let's
say you work for a company and then you
stopped working for the company so they
switch off your email address that would
mean that you lose access to all of the
coins that using with that email address
so it kind of makes sense but people do
you have to be aware that if they you
know if they do lose access to an email
address then and that could mean they
can't access some of their some of their
accounts doesn't work if you use a
delete cookies and like every browser
yeah so if you really want to be signed
out you can just keep your wipe your
browser or reboot your computer like
what might happen in an internet cafe so
that's that's really if you want to be
signed odd you should wipe your cookies
and then you can always sign back in
again because you can always prove that
you you own an email address so that's
kind of what it hinges upon but you have
to like let my cookies exist when I
close the browser to use azula like
continuously on my own personal computer
or can i delete my cookies and I think
if you know if you're if you're sign in
to your website you have to maintain the
cookies but you know if you sign on to
the website and you do want to be signed
in until the next day then you could
delete your cookies and then you could
just sign it again it might mean that
you have to type in your yahoo password
or your gmail password again any any
other questions
I can show you a quick demo of something
else so in in Drupal there's actually
there's a lot of different distributions
of Drupal you can use so that means if
you want to build an e-commerce site for
example you can use commerce kickstart
which is just a drill installation with
lots of modules pre-configured to to be
an e-commerce shop and so I've i've
installed mozilla persona on on this
website so that's let's say I just want
to buy something i'll buy this bottle so
I've put it in my cart and I just want
to check out so I want to I want to sign
into my account I want to I want to give
them my email address i want to prove
that I owned the email address so i
click sign in my web browser already has
proof that I I own some email addresses
so i select the one I want to use I
click Sign In and then I've become sign
in to the website it's transferred my my
cart from the anonymous session into a
user session so I think this is this is
a really great flu for signing into your
website it means that people don't have
to go and check the email or do you
anything complicated like that it's just
two clicks to get signed in so it helps
with your your funnel yeah just
it just don't really get is Teddy to you
were logged out a moment ago it was
nothing no login and you just click sign
out sign in you just click the email and
you're logged in with no credentials so
no password is an old story so it helped
you know when you are locked out from
the website you go to facebook as they
go down and you can use your friends you
can expect them not to be able to again
just click in so what what you can do is
when you're on the sign-in dialog you
can click this is not me and whenever
you click that that just it deletes all
your credentials from the web browser so
so once you've done that you is this
sort of like a lower level security or
and you said you wanted to change your
profile settings or something like that
would they require the password again
because this could be a security oh and
can you explain your body bit more I'm
on a public computer and so if let's
let's let's say you are using the web on
a public computer and then you you're
finished so you want to walk away and
you just want to clear your credentials
if you if you click on that this is not
me button and that that just deletes the
credentials from from the web browser so
if someone then came to that web browser
and wanted to sign in there will be
there will be new credentials for them
so I have to rely on my customers
clicking this is not me after they've
signed out this is no different it's
it's it's always like that in a web
browser yeah you have to I mean is it
the same if you
or something but the problems like to
later you have to slow down from the
application and then kind of formal gown
from persona to your blog from
everything so so this is this is the
bootstrap implementation so the idea is
that it's all handled by your web
browser at the moment new web browsers
support the API so this is actually a
JavaScript polyfill but it's it's meant
to be a direct connection from from your
web browser to your identity provider
and to the website you're signing into
and so eventually Mozilla would actually
be involved at all it'll just be a
protocol that anyone can can implement
but in general you know if you even if
you sign out from a website you still
have to clear your browser otherwise
someone can just sign strip back in
again and because and because well what
okay if you didn't click the button you
know please please remember my password
but even if you do to ask funny if you
did it in browser than the usual bahria
I want to render this but you did that
book thing but i think is usually when
you click logout is cookie Marcus
invalid server side and that's it
there's no way you're getting
again would be nice maybe maybe it's a
setting to say when I log out clean my
session I don't want to be remembered I
think like whenever there's an
enterprise or implementation or it could
just be like a big sign up button that
just fits on the web browser but at the
moment if you click Sign Ives and you
still have to click on through this is
not me just to basically wipe your web
browser and I'm supposed because it's
you're not signing into each website
individually you're you're making sure
that your web browser has cryptographic
proof that you own an email address so
it's kind of it's a different thing so
either your web browser can prove that
you own an email address or a cat
whether or not that specific website
things that you're signing at all isn't
really relevant from I'm from security
point of view yep could there be an
initial request from the site using
persona like before i place order with
shopping cart they ask for confirmation
by password or I made this tense
purchase like confirm with passport that
you're you and that you actually perform
this action so at the moment it's just a
brief that you an email address but if
if you want to do something substantial
like if you're signing in to your online
banking and you want to make a
transparent to purchase something
expensive it might be that the website
should then have something else and just
to like an extra form of Education just
too
that you're you know just how about the
greater I gotta create a pretty fact
that you are to use that young but I at
the moment that's not in the school
any any other
okay so i think i can rather so thanks
for listening and hopefully you'll get
persona we go on your next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
