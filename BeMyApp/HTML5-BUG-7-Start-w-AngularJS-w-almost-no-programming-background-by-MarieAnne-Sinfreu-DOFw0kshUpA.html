talk to you about angularjs and I will
try to explain it to you in a way that
is really easy because when I started to
use it I was not a programmer and treat
when I started using angularjs I only
knew this so Photoshop InDesign and all
the tools for of a web designer HTML CSS
a lot of less also and my knowledge in
programming where were only jquery saw a
little bit of JavaScript that but a lot
of debris and I was using a lot of
plugins so it was the whole it was using
things that were that were already
existing and not really programming so
yes I had a little bit of JavaScript
knowledge but what I will show you now
is how to learn in from flooding from
really zero yeah so today I'm a junior
front-end developer and I'm using it i'm
using so angularjs every day it's my
main tool and i'm developing web mobile
app so i had to learn all this new
vocabulary I never heard about before so
like Opie NBC this module directive
classes and prototypes this yeah all
these new words were completely strain
and strange to me so what is angular
angular is a JavaScript framework maybe
you heard of anger GS or backbone GS
there are also other JavaScript
framework really popular but an angular
is its particularity that is based on
the
see framework busy pattern torrents and
this will allow you to build be really
well structured browser side application
and it's created by google so you had
you have a lot of documentation a lot of
actually the documentation itself it's a
little bit crappy but if you have a lot
of a big community around angular devil
and help you to to deal with your
problems so i will talk about a little
bit of a messy patterns because i didn't
know what it was at all when i started
and i will talk about it in javascript
point of view so please see programmer
don't show that means this stands for
model view controller and when you
realize a nap you need you have a data
sorry so your data is your model so in
JavaScript a data object can be a string
a JSON file an API a lot of things and
then you have your view so your view is
your HTML file inside of you you will
display your data and in and then you
have your controller is the link between
the two it will allow you to it's your
program it's what yeah it's not allow
your data to display to be displayed in
the room explained it pretty easily so i
have an example in pure JavaScript so
for example my model here is a string so
a true the string is the basic kind of
model you can find then in your view you
have a title and I want a button to
click and
on to click on it and when you click on
the button your controller will tell
your view to change and to take them
into take the new string and to replace
it so it's really basic stuff and it's
the basic well I don't anything to say
sorry and then so s triangular in anger
its particularity is that the view and
the model are are updating and stenting
him so for example here I am putting a
string into this input file and the view
update instantly so this is the
particularity of angular it's it's is
way of binding and both ways data
binding between the view and the model
and to do that we only only need sorry
we only need two lines so that in your
view in your HTML you have the input
field with this ng model that link to
the view so the curly brackets will call
the ng model attributes and this is the
way you link the two values so when we
start when you want to create your own
API that you only need one file so you
don't know the file angularjs on the
website then you call it in your in the
head of your of your of your index dot
HTML then you initialize your API you're
up sorry by calling here the ng-app
attribute and this is it you have
our first hot running and then you have
to create your all the other files it's
your job to create the index.html of
course and all the controllers and all
the views you will need so the template
that will be called the CSS there's
nothing else to download its it's all
your work to it all you're doing sorry
is not against and you have to create
all the rest because it's a question I
ask myself when I started because a lot
of framework came with a big folder of
other information of fires and with
angular we had nothing I just had this
file and I I didn't know what to do with
this end because I was really started
from the also and then I realized I had
to create everything so that's why I
precise hear what hear you have to do so
how does angular works well that's two
comes to really strong concept to
understand the telescope and directed
what the other a lot of other concept
but i will just extend this to to you so
the scope in JavaScript well the scope
is where viable and the functions viable
Xander functions are accessible and in
one and in sorry I would just explain my
example I like examples okay well maybe
I speak too fast and please enter me if
you have any questions so the scope it's
Y variables and functions are accessible
and it's a context in which you can
execute them for example in my
JavaScript I have this variable that is
declare in the root at the root of
the script so this variable is global
but this viable l is declare inside the
function that means that you you will
only access it inside the function so
inside the scope read so which so if I I
don't know if that work
so in my example we alerted the local
viable unload and this viable create an
error as you can see so yet this alert
create an error because the elf viable
is not it's not global so this is the
the idea of scope in JavaScript so now
Donna scope well done' scope is the same
idea that means that it's a context with
between love you and the end up
controller but it's here it's an object
that communicates between your view and
your controller so how to use called
Dora scope offers in your in your view
you have to define here your ng
attribute ng-controller attribute and
define the controller on this div and
everything that will be inside this tip
will be the scope matching the function
example to a controller in your
controller javascript fine and so that
was called only a dollar scope inside
this function only well only access the
scope inside this teeth so here I chose
I chose to use the same name with the
two controllers so dollar scope say
hello and i have two different
controllers and two different values to
this property cielo and the result is in
my controller a and my controller me the
results are different there's no
conflicts the scopes are all separated
so directives so directives are the cool
way and this is the coolest things in
angular it's the cool way of learning
HTML to do things and it's the thing
with with you will play a lot so there's
two kinds of directives the one the ones
angular provides and the ones you can
create yourself so don't try to create
your directive right now you can i've
been using angular for three months and
i started create creating i started to
create my own directives two weeks ago I
didn't need to create my own darkest
before but it's really funny now that I
know how to do it and how to learn how
to do it too to do it so how did I how
do they look like well actually you
already so some of them so the ND app
the ng-controller our directives
everything that starts with angie is a
engineer dash is a directive created by
that angular provide and the slideshow
tag is also a directive so you can
create a diuretic that look that look
like an element or a class at or class
or even a comment i think but i really
never used this kind of i mean i never
used them I never had to use them for
now the ones i create usually are
attributes or elements so my favorite
directives are of course the ng app and
in ng-controller because i have to use
them to assign the behavior of my scopes
like i explained then the ng model that
I
already talked about when I explained
really quickly that when I write my name
in the input field I the anger to do
well the ng model tells angular to do
both way that are binding that's the
that's a also directive so ng hide
ng-show are attributes you can put on
the elements and with with an expression
inside attribute will that would be true
or false the element would be hidden or
will be displayed so this is really cool
and actually it's really easy I mean
when I used it for the first time I was
really amazed that you could do a thing
that that ask you a lot of lines even it
in jquery to display or just hide an
element trying to say well if something
is bigger and that displayed or hide it
and here it's just an attribute with an
expression in it then my other favorite
directive is ng repeat when you have an
array of items you can repeat your your
items I would just show the example it
would be easier here i have a list of of
pilots and this list I didn't write it
all by by myself I just used one hat you
attribute here I try to select it and ng
repeat and I go my my array of pilots
and so pilots its pilots is actually an
existing object array but pilot is the
item that will be created each tire to
each
to each end in the in the rain so so
this is the really cool part of angular
because I have to deal with an API all
day and with a lot a lot a lot of object
an array and I use this ng repeat all
the time this is so easy and then my
last example it's a little bit more
complex it's a calculator with ng hide
ng-show and ng model so here if you have
Q yay so how does that work so I initial
8 in my controller the value of zero
because if I don't do that my input are
empty and my value isn't is equal no in
here you can imagine there's nothing in
the input and and yeah the result is no
so i initialize the value of of the
input to zero then in my view um I will
do all the the calculation inside of you
I don't need I don't even need to
program something in the controller and
to say well yeah I had I can do
everything inside the HTML so as I
explained earlier here i have my to div
element with the NGO ng ng height and
directives and that will only be
displayed if the someone will be
displayed that will be displayed if they
are true so this ng show will be
displayed if by one and you say time
time Val Val to greater than 10 10 and
the other one will just hide if it's
greater than 10 so so this is it that
was a really short introduction to to
angularjs and this is my favorite
website to looking for more informations
and actually does a pretty pretty cool
website here and Alex that gives you a
little a lot of example a lot of really
simple examples that makes you train
with a lot of directives um then what
this is this one Trudy and 22 MVC is a
website also that allows you to create a
to-do list in angular and in pure
JavaScript and in jquery and and with
every frame JavaScript framework it's a
website that make you it's to allow you
to decide which framework you want to
use they made the exact same up with a
lot of different tools so just really
nice to stop using angular because it's
a real simple example to well we'll just
talk briefly about our angularjs group
intervene if you want to join the
angularjs group we are really few right
now so we have a lot of interesting
discussion and the next meeting is this
wednesday so so thank you and oh fun
with
so use it to the website on also us harm
I mean Ariana native apps um well you
can't use it to use to make native apps
but what I'm doing right now is I'm from
developing mobile application for iPhone
and I'm using phonegap to embed this
application in the in Xcode you said
make a mobile website so is it the
ingredients on how does it perform mama
uh right now pretty good it's a it's a
fast and it's not actually the problems
can come from phonegap but on the yeah
we only try with phonegap we didn't try
the on the browser we didn't try it on
water but but it's really fast
yes how does it work together from
chairs
there's a well you are you using fun
camp you know what it's yeah your
application it's just a index with as I
shown here my own application is that is
dead in the same type of organization so
I just copy this and put it on the Wi-Fi
folder of hunger and it isn't working in
this is the cool thing about manga is
that it does everything for you doesn't
provide a way to access like the lotus
Orisha phone before the html5
environment or instead no native way to
like a referencing making the model with
the local storage fee I don't know this
is a question that we didn't talk about
yet and i'm working with the back in the
rubber and in this kind of big question
day yeah i think there's a way to
provide some sort of a data provider so
you define data provider somebody will
be like your lower layers and I'm
supposed to just come to what I like
PhoneGap done right it's just JavaScript
you do whatever they want on that has it
I can hope for that name will
work
but maybe pink angular and not other
frameworks hosted yeah I didn't have a
choice but actually he gave me one day
to try it amber and it was so confusing
using angular for three months and
suddenly using ember I didn't get
anything about amber and I probably
should if I had one week or more maybe
it would be more useful but in 11 day
was not you know sire no come back no I
didn't try the other one why except
ember but really cookie and because I I
am I have the opposite from here my boss
does not like angular so you want to be
spanked one and he said many anglers too
hard to get in hmm is there any good
tutorial we get started I don't know I
think well for me that they didn't know
anything about about JavaScript
framework or for warming it was not that
complicated I think amber if it's more
complicated the and had you call that
the way the syntax of everything in
amber is really complicated the way of
writing in angular sure you have to get
used to it but well for me in two weeks
after starting using it I could display
a lot of information from the API and I
could make booking rooms and
shank change views and so it was yeah I
think it's a really cool tool and yeah
I'd like to use it after them again cool
