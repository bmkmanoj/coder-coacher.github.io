for coming are you happy to be here
we're
this is I believe the third time we've
done a buzz workshop Bobby correct me if
I'm wrong this is the second in san
francisco and i know we're planning on
doing one again next year so thank you
so much with this is way bigger than the
previous ones i'm told i wasn't at the
previous ones but this is awesome great
turnout so thank you for coming this
morning hopefully Bobby showed you the
agenda or you saw it on the on the
website I think it's going to be a
really interesting day I plan on being
here all day so hopefully we'll all
learn a few things my name is Lee machen
I've been it into a while and what I'm
responsible for is I managed the
developer relations team that works with
developers of consumer applications I'm
not so interested in databases or essay
p or those types of things so I tend to
focus my attention in my team's
attention on apps that can be bought in
an app store somewhere is sort of how I
generally define it that certainly
includes a large focus on game
developers but we focus on other folks
to that do media video you know a bunch
of different areas but gaming
increasingly tends to be where we direct
more and more of our efforts in this
role we really got two two two two jobs
one is to make sure that game developers
who we work with are aware of what's
coming from Intel and whether that's
mobile products PC products or server
products we want to make sure that all
of you know what we're doing so that
hopefully you can you can take advantage
of it and if you need help with that we
can certainly that's our job second is
to make sure that Intel knows what the
game the games industry is doing we take
a fairly long time to design and
manufacture a new cpu generation and
sometimes the world can change a lot in
between when we first draw it up and
when we ship it four or five or six
maybe years later so our job is to make
sure that Intel is reacting as well as
it can to things that are changing in
the industry from year to year and that
feedback from you guys is essential for
us to showing up in the in the in the in
the for consumers in delivering the
products that consumers and developers
need one new area that I'm not going to
talk a lot about what I'm happy to talk
about after we've got we announced a
fairly large diversity initiative back
at CES this year in January
and there's a lot of work going on
across Intel to try to make Intel as
well as the tech industry overall a more
diverse place to the extent that that
extends to the games industry I manage
that activity and we've got a number of
activities going on there and I'm happy
to talk about that if you catch me after
this so I've only got about four slides
to talk about I wouldn't really call
this the keynote I would say this is a
few hopefully thought provoking comments
before I hand it over to the guy who
really knows what's going on in the
industry so let's talk about what's
what's going on in games for a moment so
the good news and I'm not going to give
any bad news the good news is that
gaming software sales are growing and
they have been growing and we think
they're going to continue to grow which
is important to us because that usually
comes along with it gaming hardware
sales as well so you know this is a
great place to be we see that the the
the overall revenue has gone up by about
almost fifty percent in the last five
years and we think it's going to go up
significantly the next five years from a
pc software standpoint this this means
that in 2014 we were at about twenty six
billion dollars i should say you were at
about twenty six billion dollars in
software sales and we expect that to go
over 40 billion by 2019 now obviously
lots of things can throw that off and
change it but we don't see any reason
why growth shouldn't go on for you know
for for a good long time and that's why
you know we're so focused on on gaming
and why obviously we want to be here to
support everything you all are doing so
who's buying all these games this is
sort of how we look at it we view it as
about 700 million active users buying pc
game software and by active users we
mean people that are paying for things
as opposed to playing something for free
and never never buying anything bobby
was going to introduce me earlier by
saying that I was the key customer for
free to play because I'm a whale because
my team told him that I spend a lot of
money on clash of clans but he didn't
get a chance to do that so he can tell
you that later but anyway at the top of
the pyramid is the enthusiast segment
which is what is normal
referred to as the gamers right but
there's obviously more gamers than just
the top of the pyramid although we love
the top of the pyramid because they tend
to buy the highest in hardware the
unclogged core i7s with you know six or
hopefully eight cores as soon as that
start shipping they buy very high-end
GPUs which Nvidia and AMD love and we
love that segment it's just not very big
about 36 million users I'm sure there's
plenty of debate and error bars about
that size but they're the ones that buy
the most hardware by the most games and
they refresh their hardware most often
so you know if you take that 36 million
and they're refreshing every three years
ish then you know that's about you know
10 million units of sales every every
year which is nice it's a high margin
business but it's not a huge business at
least as far as Intel is concerned so we
want to serve those folks but we want to
serve these other two parts of the
pyramid as well the middle section is
one that's been getting a ton of focus
from us over the past probably five
years we call this the mainstream group
and it's almost an order of magnitude
bigger than the enthusiasts and this is
really the sweet spot for our core i5
products typically four cores and that
segment can be subdivided into people
that want discrete graphics products or
people that are happy with the HD
graphics that are integrated with all of
our core i5 CPUs a big part of the work
that my team does is working with game
developers to make sure that the HD
graphics that comes in those core i5s
delivers an acceptable gaming experience
you know a nice 30 framerate experience
even on some of the games that are
considered you know more enthusiast
focus games we think this is really
great for people that want to take games
on the road on the plane places like
that and I think you know people have
been pretty happy with those products
although in all honesty we haven't
broken through with HD graphics as a go
to graphics brand for people that want
to play games but people are discovering
that there's some really good gaming
experiences to be had with core i5 and
our graphics and then at the bottom
again another another 2x bigger than the
mainstream segment you know we deliver
products for them as well
and these are people that are playing on
the web or in much more casual
experiences that don't require the the
horsepower of the CPU or the GPU so we
love having 700 million users in the
gaming space to target and hopefully you
do too so a couple of trends that I just
wanted to mention you know none of these
will be news to any of you but they're
things that I thought are interesting
that have happened recently or will be
happening in the near future that I just
like to spend a couple of minutes on
first is the emergence of eSports and if
you've been paying attention this is not
a surprise but a lot of people it seems
to be a little bit under the covers to
where people are like what you're going
to watch video games on TV that's crazy
people like my wife and my parents but
people who like games and people below a
certain age think it's the greatest
thing ever and the numbers prove out the
interest is there you know we got tens
of millions of people watching things
like Intel Extreme Masters and the ESL
World Championships online and it's just
growing like crazy and we're investing
as much as we can there because we think
that's a huge segment that you know
needs some more innovation it's a large
segment that is interested in things
beyond just what the players are playing
we have large demo areas showing off
mobile products and various other things
at our Intel Extreme Masters events and
there's a huge amount of interest from
that audience those people are all
watching on twitch which is another
thing that has just exploded in the last
few years we work with twitch to make
sure that the content coming from the
streamers whether they are professional
streamers or people streaming from their
house have a great experience and have
accelerated encode decode etc but twitch
just as a channel is just growing
ridiculously and we are from a marketing
standpoint wanted to make sure that we
rely on our messages and twitches
audiences are are up to date on what
we're doing another kind of streaming
which is streaming the game as opposed
to streaming a video is something that I
think is going to emerge in the next few
years and really bring a lot of variety
in what types of games you play and
where you play them so you may be aware
that valve is going to be launching a
device later this year that allows you
to stream your pc game
aims to this device that plugs into your
TV and I think that that's one option I
don't know if that's going to be very
big or not but it's it's interesting and
then the extension to that is when those
games start to be streamed to all of
your devices from a data center
somewhere obviously on live try this a
few years ago there was a number of
things that kept it from really taking
off but I think in the next few years
those things are going to get solved and
again we're going to have a lot of
variety and diversity as far as where
you're going to be able to play games
and what type of games you're going to
be able to play I want to make a mention
of what we're doing with cameras you
know connect has focus on a certain type
of user and a certain type of
interaction we think that we can extend
upon that and add those depth sensing
cameras that both face you and face the
world and we're working with OEMs to put
those cameras on the front and back of
PCs and tablets over the next two years
and we think that once that hardware is
pervasive that developers are going to
really find some interesting things to
do with it and you'll hear from one
later today choice provisions who's
building a game that's targeted
specifically at the user facing camera
and just your type interactions another
thing you can do with those cameras is
do really high-quality scans of people
rooms and objects and once you have
those scans on your on your computer
people are probably going to want to
print some of them and I think 3d
printing is another area that is going
to take off it's still sort of you know
very small right now but once everybody
has one and they can print their own
toys based on the IPS that game
developers create I think it's going to
lead to another expansion of the types
of people that you can target with your
with your products I think it's also
going to lead to some interesting IP
questions that are not really you know
my job to solve but that'll be
interesting for all of us to to see how
that develops in the next few years and
then one more that I'd be remiss if I
didn't mention is VR obviously this was
born on the pc oculus valve and others
are targeting experiences that are going
to require very high-end pcs to deliver
the very high end experiences that they
want to have as their launch experiences
they don't want to ruin the experience
or get people sick right out of the gate
so from a high-end enthusiast standpoint
we're one hundred percent focused on
supporting those guys and making sure
that an Intel machine is going to help
deliver the best VR experience you can
we also think that there are some
experiences that you should have you
know in that mid-range segment can i
connect my head my head set to a intel
iris powered mobile device or a laptop
for gaming that doesn't require as high
spec or watching movies or you know a
number of other experiences and we're
working with some partners to sort of
figure that out but there's this there's
this elephant to the room which is our
people really going to want to wear this
thing all day long do they want to have
that that that detachment from the
actual reality in the room and I think
there's a huge divide in what people
believe there I think a lot of game
developers have been dreaming of this
for 20 years and it's the coolest thing
ever and it's all they want to work on
and then there's another half of the
company saying well wait a minute are we
going to make any money on this because
like we talked about on the enthusiasts
top of the pyramid slide that's some
high-end hardware that you know a lot of
people don't have or can't afford and
the you've got people like Jim Sweeney
who say man it's not for the whole world
while at the same time his company is
killing themselves to make sure that
every VR game that ships is based on the
Unreal Engine so anyway it I'm not
bullish or not bullish but I wanted I
want it to run really really really
really well on Intel and I want one of
those headsets as soon as they ship and
I know our next speaker has got some
things to say on this topic as well so
just two more slides and then I'll hand
it over we do a intel developer forum
every year in moscone center right down
the street as they follow on to this
event we're going to be putting together
a one-day sort of side event that's
integrated but not entirely part of IDF
and we're going to invite all of you to
join us for that in August so there's
nothing you have to do we're going to
send you an email invite with a pass to
register for the one day gaming session
we're putting together there and it'll
be totally free to attend we're going to
have industry veterans we're gonna have
a keynote which we're now calling mega
sessions focused just on gaming I think
it'll be a really interesting
we'd love for you to come and then just
finally we have an online community
focused at all types of software
developers developing on intel
architecture and the section of that
focused on gaming is right here software
/ game dev and we love you to join and
be part of that community</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
