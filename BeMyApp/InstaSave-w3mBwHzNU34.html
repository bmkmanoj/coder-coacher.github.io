were announces ship safe but what we're
doing now is it's too safe don't worry
not let's start it up what does
everybody see here yarn wire which we
supposed to find out the debt picture
contains the leading cause of accidental
death for children 1 through 4 and the
second leading cause of accidental death
for children 12 14 let's look back at
what was that the swimming pool welcome
to insta same we are going to prevent
accidental drownings with beacon
technology very simple very
straightforward very needed my name is
Daisy ambition of running some startups
I have a lot of experience teaching
children how to swim and sail at ran
several schools treasure island for
peace and i participated in an actual
rescue wants this is something i have a
tremendous amount of expertise in so
what I want to do is I want to connect
vegans and water sensors have that water
sensor go to an alarm or to your mobile
device and let you know that it's time
to rush to the pool to get your kid out
of it just that simple when the peak and
submerged an alarm will sound and the
way that works is that we have water
sensor something I was not available to
me this weekend so I apologize but it's
essentially the same sensor that will
allow you to know your basement was
flooded or having water damage in your
house put it on wearable case and have
long-lasting batteries what I've done is
I've taken a piquant connected it with
what would be the water sent the water
sensor will happen though you can know
because the pekin is submerged a beacon
will then let a mountain oval arm or
your mobile device note that it's
submerged so picture a child wearing
this it's emerged they drop into the
water you're not paying attention
now there's more possibilities that but
I want you to just focus on that your
kid falls in and alarm goes you going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
