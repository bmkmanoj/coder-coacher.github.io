show you how to setup the server
electronics setup so let's get started
for this we'll need what we built
earlier the open cm9 point 0 4
controller board an open cm 485
extension board and a micro USB cable
and a 9 or 12 volt power supply when you
buy the board it usually comes with
connectors make sure you feel to the two
male connectors underneath the board
like this i plug it in and put the 12
volt power supply and plug in the USB on
the control card we turn on the switch
and a red LED should turn on in order to
see if your card works we can start by
plugging it in via USB to the computer
window installs the peripheral device
then we launch the ide and click on run
we check that in tools there is a serial
port that must be different for you the
board here is 904 file then we click on
examples we go fetch the blink of the
LED and click on the download point the
card restarts and the program sends the
signal and gives the CSS link the
program just sent and the LED is
blinking here it is if everything is
working fine the green LED on the board
should blink if that's the case we can
connect our arm to the card to do that
we just need to connect it on any of the
three pin connectors like this now we're
going to an assign an ID on each of the
servers in order to be able to control
them individually now we're going to set
the IDS of all the servos to do this we
are going to have to connect eserver to
the board one by one don't forget to
unplug from the other servos whose ID
you are modifying here is the first one
unplugged I unplug it from the card and
we're going to move it to the second one
i unplug the second from the others and
i plug it to the card now all i do is
upload its code to set its ID and to do
this for all the servos all you have to
do is repeat the same steps
now that you downloaded the sources on
github you reopen your IDE
you'll click on file and open
and look for the file that you
downloaded it restarts and sends the
program once the program is set you can
plug in your motors now we're going to
plug in the Edison card to the open cm
for that we'll need a small micro USB
OTG cable that we're going to plug into
the control card then with a classic USB
cable we are linking it to the edison
we find
run it's all good voila so our arm is
ready and all we need to do right now is
upload the program and the next video
I'm going to show you how to program the
robotic steps so let's get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
