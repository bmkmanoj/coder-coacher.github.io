her studies her job and her friends she
Criss crosses town all day long
Metro bus tram bicycle for Hertz child's
play to combine every means of transport
she thought she mastered it to
perfection until the day she downloaded
the new step-by-step app it's a sort of
GPS that had a bunch of new Romans
transplanted as she puts it today Leia
has to attend a class in this lab at the
other end of town she enters a
destination and her other appointments
as well as the time she wants to arrive
her app immediately calculates the best
route which takes into account her
preferences public transport of course
but also cycling and car sharing Leia
can even specify if she's wearing high
heels today her route is calculated in
real-time and continually updated if
there's an incident on a line or a
traffic jam the app will immediately
suggest an alternative to arrive on time
what's more it also takes into account
the weather if it's fine it suggests
using a bicycle rather than the tram
Leia just has to follow the augmented
reality routes to the nearest bike
station the same occurs if there's a
change of plans such as the opportunity
to look after little Tristan tonight
layer' enters this new appointment and
the app updates the route plan
the day is coming to an end her last
tram ride is late at night but layer'
knows that if there's the slightest
safety problem she can press the apps
help button and be instantly connected
by videoconference to a Keolis agent
layer now has a dual reputation she not
only can't stay put but also she's
always on time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
