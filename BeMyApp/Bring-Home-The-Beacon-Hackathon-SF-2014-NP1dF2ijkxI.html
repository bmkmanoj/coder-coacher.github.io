so what's the name of your app it's only
back early hairs all right so what's it
gonna do it's gonna crash this news
button by waking up the world I name i
have is ship safe say ship safe is um
where are my beacons to help with the
life-saving efforts if somebody falls
off of a pope and vegan cleaver you can
clip so what does it do let's make
networking a lot easier so we want to
use speakin instead of nametags like law
school named Tex sake and just look
around and see what their people are
doing maybe the amp is assembled
assemble all right and what's assemble
going to do for us think of it as open
table conference room so lets you find a
conference room booked a conference room
and most importantly uses beacons to let
you know whether somebody's already in
there with the way you should be in
there and you're not or somebody should
be in there and they should give a less
we're making ninja fight into fine
what's this going to do basically it's a
real world capture flag except
everybody's a ninja crowd a logger what
does it do it tracks time based on where
you are and shows you exactly how long
you been at each area the name of our
office bigger bombs ate a box and what's
is gonna do so basically big of all kind
of like revitalizing the real-life
shopping experience so for example if
you're going to like you have to choose
a whole bunch of sort of pine and
accessories for the White House
what did he give this why your
smartphone to say I believe that blood
what does hoopla do so let's do you play
games but you get to be a pay-to-play
you get to earn points which you could
then change into some of your favorite
brands and offers I think my favorite
future idea feature is a ability to chop
up your enemies for your phone local
story okay alright so so when you hope
to achieve and local story so basically
it's to create kits for teachers and
their students to create tours of local
interesting buildings other
infrastructure random every building has
a story we want to wake up the local
environment and get into the out into
the world it's all your favorite feature
about this after all within the
recommendation engine that's going to be
awesome so this is basically like the
first shopping cart for the real world
it's like it's like the Amazon
experience but in an ikea store we are
building khodam am I is enabling
interactive art without taking people
out of their environment at festivals
and gallery walks and it's also
providing people with a way to discover
artists like if they see something cool
they don't have to remember anything
they can later just see it on their
phone is a live stream so we got a
couple apps actually we actually talked
to real moms and got some really good
feedback so based on my feedback we're
building something that lets the family
make sure that they take everything
necessary for the baby on a trip when
they're going out the door AB number two
is about helping moms make sure babies
get enough food at the right times and
we've got sensors on the bottle they can
send messages with so this is called
Viacom so it's some app that helps
people by ears bothers my favorite
feature about this out
is putting beacons inside of water if
you have a what ink i can order table I
mean Michaels the reason I did okay
great so what's a safe ride supposed to
do whenever you get into a taxi
institutions where they can object
you're picking on me or anything so we
are thank you for that we can absolutely
once you get into the taxi you get the
taxi information on your floor using a
wrap so what's your favorite teacher
graph is a assemble i love the fact that
we you can walk into the conference room
and see whether you're there if
somebody's already in the room instead
of having to go and knock and say and
their room it can send the person to
message and say hey somebody's waiting
for the room I like
you
hey yeah so we are team bagged tagged
and bagged elected as you're up to so
what we do is we are trying to take all
the pain out of flying with your checked
in bandages it's film fest and this is a
feature to our amazing nights that we
did and the feature is into a VIP
treatment when you get to the door it
will recognize who you are and then our
usher justice robotic balls going to
take your seat the name is sub Terra
cognita so like terra incognita know
Lance but it's subterra and your knee
and Derek oculus oh no one land I like
it what does it do well as the name
implies it maps underground surfaces so
you can see what's going on inside
simply by beacon technologies if your
doors speaking city tours so you walk by
the first nation that is already from
outside anyway and it was just waiting
for me to be all sort of back our
favorite future is stuff like this where
you can walk up to an LED matrix and
upload a gift to it and it'll display
the gift on an LED our art matrix so
everybody can come and share their are
to be part of the event I are catching
life leg okay and what's it gonna do we
are going to do kind of make a list of
the history of lowes become so we are
going to try the beacon because history
and maybe clocks history so what's your
favorite feature it's the big connection
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
