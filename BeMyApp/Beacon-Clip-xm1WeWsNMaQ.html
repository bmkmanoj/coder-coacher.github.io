networking a lot easier through the
beacon technology so what happens
generally we all do networking but we'd
like to do it in a most efficient way so
have you ever wondered what is the
person sitting next to you doing what is
their background I did and I bet a lot
of you has had the same problem before
so the solution would be to have a
bigger clip which would be a visible
device that you could have instead of
having just a sticker with your name on
it that could tell a little a bit of
information about yourself and people
around you but after that we imagine a
very lean operation so focused on the
ghost of the in terms of Bible costs of
the units the bigger clicks and of
course sales commissions we imagine an
elite team as well working on it and
having this become a simple and
innovative way at the same time to make
networking delete better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
