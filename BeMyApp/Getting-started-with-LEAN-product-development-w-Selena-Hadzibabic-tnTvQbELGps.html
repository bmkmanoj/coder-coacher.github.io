webinar series it is a pleasure having
all of you here we'll be starting in two
short minutes so once again we'll be
starting in two short minutes folks
you
you
you
you
you
you
hi everyone I forgot her from being my
app and once again it's awesome having
you all of you here uh in this webinar
series we have Salama from New York
she's had a product management at to
order group and what if - she didn't be
speaking on lean principle and
methodologies so anybody who was working
in a start-up this is perfect people who
just want to learn how to build a proper
product with the least resources as
possible but I'll let the professional
do the work so I'll further ado I'll
give the mic and screen to sell out so
surround the screen and mic is all yours
great thank you um sure
going here great I hope everybody can
hear me well thank you for having me as
uh as I was just introduced my name is
cell and I'll be talking to you about
lean product development principles and
I know it's a six o'clock in the
afternoon for you guys on the Thursday
so don't worry this will be a sort of a
leisurely overview of some some steps
that really anybody can take whether
you're a product manager or not towards
making sure that you have a leaner
product process and then you're building
the right product so before I get to
lean just a little bit of background
about me so you can sort of understand
where where my learnings are coming from
my name is Selena I worked for I started
my career in a company called the
ladders which is a check it's an online
job site and what's interesting about
them is that it was with them for quite
a while and the company transformed from
like very rigid waterfall company like
nine months marches to the big grand
release date and then it started to
introduce agile development practices
first on the tech team but then of
course once the developers started
working in an agile
way that required change from the rest
of the organization and we had some
really smart people working with us and
we started to figure out like how we
make agile UX and how do we expand the
and drive agile principles throughout
the organization so we got to the point
where we sort of felt we had a pretty
decent lean practice um after I left the
ladders I joined Auto Group that's where
I am right now or the Guru is a b2b
startup so quite unsurprisingly it was
initially very sales driven because the
the first step that the founder had to
do was just make you know get
connections with companies that he was
trying to sell to but over the past
couple years we've been introducing
stronger product and UX practices my
twitter handle is DZ is hn only slightly
less complicated than my last name but
please feel free to reach out I won't be
checking Twitter right now over the next
hour but I'll definitely be checking in
later and if you have any follow-up
questions or thoughts don't hesitate to
reach out so lean um
I think like most people I I first heard
the lean practices articulated from Eric
Ries in the Lean Startup book but there
have been many books written on lean
lean UX lean customer development lean
analytics lean this mean that because we
struck on something interesting there
which is this idea of you know making
sure that we're doing smart work not
just hard work it was also there's this
I don't know how much this this has been
happening in Europe but in New York
certainly and generally in America but
definitely in New York several years ago
there was this explosion where everybody
was talking about me and any conference
you go to people would be frankly
bragging about what a you know what a
great job they've done with with their
products because they applied lean
principles there was even this company
called Lean Startup machine that printed
up a bunch of these thicker that say
what took you six months took me three
days and those started popping up on
Comm
and I remember seeing one of those for
the first time in just going like damn
like what am I doing wrong because it's
definitely still taking me six months to
do something spread and so you know I
was hearing a lot of these like success
stories of incorporating Lean Startup
practices and and that's natural that's
what people go to conferences to share
but at the same time I would go back to
work you know the following Monday and
feel like any of the things that I was
trying to incorporate that I had learned
at these conferences or read in these
books where like a Sisyphus you know
pushing a boulder up a mountain and in
the in the kind of stress and hecticness
of the day to day startup or where you
know that one one morning you have to
finalize a business plan and then that
afternoon you want to like wrap up
wireframes so the developers can proceed
with building stuff and then the
following day you have to like have like
client meetings and you know in that
hecticness it started sometimes to seem
to mean that some of the practices
recommended in all these books were
really like meant to work for you know
spherical cows in a vacuum and i
couldn't quite see how they could
translate into the day-to-day reality
that i was in and that my co-workers
were in and so what i'd spent a lot of
time doing in addition to reading all of
those books was like really trying to
get sort of back to the core idea of
lean because it kind of you know
understood finally that um just because
a particular process had worked for
somebody else's project or somebody
else's company that doesn't mean that
that exact same process would translate
into my company in my project and so it
really started to like go back to basics
right to figure out how I can
incorporate the lean like thinking if
not necessarily explicitly the practices
so you know what's seen at its core
right it's it's sort of you know various
ways to say it but basically this this
cycle of build measure learn right and I
actually
to think that we start from learning
because you know you learned that your
customer has a problem and then you
develop a hypothesis for what product
could possibly solve that problem and
then you build ideally the absolute
smallest fastest thing that kind of
encompasses your idea and you put it out
there into the world and then you
measure like this solve the problem or
not that it's all half a problem that
it's all any problem at all and based on
what you learn from from the
interactions of your customers with your
product you decide how to move forward
right maybe you're onto something you
saw like a good chunk of the problem but
there's a little ways to go
or maybe you learn you saw the entire
clock problem and that's very exciting
or maybe you learned that you completely
missed the boat and then you're really
glad that you can spend six months
building something because in three days
you found out that your idea wasn't the
right idea to solve the customer problem
but so so this basic idea of build
measure learn or learn build measure I
think it is not just at the core of lean
product development it's also in the
core of incorporating lean practices
into your organization because lean
agile any process any any sort of
philosophy or framework for for doing
our work
you know it won't just be accepted
because like AIDS like a neat idea and
this guy published a book about it right
it'll be accepted if it actually solves
an organizational problem right and I
think you know that was one of my
personal early early mistakes was that I
was trying to squeeze these processes
that sounded good into my organization
from my organization didn't necessarily
have that same problem that you know
somebody else has did and that's why
there wasn't a fit thing right I
actually ended up also finding a very
helpful definition of lean in a book
called lean UX written by Jeff Gosselin
and Josh Satan and is actually fortunate
enough to work with Jeff goth of it at
the ladder so I spoke with him a lot
about this and I really like how they
articulated that lean UX you know it's
not necessarily a bunch of processes or
steps
need to be taken in the right sequence
right it's really the practice of
bringing the true nature of a product to
light faster right so link the core what
you're trying to build bring it to light
faster in a collaborative cross then
reduce the emphasis on thorough
documentation while increasing the focus
on building a shared understanding of
the actual product experience being
designed so like in other word you know
like let's not like have one team come
up with you the idea and stuck it out
and say this is how it should work and
then have another team build it and then
like see what happens right it's about
working together to understand you know
what are we trying to create here and
what's really the core of it and how do
we get rid of all the bells and whistles
so that we can focus on the smallest
thing that we need to build and then
build that quickly right and what really
stood out to me is is these these
notions of like the true nature of a
product that it the process itself needs
to be collaborative and cross-functional
and then the emphasis is on shared
understanding rather than like any
specific documentation or process for
that matter so I kind of like when I
guess met up on this definition and
thought about how this actually also
describes how you could introduce lean
into the organization right so what if
you say lean is the practice of bringing
the true nature of a process to light
faster in a collaborative cross
functional ways they'll then reduce the
emphasis on specific steps while
increasing the focus on building a
shared understanding of the work
experience being designed right so like
how do we productively talk about how do
we want to work together what are the
problems with the way that we work
together now why are those problems
important to solve and how can we solve
them and then we can like borrow
inspiration from conferences and books
to try a new particular process but
what's most important is to understand
the true nature of what we're trying to
achieve so you know I kind of set up
this framework in my head where you know
Lean practices help you build a product
for your customers right but if I'm
trying to develop the leap practice
within my company and within my team
then
my customers are my team and the product
we're building is our work experience
and our vision is really straightforward
we want to build stuff that max right
you can freeze this any number of the
ways you want to build stuff that solves
meaningful problems we want to build
stuff that makes a lot of money quickly
and whilst to exit but like one way or
another you're basically saying you know
we want to get to our goal fast and we
want every step that we take to matter
and then we stick to that same idea of
you know learn build measure or or
reframed as like define the problem
behind the hypothesis run as small an
experiment as you can and then measure
and see whether you want to persevere or
pivot in the words of lean right so I'm
gonna tell you three stories about you
know how I sort of applied this to some
very specific organizational problems
that I've seen my company struggle with
in the past but I've also heard from a
lot of other people that they struggle
with these things so we're gonna talk
about setting KPIs
we're going to talk about vetting
assumptions when we build products and
we're gonna talk a little bit more
broadly just about experimenting with
new approaches in general right so if
your organization or your team has this
problem right that we can't measure the
impact of our work we spend however much
we come on like year building something
we release the product and we're not
totally sure if it worked or didn't
right or we're not sure what worked and
what didn't right well okay if the
problem is that we can't measure the
impact of our work we're not sure that
it's impactful then like my hypothesis
is that let's just set some clear KPIs
key performance indicators and that
would help us measure the impact right
it's pretty simple pretty
straightforward if your problem if your
organization doesn't have this problem
then like you don't want to bother with
this step right but if your organization
does have this problem the hypothesis
that I would start with is like let's
just start measuring and one thing that
I think some people also get stuck on is
like well how do I do lean or how do I
do
kpi's or how do I do
anything like exactly the right way
right well like don't stress about it so
much because remember again it for this
to succeed it really needs to be
collaborative which means that you can't
figure it out on your own nor are you
supposed to but if you kind of take a
stab you run that first experiment you
build that smallest thing you start
measuring something anything really
almost anything define some way that you
think it makes sense to measure that
your customers care about something it
can be signups it can be site visits it
can be a lot of other things right and
you can certainly do a lot of research
on this to see what might be the best
sab but my recommendation is just set a
KPI just get going right start measuring
some things start talking to people
about it start telling people when the
number goes up start telling people when
the number goes down start talking to
people about what have we done recently
could that have resulted in this number
going up or down right start engaging
people with this idea you know here's a
metric that we need to pay attention to
because it tells us whether our work is
having a positive impact or not now in
the context of building a product right
like you would build a product you would
release it and then you would look at
this number and say like great that the
number of customers who care and go up
or go down or stay the same right and
that's how you measure the impact and
when it comes to processes what you're
measuring is your organization's
response to what you just did right so
if you put a KPI out there there's
really three outcomes one nobody says
anything nobody notices they don't think
it's very interesting and in that case I
would say it sounds like KPIs are is not
what your company needs at this very
moment either the organization doesn't
have the problem that you thought it had
or they're not ready to tackle that
problem but either way if people don't
engage with you and you can create that
like collaborative work towards a leaner
process then this might not be something
to harp on right now on the other hand
if people ask you about it and they kind
of like the KPI that you chose like
great now you have a KPI and you can
measure the impact of your work and
lastly maybe people will ask you about
it but say like what do you mean
customers who care like this Bay
that doesn't really make any sense like
I think we need to come up with a better
KPI let's work on it together
fine that one's great too as far as
introducing lean process as far as
introducing metrics that guide your
water two out of three of these
scenarios and call it success
because again you've created that
atmosphere you've created the situation
where you're collaboratively figure out
figuring out how do we measure the
impact of our work with specific KPIs
now another problem that I hear a lot of
especially development teams complain
about is you know hey we we we never get
to the space tube we abandon projects
before we really get to finish them and
all the value all the fun stuff all the
great things that we were going to build
or pushed off into this infamous page -
that never really happens right and this
can be very frustrating but I think it's
also revealing that maybe the team
didn't in the beginning aligned on what
is the value that we're trying to build
right and in my hypothesis here for for
the organization is that if that you
know MVP's is the is the term that Eric
Ries would use in any startup in a
minimally Viable Product but MVP first
iteration version one whatever you call
it whatever that first you take if it
were smaller so you could do it quickly
and if it were testing the right
assumption about about the value that
we're creating then the team could
easily get buy-in to persevere and get
to Phase two and three and four and
seven or they'll happily pivot away
because they'll learn that what they
thought was valuable is in fact not
right and there's a whenever I talk
about this specific hypothesis and
whenever I talk about MVPs there's a
very specific image that I really like
to use and I apologize to the person who
originally published this because I've
seen it now in so many places that I can
no longer find the original creator but
I think it's a really really good image
to explain this notion of a Minimum
Viable Product right so
a lot of companies still build products
the what are called the top way right so
if you are you convince yourself that
what you need to do is still the car and
then you immediately jump to thinking
about the efficiency of your production
right so you're like great I'm gonna
like have people who are experts in
building wheels I'm gonna have people
who are experts in building chassis or
if I don't have those experts at least
I'm gonna focus in my organization or
making is all the wheels that I need and
then I'm gonna be all the chasis that I
need and then eventually like we'll
assemble a car right and the problem
with that of course is that it takes
forever and by the time that you release
the car into the market you know in this
particular image if we have a we have a
happy face suggesting that the customers
are happy with what they got but we know
that that's not always the case
and by this point you've you've set up
your organization to be good at building
cars and you've invested so much in
building this car and you probably Laden
it with a ton of different features that
it's hard to tell like what's working
and what is what is valuable and what is
on the other hand you know there's this
other approach of the Minimum Viable
Product where you know you build like
skateboard and then a scooter and so
what I what I like about this image is
that people look at it and go sort of
like ah yes like this makes so much
sense of course of course I would want
to take the bottom approach because you
know this is a way to deliver value to
the customer throughout it's a way for
me to make sure that the next step is
worth taking and that the investment is
going to pay off I'm getting feedback
throughout the process so I'm learning
about what is it isn't valuable to my
customers like of course this makes a
lot of sense no
the tricky thing also about this image
is that it's it's a little bit
deceptively clear in that you can look
at the bottom of the picture and you see
these five objects and you're basically
mentally processing like okay like what
do all these have in common like they
get me from place a to place B faster
than I would get there by walking
because it's very clear to see when you
look at five things what they have in
common it makes a lot of sense why the
skateboard is an MVP of a car right
because again like that's the value that
they all that they all give to the
customer getting me from A to B faster
but then like from the skateboard to the
car we've course added other sort of
peripheral values to mean additional
customer beats right so like maybe when
you know when we release the skateboard
and the scooter and even the bike
somebody said like this is all well and
good getting for me to be faster but
like please make it a little comfy or my
ass is killing me yes sir that's how you
again like the comfy bike seat and
eventually car so this this entire night
notion of you know recognizing what the
core need for the customer is which is
in this example getting places faster
this this process assumes that like you
understand this customer need that you
want to get places faster you understand
how it helps you mean business goals
right like if people want cars and we
can sell them for more than it costs to
me something will make money great and
then because you understand the customer
needs and you understand your business
goals like you come up with a bunch of
ideas and can figure out which one is
the fastest to test right so customer
need is to move faster business goal is
to make money there's lots of ideas and
you put a wheel on anything it'll no
faster than humans walking and and then
you sort of triage it to the place where
you say like well a skateboard is really
cheap to make so if it turns out that we
were wrong about the customer need we
didn't waste a lot of money and if it
turns out we were right like we can
still probably sell it at a higher cost
than it costs to make it but here's what
happens instead instead you know you're
your CEO your boss your coworker the
sales guy somebody in the organization
comes to you with an idea right like hey
you know be cool we should totally do
this we should totally build the X right
we should totally build the car um and
that's kind of inevitable it's it's damn
near impossible and I certainly haven't
seen it
that truly always thinks they thinking
from left to right from thinking about
the customer needs and then generating
ideas it's inevitable that somebody in
the organization is coming to you at
some point with like hey this is a cool
idea and that's okay just work with that
right just work with that and kind of
like moonwalk them back towards the
customer needs that they think that
they're solving right so somebody says
we should build a car or whatever
there's a number of ways to to vet the
assumptions that they're implicitly
making about what the customer needs or
what the business is trying to
accomplish right so one how customers
use it
what would they achieve right so like
you're trying to suss out you know if
somebody tells me we should build a car
with comfy seats that goes really fast
and has air conditioning right like well
what of all these things really really
matters right because I don't want to
build all of it at once I want to build
the one that is the sort of the capital
right the poor value so I will customers
use it what would they achieve why is it
important to them to achieve that and
what have they said to make you think
right like how are we for why we drawing
these conclusions right
how many have said and this is also
important I can tell you how many times
I've heard that you know over the
weekend somebody talked to their
neighbor and decided that if their
neighbor said they would use their great
product idea then like surely everybody
would use it but their neighbor is not
necessarily representative of the
company's target audience so it's really
important to make sure you understand
like what the hell people said and how
many have said it and then of course
it's an opportunity to get in touch with
some of them and and hear sort of
directly from the horse's mouth what
they're talking about and what problem
they're trying to solve there's also the
question of the business right what will
it do for us and when do we need to
deliver on that so
sometimes we you know I'm assuming that
the people in my audience are sort of
for profit
but but even if you're in a non-profit I
think you know it's always important to
make sure that you're solving the
biggest problem that you have so the
answer of what will it do for us doesn't
necessarily have to be it'll make us
more money in for-profit companies it is
but maybe it'll you know it'll help us
attract more customers it'll help us
create more awareness about this you
know social or economic problem the goal
of the goals can vary certainly but it's
important to recognize whether this
whole idea even if customers are
interested in it what will it do to
further the company's mission and then
when do we need to deliver on that is a
critical question for startups
especially because you know all
companies and all of all sizes feel like
they have limited resources because
there's always more work than people but
I think for startups especially nothing
is more dangerous than to say well we
have to do it at some point so we might
as well do it now you don't have much of
runway when it comes to money and so
it's really important that you're always
working on the absolutely most important
thing at the moment if you don't have to
do it now
leave it for later it may not be a
problem then grows to be big enough to
ever be addressed it may become bigger
next year you deal with it next year so
it's really important to check for this
like why do we think we need to do this
right now
and then a couple of like negative
questions that that I started using that
I found really helpful in terms of again
illuminating like what are we trying to
solve for what is this value that we
think we're creating and as long as you
can sort of like get past you know
people looking at you like you're an
idiot that's these questions
I really think you get interesting
answers so one is you know what happens
if we don't do it the competitors will
do it is not a helpful answer but what
you're really trying to get to the
bottom of is you know how is the world
going to be a worse place because we
didn't do this right how is our company
going to like crash and burn if we don't
do it how are the customers
to be absolutely miserable if we don't
do it how are we going to you know miss
the opportunity to set ourselves up for
some sort of important growth step if we
don't do it and you'll find that for you
know like 99 out of 100 ideas the answer
is nothing disastrous and again because
you have a limited runway you really
really want to focus on doing things
that are disasters or that create really
monumental winds and then if you're
really finally considering that that you
should do it then you should build the
car or whatever the idea was asked how
we could screw it up typically again I
think you know this is just human nature
we're so we're so great at getting
ourselves like psyched up and excited
about our ideas and and how you know
what's great about this is that it'll
solve everything and and it'll do this
of this and this and seventeen other
things and what's difficult about that
is that again like seventeen things will
take a while to build what's really the
one thing the one problem that this idea
is solving the one core value that it's
delivering and how can we get to the
bottom of that so that we build that
speed board and not start building a
bunch of wheels and a bunch of chassis
x' for a car so you know we commonly
talk about what a success look like
again i think like this is especially
true in america there's a very sort of
positivist culture and we want to know
what success looks like
but it's tremendously helpful to
understand what failure looks like
because you know this is where you know
the the person who came to you with the
idea to build a car with comfy seats and
music and air conditioner and a sunroof
when you ask how we could screw it up
they typically don't say any of those
extra features they say like i imagine
if we built the car and it didn't even
run right it didn't move and that really
then tells you what is the key value
that you're delivering so again back to
my original point here is you're trying
to create a situation where the team is
collaboratively figuring out what is it
we are trying to build so when you start
asking these questions again three
things can happen one is they'll stop
themselves right out of it
which really is just tells you that it
wasn't an important enough problem and
not an important enough idea if they're
not willing to fight for it they'll help
you ask questions this is great I'm
collaborating and of course the best is
that they'll help you get answers right
so they'll put you in touch with those
relevant customers they'll show you the
business plan that shows you know how
it's important to achieve the milestone
that this product idea will help us
achieve in order to grow the business
further now sort of expanding beyond
specific examples of measuring or or
betting ideas measuring the impact of
work or betting ideas I think something
I hear a lot is it's really hard to try
new practices people don't even
necessarily articulate it quite like
that they really just say you know this
is how we've always done things so
that's how we're going to continue to do
them again this is understanding human
nature and we're creatures of habit and
things that we believe worked in the
past we believe will work in the future
and so it's very hard to to initiate and
accept change but I think what I want to
call out is that it's really important
that we articulate the problem instead
of dictating the solution and then would
make an impact sooner so what I mean by
that is you know as a product manager
for example like I say the sentence all
the time this is what I'm coaching my
team all the time right I don't tell me
what product you want to build tell me
what problem we're trying to solve this
is what we keep telling our sales teams
our business colleagues clients right
like thank you for coming to me with the
idea but help me understand I helped me
articulate the problem you're trying to
solve and then we'll come up with the
right idea I am the right product to
build so the same is true in
organizations right you can't just kind
of barge in and say like we're gonna do
MVPs and we're gonna do you know measure
KPIs
and that's how we're gonna work going
forward because people won't understand
like why this is important to do so
organizationally just like in in all
buildings in building products you want
to make sure that you articulate the
problem so for example these are things
I have actually said to my teams you
know we have a lot of features we want
to build and we're not sure how to
prioritize and we wish we could learn
what resonates with customers before
deciding this is a great way to very
clearly articulate to somebody who
hasn't done user testing before how and
why you need to use user testing as part
of your process right and it doesn't get
into you know telling them about how
Aleen customer development works it's
not about any buzzwords it's not about
things that they don't understand it's
about a very accessible and and in a
problem that we can all appreciate which
is there's a lot of work to do and we're
not sure how to prioritize another one
is you know we often work under
deadlines that we don't always
understand and I've seen teams
definitely waste a lot of energy and
frustration because of the deadlines but
it's very helpful to simply acknowledge
like look I'm afraid the deadline is
here to stay I know that makes you
scared that I call the valuable ideas
that you that you think are important
are going to get pushed off into that
infamous Phase two and you're never
gonna get to work on them but my
question is like okay like if the
deadline is here to stay and we have
live at a time then how do we make sure
that we build something that matters in
the time that we have tell me about this
value that you perceive tell me why you
think it's so important tell me what
customer needs is going to be tell me
what business goals is going to further
and then we can make sure that it's
prioritized for this base while or even
something as silly as you know running
into technical problems we were doing
this as the ladders we were doing a lot
of usability testing on our QA site and
the data was all rubbish and so people
were so distracted by you know made-up
job titles that they couldn't really get
us good feedback on how easy it is to
for example like Rana sir
a job run a search for job postings and
so again sort of just voice the problem
and and somewhere between you know QA
and and dead somebody figured out how to
give us a dump of fresh data into our QA
environment and then we have
realistic-looking job those things and
we were on our merry way learning about
how people interact with our search
interface so being lean can definitely
be hard but I think you know to sort of
summarize both what I what I think is
the lean process in terms of building
products but also what it takes to
introduce in practices into an
organization is particularly the problem
demonstrate the first experiment and
then people will join us in learning how
to make our work more valuable and
hopefully we will all feel like we're
doing very epic and hard work so
that's that's it for my presentation
again my name is selina my last name is
pronounced how'd your puppets but don't
let that stress you out my twitter
handle is DZ is hn and i believe we're

questions and what's that so they know
once again thank you very much it real

management to a very necessity and with
that ladies and gentlemen I want to see
