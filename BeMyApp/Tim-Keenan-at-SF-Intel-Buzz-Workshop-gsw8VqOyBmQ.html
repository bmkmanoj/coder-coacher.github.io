everybody can leave the room the Indies
going to come up and talk it's really
the so what I'm going to talk about is
creative directing all right how many
people in here make games what does
everybody else to do you were you guys
developed how many people here are
developers how many people here would
consider themselves independent
developers all right well there's some
of you guys in here well first of all I
guess myself my name is Tim Keenan I
made a game called the virus named Tom
I'm currently making a game called
duskers that I'm going to pitch at the
Showcase later if you want to check it
out and what I did was I decided to
become an independent video game maker
and when you do that you're in charge of
the creative vision and that means you
get to wear a lot of hats see I picked a
picture and he's wearing a lot of hats
and so as part of that hat is you
telling everybody else on your team what
to do and had it and like how to make
this awesome product and you might not
be best suited for that and I wasn't and
I ran my face into a bunch of walls and
so I thought I would let you guys know
so that you could avoid those walls you
probably won't you probably run into
them anyway but at least you can look
back on this and be like oh yeah so uh
just in my background I came from a
large studio so I came from triple-a i
worked at rainbow studios and then i
went to dreamworks animation for a while
so what that looks like is something
like this I was a cog in a big factory
making awesome stuff but I had someone
above me that was art directing me and
telling me you know what the creative
vision of the product was and stuff like
that when you go indie it's more like
this and in reality it's actually more
like that right because you're going to
be doing most of the work however there
if you're lucky there will be one or two
people that will listen to you and
probably work really cheap and you have
to tell them what to do right and so
inherently this is kind of the problem
is is that you have to be the director
right and in a video game which is what
I make there's art there's audio their
story there's design there's all sorts
of really cool interesting problems but
the thing is is that what
I was a dreamworks I was at least
art-directed so at least I had an idea
of what an art director did so now I'm
just going to flip the scales and we'll
just pretend that that's a smooth
process and that's fine but what about
audio I had never even created audio
nevermind and Ben audio directed never
mind being an audio director I had never
I had written my own stories but I had
never directed anyone else to help me
write a story so these are kind of some
things that are really interesting and
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
give you guys my three tips that I think
are the biggest things that I learned
when I was going through this process
and the first one is called directing
results you do not want to do this and
let me explain what this is I learned
about this when I was a dream works and
we were doing live-action stuff we were
doing short short short films and my
friend told me about directing results
and basically the idea was is that you
don't want to tell the actor if you want
the actor to come in and be really angry
because his lover cheated on him or
something like that you don't want to
come in and be like oh you know what I
want you to stand here I want you to
throw the vase over there and I want
your eyebrow to be here you don't want
to direct the results of the actor you
wanted you want to give the actor input
and this is that classic what's my
motivation you want to tell that actor
you're really angry because you're you
know you were betrayed go and then if he
doesn't give you that you don't tell
them where to stand you come in and you
say you weren't giving me anger there
that look like frustration like this
your wife just cheated on you you're
really pissed and it was your brother
right you're angry and so that's what
you want to do it's the same way when I
was first doing audio direction I didn't
tell them Oh bring up drop that snare or
you know what like I don't like the
reverb these are all terms that maybe I
could use but I don't know enough that
audio guy is awesome and he's going to
make an awesome song for me but what I
have to do for him is I have to say hey
I want this to feel have more energy I
want this to feel more snarky maybe a
little bit maybe like I'll give him an
example which gets me to the next point
which is reference this is a really easy
way for you not to have to have the
perfect vocabulary and put everything
inside of your brain inside someone
else's brain and
say look that's a cool picture I want it
like that right and so that's what I
would do with my audio people I would be
like hey you know I wanted to I wanted
to I wanted to sound a little funky
because it's kind of a quirky game so I
gave him a cool track of electronic funk
right so in this example I brought on my
buddy Travis from Dreamworks and I was
like I wanted to have this city of
tomorrow and I wanted to have this
really cute scene with this little girl
and is very soft family and then this
like hard metal dog that looks kind of
like a shark and set up a little bit of
like a weird situation here because I'm
a bad person but so what I did was I
went on the internet and Pascal champion
does this awesome like really nice you
know soft family stuff that is in the
style that I like and I told trav hey
this is really cool let's do it a little
bit like this and what do I get right if
you look at this little girl I mean you
know that you're going to get something
close to what you want and you're
sitting there and you're just giving
them help you're not saying make this
because this is very different but what
you're trying to do is you're trying to
convey something with imagery or sound
or words it's ten times easier right and
they'll be happy for it the final one I
would say is pick a direction so this is
a fun story because my wife and I worked
together on a virus named Tom and on my
current game my wife and I are not
working together and that is because you
need to pick a direction I'm just it's
not that bad but at the beginning of a
virus named Tom I had an idea I wanted
it to be about circuitry and instead of
just going with my gut and picking a
direction and saying that's the way
we're sailing I said I saw this game
called flock and it had this really cool
quilted landscape and I was like oh my
god that's really cool i never would
have thought of that i'm not creative
enough and so instead of saying this is
the direction we're going I'm like let's
just experiment why don't you just come
up with a bunch of really cool ideas and
then we'll do one of them and so she
came up with all these cool weird ideas
that are awesome and then I was like hey
let's do it like a circuit and so at the
end of the day it was a little bit
frustrating for her because I acted like
we were going to go in all these
different directions and she was just
kind of sailing all around the sea and I
would pause it that it's way better
her to say with confidence we're sailing
this way and then three months later be
like this is the wrong way we're sailing
that way that is way better than being
like hey guys um we should probably sale
somewhere I don't know where do you guys
want to go that's the worst thing I
think at all for someone that is trying
to get direction from eunice trying to
make your vision come true is when you
say those horrible words of I know it
when I see it that's gonna that's just
going to break everything so I think
that you should have confidence in pick
a direction so just a quick summary
don't direct results give your talented
creative people that are working for you
some direction and you know let them
produce something awesome provide them
good reference so that they know where
they're going and provide them a strong
direction and I think with those I think
that would really help you direct things
so I have no idea how long that took but
that's about it I guess we can do
questions how do you know when you're
ready to go from being a solo in D to
someone who's going to go on and hire a
team and direct as you say when you can
convince a bunch of people to work for
you for very cheap you're ready like
literally I'll tell you what with the
virus named Tom I was doing it by myself
with my wife and then I started putting
things out on the internet and some
people would find that and they just
start emailing me and then at that point
I was like you know what like some
people are interested in this game and
really what a lot of people that are
going to help you want to do is they
want to make a game they really do and
they've either tried it and realize
that's a ton of work or they don't have
time or for whatever reason they aren't
able to do it by themselves but if they
see a project that they think will
finish then they will jump on that that
has like potential that they that
excites them that's what will get them
on board so all the people that I'm
working with that I worked with on a
virus named Tom I think they came on
because they saw what we were doing and
they were like these guys aren't going
to quit halfway through they're going to
finish this game and it looks really
cool so I think the it's just like
marketing your marketing yourself to
other people and that's the best way you
can do it because i think it going out
in this example my friend Travis
I did bring him on as a contractor
because I knew him and he was far too
expensive for an indie budget but I knew
exactly what I wanted from him so I
think that at the time when people are
contacting you or you're starting to get
excitement from it that's probably when
I would yes anyway anyone else so I
totally agree with each of your three
points and we yeah that's my experience
as well but sometimes you might be doing
all those things and the project isn't
quite going where you wanted to anyways
despite enthusiasm and despite best best
efforts what's your go-to when you feel
the urge to take too much control
because it's not quite happening what do
you do so well first I blame everybody
else right but no I I think that I am a
control freak I think you're going to be
hard for us to find an independent a
game developer that is in a control
freak because they clearly aren't
working at another company and they're
doing their own thing but what I find is
is that when I bring it when I bring
someone onto the team usually at the
beginning I have trust issues and so I
do like I over control and I over worry
about everything that they're doing and
then eventually I start to trust them
and so I find that whenever I'm feeling
things aren't going exactly right the
the temptation is definitely to like
gather all the bits that you delegated
and just take them all to yourself and
that's just ridiculous because you'll
never be able to do it I guess at that
point what you need to do is realize
usually it's a communication issue
usually it's like I'm not getting
something out of an artist that I want
and it's usually my first instinct is to
blame them they're a bad artist they're
doing it wrong but usually it's that I'm
not conveying what I need out of them or
there's something else so the first
thing I do is I go and talk to them and
nine times out of ten they'll tell me
something like yeah you know what
honestly I didn't really know what
you're talking about there but I didn't
want to interrupt you because you're
like a pen and so I just kind of gave
you something right and it's like okay
so you don't get what I'm looking for
whatever and nine times out of ten
that's usually my go-to is like
communicating with a team and being like
why isn't this going there and usually
they know I know because that's why I
bring them onto my team is because
usually they're smarter than me
yes use your words it's like having any
real it's like toddlers or a
relationship with a significant other
anything like that it's like instead of
just letting its do or trying to figure
out what this mystery reason is usually
it's you know somewhere in the room
there and you just need to hash it out
all right that's at least my experience
all right thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
