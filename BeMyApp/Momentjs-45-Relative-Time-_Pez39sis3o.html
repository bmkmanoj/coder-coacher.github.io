ever tried to compare a date to another
if so you should find this method with
momento Gia's easier first of all I'm
going to present to you the function
from now so for this you need a date a
result and invoke from now and display
as you can see we have four years ago
easy right now something more useful
we're going to create a difference
between two moments to find the
difference in days months or years
between them and start by examples of
the month so for this we need N and we
change the months and we're going to
change the result you need your and your
function diff and the start then we
display it as you can see we have the
results in milliseconds there's another
way to display the results in a more
natural reading unit of time so you need
a function duration your results from
before and the function human eyes
as you can see we are the results in
months you can also do it with the
functions as and timing it we are going
to do it in hours
and as you can see the result is in
hours to finish these expectations about
differences between dates and times I
just want you to check the function as
before enter tutorial after this you'll
be able to easily understand the
exercise and the warm-up enjoy and have
fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
