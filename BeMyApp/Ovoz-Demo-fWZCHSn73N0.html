does is they fool it is a food and
recipe application so what you do is you
take a picture of a grocery receipt and
all the information on the breeze gets
thrown under the cloud once it's in the
cloud it's start searching for recipes
based on what's in your refrigerator
entry so you know today I was craving
Beijing so I went to Whole Foods I went
to the deli section I saw a great piece
of center cut bacon and you know I
bought it it was hatred good deal i also
bought some chives and some cheese a
grim nipper be no ties but Chris
pecorino and so what I did afterwards I
did a picture of the grocery see it's
using OCR right now scan yes so here's
result it's a little off but as you can
see the output is French I've ever ever
you know
and that's as i get 5 to 25 to baby and
close to each other it's so say that
down I confront it and once us go down
they'll show that I do have these and so
since I said I was being bacon and I
have inserting my pantry for previous
purchases that I dead boy's trip receipt
and will generate recipes based on what
when I just find what you can do is that
you'll see that you can check off what
you have what you eat which which is
nice because they say you want to
serving me recipe you this is the way to
do it and since all the gadgets up in
the cloud and with the receipt it's not
just ingredients it's also crisis
location time thoughts on the items on
everything
phone number store so what we'll do is
average suspending and also since Gators
so per se eggs or churches strategies
that can be also this is how we monetize
line so the crap Chiefs effectively as
possible results and they pay for it for
that may be what people do is click on
it it will activate a new opportunity
store coupon day so when you do go to
the point of sale to show your demonic
along with cheese and that's a feedback
loop saying that okay i bought the
cheese</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
