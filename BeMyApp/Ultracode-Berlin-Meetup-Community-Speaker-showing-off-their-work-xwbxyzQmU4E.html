goal to do like getting a small movie
entitlement and I'm also getting
information about the project and
software come from places on can happen
to want and see what there's in there
almost up akasaka suppose work progress
and also to see Power also the company's
work with this company yeah the man for
example they'll just try to get like you
had both or some other stuff they don't
usually only money they are also happy
with I we did this app for waiting for
them to help them and this is the kind
of culture did another one benefits do
you have fun as I don't get it out a lot
after seeing this in our idea why should
i use because this kind of happened it
can go with app to as a vengeance or
anything else and tell people easily
what they are doing and because it's
attached you can easily grab you by your
sins instead of just strong picture say
all-star and again so you can give
people epigenetics pro by yourself or
gays and the other one is called the
jihadi tarana and they had the idea to
give it a which is probably jumped for
the little store it's a business for
doctors and all the book so thinkable
level there are frequent see for example
and put the information they're on their
way they can put inside here when do
they need to give the medicine also they
have the contents for example to the
doctor so for some damage give share
information they can decide which
encouraged able to share latest our
contact information on the same shop so
there will die UNS to give longer nap
different i'll type straighten up and
hit the illusion up to light on
information and is only between those
two type of people yeah it's already
over how is it really helps in
international high price well then we
will have a better and i want to report
communication between classes using
javascript engines and people you should
did you all know today as leo
my name is Chris Johnson super specific
pelipper during the day nine games
friends monthly packet one of the very
few games n which is meeting of people
who are interested making games using
their skills for fun and we will
everyone and we do small games in a
period of like eight hours so we're
going to show today is a many we go in
our last step and well the thing is that
interesting games is from a more
creative side of it which means
gatherings where you go around like
killing monsters it's like them that's
so funny good but I'm more interesting
what are both arts games so it's not so
much about the challenge or cutting
boards or a lot expressing talking about
situations so they are delicious and so
on so this would be for the straight
chain be pure and use them and it's
about relationship into people you and
your friend and you will see girls are
hot and
so the game is all shop and when you
stop this is art which is feeding this
part of your frame and these sentences
will you can tell you practice what you
say to your friend see what surveillance
to swamp the reason this just shot one I
have a lot of fun
you good you
so on
so was it was clear for from the
engagements business comic writer I
followed media all my students and yeah
Alex table details I actually use the
world for this does la la vie for any
magician for business and a support of
that work in examine 26 of a drilled in
the quad the fifth floor of the quad
secure favorite it's in a tower gem
which is from this is this it's not just
for programs like artis I mean graphical
our kids design as everyone is welcome
and all kinds of games all communities
while we're and don't know games also
board games without
how's the bits and swing how do you guys
are concentrated so well this was always
so that's also speeding happy be coded
so I think the more name is my name I've
209 and they're real available on other
because power into page imagery so
sheriff clarity very yes okay hello
everyone give me a name is 11 10 vs
Kelly CEO and co-founder and Ferb off
your list we are a small start-up
recently links and we basically got some
technical stuff how much of you know
bang boom yes ok now the JavaScript I
think a lot of you ok they sell quickly
itself it is we have joeys basically on
the front end up using that book we're
using that point with lots of JavaScript
that we have of course 50 for the
backend and for the first three days are
using movie always look for me from
unison 30 seconds about how you're
managing and such communication
because this is for us a very hard topic
because living are with you I think you
all know it's really really really hard
and well this is a screenshot of your
list basically if you wish you can
create lists of links and you can share
it with your friends with other people
you can also discover you become the net
sellers and this is my personal
dashboard here for example and preview /
single this is a widget widget then
scientifical that thing follow me
because I'm famous or social layer is
only top right and have some face about
my profile and here I have Moses and
said it's airship that amusing to search
my knees and what busy is well this is
very important so I we have a lot of
very different we just a lot of our
different motives behind your digits and
basically sees how a secret recipe we
are trying to eat too it is all
responsible when you buy or reserve it's
just a provider of data and basically
advice is a dish server know anything
above 85 this is far as a very important
point why every single feature cheese
render its birth way so they might
accept every single winter knows what
they have against number server so many
will not preparing for you doing this
okay so then we owe many people in
various or magnitude averages right side
and sew that to our you why this is
again our dashboard and to record this
dashboard basically we do we get to get
the native of my profile with positive
stuff my name will be on the label all
the leads of Oasis then we do
plenty others gets to the server which
is quite a lot good it will be base
about it with the lists and then we pick
the gas to get me they do not all users
that are in this varies basically
computer serious or is this a problem
well naturally is quite ready to be
served 3 720 hard but we don't think
this is a problem for us because
basically the first step when you're
reading something that this very complex
is to make it work right the second step
is to make it cheap so basically what we
are 33 cheaper is in technologies this
collectible hyperdrive basically is not
really just 140 lines of truth but i
will let you tell you about these words
well basically the rendering of the dash
for example and can see very tight loops
1 over 220 lists what will you do this
video class shall we move on Lulu data
any goal for example and eluted which is
the weight of the grandeur space this
movies really died because the nine dat
one hole and another ugly just previous
cycles so what we're doing with hybrid
right is that is splitting in two steps
basically the first time here over I
think that all seem needles to manage
all the patches that are happening on
the client so what we do we just capture
what his gifts using a bigger object and
buffer only or the queries to the server
and then after a voice move a lot of
times at like 50 a few seconds it just
goodies told the only answer this
server buffering of the first I have a
really small town of peace so for
example is is not happening second oh
well of course anyway this is ok this is
the nsbe network 5 from drama
established and this is the first gather
and going to get magnified as you can
see here and getting cold feet Jason get
our coats microphone without my personal
data and so for example here we have
loads of very skillfully data of the
users ok so that you have something PPS
users and if you go down the sound both
these bouts of requests we have also no
requests to get beta boss about all my
lists and motion here as you can see you
have a loss of very reasonable gets we
don't watch the babies and this is what
happens if yours are using is awesome
but if you turn Piper by tom this is
that legal happen you have just one coal
on packet right when you just put all
your gas yeah first is not so readable
but here basically we are doing on a
wave of quests and we are offering them
and
send them to the server and the server
does realize we only get a yard and
asking treats so from the scoop
everything okay this is the best one I
really hope you understand what we're
trying to do we will be sacrificed art
if you have a person and way of course
here to answer and one last thing that
we are are some talented JavaScript
developer and so you if you want us to
win thank you very much the last rookie
ok well just let's go that's mighty more
meet up anyway I think everybody poops
it with hope you are doing 153 so what
if you know in order to share so what it
will do is it will be destined to move
in Street School that out loud and open
with Vita time left thank you
happen
