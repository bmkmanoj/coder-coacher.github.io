for developing Johnny bumpers me the
best way to easily put up for the can
also see me this is my mentioned this is
a world program where we are and
developments to confront mr. Cates also
API documentation and I just wanted to
point out two different dates on one
starter challenge or interception
computing the key thing is um you see
all nighter surprise also I propose a
small slim very nice very nice
they are within this hall computing I'll
take for the challenge position our way
to change the way we could institution
wait wrong but as a reporter on
perceptual computing challenge on the
challenge with seven developers some
branding applications or AP is within
two weeks it would give you the robotic
soldiers but for tsommo and consign but
also on facebook to be judged by others
like social be special I back but should
be part of this is very nice way from
our side achievements t there's one
thing the other thing is the Pacific a
challenge this is entering phase two
we're still fine-tuning this stuff
good evening time so uh I got it right
you guys don't know much about
ultrabooks July okay so as I said I'm
just a free slice about it so to get
started because I enter experiences that
I i am personally very passionate about
it and I'm very happy to detail is
paying so much attention to it now but
it also plays together with witches any
tail heads above water pools in the
beauty but just all the stars let's yeah
I did it it right so my name is Kavita
i'm brazilian i will be i come from me
islet in the south of brazil co put an
opposite this is the kind of background
I grow up I was I booked some follow and
there was higher buddy tell unless you
to go to be a big first community
manager and I had a lot of fun then I
moved to London for years ago to work
with open source is marketing and then
two years ago women to have actually
it's not quite Munich but its mini
Christ but it's hard
very sexy what i end up with a very
different scenario on the weekends are
like to see and ya later on and explain
how i'm mixing message to my background
will detect oven and they user
experience but let's start from the
beginning so in service actually on the
fourth generation of the ultra boots we
started 3 over 1 year ago and we
bringing healing systems you have a
couple of examples in here so neutral so
i have here my my desktop my work
station which is a notable preacher the
first thing you notice is very free and
very light it's very excited there is a
lot of colors different comp practice
but it's not those thing you like is
actually quite responsive he has the
latest generation of retail core so the
response is what we expected and the
battery life we aim for food a battery
life and is getting better and better
and if this new generation the new
processor I degree engine Vincent agreed
they've really new features that are
trying to promote the use of sensors
touch is already required for 2013 we
have the new convert to close the
textbook you can stash you can turn it
around into Swami to a tablet and there
is a lot of things about sensors as well
so it's much you have accelerometer
application mr. like you have poor
posture new to communication and this is
this going on and the performance is not
the status is what i want to show you
this
what you can mention the perception for
you what perceptual computing means is
to have more metro interface with your
computer so I had a great TG Cameron
here and the perception computers
working is creative the camera and this
is the soil romantic but it's impulsive
age so they set up detecting just leaves
or the referral you can actually track
fingers and love us because around you
can actually track up to 10 fingers and
I think the sample to later on the rig
it show you more and more symptoms and
more examples we have facebook of nation
of face detection jetta strips
recognition a lot of steps so this is
what we're bringing to the micro to
bring more capabilities because we have
a barber processor we have new
technology we have the size and more
battery but what this also means is the
user expects everything to work if you
bring charge to a desktop the users can
expect that everything around when a
judge if you have gps it's going to be a
want to sort to have to react to the gps
to the location so it's not just about
the performance anymore or sponsor
performance develop a the security is
important but the user wants things to
be touchable they want to speak
naturally not to be the comment when you
using voice so using a natural speech
the user friendliness and it's easy to
use it easy to learn and all this so how
can we actually address all this and
that's it for today i hope for a user
experience and how can meet you later
and I notices everything now
user experience so let us start by doing
the record straight what we believe that
is user experience experience by into a
poison chalice and again I the
definition is an experience is what a
person can be a new one person saying
spews receive it's very psychological
very subjective they infuse and
perceives before doing and after using a
product or service so it starts going to
before you start from the expectation
from the marketing messages so what it
is the person thingy before our finding
your service of fighting a project due
me what is the experience like and after
what this visit is going to remember
about it and there is a lot of things
that play that because if you have high
expectations and then you don't believe
her a person that's going to remember
that your product or service felt
shorter if you if there is problems the
human mind is going to remember the
problems which more than the the the
nice things they're boys so there is a
lot of things that are in place of that
sees me we have a short time oh yeah and
so that's why I expected a study
psychologist well because I'm going to
begin to approach the engineering
sciences with the psychology so this
since their approach trying to
understand the question because the user
is on the center of the experience since
we have short time were you not going to
be able to cover everything just going
to select a few days there are other
process of design but one that is
becoming more and more the standard and
a lot of emotion for using is a user
centric design in this quite
self-explanatory you turkeys on the
center of the whole process so I think
it and we can define this users
designed by the forks four phases of
course one let's really know you're
using the second one is prototype spend
some time to retire then you go to the
airport that everybody has fun either
holding the software or designing and
then of course text you'll be fine just
let us see a little bit about each one
and a lot of people would like to think
that they deserve is everybody in the
world but everybody's award is a lot of
people and there are a different
scenario is very different and they have
different needs usually might be
shielded in an office very nicely with
very high speed internet information but
may also be someone that is on the
transportation trying to entertain
themselves trying to do so or to be
productive on the way to work on your
way to some someplace you can be trying
to achieve something else you can be
trying to achieve a better education to
achieve something that is face it's very
meaningful for the light of this video
displaced and easy to eat areas like an
Africa weapon an internet connection is
still very difficult or they might be
sharing involve people with their
comments or in their office in in
different cultures he didn't secretly so
in there also the Occidental Western
yeah in the nation are our part of the
world I get confused Portuguese in
English in Spanish we value into the
duality we want there is this quote that
says that you know the the Walkman was
very important in the United States
because people who listen to the music
they want without being bothered by
anyone else in in Asia people were very
happy because they
listen to music that they want without
bothering anyone else so there is two
very different perspectives of people in
some part of the world Valley Community
much more than individuality so people
know your user it's going to help you to
start designing what exactly is that
this best experience for this prototype
and when we run the application labs
it's very nice to see how in just five
minutes you can start while I see
problems you could just send a paper
because it doesn't take much more to
prototype just design something you can
use a drawer anything you can use enough
force and forgot to would say if anyone
has any questions anything actually have
some nice drops just to get you guys
more more motivated so so it doesn't
take much to prototype you can you know
have some dogs or have some big girl
perhaps anything that you'd like to just
create a situation and start drawing and
start designing and then you get your
ideas will they give you finish actually
for instance if you say over to a client
in show so this is what we're thinking
and they can say yeah that's I started
no that's not actually the problem that
I wanted to so it's very useful and then
of course proposal would find and then
if you spend every time on that and here
you r you then you actually understand
your user and you have a good Indian
sign this is going to be much more
useful because when we end this air is
part about developing you're not going
to find out that you actually have to
start from the beginning or start and
changing is the thing hopefully but if
there is a lot of there is a lot of
peace
searches and studies that show that
actually the investment that you have
been here it's much better and out and
used then if you ignore the other faces
and of course you go to the last phase
that it's test and refining this is
where you see it is going to show itself
so usability it's also very important on
a good user experience any means
efficient you use and also easy to learn
and easy-to-learn cannot be stressed
enough so this is my favorite example
cut the rope because we have very simple
very subtle is showing the user exactly
what it has to do with this into a
decision face is just a little hand
going through the this week and the user
is going to eat a that and he knows what
to do it's just swept there and they
just want to be character design and
then and that makes the user can we
borrow it and you would like is actually
having fun on that so this is for things
about the user centered design and just
to remember this is a lot about people
and so I would like to talk a little bit
just five pieces that you I think we
should know about people there was a lot
of place there is a lot of folks form
and let's just five so people don't
really think or work more that they have
to so when you're thinking about
features think about that is my user
really need this feature or does the
YouTube really need to know the court of
the proxy and what is going to be the
tcp / size or do I really need the user
really needs to select five types of
help to make a question or something so
really think about the features that we
want to
they're people have limitations the
story that we can agree that we are able
to test it's not true we only hope three
four informations at a time in mind so
the best way that you can help your user
is actually to make this information
very clear right in the beginning I take
advantage of the best air is on your
sleep we have the best information so
take a look on this research is usually
some of the top top right but not the
second top right there is a little
bedding in between socialism the crime
area in cultures there be a left right
that's the first area that people are
gonna look at it so make information
very easy to scale put it into writing
there and the most important information
put it on on first people I easily
distracted so if you put eye tracking
systems you're going to see that any
animation any noises anything changing
and your banner exchange anything it's
going to distract people and they are
the automatic you look for that because
that's how we are we're all people
moving around or something changing and
if you want people to be distracted in
your website or new application that
straight maybe it's a game that people
need to be aware that some danger coming
but if you want people to understand
some information into have a flow of
actions be very careful with right
colors fonts beings or todos people
great mental others they have ideas
about something that is might be around
my people sexual so for instance the
first one it's our standard or saving
files but nowadays many people who think
actually saw one of this or know what is
it even so so there is a lot of the new
generation doesn't even know what is it
and even though the people who never
worried it is it to see them this is no
say before that means that this whole
thing that it's saving so you know I
should see something to go to make sure
that you would instill what is your user
thinking about how to 22 permission if
you match the mental health and people
to create they're going to pendmore and
they're going to be much more easily
around your application and there is
very simple way storing a nice
information so right there is a upset of
recent post all the gas out one of my
favoritest things are opposed together
be able to be together to go together so
here you have to sing set operations all
the right you have all this information
together ending a lot just by adding
some space you create some organization
reset and this is very simple you know
the speech to start designing borders or
voting a lot of important than just buy
eggs some superficial location the grade
is around 90 degrees to be sent a
confirmation so there is a lot of things
that you can play with all our rich
shade with organization to be bordered
that can help you to organize
information on this mean it's very
simple and very fast muslims and why we
share all this about people and about
user centric design and knowing your
user and everything it's it's a lot
about establishing emotional connection
we mentioned that what the people are
going to remember afterwards it's also
going to be important so one of the
things that they say that if you show
you two pictures before i remember your
presentations as well so i like to try
it I don't know it's kind of work
because I'm going to remember on my
presentation this is my head but what
that also means it's going to be the
difference from your detractors and
promoters your promoters of people we're
going to need good reviews they're going
to tell other people that they use your
software it's great they're gonna give
you five stars and they don't tell a
blogad own tweeted about it and the
detractors are going to do the opposite
ago may give you bad reviews they gonna
influence people that are looking to use
your softer and me many of those
people's just angry because the subject
didn't work the way they expected of
them or some problem so remembering that
big things of all people with who you
reach is your user and think more
carefully about the whole process makes
a difference between happy user in hand
we use some extra research is so if you
sit the liable for user experiences to
make you think there are some other
nights nice information on designing for
interaction I don't know how the second
career direction is good for creating
think directions you know what is the
first thing that you need to meet you
well it can absorb in an exact and
what's going to be the result and by
having a nice fall emotional design
talks about giving this extra two extra
psychological background on things you
know why we hate to love everything
things it talked about it and one of my
favorites it makes everything asylum so
how do we manage to get everything from
you guys to be so messy for instance how
do you manage to get a dishwasher they
have 30 grams and
use one or microwaves that are have
button so many people don't know how to
interact so in how can we get that easy
simple when the patient's little bit
details one of my favorite websites so
what it says shows you examples of very
little things that makes a lot of
difference for the users so points in
some way to celebrate the ones that one
arrives in the darkness I feel a little
bit that when you like the video the
little guidance for you so it's a lot of
examples of a lot of software that does
is nicely to it so and again just learn
how can we raise the body's and thinking
about the uses and really take advantage
of all these new features that we are
making possible we fired so if you feel
there is too much that you would like to
get add someone so tactile and
specialist or if you want to know more
in you know I'm put it out on your in
your vs LA noire music eccentric design
makes yourself a great sign so you can
get back and just go to something
wonderful so that was about it any
questions or comments
