going to be explaining how the LED drive
works for this project we're going to be
using 768 LEDs and so for that we need a
real time based system like the Arduino
we're going to be using the Arduino mega
which packs a lot of memory so that said
I say let's get started now we're going
to see the code that is receiving the
information from the Edison and that is
going to direct the matrix it is a code
that will open a serial port here you
can see it it is going to listen to what
the Edison will send we obtain
everything that the Edison send us in an
array we are going to search for this
array and extract everything that we
need the only issue of serial
communication is data that is sent as
characters as a result to send numbers
like 100 we need to type it in 100 so we
have to do a bit of math to extract each
of the numbers are coordinates and our
luminosity values it is a simple formula
here we convert every character to a
number and then multiply it by its
corresponding decimal then we call that
function matrix draw pixels that enables
to light up a specific pixel on the
grade by passing what we treat to the
serial port in the arguments
when we reach the last
pics of the grid we refresh the display
by calling the matrix show be careful
when you declare the matrix you have to
put the right parameters the right
matrix size pin number and the other
matrix properties</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
