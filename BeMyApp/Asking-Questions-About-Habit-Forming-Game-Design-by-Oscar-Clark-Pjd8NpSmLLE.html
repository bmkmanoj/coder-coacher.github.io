worry this isn't the talked about unity
ads it's not talk about Oh ultrasound I
have some wire for sad it's not on what
Indiana does not talk about everyplace
specifically it's actually a talk about
ethics I know you thought you coming to
games conference but I'm asking to come
on talk to you about ethics ok and let
me start with this who's a big gamer on
tablet and mobile big gaming on I'll
come on degree I bet you are secretly i
bet you pet candy crush something on the
line bet you do come on national pride
and all that now who's a fan of
free-to-play do you know what I'm
surprised that's good that's good now
who's heard the argument candy crush is
evil because they say you know what I'm
talking about so there's been a cut a
lot of talk about the free-to-play
evolution so what's happened I've been a
big advocate for free to play for a long
time affect my job at unity is as an
evangelist for unity ads in every plate
yet but my remit is also about
understanding problems facing developers
so I've been really interested in free
to play on what happens with it and in
particular more recently when we see
people starting to question it now
obviously the first peoples are nervous
about idea now that says it's damaging
games and now it's saying it's addictive
well I thought would be a good idea to
actually look at some of the psychology
so this is not just a not technical talk
this is also one about psychology I met
you didn't expect that they're gonna
look at what happens to players because
we often forget games are about players
so let's talk about that so the thing I
want to try and just so briefly is just
give you a sense of what every play is
if this works he says sometimes it
doesn't work with the hdmi but that's a
apparently unknown bugging yes a known
bug in power but this is not supposed to
be a salesy pitch let's come back to
that later so we're going to talk about
every play at some point but it's
basically a game player recording SDK
which we have which means that you can
make your players record what they do as
they do it now to remember to turn on
recording it just works and you get
shared you get these crazy people
telling you about
great their experiences are playing a
game which is brilliant basically what
we love we love sharing our experiences
we games I'll talk Julia about ads and
some later but not very much first I
want to just declare something I am NOT
a psychologist however I do have a very
good friend of mine called Bernie good
who is and we are Co writing a book so
it's going to be called the psychology
of game design so we're really interests
in this area now I think that it's
important to understand what games are
games are things which create and
engagement through the autonomy the
agency that I have there's something I
do something to this we know the
difference been reading a book and a
game is that it's not this character
that is I did this there is no show and
tell
because we can feel competent at what we
do so what does that have to do with
this kind of game design thing well as
we've been moving on we've started to
see people as I said earlier starting to
question the whole kind of premise of
what games are when you see something
like clash of clans or candy crush I'm
packed actually not those games but the
games that are follow the names that
have copied them there's this question
about what habit-forming design does to
us yeah who's played fallout shelter
lately really my tell you 10 we're to
compare shelters i have 150 people in my
shelter what's that sir no one has an
iphone well that's true i have i'm an
android phone user and an ipad user so
in my defense see not the only one there
see with Brotherhood of the fallouts
anyway so the point of all that is that
there are these games which make us want
to go back to them time again in fact
the argument is that the user technique
called the Skinner box anyone heard of
Skinner box ok so signal which is
actually fairly old 50 60 s here a
psychology experiment my guy could be
iOS 8 this bj or BF Skinner things BF
Skinner our reason I get confused is
because the second psychologist i'm
going to talk about has being his
initials as well so BF Skinner talked
about what happens to rats in this
little cage which wasn't originally
called ask in a box but got given his
name later now I imagine this box it's
got some seed in it the animal presses
the button gets the seed fantastic turns
out if you make it more difficult for
them to click the button they'll keep
pressing the button till they get the
food if you make that random or change
the variable States you start
conditioning potentially conditioning
their behavior that's why it's called
operant conditioning and there's people
who've been looking at games like these
kind of standard repeating harvesting
and pattern matching games are well
because they've got this simple mechanic
and they give rewards they must be
Skinner boxes now
well I'm not sure I agree but let's take
that premise on the first thing I think
we want to think about is what our games
anyway games are manipulation we are
already changing people's behavior and
supplying them we reward for doing so
only we think about it right how many
games have you gone it's a first person
shooter you're going down the corridor
you find yourself turning left you're
not really sure why you turn that but
you did turn left and then later we find
out there was no right turn have you had
that moment that's magic that's magic
they made me do that I mean because we
know why because as designers we made
sure the Lighting's right with make sure
the audio is right we make sure the
reward is right we can tell that there's
monsters on this we're gonna go shoot
them or run away from the ones they're
coming from the other way you know if
it's like alien isolation you only get
away from there don't you I guess I do
want to get towards it so yeah that we
know about the sort of careful use the
unpeeling of the narrative that we do in
games that's what we do we are as
designers manipulators but is that evil
no because we're creating value
correctly entertainment so does it
become evil when we start adding money
is selling things in a game evil now
where I come from is I spent 17 years in
games I was the game global games lead
at three the mobile operator back in
like 2003 when we launched I did the
kind of fundamental design of the whole
platform there in 2005 we were doing
sixty-eight percent of the UK downloads
and plays forty-five percent of the
revenue on five percent of the audience
so I'm mr. evil but I am genuinely mr.
evil I took sixty percent revenue share
and I still paid out more than any other
operator no I really okay reason I say
all that is so I kind of understand
retail the funny thing about
free-to-play is the retailer isn't Apple
the retailer isn't google
it's you that's what's happened that's
the thing that Milo people don't get
inside games we've changed what we do
we've changed just that we provide this
entertainment and we let someone else
who has nothing to do in game design
decide how to make money out of it those
evil people over there in the other room
and instead we just focused on making
the game didn't we well I think actually
that's interesting I'll give you an
example is premium necessarily good an
autumn premium is necessarily good pay
upfront good necessarily i'm gonna say
name of the game and see how many people
know what I mean jus nukem forever yeah
anyone yeah i think a few giggles you
know what i'm talking about how i think
i spent 45 bar 35 pounds i think i spent
on it it only had to be bad and I'd have
been happy because I'm a fan I'm happy
to ensure my love for the brand it was
terrible it was genuinely terrible I
mean it wasn't it was just so bad that I
probably could have done it better oh
that's not fair I'm rubbish coder I I am
learning unity in my defense and the
last scene is your training day I
actually knew what I was doing I can't
believe it so I must be getting better
but you do not want to look through how
many logic steps anyway yes four loops
nope and so my place here yeah if I
follow a technical talk and I have such
talk about volumes that's bad at me
anyway um so money isn't necessarily the
thing the issue is are we creating habit
forming behavior which is changing
people's element of choice are we
actually affecting what they think
you're their choosing now who's paid The
Witcher 3 yeah which is three you have
the absolute free reign to do anything
in the adventure in them in the
admissions don't you actually you don't
there are loads of options there's only
one that actually takes the story
further they might become finished it
yet so there might be a couple there
that I have a bit more free rent there's
a couple i noticed there you could save
the family or not
the family but essentially you're not
really in control you're simply peeling
off the available layers which come down
to very small options that don't
actually change the fundamental plot but
you feel like they do I am The Witcher I
am killing all those Hippogriff San
matter I can't even remember the names
of the monsters it so you harpies and
all that kind of stuff I switched to
Batman recently so that's why it's out
of my mind anyway point being is that we
manipulate all the time we create
choices which feel like they're true but
they're not freed plays no different but
it's about money now so is money the
manipulation is money that thing that's
making this emotional reaction amongst a
lot of people now obviously the key
question has come out has been around
children now i'm not going to suggest
that we should be targeting children
audiences as some great legislation
already in place there's discussions
going on in the EU about how to present
things i don't want to get into that
because that's messy and there's all
sorts of other things that go along with
that so I specifically only want to talk
about people who are not vulnerable so
that means I'm not going to talk about
kids or people who have issues but
normal everyday folks is the target
audience here now if we talk about one
will everyday folks how many times a day
you presented with somebody telling you
should buy this now 2 for one buy one
get one free you are being manipulated
in every media on every device every day
multiple times a day do you do
everything they tell you to do you will
buy sell it bang and clean your bathroom
today because the sheltie man tells you
to sorry in the UK yeah but advertising
for facility bang is a anyway I won't
explain ask me later the bridge to tote
that the point is that we are actually
really good at skinner boxes as human
beings we are actually under understand
the process somebody offered to
something we can respond to actually
that isn't a singer skinnerbox
that's just somebody trying to present
us with an offer we have to make a
decision so i thought i'd ask the
question what is addiction addiction has
a specific definition i went for the
harvard health website definition if i
can remember of my head but it's
basically a compulsion that overrides
otherwise rational behavior so if i go
and buy lunch box in fallout shelter is
that something that's a rational
irrational behavior and am i compelled
to do it because it's so nice when i
open it up but i have to basically
stopped feeding my child to do it that's
the level we're talking about here we
that is the level that we would have to
be doing if this is truly about
addiction it is really truly something
which is evil quanta rephrase we have to
be demonstrating that a non vulnerable
people are going to be so absorbed that
we have the power the magical power to
force them to do something against their
own self-interest I don't think that
happens there's lots of reasons why
don't think that happens and I'm really
hope we can have a good debate about
this later on as well but essentially if
it's about addiction that's the that's
the bar we should be using the term
addiction about games the trouble is we
always use to look at great game is so
addictive it's a fantastic whereas now
look at game it's so addictive is evil
we have to decide what we language
you're using and the trouble is we love
games with adore games and we want to
get into that sort of magical moment of
a childhood where that when we were
playing I'm shopping for me it was like
policing like him I'm old I used to play
shades on my apple 2e online multiplayer
games in 1985 that's how old I am anyway
so I love this quaint chemistry I get to
claim this one I saved counter-strike
it's a bit of a lie they ran out of
money before they got bought I bought
them some new computers and three of our
team got the names in the credits and
stick that last bit I was only told 10
years later because they only put three
names on and they didn't want to not get
their names on it my David doesn't know
I know it's the point of all this anyway
is we're passionate and door games but
there's a difference when we use the
language of psychology to compared to
the language of design a lot of the
words we use particularly in
monetization like whale don't like the
term whale you like the term whale oh
sorry yeah actually I fooled you there
you've heard the term well they should
see that's what you do is at as a
speaker you try and get people to think
of a pattern of behavior and then you
fooled them oh wait that's a designer
and so but you're right you've heard of
it um well the whale comes from gambling
as you know is it a complementary
turning would you say I think I mean
many people to describe me as a whale
that was just me getting out of the
swimming pool come on it was better than
that Shirley alright so it's not a
common with return and not least because
we're in an industry where and casual
Bob not necessarily casually there's
only definition I don't think casuals a
good definition but on games which are
focused around audiences which happened
to be primarily female and slightly
older calling whales a is not a very
good term but it's also not a good
definition whales are not people they're
not things they're not you don't
suddenly miraculously spontaneously
create away look they go as well have
him whales are part or the term whale
actually refers to a part of an
engagement life cycle we find the gang
we discover it we decide whether it fits
into our lifestyle or not we learn about
it we then become engaged and over time
we may become super engaged and that's
what we mean by one we say well but this
use of this language is actually
problematic because the language is
what's the problem because we start
alienating people well that and when we
start seeing patterns of repeat behavior
designed specifically to keep me playing
simply to get money out of my pocket
I don't think games like candy crush
rules of clash and all guilty that at
all I think that there are some games
out there though that are trying to copy
the outcome of those games the way their
design because they've seen them being
commercial and i think as players we
don't give them enough credit i think
they smell you know if smell there's
something not quite right if your only
objective if your only objective is to
make money it's kind of a question that
we need to think about in terms of our
engagement with the player we have to
think about the behavioral process of
how they play because if you think about
what do games do the credit state of
flow flow is something which is really
fascinating it's it's almost like a
meditative state when you were getting
to that kind of we all know flow anyone
not know flow then you're not okay good
so flow is that meant as you stay when
we're not bored and we're not it's not
too difficult so it's great it's a
fantastic it's almost a suggestible
State arguably and at the same time
we're providing with reinforcements in
behavior do this this is the right thing
to do do this is right thing to do is
that very mushy that's kind of like what
the cults talk about in that way that
because the shrub is that's not what it
is at all and the one thing I think zoo
really saves it and this is where I'm
not I'm stepping away slightly from the
literature and i'm giving a personal
interpretation is it's something that
sort of your answer pet singer and i
think i've talked about in his
definition of games called homo ludus
and he talked about games being outside
our normal lives that's really
fascinating if and it's the third part
so we've we've talked about games as
being about competence we talk about
games about being about self belief but
actually the third part is also economy
and the third part is that games are
escape if games were about the real
world i could see how that manipulation
I mean but we separate us as we suspend
disbelief when we enter a gaming world
to think that we can actually you know
sustain the behavioral
over a long period of time that's over
guessing how far we can go with games
there's actually much more powerful
techniques out there to control people's
behavior in well controls our own work
to engage people joy fun value
entertainment that's the stuff that
makes games games if we focus on the
games they're the things that are going
to keep people playing we focus on the
enjoyment to play with the delight and
the reasons we don't control the
external stimulus we don't control
everything that happens to players we're
not dealing with food this is not rats
herds only source of food is to press
the right button at the right time we're
not putting their life patterns at risk
by withholding their gameplay what we're
doing instead is running with escape
growing opportunities but that's not to
say that we shouldn't be careful there's
some really interesting evidence that
shows that we need to show disengagement
we need to give people the opportunity
to not get so completely overwhelmed in
the moment the emotional heat then can
make them you you make you can encourage
people to make emotional decisions
rather than logical decisions and when
you do that you actually start breaking
down the relationship with the player in
the long term when we see people
manipulating people that's obviously bad
but more to the point even if we simply
engage people without a break we don't
just damage their long-term engagement
we actually damage like of them coming
back to play next time think about
mobile phones I've got a game that takes
maybe a minute and a half to play a
round of play this is one that takes 15
minutes on your mobile phone which one
are you going to pick up most often how
often do you know you've got 15 minutes
to play it very rarely so you choose the
one that's look at the right frame of
play the right rate and rhythm and
pattern and that actually is in our best
interest to provide games that allow you
to disengage it's only through that
disengagement we have truly good fans
because we can see here's an enjoyable
thing and I don't
turn out as good game design and so is
being upfront transparency it builds
trust it builds the propensity for
somebody to say hey i saw this game it
was worthwhile why don't you play it too
I saw this game is worthwhile i just
spent 15 pounds and i loved it i'd much
rather be in a situation when our
players love what we said Robin the
other around the games industry is a
fantastic position where we've gone for
the first time truly mass market we've
seen a phenomenal shift because of that
the tools free to play not only is there
an infinite amount supply of games but
we also have a much larger audience than
ever for seen in games and that audience
isn't willing to pay upfront that
audience has to be the light it has to
be shown what's possible but as
designers we have to be sensitive that
we have to provide it with the
opportunity to disengage and we have to
clearly communicate what we're offering
if we do those two things we can avoid
the accusations that we're Skinner boxes
we can avoid the creation of reactions
against our game and the reason that
happens is because we're focusing on the
fun here's a bunch of sources the stuff
i was saying is all based around a whole
bunch of information that i have
researched is research not just me
talking if you want to get a copy of
this i'm going to share with the people
and obviously feel sorry i have to give
special thanks or is it apologies to my
friend Bernie very good who's cyber
cyber psychologist even and like I said
we were about to embark on writing a new
book on psychology of game design I hope
that's interesting I'm happier asked
questions on lots of questions on
anything about games apart from
technical or pricing I don't talk
