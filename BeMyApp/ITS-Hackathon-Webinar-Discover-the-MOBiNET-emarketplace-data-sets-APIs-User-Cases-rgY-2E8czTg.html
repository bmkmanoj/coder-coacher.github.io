about that denmark and parking yes haha
okay okay perfect so well yes it is a
good time for me then to give you some
my customers I let you introduce
yourself and what you're going to talk
about thank you very much also welcome
from my side I will open this with a
quick overview of what movie nuts more
specifically G marketplace that I had
eyes on the mentioned before even though
my French is not perfect and to give you
an idea of what the concept is what the
possibilities were this concept is and
what our plans are for this for this
concept so just to start off moving that
is an easy fondant activity meaning the
Commission believes that the creation of
the European wide eee marketplace for
mobility services is very useful and
something that they would like to see
established and implemented in Europe
you know on a very high level and
e-marketplace mobility services is
basically a Directorate a categorization
of all the different apps that you can
find on Google Play or iTunes we'll have
you related to mobility so moving
yourself from A to B from any location
in Europe now that's not the only
functionality of this e marketplace
itself like I said it's a service
directorate of ability in transfer
related services eating is mainly used
to to enhance or as one of the reasons
is to enhance existing services it is
tooth it is for service providers to
find potential business partners so that
they can expand the customer base of
their service and move net is not going
to be a brand such you will still be
controlled and organized everything
through the service providers or the app
developers themselves in in this context
so you know for instance if Brussels
Airlines wants to extend their service
from not just buying your ticket to fly
from A to B but extend it to also all
the transport mode at your destination
that is something that could be enabled
by an e marketplace so instead of doing
12 1 business and negotiations I guess
someone I brussels airlines are big
enough to be able to do this but there
are us who are smaller in size and you
would have the possibility of finding
potential business partners through the
platform that's one part the other
functionality the other part of the
platform itself is for public
authorities to make available traffic
related data you know today there's a
lot of discussions going on in Europe on
both local regional and national level
in terms of what do they do from the
public authority side with all the
information they have from the transport
network being buses taxis trains etc etc
and the trend is to make this more open
for developers to become innovative and
develop something new for people that
are not stuck in the transport sector
but some of you might have a different
view of what mobility could look like so
what mobile it also does is that it
enables the public authorities to store
their data here to make sure that it's
visible through the marketplace so that
there is one reference point for Europe
of finding this traffic data finally of
course through the front end it's also a
b2c service so basically a nap
directorate of mobility services that
what i mentioned in the begin
meaning that you could look at it as a
category of ability apps so that's the
three main elements are moving it now of
course in that it's not just a
cloud-based platform and e-marketplace
what we've also done is that we have
developed different sets of components
to be used for either enhancing an
existing service developing a service
using the data to do is a service so
that use the data in moving it to
develop your own service so basically we
are talking about the movie agent which
is the interface the app on on smart
devices and those the movie center or on
the right that contains service
directorate identification manager etc
etc which are components with AP is that
will be available for you during the
ideas hackathon to be used for whatever
innovative idea you come up with of
course the main point of entrance to the
wonderful environment of Morgana's is
through the dashboard when you do have
an the sdk where you do have the tools
and documentation available for the for
the development now because moving it is
all about the platform itself it's quite
difficult for anna validation for
validation point of view to figure out
how does this actually work so what
we've done in the context of the project
is that we have developed wow we have
developed a large case of potential use
cases around different services and fade
later on after i finished my
introduction will take you through one
of them particularly which is the
parking service so all these are used
and services that are described in the
service director it can be used some of
them have AP ice on top of it that can
also be used by you during the ICS
Agathon but basically from moving at
sign we're using them to validate the
platform itself that it covers the
aspects required from
a service providers point of view there
was the services in addition there's
also quite a lot of data available
through brunette which is going to be at
your disposal for mixing up in any shape
or form that you see fit to come up with
the innovation on your side it's the
open transport data from the city of
Bordeaux in France it's open data from
Glasgow I don't know how we handle with
driving in either side of road a bit
backwards in the UK but I'm sure we can
figure that out there is parking data
available from data and tricular and
grease road words warning data from
elmont as the sickening and timing phase
from elmont as well as in Vigo and Spain
there are some user base insurance
related data sets from three insurance
providers and there's a journey planner
API from Helsinki so these are the
minimum set of data that will be
available for you and we are currently
looking at to see if we cannot add
additional data on top of it maybe
though some big transport data are being
discussed current music for some Earth
Observation data from a satellite that
potentially could be used and can be
could be played with now my background
is more on the business side and not so
much the technical aspect and Faye will
take you through the technical items and
the support documents etc etc also the
parking services promised in a little
while but just to give you an idea for
me this could be quite interesting
because there are many many different
scenarios and services one could think
about using these data sets and
potentially enhancing combining the
services that we've already done one
thing for instance we haven't looked at
is power to wheelers any specific
requirements for them we do know
especially in Brussels where I live that
traffic congestion is this not perfectly
the same for power tubulars as it is
sitting in your car so specific routes
in terms of them there is integration of
different modes has been done so
sort of not everywhere Klaus horsing
last week I saw something quite
interesting in terms of clubs awesome
your groceries that a neighborhood would
combine going to the supermarket and
having their groceries delivered at the
door there is gamification of travel
behavior across different cities as a
mobility dashboard of cities mobility as
a service think of it as you know the
mobile communication you choose your
mobile communication an operator based
on the bundle that you get X amount of
free data roaming in Europe locally
three minutes phone call between two
subscribers to the same company cetera
et cetera why not take that idea and
transfer that into the transport sector
so I think there are many many ideas in
terms of what potentially could come out
of something like this one thing that I
haven't put on here which I thought was
interested but maybe not in the context
of mobility is I actually saw someone
six months ago developing a piece of
music with traffic data from a specific
city so there are many ideas obviously
that's not specifically what we're
looking at in this case we are looking
more at the mobility aspect and the road
safety aspect so that's more than two
items of you looking at plus we are very
very interested in a European approach
instead of a local approach to the
specific service now I said also that
this is an easy funded projects and some
of you might think okay that means the
start of ax men and what's going to
happen after the project is finished we
actually have a lot of plans in terms of
continuing and commercializing this
platform after the end of the projects
what we're doing is with the political
support and the backing of the different
companies who was involved in this we're
developing a plan of how to maintain
this after the lifetime of a project in
a very short term that means that
whatever we're doing in board or
whatever innovative ideas we get in
badal whatever external source drivers
that is interested in
as we will load maintain help continue
the development if needed up until at
least doom next year and Beyond but at
least in the first insistence of june
next year and we will try to showcase
and propriety we will showcase an
extended version of morgan net at the
european HS congress in glasgow 2016 so
there are plans to maintain it recall is
the provider community that's going to
continue this and take it forward we are
very serious of making this something
that is unique in Europe we are in
discussions with many different
stakeholders of how we can integrate the
different services and really for moving
it or the concept of moving it to become
the e marketplace in Europe so that was
a little bit my opening statement as
Alex said or I'm sure he said is that
we'll have a Q&amp;amp;A session in the end so
if there are any questions relate to
this feel feel feel free but just before
I give the floor back to Alex for him to
continue and for Fei to continue the
technical introduction I just want to
say that what are you going to see and
what you'll have access to today we'll
have a little bit of limited head
limitation in terms of access to some of
the support documents the data set I
showed you is also available but we will
be adding more data and there will be
some last-minute fixes to the platform
itself but rest assured what you will
see today is ninety-nine percent of what
you will be able to play with when we
get to bottle so with that I think Alex
back to you yes great thank you very
much Rasmus thank you for this
introduction and these inspiration so
I'm quickly going to give the
presentation desk to a PHA so hyphae are
you together with us
yes I'm here how are you s so i will
present a technical presentation of
mobile net from the perspective of a
developer so let's see what we can do
with mobile net first of all the first
thing that the developer looks for our
resources word file resources in order
to develop our application so the first
thing is what resources are available
and the next thing is where to find
these resources after logging in to
nominate platform at the menu section
you will see a support page work you can
find related mobility related
documentation tools and videos this
documentation are after presenting the
area here a please some of them are
introduction to the graphical user
interface of mobile net dashboard and
some are programmatic to cuba
documentation in order to develop your
own your application so as a developer
you would like to pay attention to
mobile sdk manual the service machine
the machine to machine service directory
discovery and the entity a monitored
user guide from the point of tools you
will have available the movie net SDK
for eclipse
you will also have a available Santa
loan application or a plug-in for
creating a service descript description
file these are on these and these two
will be demonstrated later on so in
order to access the documentation and
all the other researchers and the
functionality of mobile net you must
gain access to the movie that platform
let's see how we can access it from a
graphical user interface I will show a
video now okay if you point your browser
to mobile center moving it EU you will
find this page you have a possibility
whether to either login with mobile net
ID or with Google open ID let's see the
mobile net bamba net ID here you can
either sign in with your credential or
SANCCOB if we go to San gap you will see
the required fields the name the surname
the password the email of course in the
day of the hackathon you will be
provided provided with your credentials
so you will only need to log into the
moment platform and you will not don't
need to register yourself so if I put in
my credential of course there is an
additional paid when you will use open
ID we press the yellow from a transfer
button and we have entered the moment
gosport so
of course in order to connect your
application with a mobile platform you
must do it programmatically so for this
we have created two manuals the first is
the under the manager user guide and
second is the manual for the SDK so
let's open the identity monitor and for
example and the identity manager let me
show some go to you in pizza 67 sorry
you can see for example here there is a
rest interface in order to do a basic
authentication you can do a get request
with some credential and you will have
as respond edition format information
this is the information that you will
see we receive for example if everything
go well or if something goes wrong then
you will receive a false false response
so let's go to the mobile net SDK
inspecting page 87 you have the whole
documentation about the authentication
via arrest happy and you will see all
the functionality that you can perform n
examples of how to authenticate to
mobile net platform programmatically ok
so now I will illustrate how to use
mobile net by demonstrating a use case
this use case is the parking services
use case
let's see what this use case does
originally we had a business-to-business
parking data service which collected
real-time parking information from more
a city in North the Eden mud called
Albert then there was we developed a
business to customer application the
park named park assist which actually
taken the directly from the
business-to-business service the data
but the problem in this situation is
that if you want to add more business to
business services for additional cities
to the application then you must help
alter the application so this is not
very nice so in order to do that we have
intervened the bombing net platform so
we have registered the
business-to-business a service of album
to mobile net platform and we connected
the business to customer application
with a mobile neta platform so and this
was a huge case of the of the mobile
platform additionally we have created a
business-to-business service for a town
in greece called trikkala again we have
published the service into mobility
platform and then magically without any
alteration to the park assist
application the park assist application
can also retrieve the parking that' from
more from trikala if the diversion costa
rica
so is this the dish case nah now
oh there farisha and what the
application does sorry yes oh yeah so we
just experiment yeah we experimented a
few issues on the sound so now with it's
good now you can you can you can go
ahead okay so let's see how the
application works first we will visual a
virtually a move to album please bear in
mind that the application will be
demonstrated through enemy later in
order to demonstrate the change of
location from Al work nor thermal
Denmark with Rick Allah which is located
in Greece sorry so let's see so we have
positioning our mobile phone in a North
denmark in ALB or more specifically and
we open the park assist application
which is developed by Albert University
football maybe net we press the
automatic back and pay button and em up
it's open which way on this map you can
see all the available parking bays
around our location this is actually
retrieve through the movie net platform
we can see the different parking bays
the capacity of the parking bays the
real-time data about availability if we
open one parking bays we can see the
opening hours price play the price of em
or for one out for example and we can
even see a guidance to the spartan bay
if we go back to the map and we can also
click on the different icons on the map
and we will see this information again
so we can select one that seems to be
near us and we can see the real time
information about this so let's now move
to drink alone with Julian so we go
after 10 hours or a day of drive we have
reached to the color center of trickle
oh and again by opening the same
application we can see all the available
parking bays around our location again
we can see a list of their available
parking bays and the parking space
availability and honor well from age
rise about you been and stop
faye up Faye we come to you could we
can't hear you anymore can you hear as
well are you still here with us yes
change ah yeah it looks like we are
losing you sometimes oh oh you are
kidding me I just know it's better from
sometimes yes sorry for this so let's
see how the parking service looks like i
just opened a restaurant and if i put
the correct URL and and to perform a get
request i will receive additional a
format file which has the geometry of
the of the parking bay it has the
opening hours because a the time price
it has the capacity and so on so and let
preciate the next thing fit but it
developer will think office so about the
model so in order to address this we
have created into mobile net a data
format card catalog so let's see how
this cutter looks like again we go to
mobile net dashboard we open the menu
the search the data catalog shirt and we
can see with a data formats are
available for our case the car park
information is relevant so if we see the
details you can see some
a information about who have created the
format and if we open it we can see an
example of how this data format looks
like this is familiar this is what our
service that I presented earlier brings
to us and here is the capacity and the
availability and of course the labels
about this information and we close this
and we go we have also the the ability
to create our own data format so we go
to the management the data format
catalog management we have the ability
to delete or to edit a format
description so here is the fields if we
like to eat it and also we have the
possibility to add a new format if the
ones that are available are not though
they are not suited for our case so now
we have created let's say that we have
created our our service and we want to
publish our service into mobile net in
order to do that we must first create a
service description file let's see how
this service can be created three tools
in order to do that we have three ways
we can edit it by using our slowly this
is how a service description file look
like it's an XML file you can see
relevant information inside this this
file you can edit it with your favorite
editor for example here you can see the
where the domain where its costed the
board the token
the above where we can find the service
we can even see that repair the area
where the the service is applicable we
can see the format here is a JSON format
well we can see that this is a business
to business service we can see there the
tags you can see the category of the
service who has created the service and
relevant information so this is the one
way to edit your Oh your description
file another way is to install the a
plug-in that we have we provide an
eclipse plugin or to use a stand-alone
application which I have just opened
let's create a new service description
file we put the name to this
descriptions by my service and we open
it so now we can create the xml file we
must put the service ID which must be
unique we must put at the type of the
service other business to business or
business to customer relevant tags that
can be searched by the category the
categories can be as presented in our
case is parking of course we must insert
the data work we can access the service
what method in which domain the horse is
not the domain the board the protocol
and who has created this service let's
open now a file an already created file
for album parking
so here you can see the service ID which
must be unique in mobile ad platform the
format the situation format it is a
business-to-business service relevant
tags and let's go to end point now so
you can access the service through
mobile net tot eh Stratcom the board
protocol and the path in the area we
appoint a to do at two points that we
can put an see the area of applicability
of the service and this is how we create
our service description file okay now we
have created the service description
file and Wilma spam listen or service
into mobile net the platform let's see
the service directory of mobile net and
their capability ok in the menu again we
have the service directory search menu
if we click it will see all the
available services in mobile net
platform so we can search the directory
directory for example I put in the
keyword parking and we will see the two
services for trikkala or either album or
the application so let's see the details
this is we have seen it a lot this
details this is a business to business
service and this is where we can reach
the service but we can see we can
visualize the service description file
and you can either we can also say a map
of where the service is applicable so
you can see in our case the
applicability of the service that they
deserve in the greater area of trickle
ah city so now let's open the
application here you can see that this
is the business to customer application
and you can find it in google play okay
and now we will demonstrate how to
publish your service you're already
created service description file to move
in a platform so again we go to service
directory management and here you can
see all the services that you can manage
so I only have access to the parking
service of trickle oh so you can see
that it tails you can delete the service
or you can upload a new service so I
delete this the service now it's gone
and now I go low publish the service
again we can do that by just drag and
drop the created file here is the xml
file we just check and drop the file
into this panel and we press upload and
here we have the parking service
and now you have we can also see that it
tastes again what is the applicability
okay this is how you can do it by using
a graph collusion a user interface but
of course in your application you will
probably need to do this
programmatically in order to to do that
you can find to a document the service
directory a machine to machine service
discovery PDF and the a manual for the
SDK let's open the machine to machine
service discovery for example here you
can see how it is request body looks
like for example here you can see all
the available the available services for
this area let's open the manual now and
we go to page 41 okay here you can see
an example of how to perform a search in
service directory and here is the
request that you must send and I can
demonstrate it lie because the platform
is working so
if i just i just opened the rest a
client again I go to this URL where the
rest api is exposed I I do post request
I put in this XML file um as you see I'm
searching for all the services that have
a stag the negative word parking so if i
send this request you will see what is
coming here is all the available
services that are relevant for parking
so you will see the button service three
kayla is the albergue service and the
business to customer service and that
was all from my side and questions
okay so well if I if I can take this
opportunity to ask a question Faye I was
wondering all the all the data sets
available on mobile net are on the JSON
format no the it depends if the parking
car the parking services expose a the
data a station it can be whatever
whatever it it has decided from the ones
that have created initial created the
service for that so I can be a CSV file
can be xml file that's okay cool depends
on the service ok so we also have a
question from Clem oh hi c'mon by the
way so this question is what kind of
data is they're available in Bordeaux so
maybe this is um oh can you hear yes
maybe I think actually I i can answer to
this question because ok so let's say
that so far we don't have the details
yet but actually two good points
clÃ©mence because we are going to gather
all this information you know Rasmus
presented also datasets that will be
available for the hackathon but it seems
that you you're looking more into
details about these data so as soon as
we all have all the information we share
with you all the details of which data
will be available
so so far we don't have in any more
question maybe Faye another do you want
to add something or is there something
that you want to add regarding here yes
just good luck maybe there's one comment
from my son Alex about me please please
go ahead for the 40 companies and
organizations who is part of the
development of magnet platform services
providing content in some shape or form
or for the hackathon for us it is very
very important than you as participants
have the right support and the right
here either technical or business
support that you need in order to be at
your best in terms of innovation so I
saw one of the questions related to the
support itself what we have secured is
that the people responsible for the
components and development of the
components within the oven it will be
available there's quite a few people
with business backgrounds that will also
be available and we'll help you know
ideas give pointers etc etc there's also
some people available in terms of who
has played with the components and
developed services out of those
components so for us it's very very
important that you have the best
conditions possible during the event to
make sure that you have that you are at
your best so if anything pops up during
the meeting except etc etc we will be
there to support you
a power for that then yeah also a good
luck for my side and I will hopefully
see you in almost exactly two weeks time
well I guess the mentors are shown on
the screen right now and your number
five is going to be surprised
hi can you hear me now we can yeah yeah
okay so i just noticed that I was
picking by my own so yeah what I was
explaining and I was showing the mentors
team and also the the judges here so we
have yes seven seven judges and and then
just giving a quick reminder regarding
the price pool okay so as I was saying
so this session has been recorded okay
we'll put it live on youtube and we will
share it with all the registrant of the
hackathon then yeah people will have the
same level of information okay so it's
my time my turn to say good luck to all
of you thanks to all our panelists today
sick Rasmus thanks Faye and thanks to
