sense and probably to start with how
many of you have heard of real sense
okay most of you that's that's good I'm
not going to talk too much I just want
to give you guys a quick introduction
and to what real sense can do and what
what we're doing in this space and how
you can get in contact with us or how
you can develop applications with with
real sense so we all know that app for
the past like 30 or so years we've we've
had this unintuitive let's just say
mouse and keyboard i mean it's it's a
bit hard to use you have to get used to
it if you look at kids nowadays you give
them a touch that but they instantly
know what they're doing or they want to
do gestures what they want to do
anything else apart from a keyboard and
a mouse so I mean what comes next next
we are looking into perceptual computing
or real sense so we've started this
journey in 2012 we've started with the
perceptual computing SDK and it was the
first SDK that we brought out out there
that would do some gesture recognition
you would do some phase recognitions and
voice recognition and since then we've
been working on it and working on it and
we've improved it quite a lot and a few
things that we've improved we've gone on
we've done a lot of work on the hand and
finger tracking so when we started with
this we were doing some basic gestures
we were tracking the hand we were
tracking for example 7 points in the
hand so it wasn't that accurate then
also on the facial analysis we also
tracking around seven points on the face
so again not see you accurate just the
basic stuff and since then we've done a
lot a lot of work on this and on the
hands for example we've gone from seven
to seven points to 22 points so now we
track all of the joints in the hand for
example so it's much more accurate you
can do a lot more gestures you can take
advantage of basically every every point
in your hand on the facial part as well
we've gone again from seven points which
was not as accurate we now track 78
points so again it's much much more
accurate we have some predefined
emotions
we have as well as some you know mimics
of the face and gestures and so on we've
also added a few other things so one of
the things is background segmentation so
basically there's no need for a green
screen anymore you can just stand in
front of the camera and it will just
subtract the background behind you so
that's that's quite cool you can replace
that with an image you can replace that
with whatever you want really also we've
done a lot of work on speech recognition
there there are a lot more things
available it was it was it was much it
works much better and we well you can
use that in any application to to do
speech synthesis or speech recognition
and so on and the last thing that is is
actually quite coolly the 3d scanning
and 3d reconstruction so what you can do
with the realsense camera is you can
scan an object and you'll get a 3d mesh
out of it so I don't know how many of
you have seen the HP sprout device
anyone okay of you so basically it's a
really cool device it's a like an
all-in-one and it has like a thing on
top and which has the realsense camera
and what you can do with it is you can
put any object in in in that area and
you can scan it and then you get a 3d
model out of it so they were showing a
really nice demo at Mobile World
Congress for example they were scanning
a mask so just a normal mask and then
you could play with it you can make it
you could play with it in like a 3d
environment you could turn it around you
can put some modify the color whatever
so that's that's actually really cool
quickly on the camera itself when we
started this in 2012 with perceptual
computing we had a quite bulky cameras
kind of try this twice the size or three
times the size of this so it wasn't
really portable but we we had something
to get out there and to show people that
we were doing something in this space
and you know in usually Intel Intel
style we kind of minimize this and we
shred we shrunk this and we've gone from
this bulky camera do this kind of you
know thin camera you can have a look at
it later I'll have it here but
basically what we do is we want to put
this in laptops like this and this is
this is what we call a reference design
this is done by Intel so that we can we
can give it to our customers in showcase
how these things work or on OEM can take
it further and make it into a product
like that so you can see is it's just a
normal lid basically so it is really
thin and it's a 3d camera in there okay
currently we are working we are working
with Microsoft on this and this works on
on Windows 8 you'll probably ask me a
bit later about till now we are doing
some work to to make this available for
multiple platforms but it's not yet
there the so basically we have the
realsense developer kit this is the
camera it's already available online at
clicked intel com you can you can buy
the camera it's available for
ninety-nine dollars also apart from
shrinking the camera itself we've also
done a lot of in or work on to improve
the camera so now we have a full vga
depth resolution previously we had only
qvga as well as a 10 1080p RGB camera
previously was only sent 720p as well as
we've improved the range so now we with
this short range camera we can go up to
about 11 meter 1.2 meters with with
gestures in face although because it
needs a lot of processing power it will
it will currently only works on the core
processors and it needs a USB 3
interface but it's only because it does
need a lot of processing power to
process all the depth data and and so on
ok basically we have two types of
cameras we have the user facing camera
which is which is aimed at you know you
being in front of the laptop you want to
do a gesture I want to I don't know go
to the next slide I wanted to recognize
my face to lock me in securely and if
some of you have seen the windows hello
announcement anyone's in the windows
hello announcement
so windows hello basically it was it was
announced by Microsoft and it's a way to
securely log into your computer and that
uses the realsense camera but we also
have something called a world facing
camera that's a longer range camera and
it can do its it targeted at the
different different environment or a
different use case you can do some 3d
scanning on that you can do some
measurements and I'll show you a bit
later with the with Adele with the dell
tablet we plan to integrate this into
multiple form factors we start from
laptops and then to in ones and
convertibles basically on the two and
one sign can show you this this is a
week or two in one or convertible
because I can turn this into a tablet so
just like the yoga if some of you have
seen it I can switch this into a tablet
so I can I can turn this into a tablet
as well as all-in-one so what we call an
all-in-one is this HP sprout basically
you have a big monitor with without
anything else basically it touch or you
have a an external keyboard but that's
that's it ok
so on the actual types of things that
you can do with that with a with a
camera in with the SDK you can do well
one of the categories is the hands so we
can do hand in hand and finger tracking
so just tracking that something is there
or a hand is there and then we can do
gesture recognition so there are
pre-built API is in the SDK that you can
use in any application and you can do
swipes peace sign whatever thumbs up
thumbs down there are a few pre-built
gestures that you that are in the SDK
itself on the face detection again you
can you can detect the face with track
as I said 78 points in the hand sorry in
in the face and you can group those if
you want so for example if you just want
to use the eyes ones you can group them
into the eyes or the nose or the mouth
or the eyebrows or whatever you want to
do a motion detection so basically if we
can detect whether you're happy or if
you smile or if you're sad or you know
many other things as well as pulse
estimator so in the latest release that
we we brought out a couple of weeks back
we can detect the pulse from from the
face and I'll show you that it's pretty
cool and the other things I thinking on
the environment yes the 3d segmentation
that's also really cool demo and I'll
show you that probably in the demo
section and 3d scanning go and augmented
reality and we also work with with quite
a few partners so on the on the last
part for example on the 3d scanning
augmented reality we work very closely
with Matteo they are leading augmented
reality company and we've integrated
their their IP into our SDK and on the
speech part for example we work with
neurons so the speech recognition is
from neurons okay quickly how you how
you can use the SDK itself so we support
for programming languages so C C++ C
sharp JavaScript and Java as well as
unity so in the in the realsense sdk
when we when we've redone the whole SDK
we've also added unity support so
I'll show you that in a second and the
other the other development tools you
can see them here if you're interested
in more detail just come to me now I'll
tell you more about it I want to click
this I want to keep this session fairly
quick so that the other people can show
you some more some more exciting stuff
okay we also have something called a
privacy notification tool so because
this might impacts or might have
something to do with with privacy no
privacy is really really highly regarded
in Germany we also have something called
the privacy notification to so when the
camera is is working or distracting you
there's a pop-up saying go hey we're
tracking your face or we're doing
something with the camera ok so we also
support a web environment so we have
different AP is that also work on the on
the on the web so via JavaScript you can
access those gestures and facial
analysis as well as unity Web Player and
all this has done is obvious in an html5
and JavaScript so if you're interested
in that come and talk to me on the unity
production I sorry productivity
extension basically what you do is you
just download the unity unity tool and
then you can you can plug in real sense
into into there ok more information
about about how to develop or how to how
to basically on real sense it's
available at intel.com / real sense /
SDK and we have this Intel Developer
zone which is a really nice tool for
developers like you guys where you can
go and ask questions and someone either
someone from Intel will come back to you
or someone from the community who
already has dealt with this will come
back to you and you also find a lot of
resources there on real sense on Android
on html5 on basically we have different
pillars that we we put in in there and
you can you can have a look into any of
those okay I think that's pretty much it
on my slides I just want to show you
very very nice demo that one of my
customers was working on so
let me quickly switch give me one second
there we go
so basically what I can do with this is
let me try and so I can see something as
well basically contract my face and I
can do different things with my face and
it also tracks my hand so that's that's
just one cool thing that you can do with
with real sense and i'm happy to show
you this a bit later so i think that's
pretty much it what i wanted to say from
my side are there any any questions any
burning questions yeah you have a dinner
with the resolution of 3d scan the model
that come out of your through your skin
oh no unfortunately I can look into it
but i don't i don't know that off the
top of my head hmm is the ID sdk open
source it's it's available on the
website but it's not open source it's
available for free say that again yeah
yeah basically we offer the tool sorry
the sdk for free to developers and they
can they can do an application they can
sell it after not so yeah yes
okay so the question was how much
process was done on the camera and how
much is on the pc i have to repeat the
question because I were recording
there's no processing done on the camera
itself everything is done on the cpu and
GPU correct okay if you have any more
questions I'll be around feel free to
come and talk to me and yeah basically
have fun and thanks for coming I know I
mean I've been out there today it wasn't
nice it was it was absolutely horrible
actually um but yeah thank you very much
for coming and yeah let's move on thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
