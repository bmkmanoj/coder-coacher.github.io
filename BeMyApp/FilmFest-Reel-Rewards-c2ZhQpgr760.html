ways of engaging audiences our audiences
are our filmmakers VIPs as well as
audiences and anybody who loves you know
today's a big day right it's the Oscars
and right now in Hollywood they're
sitting in a VIP lounge and someone
spent a lot of money for that event and
what we think that could be the next
interesting thing as a smart coaster and
the idea is we put the beacon inside the
toaster and it looks exactly like this
we've outfitted a beacon and it has a
temperature sensor so the idea here is
as the temperature goes up or down we
know there's an active customer using
and drinking we can silently tracked all
the customers that need attention for
the bar staff we know how long they've
been drinking and what they're drinking
is over so for playing the role of Bruce
during today we have how significant for
him and he's going to get it started and
while he does that I'm we're going to
pause for a moment while he puts the
bureau and I'm going to switch over so
you can actually see now what's going on
is we're using Gimple and they have a
they have a temperature sensor built
right into their tiny little bit and
what you're seeing is the list of folks
that are sitting either at the bar at
the moment I've got sandy
they're all kind of they're all kind of
thirsty at the moment but in 30 seconds
that's the amount of time it takes we
should start seeing some activity
because we've got we've got one of them
that is how it has a hot drink and
another one has a cold rain the other
ones haven't been served yet another
bottle imagine we open these guys up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
