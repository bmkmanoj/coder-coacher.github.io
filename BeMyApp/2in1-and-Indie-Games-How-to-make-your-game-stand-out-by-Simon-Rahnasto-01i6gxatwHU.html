computers and how indie games can
utilize them and the way I'm going to
structure the talk is first I'm going to
talk a little bit about our game which
is called amnesty which is a the one
point that we actually created the game
first without any intentions of having
anything to do with doing all computers
but afterwards we work together with
int'l to to bring support and this is an
ongoing thing so the game is released
but it doesn't hear how the latest patch
introduces support them and some other
cool features that i'll be going over so
the rent a friend of the talk will be a
sort of our experience and how it's been
to implement this why we believe that
more game developer should consider this
so first the first thing I will be
talking about is our game what is about
because it becomes relevant later on
when talking about like decisions and
cool features after that I also talked a
little bit about what so to your
computer they've been mentioned a few
times in talks already which is great
and I think most people have seen or how
vague idea what to even computers they
recent years it's becoming more and more
popular so yeah and then I'll talk a
little bit about what we've actually
done and how is in and why I think it's
a an important thing to to have this in
consideration so to begin what's
luminosity well it's an arcade game it's
a score that game so the main focus of
the game is trying to beat your own high
score and it's on steam so we also have
the global leader
where you can now compete against the
world or you can compete against your
friends which is even more um it's also
fairly simple to get into it's it's not
a complicated game it's a little bit
different which is why I wanna go over a
few things so i have this is not eating
game footage i'll just go over the very
basic mechanic and then i'll show the
trader and that should be about it so
you control a player ship it's a
spaceship because pasting but the game
has a little bit of a different twist
and most of these channel games in the
sense that the enemy draws you're not
actually trying to shoot them to destroy
them you're actually trying to do the
opposite because when you shoot laser
comes out from both ends and the
objective is to try to avoid all the
enemies so it's a bit of a puzzle game
in that sense and there's a bunch of
different enemies and they do bunch of
different things and behave differently
so you you try to basically divide the
map and when you section of places you
conquer a place and you get points and
the basic goal of the game is to conquer
a certain percentage that rises I can
get higher and higher so once you get
like sixty percent to a map you in that
level so with that in mind I just want
to show you our trailer for the game so
you can see it's an actual in-game
fridge see if that works I don't know if
you have sound
after its look cooler results
lay the arcade mode to be on the global
award
so yeah that song in-game footage just
so you sort of get an idea let's see if
i can get my powerpoint back
yeah there we go so yeah that's what the
game is and you know it's it's been out
for a while on Steam and yeah moving on
to water to a more computer they look
can perform just like normal laptops
they have you know you know standard
laptop performance they have usually
quite big screens around normal windows
always but the big you know
differentiating thing is that they have
touch screens and the reason it's called
to e1 is because you can usually convert
them to tablet either by light in this
example rotating the laptop to basically
fold over to serve as a laptop or in
some other cases where you can literally
just detach the screen and there's the
recent years there's been quite a lot of
new to your own computers releasing like
in zeeland 2014 around 70 m coming this
year is even more so they're getting
more and more usual and like personally
I don't think that like in a few years
we might not be talking about 31
computers because a laptop will just
have touch so it's becoming a lot more
standard to speak there's also
all-in-one computers which is sort of a
bigger version over to your computer
they're sort of the desktop version so
you know you have a bigger screen they
also have battery so you know you can
they're portable and the really cool
thing here in my opinion is that
especially under the same thing applies
to two in one computers but especially
on on the on the all-in-one computers is
that they are
are designed for both the users so for
example myself who loves board games
this is a pretty exciting thing because
how you'll be able to make you know
inches tall board games which you can
just lay out on the table and play face
to face and it was actually this image
that gave me an idea that i will talk
about it later and what we've actually
done with luminosity to sort of trying
to get this thing so yeah that's one of
the cool things in my opinion and if
it's it has a little bit it's almost
like the next step from like consoles
you know like if you play PC games
you're not playing over net then you're
not really face to face with consoles
you're sitting on the couch you know
it's more social you're next to your
friends you know but with this you can
literally be face to face like the board
game you know so it's it's even more
intimate in a way so why why is it
important to to care about to remark
appears well I think it's a great way to
differentiate your game to to sort of
anticipate how laptops are evolving
because not only do you compete with
gains in terms of sales like somebody
has to buy your game over thousands of
other games like for example here on on
steam which is a fairly you know
regulated market like you can't just
instantly release your game there they
still have like 300 games per month
releases and it's even worse on on apps
and app stores and such but the main
thing to consider also is that a lot of
gamers they have a lot of games so
you're not just competing with potential
customers you're also competing of
potential gameplay time we've noticed
huge difference in that when there's a
lot of people playing our game
especially on place like steam that has
some kind of social components it it
very much matches our sail curves so
when a lot of people play it helps drive
sales personally for example it happens
quite frequently which is one of the
most frequent ways that i actually get
games is that i'll just see one of my
friends playing a game I've never heard
and wondering why he's playing that then
check the game out so see if you if you
make your game for two in one computers
which is like I said I believe there are
getting more and more popular and I
think that you know if not fools tablet
features at least most laptops will have
a touch screen because why not you and
when if you have if you're game has two
in one support and you you know
someone's bought your game of steam the
second they feel like going and sitting
in their couch they'll bring the tablet
with them and leave the keyboard or fold
it and all of a sudden you're no longer
competing with hundreds or 500 and other
games for their attention you're now
also competing with almost no one which
means that like if they want to play a
game and your game has touched support
as well that's that's great thank you
saw on the trailer this is how
luminosity looks when you play normally
on on tablet mode the main important
thing is the middle screen there is just
like game area and when we added the
support for clutch
we also change the UI slightly so now we
get these touch buttons down here we
move the screen up a little bit with the
information and because that's
multi-touch you know you can swipe it
with your finger to move the player ship
and then you have buttons to rotate and
bottoms to shoot then also a useful term
there's an in-game shop here as well
that you can tap to buy certain power
ups and stuff so that was fairly like
convenient way of getting it to work
with the game so and this is at the
moment on fully functioning so you can
basically bring your tablet into your
couch or something and continue playing
luminosity seamlessly because the
computer detects the swap and changes it
without any need for going except in
certain pilot but we also wanted to
implement something that was like
special and unique for the touch so we
didn't just want to make it compatible
we also wanted to add something cool and
got the idea from the whole like board
game perspective and felt like how can
you make luminosity a board game and
this was like the first iteration of how
to do that which was basically copied
exact screen flip it over and two
players can play face to face and
compete on who beats to level first and
where does that get a point and so on
but the problem with just having this
approach which we notice posted well it
looks a bit messy and also another
concern is that because now you need to
fit more stuff in
the same size screen because the screen
doesn't get bigger the actual playing
field needs to get a little bit smaller
which was not optimal this is the sign
that we fall off now which is has
basically restricted out most of the
stuff on the sides and basically this
focuses on making it as clean as
possible without compromising on on in
game features this is what we're working
on currently that's why I long how many
fancy in game screens this is just the
at the end but we've gotten fairly for
on it and it's it's but it's not table
yet but yeah so this basically allows
you to to take the competitiveness of
the score attack game to the next level
basically because now you're not just
competing for points on the leaderboard
you're actually sitting next to face
with somebody and trying to beat them
and the thing too that I think is great
is that a lot of times when there comes
new technology there's a bit of a rough
start and all you have to figure out how
to do stuff them a lot of times it
doesn't work that well like you can
think of like the first 3d games just
something as simple as how to make
proper controllers controls work that
obvious back then but with two among
computers you have the advantage of
being able to take a peek at the tablets
and some degree also phones because they
already have touch screens and only
touch screens and have how to basically
come up with different ways of
moving and the input done and stuff like
I've done you know any game almost
exists on iPads or or Android phones and
such and you know there's a multiple
there's there's a lot of different input
systems you know it like virtual
joystick sand in there's even 3d games
where you know shooter games and stuff
and it's not just that you now make a
tablet game because you also have
deposit like you have fewer limits like
phones and tablets although they're
getting better and getting bigger
screens and stuff they still have
performance issues like compared to a
desktop computer or laptop and generally
speaking they also have smaller screens
so yeah you basically get all the good
stuff from from tablets and such but
without the bad part so this weekend so
yeah a little bit about like how
difficult it is to implement to more
support I as I mentioned before we
actually released luminosity without you
know without having any to not support
it wasn't on our agenda or it wasn't
planned or anything so we designed the
game without that in consideration so
that just shows that if you have like
this doesn't necessarily mean that you
have to wait for our next game you can
look at your game i think what what
could i do with touch could kill my game
wrong with touch should i make maybe a
special mode that that only touch would
allow for as for technical
I won't get too much into detail but I
can say that a few great things is that
a lot we use a framework called love is
LA based although it's it's built on C++
it because our framework has support for
phones and tablets it it made it a lot
easier for us to basically use that as a
starting point we already have a bunch
of code that we could work with and
really the only thing that wasn't there
at all was the the slate mold thing
where like you have to get your program
to understand that this is to be one
computer and that now it's a laptop now
to tablet and so on and is it I can't
speak for like too much for like other
like frameworks or such but if you are
able to to mess with the source coder
stuff like that then it shouldn't really
be that hard like the the slide changing
and stuff isn't all that that advanced
like the the main thing is is getting
multi-touch to work and most likely like
most of the modern most used frameworks
and such already have a partial or full
support for mobiles and tablets another
small thing that I think is worth
mentioning is if you do make a two-month
support for your game an interesting
thing that I figure out was that
sometimes you you want to use touch
because some people just find touch more
intuitive but you don't want to detach
it from the base so you won't use the
basis sort of a way to hold it in place
so a recommendation will be to also have
have the possibility of changing side
without actually doing it so if you
would touch the screen the the game
would then recognize that oh yeah he
wants to use touch and change
accordingly and then it's quite simple
just the second player touches a key or
uses the mouse you just swap it back
because all now he's wanting to use that
listed which we've done and it's
actually quite nice yeah that's about
what I have to say so thanks for
