meant for insulators people who actually
do that you know dirty work of getting
becomes out there and it's meant to
assist them during the installation and
also it's nice to assist and you know
owners you know whoever owns the the
place where becomes are installed so
after the installation they can add the
record and to the track of of you know
of the signal in case a you know there
will be ma like support queries or for
example at some point of you know in a
time in the future you know something
happens and you know you have to travel
to your up and you know you might have
like you know hundreds of retail
locations so you know you need something
to actually you know store that data and
you know being able to you know it's
like I said it is a tool is it is 24 I
basically I getting most of that NOP
comes in like mass deployments and it
may not be very exciting no it may not
sound very exciting but you know it is
