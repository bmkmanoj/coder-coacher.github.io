are you guys working on we are building
how's your French pastor crunches mobile
app on iphone game and it lets you
Tilton drop our ninja hamster through
our word labyrinth and the goal is to
get it away from the crash nadir we have
Zach and Fred that are brilliant
developers mean jess we have Michael
enter shop our designers our project
manager Philip boo boo and then we have
our audio guru or Sean and I help
see what's happening there so our
character is gonna be a little rolling
hamster guy show the hamster the major
is too okay perfect so this is the word
labyrinth that we're going to have the
ninja crawling around so the words are
going to be delicious looking buttons
that you want to lick right here's a
level clear screen we're gonna have an
implosion if you do end up crying this
cute hamster mr. little hamster guy when
he's not moving around and when he's
rolling depending on the tilt left to
right he's gonna curl up into a little
ball yeah so we'll have the tilting
functionality will have the words will
have so we'll still have the whole
typing concepts that we run it in our
original idea the idea is you want to
clear our word by typing in so you type
it slender and it blow up the block then
you have a path that helps get you a
path down towards the bottom of the
level you want to avoid get a hip a
little buzz saws atop their animate like
chew up their character yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
