world in our team that is based in KW
he's starting to travel to Europe and
meet developers so do you guys I've
already met and thank you for that and
we will draw it on last month for you
we're always around that side of the
world
so today basically we're going to speak
about a few things that matter the most
press developers we're going to go with
Vito market every some numbers not too
much to thank you probably better than I
do some of your options and developers
the ways you can monetize your
applications also we took three apps as
example different application and we try
to see how much revenue we can actually
make from each model of a
addiction first job before we start just
a small thing to keep you guys focused
and these presentations are scheduled a
few Android heads so the first few
people that will tell me how many of
them are there in the end of the
presentation we get a smooth something
from from us this is actually number one
next time so nothing much to tell you
about the numbers you all know that the
top five countries in Europe and
relieved actually more than seventy
percent less time Eric Schmidt said it
wasn't really even a million you baby !
the number of 48 billion downloads this
is something I heard sorry leftovers on
unless dressed you guys who is speaking
tonight okay good okay it's okay
so the numbers are Android this is we've
no knowing every challenge is encrypted
are on the way or every developer is new
on things first of them agreed how to
get discovered how would our app can
discover you this much huge market in so
many applications out there how my app
will stand out and will be downloaded by
the users is our first challenge second
challenge is the retention basically how
to give our users coming back and using
our vacations da you daily active users
is numbered language that we all speak
this is how we measure exactly how many
users are using our applications they
end their challenge which we focus on
today this monetization basically how we
can generate revenue from our deviation
so just to go over the few ways that we
have we have the paid apps modern we
have parents premium notifications and
iphone and those are the five top a a
revenue model actually monetization what
I'm sorry that you can actually create
ribbon hey that probably the toughest
cookie dough especially in the android
market where is considered to be
it is three ecosystem although apps
could work between 99 cents and two
hundred dollars and developers you
should remember that's thirty percent
out of you out of the retail price
movable to loop if you do decide to go
on a paid application make sure it's
desirable sometimes it could be from in
a niche market where actually it would
be a product that will be used for other
people make sure it's very polished then
people will be a deep in entropy using
it very often banner ads probably the
most common monetization model out their
banners appear inside the app they could
come in interstitial they could be when
you exit the application basically the
payment on this one is based on the DA
you that we talked about it's a success
of downloads and the number of sessions
that the user makes inside your
application when you go on this model
shop around between other end it works
there are many of them shop around it
with a diverse mix and match try to see
what will be the best eCPM for your
application is
you know it's an effective cost per meal
basically the affecting ribbon that you
make from a thousand impressions use for
this time let's continue with the third
pocket basically premium it's a free
application where it could be in vain to
be paid with an upgrade it could be day
with virtual currency users want to buy
coins inside education or pay in order
to move another world in the application
or you could say gambling communication
etc as I said it's well integrated with
Tina currency it should be an addictive
game or addictive application but the
user will be coming back the user in
order to to purchase something in the
application he must understand this in
it this is an app that he actually uses
often in what I said about the upgrade
you can make
version of the application make it out
rate adapt to airplane for the first
model we're going to talk about
education education truck click on
private area only annual developers who
actually know how hard work this area
usually the companies that provided they
say they have high CPM which is normal
the key to success on this one is
basically generated also a lot of
downloads if you decide to go on this
model try to make sure listen to your
users they try to see their feedback
about this one to see how the users
react to this type of organization we go
to the last one basically icon else it
could appear in many ways one of the
ways it is search icon point basic you
to search web page a access point on
this model basically developers who will
actually get paint from the network on a
paper download mode which means one
every time the user
download your application you will get
paid on your freedom depends of course
where the users are coming from but you
will get paid on every single icon to on
key to success it's very simple just try
it downloads to your application a
little bit of the search icon feelings
for someone it's considered you simple
SDK integration you just puppies publish
the integrated up to the market bugle
playing when the user we first open your
application with you get a euless google
a privacy as one of the companies that
provide this one also complete
developers to provide a union end-user
license agreement to second scan on it
will take the user a this is the free
application you are going to get a
search icon on your device headed to
your class the first example of
application at I too was a clock widget
I'm sure we all know what it just for
the example of course all the numbers
here that we do is something that we
checked in saw the results on the core
of course is only electronic compass so
I mean I resetting the present
don't count on exactly every now don't
you know don't vacuum the numbers um
just to make the to understand on this
one we took a 50,000 monthly downloads
to the clock widget on the beta I would
say don't go there there are many a
clock widgets out there three
alternative in the android market and be
very hard to monetize on this one let's
go to the banner ads basically if you
wanted a lack of a placement of an ad
natural ad placement for for using it if
you want to try the banner ads inside
the application you can try the settings
page second page as an option the
revenue potential to be calculated so we
have 50,000 monthly downloads the
average number of impressions per user
would be one this one's at this one the
CPM for that would be one dollar boxing
the number and the potential revenue
will be 50 Donald with a premium all you
can try to snoop to the dollar I know I
would
but I'm not sure it's going to work for
you premium one would probably a little
be a little top of this one may be
trying to make in a pretty bold version
of the clock widget with an upgrade that
would be actually worth paying the
notification is that would probably be a
better solution for all of those four so
part two little odd about the option as
i said before you try to keep your users
on this one revenue calculations and
witty again fifty thousand downloads a
month one push notification birthdays so
basically around four pushes a per-user
impression we calculated a 200,000 we
took a favorite of ninety percent which
is pretty high and the CPM also pretty
hard which is three dollars and we came
up with five hundred forty dollars of
course again it's an approximate number
again the clock widget no natural
placement so you better make some money
for
downloads the user downloads actually
your clock widget fifteen thousand
downloads thirty percent us users in the
calculation the payout for us users is
actually five dollars for it down so and
ten dollars for a thousand non-us we
came out with the number of 1175 dollars
which is not that bad that's with the
clock widget let's go to an action game
it could be a great example this would
be our second example all this one we
actually decided to take 150 a que
monthly downloads just for you to have a
variety of it um with a penny version it
could work I'm sure you guys have seen
create action games and also regular
games out there in the market in faith
and still being downloaded also try this
thing about your marketing budget if you
decide to advertise your application to
distribute one of the networks or in
Google or wherever and you decide to
marketing competition is tough though so
because most of the apps are free make
it an addictive application so the users
were coming back come back and use your
application with the paid app oh sorry
free app with banners inside the
vacation for revenue as we said 115,000
monthly downloads number of sessions in
time the user we spend
application is between two and four
minutes is the numbers that we see on
this one we took the request for
impressions per user the three break is
a little lower so it's seventy percent
and the CPM is also very lower from
before so it's two dollars on this one
you can actually make thirty three
hundred dollars and sixty so this is not
a bad solution is quite good for this
one um in the dreamy model we decided to
take also the same numbers we planning
interpreted in advance what does it mean
we can rely sleep the example of this
booming game day candy crush by Kim this
is something this is a good example for
a way of thinking of three new model
before you not your division or you
publish your education where are the
placements that the user will engage
with painful where we actually want to
pay the fact that it became addicted and
everyone is playing in the beds that's
something else but it's probably
thinking trying to plan in advance if
you decide to go in and remodel
um we took one cent per daily active
users thirty percent will be active like
10 sessions a month which is not too too
much to say we came up with four
thousand five hundred dollars which is
probably better than the banner ads
notification at its around the same
calculation that we did before but only
with 150,000 downloads we will see 1620
dollars just to go quickly because
everything is the same with the Primera
CPM number of push notifications etc the
icon and if you decide to go in the
clean application and you decide you
don't put the user to have any banners
inside application and you decide to go
in the King weeks no matters as I said
you can just turn from your downloads so
as we said it's simple calculation
153,000 downloads thirty percent will be
us as an average we see three thousand
three hundred dollars we finished with
action game we go to the third one we
took a music player okay which is a
different application long sessions they
actually on this one we do the same
amount of monthly downloads so you will
also have a you know a proportion for
what it could make if you make a paid
application then
there it takes a high end game and you
jam up in the application a lot of
features that will be actually good for
the users the user will see a great
value in it you could get really good
value in Amman money on this one a free
version that we see we saw paid apps and
we saw three ads or music players the
free version can actually generate 20
times the amount of a in stones the
banner ads on this one because it's long
sessions local repeating sessions for
the user 150 thousand dollars number
session we will leave it with three to
five minutes and a song okay every
number of impressions per user will be
30 let's say a song per day okay average
the fever will be seventy percent and
CPM too dark you can actually see up to
six thousand three hundred dollars you
should not be on a freemium model it's a
classic pretty model trying to make a
free version we have only some features
of Steve would be anything for the user
and making upgrade your application
notification ads are exactly the same in
the number this one and we actually took
the spirit a little bit lower because it
doesn't see the highest resource on this
one you can get up to a 1530 dollars and
last one we see the same and
the game before because or that matter
is actually the monthly downloads that
you see and the amount of users from the
US so you get to the same exact number
three thousand three hundred dollars oh
no not at all but i'll send you this
presentation just for you guys to see
but when you actually make your
application to think in advance try to
think what will be the perfect balance
between a clean you mix of the
application and then happen that will
have all of the monetization ways to
decide to go on that side of the of the
you know of the balance your users
profit on your user a and upper we
probably got a troglodyte if you decide
to go on in few weeks with no no way of
a monetization model you probably gonna
be great and missiles and a lot of you
but try to think about
just in the summary we talked about
Android the huge of booming market a
great opportunity for us android
developers we also talked about the
challenges that we have in retention and
organization of distribution try to know
in advance what is the way that you
would like to monetize your application
try to match it with your application
think monetization in advance think what
will be the best way to organize my hand
and for laughs shop around test mix the
models see what generates the maximum
amount of revenue for you use it a from
your users for your application and I'm
sure you will do this um just let us try
just a little bit about started where
New York for work and photo company
development in space in New York where
about 250 people we basically have
developers ponytails and distribute
their applications we introduced three
ways of doing it basically the search
based monetization the second one will
be a paper downloaded by con jobs and
the telephone would be exit ads with a
nice
revolution basically when the user will
exit the application only friend you
will get a good range banner and of
course it can exit just try it away
there are three hundred and thirty-five
thousand applications working with us
and we are about to beat the 1 million a
download of our SDK regular number and
shaking today we launched our new ad
type which art which is really a
deputation so go on our website and
check it out questions feel pretty good
on French ok
okay you can come and talk to me after
but also in my cards here you have any
question or something creepy to email me
or contact me over skype or the phone I
always always like to thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
