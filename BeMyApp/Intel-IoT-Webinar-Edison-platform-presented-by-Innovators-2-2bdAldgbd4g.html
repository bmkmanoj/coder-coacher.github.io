welcome to the Intel IOT webinar the
second one of the series of three
webinars so I am Beatrice from be my app
we are organizing this webinar with
Intel so let me introduce everyone who
is participating in this webinar so
first we have Yorick who Islam integrity
representative then we have dirt who is
will be there to ask audio to enter all
your technical questions on I OT and on
Edison and we also have salt on
Miranda's where's the founder of Cuba
logs so he will present you with this
salad so how does this webinar works you
can ask all your questions get chat and
we'll try to answer them the best
possible before giving the hand to true
Yorick so he can start this presentation
on IOT I would like to ask you to enter
a poll to know you better and maybe make
more personalized webinars for next snap
next I
so it should open on your screen
I give you a limited front
so I will close the phone now don't
forget that you can ask all the
questions you want on the chat and now i
will give your hand to figure it Thank
You batteries hey my name is Yorick um
yard gain I'm based in Belgium arm and I
I'm in charge actually in Europe and
amia more more broadly of our IOT
innovation activities with inventors
startup and makers today what we want to
cover in this webinar is essentially
talk about some of some of the
innovation out there so um I'll talk
very briefly about some background
around IOT and IOT innovation but that's
that probably just a couple of minutes
then we will end over this webinar to
Zoltan from Cuba dog and Q blog have
developed a very nice smart home device
bit based on some Intel technology and
he'll get us through the details of how
they develop that the market the ups and
downs as they went through this and then
obviously we'll what we'll wrap up and I
think Beatrice has a lost bull at the
end of this so this is the agenda for
for the webinar today um the IOT so the
Internet of Things I don't think anyone
debate that there is a huge opportunity
there the numbers that you see here 50
billion connected devices by 2020 is an
estimate from the analyst firm IDC this
is one of the numbers that runs out
there there's different numbers but it
doesn't really matter
whether it's 40 million or 60 billion
the the number is really big and and
also it's really going up exponentially
and that go through all sorts of IOT
verticals from health care smart city
smart own as we'll talk about this qubit
of Transportation citizen sweet touch it
is pretty much every sector of the
industry and of our lives the
interesting bit to me about this IOT
innovation and what what's happening out
there is that there's more and more of
this innovation that comes from what I
call this long tail of innovation and
this is essentially from makers to
entrepreneurs startups even students are
which have university programs that are
really tailored that bringing them to
the stock up Nevel and a lot of the
innovation comes from that now I hope
you didn't see that pop up which was
from my IT department um but anyway
sorry for that interrupt so this this
innovation really comes from from the
start up and the entrepreneur versus
more of the established companies um it
doesn't mean that the established
companies are not innovating they're
they're doing that a lot but there's a
couple of factors that make it easier
and easier for all those startups to go
and innovate and you can look at it from
a financial perspective with crowd
funding sources for instance from a
sales perspective with online stores
butt but also from a hardware and
software perspective with tools that are
made much easier and building blocks
that really make it easier for
entrepreneurs to go and build up any
sort of concept they have in mind well
so before i'm handing it over to Zoltan
to talk about the cubic solution I
didn't want to share a bit of insight
about a specific product that intel has
developed specifically for IOT
innovation and specifically for going
from production to
from a quick prototyping to production
this product here is called Intel Edison
some of you may have heard about that
one it's a very tiny compute module you
can almost think of it as a complete
computer running Linux um it actually
has dual core cpu based on atoms so this
is the sort of um processor that you
find in tablets to give you a sense of
the performance that you get but it also
has one gig of ram it has four gigs of
local storage it has all the
connectivity in terms of 40 gpio so you
can connect all the sensors with a
microcontroller that will listen to the
sensor data and only wake up the cpu
when when it's needed and it has the
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy so in
terms of connectivity you get a lot of
things that you need for the IOT
solutions and and all of that which
doesn't really come across on on this
slide but it it has about the size of an
SD cards it's not an SD card format per
se but it's it's about that size of
really very tiny form factor that you
can fit into a nice and sleek design at
the end of the day well I'll talk
quickly about this last slides from my
perspective which is talking about the
expansion board because I said the idea
of this is really to go as quickly as
possible fun prototyping well ideation
to quit prototyping to product izing and
in order to do this well obviously when
you go to the production level then you
have the Edison module that is ideal but
when you want to quickly prototype we
have a couple of expansion boards the
first one that people typically use for
the first prototype is an arduino
expansion boards and i'm probably always
simplifying this but think of it as
playing with blocks right when when you
play with the Arduino concept so it's
very easy to connect sensors loads on
some piece of software with some demos
and get something but not something done
very quickly and
I think Sultan will dive more into this
but as you go from this first prototype
to a more evolved prototype and then
eventually to a product final product
that you go to market Wiz you start
using much smaller expansion boards and
eventually some time building your own
PCB that is really feature optimized for
what you want to do so with that um that
was my short introduction I do want to
hand it over to Zoltan and he will get
us through the story about Cuban hog as
a start-up and also the product and how
they made use of some of the products
here hello my name is over an ashen
hello from Budapest Hungary and I'm
gonna quickly start my little
presentation which is before that I give
you a bit of a background on on on
myself and I'm an ex corporate senior
executive and before that a war
correspondent I was working for
companies like Artie a group receiving
the nines and bertelsmann big media
firms on marketing and communications
side after that as a senior executive
running board of Europe see cluster and
I kind of got fed up so I landed on
startup planet by by lifestyle design
changing from corporate to to a more
creative way of expressing your
innovation and creativity up import of
five startups five benches actually five
out of four out of the five was a high
with t and three are still in play which
is a good board so I also made some
success not like very big success not
like getting required by Google for
millions but some success at least and
and and why I OT he is the buzzword of
buzzwords these days of course
everything
if you open any blog that blog it's
going to be front-page if a new IOT
device is coming out and I'm talking
about consumer products not strictly try
to intro to our to my QB lock bitch
cubicle presentation is that what we see
and my my vision on on what's happening
in the IOT is that there is an i agree
with with your econ that there is a lot
of innovation and most of the innovation
is coming from startups so n n students
and young enterpreneurs really address a
problem and try to or try to remake
something for the future which we had
not connected before and by connecting
it actually serves us better and gives
us more time gives us more money to be
spent on and spent with the things we
love and the ones but not so basically
that's I think the romantic idea of
doing I already startups that's mine
actually and but what I see is that
corporate innovation these piggies are
kind of looking out for startups and
corporate innovation is dad I think but
there is a reason for that is pretty
it's pretty hard to innovate in a
corporate environment it's very uh you
know you have to keep all the policies
and compliance issues in a start-up in a
garage it's three people in a corporate
system is 300 people Kostas is pouring
they it cannot be covered so there is
not no real big innovation coming out
from from corporates of course there are
exceptions and also the record profits
are acquiring innovation which is a good
thing for startups of course or
partnering up in startups the market
itself is really clustered with a lot of
devices like there are very useful
devices very nicely done devices which
actually really serve as good like man I
would say Nast is a great example of
that great piece of hardware very sexy
piece of hardware and a
great back into it which actually serves
us saves us time and money portion it
really works and it's a great thing that
we can have that a big data layer in our
homes but there are devices like
Bluetooth Glenn sensors and all these
which are which will not be there and
even in two or three years and then
there are a lot of smart blogs and smart
bulbs and all these which surround us
now in our in our houses and homes and
we kind of love them we are still amazed
by the fact that we can control those
from our mobile phones from anywhere we
kind of show up with it and but sooner
or later there has to be an end of
pushing out devices and pushing out
communication protocols and not getting
on the same page with the others these
days the big companies and I'm talking
about companies like Google or Apple I
kind of pushing their own protocols on a
game territory in the market in the
space in the IOT space market space and
and of course there are companies like
smart bulb is a great example in terms
of IOT that that was Philips hue very
very pricey piece of hardware for for
smart lights and then she came with with
a $25 smart bulb and also with the G
link and the link and whatever pushing a
huge budget behind a huge marketing
budget behind it a kind of trolling
Phillips out from the US market and
today's news is that they have to recall
all g links which which are actually the
links for the small box the links at the
links for the wings and they had to they
have to recall these because there was
an update coming out which kind of
rendered the device is useless and
that's kind of resembles how I OT Morgan
is today consumer market I would say and
I know it's harsh but
these are like zero point six and zero
point seven and eight devices not 1.0
even these big companies are trolling
and of course making these products sexy
there with a lot of marketing money but
then when you open the app you look at
the app it kind of reminds you that it
was like five years ago when these apps
sexy this is not sexy for today and also
look at the functions no integration
with anything kind of feel after when
the first like amazement where's our you
feel that your left low there will be no
updates coming or when there is an
update maybe it renders your hardware
useless and you kind of feel that it why
it's $25 instead of a hundred and but it
that's what the big companies do but
meanwhile they generate a lot of users
of course with that marketing budget
that those users are kind of yes left
low one day you buy something for one
brand next day you buy something from
another brand and if you can wait and
pray for ifttt integration then but if
that doesn't come for a long long time
like remo lads didn't have i have to t
the integration for a long long time
then you cannot integrate it into your
home automation ecosystem so let me give
you a bitch about what we do with Kimi
log stupid log is a universal home
automation remote for smart and not
smart finish five years ago you probably
didn't have any smart devices in your
home today might have some and in a year
you are going to be surrounded with all
these smart objects smart and of course
with your old dumb devices everybody's
pushing a protocol everybody wants to
make you a slave warm brand and one at
four but and you can end up with all
these remote controls and apps on your
home screen and you can you're just
going to be in a smart chaos you cannot
use these this is not going to be a fish
for you this is not going to make your
life comfortable but don't worry we've
got to cover you'll be log one-half to
rule them all one dashboard to bind them
all and when I mean we can connect up
everything we can really connect up
everything there are like very dumb
devices your old devices beloved all
things around you like an old term
estate garage door opener or your garden
sprinkler we can connect them up with
our wired protocol with our wired module
and there are not so smart semi smart
devices like smart Bob smart plugs and
all these with a communication protocol
we can connect those up via
communication purple we cover all
communication sort of those existing and
of course there are the very smart
devices like the last family we
integrate those who is API to be log is
available in three versions basically
the modular version which is the shiny
metal thing with little cubes which are
which magnetically connect up we have
the kid the combo box which you can see
the wide load box branded with Cuba log
and of course we have a white label
solution there everything is up in the
cloud your dashboards your rules you
were your scheduler you can access them
from any connected device and also from
delegated apps or for your favorite
smartphone friends this is a multi-brand
mo war which we show at exhibitions it
shows the enormous internation
capabilities of of cuba log and you can
see all the smart bob brands or the
smart blogs and jordan sprinkler on the
like bottom left corner plan sensors and
also you're an old thermostat the garage
door opener old ventilation systems and
the end of course the nest family so it
shows that we can basically give you
teamwork instead of individual devices
and when we start remember when I say
teamwork that these devices will start
to work for you as a tea
and people bringing new experiences I
really need new experiences for you let
me show you a little teaser video we
made for Cuba log which kind of shows
you out can help you in your daily life
with one use case
why it's important because this is
really not the future this is now this
is happening now the teamwork of devices
is actually something which is there for
now and it's very important for the
future even more important for the
future but there are still like my home
as a lot of smart devices and every day
I'm facing the problem that these
devices don't want to work together and
they are made not to work together a bit
above the mark and we are on at the 1.9
brilliant US dollar market I don't know
how many zeros are behind 19 but it's a
lot and the connected home market by
2027 billion u.s. dollars and Cuba log
is addressing a relevant market is 200
million u.s. dollars which is also a
pretty big market and for us of course
competition there are a lot of a lot of
companies working in this space doing a
different kind of platforms and and
devices and also back ends and front
ends no one knows what we do of course
that's something you've heard from a
startup what we do is basically an
end-to-end solution so we give you the
hardware we give you the software and
everything if it's being up in the cloud
plus the big data analytics layer to and
it's totally customizable by the user or
by the corporate partner will use it at
the end and then a bit about the
business you are not a b c company we
are not doing consumer devices all that
is plan that at one point we're gonna do
a workshop for I prosumers as they call
them I think guys like hear yourselves
have to kind of play around with the
hardware as a as a b2c product and kind
of make new applications for it but what
we do is a b2b to see model to help
tacos and utilities and integrators and
also manufacturers to tap into new
revenue sources in the IOT space for
instance bubbled automation devices
the service selling extra data services
or putting smart metering solutions on
adrenaline and many more so you have to
imagine a toolkit for b2b partners on
the software side on the hardware side
modular toolkit which can turn from
which we can create a solution and
application for for apart nor really
easily and even we have a non-branded
user experience which can be integrated
by the the b2b partner and all that will
be coming in a box everything will be
migrated to their private cloud from our
club and they will have control
everything all the delegated apps and
everything included from A to Z so
that's what we do and that's our
business this is odd I'm line we started
out the company doesn't 13 and we queue
below was first introduced the first
very very basic prototype was introduced
at the Deutsche Telekom innovation
contest in Berlin into the end of 2013
which we actually won shared main prize
and we had our first pilot and and an
awful version of the hardware just a
year ago and since that we've been kind
of touring we were participating in
pioneers Vienna also a lot of
exhibitions cool dance a bit and we are
planning to launch the product in q3
this year and we are running pilot with
these players that's basically the first
logo is modular tellico Hungarian
telecom rafi which is a smart deco
provider or a smart office deco provider
and Deutsche Telekom also this is the
theme I'm in the middle and we have a we
have a i think a great team and a great
quarter team as well very very
enthusiastic Oh dirty they basically
live 24 7 in
the word of Cuba log and they are very
enthusiastic about the product we are
running a me running like a premarket
venture around VC round we have been
seeded up to 600,000 heroes by a VC a
local VC actually at the private
investors and also we are looking for
800,000 now in for RV CRM and you see
how we use the found this is your life
take control to that map to belong and I
wanna talk a bit about how we how we
develop the hardware and I think that's
going to be pretty interesting for you
and I share another presentation about
that it's a basically when you when you
go into hardware development it seems to
be that you know you're very brave and
of course you turn out to be very bold
because you know all the mistakes that
have been made you've seen roku box
burning on the market after big
kickstarter campaign and all these
stories but you are still brave enough
to enter hardware development even with
a complicated project like you belong
and but we were kind of brave enough and
then we realize kind of bold enough to
to enter into hardware development and
we kind of thought that we are not going
to make mistakes made before but we made
all that's how it is i guess for
hardware development software is I
wouldn't say easy but way easy its ways
it plan a software project it's way easy
to speed up elements of a software
project in Hardware you have to go from
iteration to iteration find the best
kind of best parts to be integrated for
our PCBs these are the best PCB be
careful about the size of your PCBs be
careful about the size of all of the
whole design of the hardware application
and also make a sexy hardware which is
kind of appealing to consumers even if
it's just common
box or it's a it's a flashy aluminum
Kotov device and we had the idea to make
it modular which and even if you look at
the combo box from inside it is modular
it has the PCBs like stack into their
slots like like those little metal thing
is stacked on each other like you can
see on a corner from his picture we
wanted to make it very easy for the user
so imagine that these little boxes
slices of a vacuum if you put that into
a bag just randomly and you shake the
bag they would get attached to each
other by this by magnets and they would
start to work so is that easy for user
we wanted to we wanted to make it effort
an effortless installation for the user
in terms of other hardware because no
one wants to mess around the hardware
you buy so that was a big challenge of
course we made a lot of compromise for
that design and because we needed to we
needed to compromise iteration by
iteration it turned out that it cannot
be smaller and we have to be we have to
be moved more careful about the magnets
because they can like interfere with
some of the communication protocols so
we have to use very very light magnets
but still they have to be strong and all
those little things which you don't
which usually we didn't think that we
didn't think that that was the big
challenge in it and of course we got the
point when we and that kind of shows
what the first modules we may receive a
blue to the wire dial the power at the
GSM and the Wi-Fi but what we were
facing that of course everything is up
in the cloud that's a beautiful thing we
communicate with the cloud via Wi-Fi or
or five GS MLT whatever you name it but
what happens if you lose connection to
the valve
what happens if if there is a big storm
and you know something happens to to the
antennas nearby that happens every time
there are severe storms even in Europe
now and so we needed a base module and
we needed a base module with the power
of battery modules so we need need to
integrate something into the battery
module which would serve as a base
module and do local computing and I was
a very very hard task we kind of we were
looking for a solution we were we were
kind of trying to uh trying to dig up
something but everything we were looking
at many computers I even traveled to
some startups to look at their stuff
like I've been in Tel Aviv and San
Francisco many computer manufacturers
will make like really really small
solutions for for computing but I took
back samples that we tried to integrate
them and it was not good and it was of
course for mass manufacturing it was not
it was just not applicable for me mass
manufacturing so then a kind of life
came to our help with Intel pushing out
int'l Addison and of course it kind of
kills all our problems it has bluetooth
and Wi-Fi minus 22 modules on on the
stack it has it can do local storage
local computing local rule execution and
everything which we need when you lose
the capability to connect up to your
cloud so we started to integrate into
that isn't it and I have to tell you I'm
and I didn't down that in Game sure who
I promise that I will that I'm not a
tech person I'm more on the business
side of startups and and but I can tell
you it was a really easy integration
like I talked a lot about this with our
CEO and that this was one of the
flawless integrations with their then we
had way bigger problems with
when like for instance the GSM there was
one of the modules we which was just not
working when we when we try to iterate
it and iterated on for months and months
it was not ready and rock group not
ready even with Deutsche Telekom on our
side helping us in the duration we
couldn't cover it for a long long time
int'l Edison's pretty easy and this was
the first version when first version of
PCB we did and we worked with it you see
the cute one prototype edison 001 it was
it couldn't fix into the packaging of
the metal shiny metal thingy first but
then next product I've actually fit into
the arm and it consider this was this
year when we when we did this and
actually we used all functionalities or
most of them functionalities evenly the
RF capability and of course there was a
and the USB charger you can see all that
I'm not going to read it and and this is
version 3 we are working on this one
it's it's basically I think it's going
to be close to the final mass
manufactured design how we want to use
this and it actually fits in perfectly
and works perfectly with with with Intel
at ism and it kind of internet isn't
straightened a very very very
complicated line and and when we were
getting chips from everywhere and I'm
like playing around with bees and
playing around with these mini computers
we always had the problem that even if
they have the capability of doing
computing the company was manufacturing
them is not a big company and they will
not be able to keep this on the market
to survive think about startups like
Spanish start of silesia infinite
hardware or something they make
chips for IOT but they they are startup
they will either be acquired by someone
or we'll go out we'll go out of business
and to be integrated into a mass product
and of course Enzo has a great tradition
of doing the best chips on this globe
and I'm sorry for if if anyone doesn't
degree them please say so but i do i've
worked with intel several project
actually had a start-up which which
partnered up with info and and I i think
in tell Addison is kind of like the good
tradition of Intel chips it just
addresses a problem and it came out and
now I just have to say it just it came
out of the blue sky like for a long long
time we we had the feeling that Intel is
not addressing the IOT spirits and in
one day it was announced the next day it
was out already could be ordered from
from amazon and and and it came out of
the really from the blue sky to help us
in that and we know that internet is
there will be a chip which will be there
and two years from now maybe in a
different version but it will be there
and also we know that angel is capable
of delivering at this chick for for
hundreds and millions of devices and
that's when you build something which is
actually a platform over platforms and
has a hardware part that's very
important to only use parts in on the
PCBs which are not from very innovative
startups which are phone companies which
actually have a solid background of mass
production and will be capable of
addressing your needs and even when we
got into the end that is a little and
how quickly we integrated it I think we
were one of the first solutions who
could actually demo a home automation
products with with angel Addison we are
really proud of that
that you know when we really like the
int'l Addison ship do so that's what I
wanted to tell you about and you can see
you can see a CEOs name here who is
actually if you have some very big
technical questions then he's going to
be your guide to answer those so what we
discussed with the organizers that if
you send those questions to the
organizers them will be forwarded to to
tom ash to Tom RCT when you will be
answering your deep technical questions
the bathroom all right I was it so I
think now back to I guess questions hey
Beatrice can you hand and over the
screen to myself yes of course thank you
hey thanks so much Sultan this was very
insightful and I like very much going
through the story right not only on the
technical side but also how you get
started as a start-up as an entrepreneur
when you get such an idea and and also
sort of challenges that you need to face
a poster from a business perspective
that was very insightful and very much
for that um I did want to close with
showing you just two links where you can
find more information one link is maker
intel com and this is where you'll find
most of the product related information
so where you can find edison how you get
started with edison you also have
project gallery so you can see what some
other other developers have done with
this and the second website is more
from a software perspective so what is
the software environment to go and
develop where can I get some sample
codes to do some quick prototyping so
this website is software that intel.com
/i UT and i think with these two
websites you have a lot of the things
you need to get started other than that
obviously feel free to contact us so
myself uric shotgun it's very simple
yarra got shotgun at intel com and with
that I will end it over back to Beatrice
who I think at closing all for this
webinar yes absolutely you think you
York um yes I have a last question for
you guys about the how what what you
thought about this webinar be deeply so
I'm alone from the schools now so you
can enter it in the screen cuz insulting
I think there are some questions for you
on the questions channel looking looking
at math looking at those right now you
will do you know how can I invest in
Cuba log well cook get my contacts web
address and you can bet your earth
you're actually running around now so
that's all I think that's a very very
actual right on time question and I'm
just going back to the top of it and I
see wanna yeah Sileo is asking a
question where do you see the end of
home automation suppose one morning I
decide to not drink coffee but it is
already brewing well I think the I think
there will be no end to home automation
I think here since the thing is that we
will have to take control so as as much
as
the last like five years about was about
the rise of the machines I think the net
this next five years will be about the
rise of the human so I think if we can
take control over our devices we can
choose if we want to drink coffee or tea
so nothing is nothing will be fully
automated it will depend on us as we get
educated on our devices as we know more
and more possibilities how we can use
these devices around us how we can use
them as a team we will use them better
and we will have we will have a lot of
time for other things rather than giving
with programming a timer when we leave
the home or or pushing buttons on on
coffee machines we can do better things
so I think as much much much as I you
know I know the concerns about home
automation and cloud and all that I
think at one point it will make us
happier if we get over the chaos but we
as users also have to learn a bit
because these are new things and some
people are not like some users of course
are not very cautious with their whole
automation devices and of course if they
can have they can start to have primacy
issues sharing too much and and I think
we have to be very careful about how
social media and all automation space
needs and what do we share we are with
other people because there are good
things like him even like your grandma
can share her like vital monitoring and
if she is if she is sick you can you can
actually get alerted if some something
goes off or wrong where and that's a
good thing but also you can share it
accidentally and you share control over
your locks your you're eating work or
your lights that can be you know a funny
thing for a hacker to play around with
you so I think we just have to be
cautious when we let into the house and
and but i think the IOT space and
especially
home automation space will be completely
different and way less chaotic in two
years I think a lot of brands a lot of
devices will just fail on the market a
lot of communication protocol or will
not be used and and and of course
smarter and smarter devices will come
with which will use the big data layer
and an analytics layer for you and put
that to use for you so I think that I I
hope that was that was the question
about that's what I'm that's what I
think about that and I'm looking at the
other where show cake okay thank you
very much Dalton um I think we're sort
of pasta yonder at the time that we we
had initially so Sultana I don't know if
there's a last question that you wanted
to take no I like well I think most of
these are not in the air yeah oq below
platform I hope answer this this one a
Philip and is asking is how open is the
tubular platform and we are planning to
open it up very soon after initial
market launch so we are planning to give
this to the users and to the end users
to and as as I told you before we are
planning to launch a website or a
prosumer product which is the shiny
metal Cuba log modular to blog to give
people or more advanced than in almost
emission an opportunity to play around
with it and actually develop
applications which can be sold these
alone or cloud platform and with all the
tab pre-made plat templates you will
have up there for different tasks so it
will be open at one point
