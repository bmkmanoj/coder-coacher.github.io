at genetic studios we have found wave
font and the Kickstarter a game game
campaign so this is why I'm here I will
talk about how to fund fund your game
game campaign on kickstarter and to be
honest there are so many kind of you
know projects that you can make you can
share and you can upload your ideas you
know it's not just a game but i will
talk about the games and so especially
sorry we are for people but there is a
video there is a visa problem there was
a Brit with a problem about our
teammates so they couldn't be here they
couldn't come here so i'm going to talk
about my alone and fur i'm going to talk
about the first project shortly because
the time it's not so you know to talk
about every kind of things every kind of
details about the Kickstarter projects
first I'm going to talk about who we are
we are four people and we got a lot
Iseman major and white software and
Android environment designer and I'm web
designer and also i write with scenarios
about our projects and also our
designers so i will do like two
designers then another one is again a
software manager the difference between
our games and the others is to be honest
everybody likes to playing games from
seven years to the seven seven years so
or free time will really like to play
the games but during this time we can
knows so many so i mean there's so much
times especially the two children can
lose so much time so because of this
because of this program we have we have
found a solution about internal
entertaining learning system with this
system you can get some kind of
informations about to space for example
vs there's a game called trottin i'm
going to talk and cannot talk about the
torch on that the game we found it in
the you know in a kickstarter enter the
entertaining learning system with
system the in atherton especially there
will be some kind of holograms like this
with this kind of holograms you will be
able to learn some kind of space for
information some kind of yeah like the
space planets every kind of things about
the space and with this for example on
the loading screen there is a there are
a lot a lot of informations and of
course with this entertaining learning
system we got some support source which
is basically on the turkey it means the
to talk it means that touch technology
key technology institute so this is so
good thing that we got sponsor and also
we got so many kind of sponsors after
we've found to have fun to kickstarter
project and there is a there are some
kind of games of all I will just talk
about shortly because the time is not
enough to fear the fear is the one the
number one game or its to be honest it's
not so good game but with this game we
got really got good opportunities
especially on the google web stuck on a
Google a droid then we were top 44 top
or dance or top 44 on the Google Android
and also there are some gameplays for
about it able to fear and we this is the
rise of the kingdom's olin to be honest
we were preparing for a game competition
and but do they didn't accept us because
we were student and we we have spot stop
to making this game unfortunately we
were using the unity 3d as well this is
again tlie i can't show the trailer
because you know the time is nothing up
and the chosen yeah it was in the summer
this summer where we prepared a cipher
game and for android android and iOS and
we have found successfully in the
Kickstarter cell today I'm going to talk
about what kind of steps are waiting for
you and what's kind of things you have
to follow during before the Kickstarter
drink each other and another Kickstarter
because there are so many things that
you have to do troughton show
is a scythe a game based on the story's
story over here team we decided who
decided to themself for the liberation
of humanity this is the gifts from the
gameplay uh-huh the pictures shortly
there is a trailer but I will show it
it's the time enough what is the
Kickstarter I think almost all of you
now the Kickstarter it's a website that
you can share your ideas and make your
ideas to reality you know why people
launched a Kickstarter campaign because
maybe some of the designers and artists
some of the filmmakers and doesn't don't
have enough budget to continue the
project because because of this this
problem they want to share their share
their projects to the Kickstarter and
also there are some kind of donation
websites like the Kickstarter making
their advertisement by their campaign on
kickstarter making their project better
with extra budget from the donations so
it is really good solution for make your
ideas to become real white people's we
put people don't want to launching a
Kickstarter campaign I was two weeks ago
I was in the zagreb in crochet and
revolting forgive me you know which and
I met with so many so many game
developers in the game the person there
were so many professional projects I
recommended to show and upload your
upload their project to the Kickstarter
page but they were all of them almost
all of us all of them were scared
because of the Kickstarter campaign so i
will talk about the what kind of things
what kind of reasons that they are
scared from losing more money because of
the world's thing is you know there are
there is a reward system in the
Kickstarter and with this kicks out
royalston you have to give some kind of
rewards to your donators and sometimes
you can nose so my
money with this world system so you have
to really decide your reward system is
really good for example when the donator
killer gives the fifty dollar fifty
dollars to you and you will give them so
you know the t-shirt or the inside the
game items like weapons or some kind of
things so you have to decide really good
robot rewards to give this kind of
things to your donators and also a
Kickstarter doesn't let bank accounts
for every every country just just a few
countries like USA France Germany
England so is another problem we also we
are from Turkey and also there's any the
Kickstarter doesn't let us to let the
Turkish bank accounts to you know to get
the money so we found it some someone in
the USA so we we got the money because
of we got a friend in the USA so this is
another another reason and there is a
chance to lose the campaign so most of
the people scary because of had the last
reason yeah there is an example there's
a Turkish Turkish company campaign who
lost the Kickstarter kicks Albert after
they lost lost the Kickstarter they they
joined the game competition the game
giant competition that we also jointed
this game comes in and we host this game
competition but they didn't loss and
they even they get this competition and
they won over twenty hundred dollar
twenty thousand dollars and they got
some sponsors like net verbal Microsoft
unity or individual game and where they
can some so many kind of the extra you
know the sponsors especially the local
sponsors so it doesn't mean that if you
lose the Kickstarter for a Kickstarter
campaign and you are really bad but they
didn't do it they really hard work hard
and they got they will they won this
competition and also they got so many
sponsors what you have to do before
drinking after Kickstarter campaign it
is one of the most important thing is
advertisement before during and after
kicks
after campaign you have to do
advertisement every time every time
because other times is one of the most
important thing with with the
advertisement we got so many good
opportunities because local sponsors or
some international sponsors speak out
and before campaign look closely at
other Kickstarter project especially
kick starter starter stuff pics with the
soft peaks stuff with ease from the
Kickstarter developers they choose the
campaign's the professional campaigns on
the main page they showed their
campaigns on the main page so is one of
the important things that if you follow
the professional stuff pics campaign you
know the campaign's project come to
campaigns it's going to be really good
for you and if and as well we have we
also follow to these topics and you know
suffix campaigns decide the budget you
will use after you reach your goal this
is another important reason for example
you decide to upload your game to the
key starters with three thousand dollars
and you have to decide that what will
you use your budget after the
Kickstarter if you have in the
Kickstarter and you have to also
explained to the donators that you will
you will use this money display budget
to do for example to buy the models or
bias up by some kind of tirana basics or
some kind of music anyway design your
report and stretch goals i'm gonna i'm
going to explain what is the kid stretch
goals on the next page try to contact
with some websites websites to make your
advertisements and especially local
websites it's one of the most important
thing for example you got during or
during our kickstarter campaign and the
jokes video maybe you know with the one
of the most important one of the most
popular website french website we got
alert Iseman they gave the place for us
on their website so it was one of the
best opportunity for us solar ties minh
is really important and make a plan
about your about what you are going to
do during
your Kickstarter is kickstarter campaign
because we have failed with some steps
you know especially the updates with we
didn't so many do app updates drink your
Kickstarter page kickstarter campaign be
sure about that you are completed really
so it's going to be definitely good if
you if you fall of this kind of steps
what is the what are the stretch goals
stretch causes extra extra budget and
extra ideas if you for example we got
this is our situation calls from the
kickstarter so it is there is a mistake
about here anyway we got we wanted to
three thousand seven hundred dollars
from the from the donators and we got
money and after that my new for example
is a five thousand dollars it means that
we will we are going to add professional
english english localization if we reach
also the five thousand dollars and also
there are some for example multiplier
system it means that extra ideas and
extra budget during the campaign keep
trying to get in contact with the web
sites with local channels and blogs
forums so it's going to be about it's
also about the advertisement make up
this age as much as you can do because
updates are one of the most important
thing during the during your campaign
everybody looks looks about your updates
and if you do so many updates it will be
definitely good for you because it means
that you are really working hard during
even during your kickstarter campaign so
it will be definitely good for you if
you make up this especially especially
the video updates will definitely good
for you add add names title on the top
of your top of your Kickstarter page
because some of the people can't you
can't see the updates page on your
Kickstarter p so it will be definitely
good if you add your main Kickstarter
page leaves about the news title so you
have to update your gay
and also you have to make updates right
of this on the title on the title of the
leaves on your main page main page make
up this with mostly y videos as I told
you before don't forget to share your
obvious also on your social media
websites accounts like Facebook Twitter
it is one of the most important thing
even you you don't have to so much so
followers or likes on your facebook or
twitter page do it because it's some of
the people want to look up your social
media that you are using it or you are
not and send the updates to your current
donators it is one of the another
important thing that everybody area of
the donators want to know how we have
your project going on is it going well
or is not going well after the campaign
if you reach your goal mention it to the
as much as you can do to the local
websites or international websites but
first you have to share it to your local
website because local websites the care
about your projects so website and make
everybody to wonder about your project
which has fun and successfully about
your project work hard to complete your
game until date you save blender
donators because this is another with
important thing that's because you are
really care about your projects and you
are working hard and anyway stand mills
about your news to your donators until
you finish your project is another
important thing to be honest we couldn't
do this email things because we get some
sponsors from the local companies and we
are telling more dealing with the
project so we want to make our projects
better so when it will be we couldn't do
it all the time unfortunately so our
donators are waiting waiting for or or
project but we can do it because
we got some sponsors and we got some
opportunities to make or game whether
for example vocalization press on the
mall to their system and we are going to
add this kind of steps for our project
so some or planters are waiting still
waiting for our project try to find
sponsors sponsors by your game which has
been funded successfully and sponsors if
you keep trying to find the sponsors you
will definitely find sponsors like us if
you don't reach your goal if you don't
even reach your goal don't think that
you are bad really bad no as I told you
know that the game come didn't game
campaign which I told you before they do
not do they do not do this that they did
not say that we are not good enough but
they work hard and they got the they
wonder that competition and they won't
really hide my money and the sponsors
and many opportunities remember the
projects which they want more after they
lost the Kickstarter campaign like the
void runner I told you work out for the
better steps this is another important
thing don't forget you are brave enough
to face with the campaign Kickstarter
campaign because so many the game
developers are fearing and scared from
from launch their game to the
Kickstarter try to present your project
in every place atsuko EDS game festivals
and it's one of its really important
because where we got you know we got the
sponsors from our universities from the
local local local companies because we
told we talked about projects everywhere
a place a group for example in the skull
in the you know every kind of place we
talked about or projects and we got two
sponsors so it isn't another important
because you got to Kickstarter page
Kickstarter campaign and it's really
important for everybody and mention
about your project to everybody as I
thought as I told you you can't know
where will you get the sponsors your
opportunities and suffers from
those kind of things are important for a
king campaign for example popular t28
first days is really important thing
because when you launch your game to the
keeps Kickstarter it will be with a high
rid of the page down down side of the
page so you if you want to be looked to
be shot for everybody you have to share
your projects to the your friends
firstly and make the click and every
click and you will get more position
more high position and of course if you
if we got some donators for on the first
first days it will be definitely good
good for you because every done it makes
your hike makes the late you to the high
positions brings you high position so
donated donations is important to me but
if you cut if you can't get the
donations just share your projects to
help friends and it will be good for you
adult Iseman since I told you before
advertisement it's so important before
during and after Kickstarter keep trying
to try to show your projects to
everybody with you know with the
campaign's with the newspapers TV
channels forums and international
websites of course our design is one of
the most important thing because
everybody wants to look I want to see
that how professional is your game it
means that if you do really good
graphics like the gifts like here gives
and you know this kind of our designs it
will be look your game will be looked
more professional so everybody wants to
share see this kind of professional
things and this is the world system if
you add some diversity system like this
in this design it will be definitely
good and because it means that you got
so many as rewards if you get if i give
the two hundred dollars so it looks more
professional and everybody wants to give
the data needs money and we get did some
kind of donations because of we got some
art art designs and music if you could
don't get don't save so much money to
music from the professional professional
webs professional campaigns like 20
steps from hell or earlier mission and
you can also download and buy some
musings from the you know maybe you know
it's with a jungle either a jungle sorry
and also there are some free license
musics that you can use your views for
your projects inside your game or your
trailer because music music is one of
the most important thing for your
children also inside of your game
teammates right some kind of things
about your teammates because everybody
wants to know who will they give the
menu for and so decide also the design
is so important to while you are talking
about your teammates a campaign video is
really important the company during your
campaign with you you have to take a
video if you if it's passable and take
your video HD because everybody wants to
see the HD videos during the campaign
video and talk about your report system
talk about all stretch goals talk about
what you will you spend your money for
ya differences differences are another
important thing with your differences
maybe you will get you know donations
because of your differences we got to we
got the money because of we had some
kind of difference in steps and you can
check out our Kickstarter page and you
can see cuz I'm kind of differences
because of this this kind of these
differences we got the money from the
donators why we launched lodge a launch
day Kickstarter campaign because we
didn't have enough money to continue or
projects and so we wanted to get some
money from the Kickstarter preach at the
beginning we were really scared from the
kickstart pitch because we also upload
our game to India Go Go mbuna which we
didn't win any money wait maybe we won
four forty thousand forty yeah forty
dollars is forty dollars from the
IndieGoGo but we heard we worked hard
and we upload our game
to the Kickstarter page and we got the
three thousand seven hundred dollars
maybe it's not so much more my name but
this was definitely good for us and with
this many we got so extra opportunities
after the Kickstarter like worry about
where professional professional laptop
and we did hire professional things you
know the projects and we got really good
sponsored sponsors because of this kind
of professional projects and what else
kicks out kick helped us after your
campaign as I told you before sponsors
sponsors are so important we got so many
kind of sponsors especially local
sponsors and we got the ncb channel for
example I gave the place for us on the
on their channel and it was really good
for for us because after debt debt news
everybody well everybody called us from
the you know from the local web local
campaigns from the government so it is
so important because we made so many so
many kind of advertisements so drink and
before and after or Kickstarter page
it's a Kickstarter campaign so it helps
for us so much so much on so much things
yeah sponsors are inverses also our
inverses will give this scholarship for
us because we got the Kickstarter
campaign we we have free phones off or
kicks other kickstarter campaign
successfully so because of this reason
they will give the scholarships for us
so it's really good opportunity for us
we got budget sports from the local
companies as i told you many websites
and TV channels also mentioned about us
about our project so it was really good
opportunity for us and leave our deals
with with me with this kind of budgets
can come to us so new ideas yeah in
front of this budget budget we were at
the beginning we were think that now the
the budget is not enough for to making
this this game but right now we think
about we think big because we got really
enough budget and we got really good
sponsors from the government from the
local waves were local
campaigns local companies so it's really
good for us and yeah as I told you
before suffered from a technology
technology institute called to attack is
really most popular company which about
the technologies so they will give also
informations about us about the space
about the planets and they will give
also they will make also a lot Iseman of
our projects so it's another good
another good opportunity which mistakes
we made we as I told you before we
didn't do so many updates drink or
during our project so it was a really
bad thing but because we were to be
honest we were really lazy to make
updates so we didn't do so much so many
updates enough and we didn't make so
much advertisement drink during the
Kickstarter page but for example jegs
video made nibs about us so it was
really good opportunity for us but we
didn't share or project zero or
Kickstarter campaign so much so it was
in other districts of all and we didn't
take a really good professional
promotional video and it was really
amateur video and it was really bad
another me another beta meets a mistake
and we didn't make it trailer good
enough it was an really emerged amateur
video a matter with rider but even with
this trailer we got 33 thousand and
seven hundred dollars from the
Kickstarter because we got some
differences we got some good our
designers and we got some advertisement
because of these kind of things we got
the we have fund successfully after the
Kickstarter who we made to quit during
and after the Kickstarter we miss we met
with Brock casa rosada Josh he's CEO of
monochrome maybe you know but did you
know that kinda dead game it was another
Kickstarter game and they want maybe
eight eighty thousand dollars from the
Kickstarter and we talked about him and
we met with him and during our
Kickstarter campaign and and the touch
is a product evangelist at the unity
during our Kickstarter camp
we made salsa with an detergent we he
made some elbow Titans for us it was
another good opportunity for us and with
with some unity programmers during the
Kickstarter campaign we met with some
unity programmers and Cena Oprah he is
cos Marco funny maybe you know its mark
on is a website shopping website is
really really good fun we've started
wearing the Kickstarter company because
of our advertisement we got we met with
Cena up front he also give some
donations for us Ibrahim each other
later of its own Istanbul Chamber of
Commerce is another Turkish company and
we are still talking talking about with
Ibrahim Jarrah and we got so so many
opportunities from a branch other yeah
and because of we got we have funded the
kickstarter campaign successfully and
talkin denise is we are still talking
with him a manager of a company and he
will he will meet results with this the
Sun they will the some developers in the
Silicon Valley so it is another good
thing and many zeros eight miletich
companies we got after the Kickstarter
the news we were on drink and after the
key campaign for example this is this is
jake's video maybe you know I think you
know it's because it's French website is
one of the most important and one of the
most popular website this is the Turkish
website and also these are the Turkish
websites and this is the TV channel this
is the newspaper the newspaper give the
place for us because of the Kickstarter
and this is another TV channel TVN a
news channel yeah that's all so I
thought I tried my best to talk about
every kind of steps every kind of things
you had to follow drink before and after
Kickstarter I hope that it will be
definitely good for you I wanted to give
some song so much details but you know
the time is not so enough to talk about
every kind of steps so I told my best
I tried my best I i hope that you
enjoyed and I hope that it will be doing
good for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
