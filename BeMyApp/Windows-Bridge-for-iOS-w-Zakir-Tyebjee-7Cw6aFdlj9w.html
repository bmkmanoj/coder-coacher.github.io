island with team the island team is also
known as the windows bridge for iOS and
what it is is a tool that enables
developers to reuse the their
objective-c code base from their iOS
apps to reuse that and build a universal
Windows application that can run on all
of the platforms phone tablet desktop in
the U and Xbox in theory so when we
started about in a last build conference
in 2015 which is an end of April last
year we announced this to the world
along with some of our other bridges
over to building a native windows app
and this solution we demonstrated with
candy crush candy crush saga was the
first application that we worked with to
bring over and we showcase them on stage
at both conference and since that time
we've run the team over the last year
and tripled the team size and we've also
changed the technology a bit so that
we're able to get these iOS apps really
running natively as a universal Windows
application and our our goals are really
just to to to allow objective-c to be a
first-class programming language on
Windows and we want to add that
functionality and we're not trying to
take anything away from you so with that
objective-c code without up just
acknowledge you can still call in to
windows 10 ap is using projections that
we have and you can take advantage of
many of your iOS api's so want to
promote all of your codes where you
reuse as much as possible and and and
again a universal Windows app as you
probably know is one code base for all
of the form factors so the the value
prop is hey you can have you can reuse a
lot of your code base and your knowledge
from the teams that you have
building your iOS application and bring
that to Windows to extend to all of the
platforms so we open source in August
last year and and we're available on
github and we push out every week with a
new release we have met we have a
samples repo that we continue to add to
we have blog posts that we push out that
try to engage the community and get them
sort of more interested in using this
technology and also contributing back so
we highly encourage the community to go
out and work with our SDK and actually
if they find bugs or if they find you a
api's if they want to help implement
they can contribute that back to us so
I'll dive into a little bit about from a
technical standpoint about the
architecture so there's three big areas
so if you start with the objective-c
compiled runtime and dark blue we have
we natively compile these objective-c
are the objective-c code on windows
which is why they're able to be a uwp
which is the universal Windows app so we
have a compiler that takes advantage of
the clang front end from iOS and the c2
back in from windows and we essentially
have a middle layer that allows that to
be compiled on Windows and uh so that
that's the the dark blue area the second
is the blue area in the top left corner
with the iOS frameworks and to Lee and
the iOS has about 20,000 ap is so it's a
very large set that we have to go and
essentially implement into our SDK on
windows so that you are able to reuse as
much of your code as possible so it's
all dependent on the number of api's
that we implement and the way we're
doing that so far is we have we have
this analysis tool that allows us to
instantly analyze a binary package iOS
application and we can see at a high
level all the frameworks all of the
api's and select
the app is using and then we've sort of
over time we've seen trends and that's
how we're prioritizing our work for our
internal engineering team so it's a
combination of the trends that we see
with these app analysis tool and the
partners that we work working with such
as yourself so we prioritize according
to that from a story boards and zip
standpoint we bring those over your
we're not touching the layout of your
application we're just changing we're
just allowing you to reuse all of that
you don't have to redesign the look and
feel of your application we we make a
lot of the controls either map tues ammo
or we make them look and feel like like
windows to redesign them and those
automatically should work for the most
part and finally in the top right corner
we have visual studio integration
tooling so the way that you initially
bring your app / is it's an essentially
just an sdk will win up CS sdk that you
download from github and in within that
within that file there so there's a
command-line tool and the command line
tool you run against your iOS project or
xcode project and it takes all of those
project files and then it creates a
visual studio solution out of it pretty
much instantly and then you have to open
that in visual studio recompile it and
run it now it's not a turnkey solution
it's not as easy as I just said it was
but basically what you'll end up doing
is once that a command line tool creates
your visual studio project you'll see
you'll you'll you'll have to take some
time to get your app to even compile
because there are going to be ap is that
we don't support yet and there are you
may take advantage of middleware
third-party libraries on an iOS that we
don't support you're on windows as well
so there always is going to be work
required it's never going to be a
turnkey solution but the work can range
from days to months depending on the
complexity of your application and what
we support already thats related to your
application and we would be able to see
that quite
through an app and the app and analysis
tool that I mentioned earlier and I
mentioned this the beginning but we also
have winner tapi projections which allow
you to take advantage of Cortana or live
tiles or any windows features using
Objective C so your knowledge of your
engineering team can still be an
objective seen you don't necessarily
have to go out and hire windows
developers as i mentioned we're on
github and you can access it via the
link right there we provide our roadmap
documentation as I said sample projects
and even partners that we work with
directly we still communicate with these
partners and have the primary source of
communication on github so if there are
particular sets of api's that you need
implemented or you need to help or you
want to help us implement we'll have you
submit those as pull request on github
just as anyone else in the community
would we would just prioritize those
higher and work with you by e-mail
separately but everything that we do we
try to do out in the open so that to
embrace the open-source nature of this
project so we encourage that and we
encourage you to check it out if you
haven't already and if you don't have if
you don't have Windows Windows 10 then
we have virtual machines that are
pre-built with windows 10 visual studio
and our SDK so you can instantly get
started without any issues there finally
this is just an example of one of the
big partners that we've worked with and
we just announced them at our the build
conference this year a couple months ago
and the app is called DJ pro company
name is algorithm they're based out of
Germany and they have the most popular
DJ app on the store on iOS right now the
effective won numerous Apple Design
Awards as well even recently a few weeks
ago and apple released theirs so they
are they have half a million lines of
code that they've they were able to
reuse for the most
through island wood and bring that over
to windows and they'll be working very
closely with us and they're planning to
launch to the store in the coming months
so that's that's all i have for mine and
just want to give you end with this
example to show you the sort of power of
applications that can come over</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
