Clara have in common simple they all
belong to the kirilus community of
travelers thanks to which you're never
really lost or alone on public transport
dick Frederick
he's a big fan of public transports he
wears this little badge when he travels
around he's an ambassador always
prepared to give information or lend a
hand other passengers can spot him on
their app see his profile and contact
him if necessary Marion who is disabled
know she can count on the community for
help the station's lift is out of order
thanks to geolocalization she identifies
all the members of the community around
her she decides to call an achelous
agent who is less than 300 meters away
he is available and soon comes to help
her Patrick loves his city his
speciality is reporting things which can
be improved or repaired an overflowing
trash bin in the Metro a bus shelter
with a broken pane of glass
he sends a photo to the keyless mobility
center and he knows that someone will be
there quickly to fix the issue traffic
information can be accessed from the
step-by-step app and all travelers can
share it via Facebook or the cureless
communities Twitter feed on the app you
can also access more lighthearted info
such as the story of a dog which was
seen this morning riding the Metro by
itself and casually getting off at a
stop it seemed very familiar with much
of the information is provided directly
by the travelers take Clara she recently
arrived in town and she studied the
public transport system so much for her
children that she now knows it inside
out it's simple for her to give mobility
tips for getting around with a baby this
precious information will be reused by
the app when other passengers with
babies search for routes
if it's easier and more pleasant to get
around town now it's partly because
Frederick Marion Patrick Clara keyless
agents and many others exchange
information daily about the network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
