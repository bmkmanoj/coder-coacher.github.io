another be my webinar series we'll be
starting in two minutes
once again we'll be starting in two
minutes
you
welcome ladies and gentlemen and welcome
to another bhima webinar series once
again my name is fernando and in this
webinar we have julio tara from
Kickstarter he's gonna be showing you
folks on how to create a successful
campaign and also best practices with
that I'm gonna give you to the man of
the hour so that I'll present you to
Julio so who do you have the mic all
right thanks a lot Fernando and hi
everybody it's a pleasure to be here
so I'm gonna just you know dive into my
slides and an s Fernando said what I
want to talk about today this really go
through a bunch of best practices
associated to running a Kickstarter
project you know what are the things
that you need to keep in mind think
about and plan for when you're you know
considering doing a campaign I'll also
talk a little bit about some of the
thought that you should you know some of
the thinking you should do before you
even you know start you know developing
a project page or or doing your outreach
and so on so let me just flip over to my
slides okay great so a little bit really
quick background about me I've been a
Kickstarter now for about three years
and my work here at Kickstarter is I my
title is a director of design and
technology and I work with creators from
these communities to help them bring to
life their their projects on our on our
platform and that work you know entails
doing a lot of workshops webinars
presentations at conferences but it also
entails actually sometimes working
one-on-one with a creator providing a
little bit of coaching hosting office
hours with creators and helping to
develop education materials the
experience that I bring to the table
beyond having you know helped hundreds
of creators I'm also an avid backer
right now I've backed over 1,200
projects and I've actually ran a small
project of my own
so I've you know I know about the
Kickstarter experience from both the
standpoint of a backer the creator and
of somebody who just you know speaks to
a lot of people who
I've run projects so just really quick
them and you know by the numbers you
know I think most of you here are
familiar with Kickstarter but you know
just earlier this year we you know
reached over 1,000 successfully funded
projects on on our platform I mean
that's a really amazing milestone for us
that means you know there's a 100,000
you know new creative things that have
been brought to life everything from you
know the oculus rift to you know movies
that have won Oscars you know - you know
comic books and and and you know apps
and video games to this you know over a
hundred thousand projects there's been
over 2.4 billion dollars that has been
pledged to the tech and design community
specifically there's been over 800
million dollars that's been pledged to
those communities and the great majority
of that money has gone to creators that
are making you know physical products
you know whether that physical product
is a piece of hardware like the oculus
that I just brought up or whether it is
something you know more more simple like
you know a chair or a piece of furniture
so today we've had backers from pretty
much every country on earth support a
Kickstarter project and that's really
you know something that's amazing to us
and and at the moment we are live in 18
countries for creators so that means
that you know even though backers can
support Kickstarter from any country on
earth we do at the moment you know have
some limitations on what countries
creators can lunch Kickstarter projects
from so we're live in pretty much all of
Western Europe I know that there's still
a few countries in Western Europe that
that where we're working on but then
we're also live in Canada the US
Australia and New Zealand
those are our you know the kind of the
geography that we cover at the moment
and you know what we've seen is is over
you know ten point nine million backers
have come to Kickstarter to support
other people creating things and over
thirty percent of these backers come to
Kickstarter you know more than once and
that's for us really important because
that's you're gonna hear me talk today
as we go
the best practices I'm gonna talk a lot
about community and when we think about
community we think about community in
many levels we think about the larger
Kickstarter community but then we also
you know especially for you as a creator
you know thinking about community at the
scale and at the level of your project
both when you're on Kickstarter but also
before you come to Kickstarter is really
important so the first thing that I that
I you know always talk to creators about
when they when they you know talk to me
and say hey I'm thinking a Kickstarter
project is really it's important to be
intentional about what you're trying to
get out of your Kickstarter project you
know a lot of people you know just kind
of work from the assumption that you
know the more money the better and they
don't really think about like what the
purpose is of the campaign in their
longer life cycle of what they're trying
to create you know we know that people
come to kiss or sometimes because
they're trying to launch a product
that's gonna be the first product and in
a larger business venture that they're
that they're trying to bring to life
other times we see creators that you
know are working on a passion project
especially you know when you look at the
maker community we see a lot of craters
that have been working on a small
project that they're very passionate
about and their main goal is just to get
that small do a small run of that you
know project and get it out into the
world so you know knowing what the
purpose of your project is it's really
important because that's going to help
you understand you know like are you
trying to just cover production and
fulfillment costs you know or are you
you know needing to raise money to also
fund some of the engineering and
development costs associated to your
project you know is the ultimate goal of
your campaign to build a community of
early adopters or is it to really launch
a product out on the market and validate
you know the market demand for what
you're doing so you know depending on
which you know like by knowing what the
role of your Kickstarter project is that
is going to make a huge difference when
you actually start trying to figure out
what's the right funding target to
support what the role that you've
identified if you need to of course
cover engineering and development costs
for your project as well as the
production fulfillment you're going to
need to raise a lot more money than if
you just need to cover the production
fulfillment cost of your project beyond
that if you're early enough that you
still haven't finished the veldt that
the engineering and development of your
product you also are probably less
certain about what will actually be the
cost of producing fulfill your your
product so you you will want to you know
allow for a little bit more padding in
that you know funding target that you're
setting if you're at a point of your
product that you're you know pretty much
ready to to produce and and and what
you're really trying to do is build a
community of early adopters again you
know your focus might be less on what's
the funding target and more on what's
that community size that you're trying
to build and kind of work back to a
funding target based on the number size
of that community of early adopters that
you're trying to build so these are just
a few different things for you to
consider you know before you even start
you know putting down a number that you
want to raise or starting to develop a
project page it's really thinking
strategically you know how your project
is going to help push forward your
bigger venture and and then using that
to help you you know figure out how you
know your funding goal will be set and a
bunch of the other things that will come
to you know as we move forward in this
presentation so the other thing to keep
in mind is that when you are doing a
hardware project when you're building a
physical thing the money that you raise
on Kickstarter or at least a good
portion of that money is really similar
to a loan that's gonna need to be paid
back and rewards and that's you know an
important distinction when you're
thinking you know especially if you're
doing a start-up and you're you know
looking at different sources of funding
you know don't think of Kickstarter
money as investment from a you know an
angel investor or VC it's really more
like a loan from your factory you know
that's something that that is really
tied to the things that you're creating
of course you know you can depending on
what your goals are on what your needs
are for the campaign you can work into
your funding target you know a little
bit of money to cover the development
costs and things of other nature and
even a little bit of margin but at the
end of the day it's really important to
keep in mind that the bulk of the money
you raise on Kickstarter is really money
that will have to be spent on materials
on manufacturing of those rewards that
you're going to provide you know back to
your community
so the other thing you know that's
really important to be intentional about
is the specific scale of production that
you're going for with your campaign so
you know when I think about like scale
you know most people often just think
about production levels and production
level is the first thing you should ask
for you know and really understand like
what level of production have you
planned for if you've only figured out
the cost and figured out how you would
produce your product at the scale of a
thousand to two thousand it's not always
you know if you end up having to produce
ten thousand of that product you can
actually put yourself in a really tough
situation because maybe all the partners
that you had secured are no longer
appropriate for this new scale of
manufacture maybe the processes that
you're planning to use are no longer
adequate so sometimes you know really
being intentional about the target and
actually setting goals not even those
goals with setting limits on the number
of items that you'll produce
can really make sure that you are going
to be able to ultimately deliver on the
production and fulfillment and deliver
you know on that on time and in a way
that you will keep your community happy
the other important thing to keep in
mind also about about your the size and
the scale that you're going for is also
thinking about what size of a community
can you manage because the fact is once
you have you know you know 1,000 backers
or ten thousand backers that you know
that community is actually going to be
looking to you to provide them support
so that when they get your product if
they have support requests you need to
always consider are you ready to you
know manage the support request from
10,000 people if you know the size of
your team right now can only you know
provide support to 1,000 people then
that's really the place where you want
to be you don't want to have a situation
where you have 10,000 people that you
know have even received your product but
then they're at a point where you can
provide in the support so any technical
difficulties that they're having and you
know is going and supported and is
making people you know just turned sour
and and you know all of a sudden you're
turning all this goodwill that
people might have had towards you and
your brand and the product you created
and you know you're creating you know
this this you know bad vibe around this
and and and really setting yourself up
you know you might have you know
maximize your short-term potential in
your short-term success you know at the
price of your long-term success and
that's something you really want to keep
in mind you know like what is a skill
that you can support and the last thing
to consider is we sometimes you know
more and more we see creators spending
money to acquire you know new backers
and it is really important to take into
consideration the cost of those
acquisitions because the last thing you
want we have seen a few examples where
creators you know started you know using
marketing digital marketing a lot of
things to build their communities but
then they did that to the point where
you know they reduce their margins and
then once they realized when they went
into production that the cost of Kretsch
were a little bit higher than they
expected they actually lost money in
production so and and the interesting
thing that happened is then you know if
you really go too far on acquisition and
you end up you know spending a lot of
money on acquisition you can actually
end up losing more money for every
additional you know backer that you
acquire so again it's just really
important to think strategically about
scale think about it from a production
perspective think about it from a
convenience perspective and from the
console acquisition perspective because
bigger is not always better bigger does
always mean riskier so you do want to
you know really think through the scale
that you're going for so now that we've
kind of talked about you know the
intentionality that's really important
that you bring to your your project
let's talk about let's say you've gone
through all that work you've really
thought strategically how Kickstarter
how a funding campaign fits into the
life cycle there of your product you
really pin down like the scale that you
want to go for and you're ready to start
thinking about you know bringing your
project to life and how do you tell your
story how do you engage a community in
this vision and this is what we'll dive
into next so the first thing to keep in
mind when you're telling Hardware story
so when you're bringing to life a
hardware product prototypes matter
they matter on multiple different scales
so first off prototype matters because
it is a way to bring to life your user
experience and you know specially when
you're talking about digital products
user experience matters you know when
you're talking about a chair you know
people know how to use a chair of course
the user exclusive minors in terms of
the level of comfort of that chair but
you know even level of comfort you can
look at most chairs and already you have
a good sense of whether or not they're
comfortable however when you're talking
about a digital product you know the
user experience is often hidden you know
inside of an app on a mobile device or
it's hidden through buttons that you
know are not necessarily super clear
just by looking at them what the
interaction is associated to using those
buttons so having a prototype where you
can show a compelling user experience is
really important you know I say that the
litmus test is if you don't have a
prototype that brings to life your user
experience in a compelling manner then
you're not ready to run a funding
campaign and and then there's the two
parts of that one of them is can you can
your prototype bring to life a
compelling user experience when you have
a user in the room you know can you get
somebody excited about your product who
actually gets to you know play with your
product that's the first test you want
to go through it and if you can that's
great then you're ready to them for the
next test and this is the test
associated to your funding campaign
specifically and this goes to the point
of can you actually bring to life in a
compelling way the user experience
through you know project videos through
videos and your project page and you
know there's no easy simple
straightforward way to do that and what
I always recommend to creators is you've
got a you have to play around a little
bit with that you know and and here you
know is an example of a project called
and like super em from a company called
new new to audio and what they did is to
bring to life the user experience of
their product they create multiple
different videos each of these different
videos talking about a different aspect
of that user experience
one of the videos was literally having
somebody you know interact with the
product by turning up the volume turning
down the volume
connecting the product to a Bluetooth
connected device submerging the product
in water since it was a waterproof
project and one of them was a sound
engineer actually listening to the
product and reacting to the quality of
the sound from that product so this was
you know a way that a Creator used not
just not one video but multiple
different videos to bring that user
experience to life but I can't stress
enough how important it is that you are
able to bring your user experience to
life in an authentic straightforward
manner through actually showing you know
people using a prototype in different
contexts so again just you know for you
who wants to do a little bit of research
on what products have done this well
I've just picked a few for each of these
little segments that will help you see
so the first one that I just brought up
is the super n by Newt audio another
product that did an amazing job at
showing it like a prototype and the user
experience and a really compelling way
is this project called fly which was a
drone project that you know where the
propellers are hidden inside of this of
this structure and you know the awesome
thing that this project did is beyond
having some really nice footage and
showcasing the the user experience is
they actually invited one of their
backers to their offices while their
project was live to play around with one
of their drones so it just became like
you know a really nice way for them to
you know celebrate their community by
actually also than having one of their
backers come to the their offices and
you know like record that backer at
their office and share that experience
with the rest of their community and
share you know they were confident
enough with their product deliver this
awesome experience that they were
willing to bring somebody in in this way
lastly you know this project called
blocks which is this modular SmartWatch
also did a really great job at you know
showing prototypes that really brought
to life the core essence of their
product in a really compelling way and
what was interesting about this project
is that when they launched the project
they didn't have a fully functional
final looks like prototype they had a
technical prototype that
pretty close to the final product and
then they had like a beautiful looks
like prototype and they were still able
to use both of those prototypes to
really kind of showcase you know the
user experience of wearing the watch
because it's a wearable so you could you
know actually see what that final watch
would look like on somebody's wrist but
then they also had a separate prototype
that actually showed the experience of
interacting with a watch which wasn't in
the final form factor but it was in a
close enough form factor that people
could understand what the user
experience was like to hot-swap one of
these modules but also they could
understand what the experience was like
to interact with the phone you know
using the touch screen alright so the
other reason why prototypes are so
important is that you know when you're
doing a funding campaign it's not all
about the product but it's also about
the creative process you know that's one
of the reasons why you have so many
early adopters and backers that engage
with projects in a deeper level through
funding campaigns and through you know
standard retail outlets or other ways
that people you know acquire products
it's because on funding campaigns you do
have the creator has this opportunity to
engage the backer not only in the
product but in this longer process and
creative endeavor and prototypes are an
amazing way to engage your most
passionate fans in this whole journey
that you've been going through you know
and and it opens up an opportunity for
you to essentially increase the size of
your team by having people in your
community because the fact of
collaborators in the larger project and
become you know like you actually what's
really amazing is is when creators do
this really well and they let their
community feel ownership for the product
and the project what we see sometimes is
that these backwards actually start
providing you know support to the crater
they will actually start answering
questions in the comment section of a
project because you know those questions
might have already been answered before
and so you know these backers become
real advocates but that can only happen
when you open up the gates
to what's going on you know behind the
curtains so you know and prototypes
become a core way to do that in a way
that excites people
that excites people in your community so
a few products that have done this
really well this is a product called
away lands camera which was you know
pretty much trying to create a GoPro a
version of a GoPro that was specifically
designed for auto mode automobile and to
help you know people who loved to share
you know their their their rides you
know do that you know in a new and
unique way with you know a much higher
resolution and quality optics than a
GoPro but also you know if this was also
product that was connected to actual
data coming from the car so you could
actually overlay data from the car with
your videos and they just did it you
know an amazing job at being really open
and showing kind of their whole
prototyping journey from like this
initial ugly standard black box type
camera to their final beautifully
designed form factor a moment case is
another project you know that really has
kind of sent the bar for you know
bringing people into the development
process and sharing you know prototypes
and the design process I mean I think
one of the awesome things about moment
is they did such a good job at this that
they actually got written up by some
design publications because of their
process you know I mean of course they
had a cool product but out like it was
awesome to see you know pieces out in
the press that were truly focused on
their prototyping process and all on the
openness of that process and the user
you know Center design you know approach
that they use so so again you know being
really to open with your design process
is not only a way that you could help
connect you with backers but you know
we've seen it actually help people get
traction with press as well and lastly
you know this is a neat ice kit from the
studio neat which is a duo a base in
Austin Texas here in the US and they you
know done six different projects and
they just do you know a really awesome
job
it's simply showing their prototype
process you know by taking one or two
pictures that kind of capture you know
the whole gamut of prototypes that they
develop as they were developing this
need ice kit
okay so that's you know enough about
prototypes so the other thing to
consider when you're doing a funding
campaign is and this is you know because
even led to a rule on kickstarter itself
is that realistic renderings are
misleading and there's a few reasons why
we believe that you know the fact is
when you actually show a realistic
rendering when your product is not like
finished and is not kind of packaged and
ready to ship it you know you end up you
know showing something that in the minds
of your backers looks so ready and and
and to ship that a lot of times backers
will think that you're further along
than you actually are beyond that you
know from every creator that I've talked
to
there's always design decisions that
happen during the engineering process
that will make your final product look
different than a beautiful rendering
that you developed earlier on and so
what we find is that you know realistic
rendering ends up creating these
expectations in the mind of your backers
then it's often unrealistic and that you
know is often leads to backers being
disappointed in the end which is why on
Kickstarter we no longer allow realistic
renderings you can use rendering still
but again renderings become more a way
to communicate your community you know
different aspects of your product maybe
it can communicate the complexity of all
the components that are in your product
like like you can see younext what a few
diagrams or it can just you know
communicate you know a different aspect
of how sound you know is emanates from
your product as in this kind of middle
rendering here and then we also see you
know a lot of times just creators using
renderings that are not realistic that
are stylized to show you know their
designs and to show you know some of the
CAD work and kind of the detail like
design work that has gone into bringing
something to life so so again using
renderings is something that can be a
great way to get people glimpse into
your creative process but it's not
something that we allow to be used as a
way to show people this vision for the
final product that you're creating what
we do recommend for creators to use
is you know create it looks like
prototype you know you can 3d print a
physical prototype and then you know
paint it or change the finishes on it so
that you can create something that looks
like your product will look in the end
but that's not a you know realistic
movie rendered image and again some
examples of projects that do a good job
and you know using renderings that are
not realistically rendered to tell their
story I mean this is a product called
gnar box which is just a really awesome
you know tool for photographers and then
you know for people who specially
designed for people who like to do you
know photography associated extreme
sports and and just being out in a while
but again they just kind of use this you
know stylized rendering in a exploded
view to show you know different parts of
their product and show a little bit more
about how their product works and this
project knew by a company called real
light they just you know wanted to show
like you know also I mean exploit a few
diagrams are something that we know
people love to show and it is something
that backers really like to see you know
that gives them a little bit of glimpse
of the complexity internally but then
they also you know just use some
wireframes just edit some wireframes to
their realistic rendering so that you
know they could show color options in a
way that you know their backers would
still know that the color options are
being shown in renderings and not these
were not color options of actual photos
of real products that had been already
manufactured all right so that's kind of
you know to like core things to keep in
mind as you're thinking about your
product as you're thinking about how you
bring that product to life in a
compelling way no let's we're gonna dive
in even deeper into the specific tools
that you have on Kickstarter to bring
your story to life so whereas before I
was kind of you know giving you more had
a higher level advice on you know
prototypes and renderings and how to use
them in your project page now let's
actually talk brass tacks so the first
thing you know the first thing to think
about when you're you know thinking
about telling your story on Kickstarter
is the project image
Kaido and short blurb for your project
and there's a reason why these three
things are so important and why it's
important like I always like to talk
about these on their own these three
elements are the most visible parts of
your project whenever when somebody is
searching through Kickstarter whether
they're searching on the mobile phone or
they're searching on the desktop you
know website they the first thing that
they will see if they're searching
through our site if they you know are
browsing through our site is a little
what we call the baseball part of your
project and that baseball card has you
know only a few key bits of information
and has a product title it has your main
product image and it has that shirt blur
so those are the three components of
your project that you know will be seen
by tons of people and if it's really
compelling it will get people to
actually click into your project and see
the rest of your story so you know if
these three you know core parts of your
project are not fine-tuned are not well
written and well done and then they're
all that work that you put into the rest
of your project will you know you'll not
will not see the will ultimately not see
the light of day so a few things to keep
in mind you want to keep it simple so
what that means is for an image for a
project image keep that image simple
don't add a bunch of you know don't make
it too complex they'll make it though
make like too many don't allow too many
things to be happening on that image
keep it focused remember that most
people where this image will have to
work the hardest is when it's viewed in
thumbnail format so make sure that it
looks good when it's viewed really small
like it's great if it looks great when
somebody's on your project page and they
can see it in full size but if it
doesn't look good in in thumbnail format
then people will probably never see it
on your project page on a void text on
your images like don't use you know any
badges don't put your project name or
your project title or your product or
like a shortened scripture of your
product in your image remember your
image will always show up next to the
title so you know you don't need to
repeat what you say on the title and
your project image
and and most times our image will also
show up in next with a short blurb so
just keep the image an image and keep it
simple and focus on let it do its job
and let the copy in the title and the
short blurb work separately but in
conjunction with the image so as far as
the you know product title and sharp
logos you know it's important to be used
clear and descriptive language you don't
want to use hype you know you don't want
to like like spend time saying this is
the best you know whatever in the world
this is the best connected lighter in
the world it's gonna revolutionize your
life you're essentially just wasting a
lot of very precious real estate where
you can actually communicate more
effectively about what your product is
all about and do it in a way that you
know our curation team will also embrace
because our curation team really does
not like clickbait the you know hyped up
titles and short blurb so that's gonna
you know limit your chances of being
featured on our platform and beyond that
you know you also want to like avoid
jargon you know or just hype words that
don't have a lot of meeting I mean one
more that I see a lot of people are
working up connected devices in the word
smart I mean what the smart mean the
smart mean that it's connected the smart
mean that it has you know that it's
programmable that it has you know
artificial intelligence like features so
you really want to you know think deeply
about the words that you're using and
make sure that those words really do say
something and they're not just these
hype words that don't any much a few
examples of products that have really
you know will then project images and
you know headlines and short worms the
first one is this project called Omata
won by a company Kalamata for this
really beautiful GPS pedometer next
floating record you know is a product
that I really love and that you know
they had always like a very beautiful
crisp images that should show the
product and they also you know had
simple you know descriptors for that
they could of course a world's first
vertical turntable but they didn't you
know they actually focus more on just
describing what the product does and you
know believing that become
of the image and the short like clear
description where the product would be
enough to get people enticed into the
idea um this is an example that breaks
the rules a little bit of what I said
you know even though we don't like in
gentlemen when people say world's best
or world's first like you know sometimes
we do allow creators to get away with it
you know and sometimes you know like
this product is a party that we did
static and we did feature and it's one
where you know as much as they did use
WorldFest when you look at the whole
rest of the Shore Club and copy they
still were really focused on being
primarily descriptive and really showing
clearly what the product does and
describing that clearly in those two
pieces of their project page so the next
up let's talk about the video the video
is a really really core part of your
project so when you think about you know
the product image title and Shore Club
is to get people into your project page
the video is the hook that will get
people to kind of hang out in your
project page guide deeper into your into
your product and hopefully you know
really get them primed to be to be
backers of your product and and so the
the core component of the video should
be the first two minutes and I always
say ideally you want to keep your video
around two minutes if you're going to
want to do a longer video make sure that
you get across the core piece of
information the first two minutes um so
I you know like the way to think about
it is in the first 20 seconds you want
to you know already show your product
and and you know start talking about you
the core value proposition like the core
thing that your product does that
differentiates it in the next 20 seconds
you want to get into the core user
experience you know so at first you're
saying like this is cool because it does
X and then you want to spend 20 seconds
talking about how it does X and then you
want to talk a little bit about the team
you know you want to introduce the team
or the development process that helped
you bring that product to life as I've
said earlier when we're talking about
prototypes you know it's important to
focus not just on the product though the
product is you know the kind of like the
hook the first thing but you also want
to invite people into the creative
process so that's why you know after you
talk about the value proposition you you
give people a glimpse into that core
user experience you
wanna introduce your team and you do
want to you know talk a little bit about
the the that journey and that journey
can focus on the prototyping process or
it can also focus on you know the
manufacturing processes that you're
going to use to actually bring the
manufactured goods to life and then you
know so that Kings up there you know
about 70 seconds and the remaining part
of the of that of this two minutes it
really you know where you should focus
that depends on your product I mean if
you have a product with a very complex
user experience then you should spend
more than twenty seconds on that user
experience if you have a product where a
part of the richness of the product is
the background story about the product
may be the inspiration story may be the
proto the hundreds of prototypes that
you've already developed then you know
spend a little bit more time than 30
seconds on who you are and the process
behind the product so you know I think I
think the important thing is again you
want to get across the value proposition
the user experience and something about
the team or process and one thing to
keep in mind is you know it really
doesn't matter if you let your community
know that their contribution matters you
shouldn't assume that just because you
are you know doing a funding campaign
that you know then people just know that
you want them to your that you're there
for their support so you don't have to
say saying that that that your community
support matters does make a difference
so make sure to always do that too um so
this is a few products that I love that
have awesome videos makey makey is an
amazing example because this is a
project that was done you know by just
guy jay silver and he did an amazing job
of creating a video using just the help
of his friends and you know like and
just like really planning some planning
out the video really well with minimal
cost and minimal overhead from a
production standpoint I think all J put
here was a lot of time and effort and
was able to kind of get his friends to
help out so then this is an example cuz
people always ask me do I have spent
tons of money on your product video and
you you know you don't have to I mean
you can and it can be helpful but I want
to show here a range of products that
kind of show different scales of video
production so this is one Super Bowl
than video but really kind of bare-bones
you know
budget and production setup then this
another project called wank by plum key
and plum geek is is a crater from
Portland that does he's amazing
you know electronics products to get
kids you know to learn about programming
and to learn about physical computing
and and he always has these these videos
that are you know simple videos he
obviously gets somebody to help them out
they're always very well shot you know
really you know like well-lit good
locations but they're also super
straightforward to so if this video I
suspect you know he probably spent a
little bit more more money to produce
these than and make even J from
makeymakey but also he you know it's
still like a pretty simple approach it's
still very much a straightforward
old-school Kickstarter video where
there's a lot of a creator talking to a
camera telling us the story actually
talking about what his product does and
then kind of cutting also to all these
demos actually showing the product in
action and showing kids interacting with
the product you know then you know the
the last example that I'll short here is
the instrument one from artists own and
this is a product video that was you
know really well produced I mean they
clearly you know this team spent a good
amount of money and effort producing
this video this is also a video that
breaks some of those best practices that
I thought I mentioned earlier but it
spends you know the first minute and a
half just showing people interacting
with the device and because it's such a
new and different music interface the
you know the Creator just knew that that
was you know really important the best
way to get that kind of newness around
like across the backers and to bring to
life of what that experience was like
was to actually just take a lot of
footage of people interacting with the
instrument one and that's what they did
so really you know worth checking out
this video but these three kind of
showed the range of different you know
craters using different levels of
production value to bring to life
products and all three projects were you
know highly successful so now that we
talked about the video you know as I
said earlier the video is the hook that
gets people into the project page so now
let's talk about the project page so it
takes
for the product page the the key things
that I want to leave you with is that it
takes a really amount of really good
amount of time to craft a compelling
project page most creators need 8 to 12
weeks to build a project page and you
know and that's because you're building
the project page at the same time that
you're working on your on your outline
for your outreach and for all the kind
of press outreach work that you're going
to do but what we recommend is that you
know start developing content and assets
for your project when you're developing
your product so document
you know the prototypes document the
work that you're doing along the way we
recommend you know for you to keep a
journal you know possibly depending on
what your community outreach effort is
you might even want to share some part
of that journal with with a part of your
community as you're developing the
product we'll talk more about that in a
few minutes when we talk about community
building but again I think the core
thing to keep in mind is that you know
the process of developing like a product
page involves you know developing an
outline tweaking that outline so that
and the outline is really something that
you use to make sure that you know
you're organizing your story structuring
it in a way that makes sense
and then once you've structured your
project page in a way that makes sense
you you you know your outline also helps
you to identify like is there any gaps
you know is there any kind of important
part of the story that that I'm missing
and so you develop an outline you tweet
that for a little bit share that with
you know people on your team maybe even
some people outside of your team you
know then you spend time developing the
first drafts of content for your project
page you know that would take a little
bit of time a week two weeks then you
want to share that also you know with
people on your team and people outside
of your team too because what happens
what we see happen a lot is creators use
a language to talk about the product and
their project sometimes a language that
might not be commonly used outside of
their own you know team of creators you
know outside of their own you know
company so it's really important that
you you know share what you're doing
externally even if it's at first just
family and friends but the idea here as
you can see is that each one of these
steps developing the outline developing
a first draft developing a second
so then developing your final draft you
know each of those take a week or two
each so you know when you hurry and try
to get all that done quickly what that
means is that you're just gonna have a
product page where your story won't be
that compelling you know you won't have
had time to really fine-tune you know
how you're you're explaining to people
how your product works and how you're
really bringing it to life and I think
what happens a lot we're working with a
lot of engineers and designers engineers
and designers are amazing at creating
the product they're amazing at like you
know something's triggering out how to
manufacture it but sometimes telling a
story and kind of you know bring that
product to life in a compelling way and
helping people see how that product fits
into their lives is the part where a lot
of engineers and designers stumble and
so you know the important the the one
thing to consider there is it's okay to
ask for help here you know and whether
that help is you know getting you know a
friend family or significant other to
help or whether that help us actually
get a professional copywriter to help
you you know you have to figure out
what's right for you but just you know
you don't wanna like underestimate the
effort required to really build like
craft a compelling project page so
here's a few products that did a really
good job I mean this is a project of a
team that you know originally they came
from Paris but now they're based in San
Francisco and they created a a phone
case that can print pictures and and
again this team spent a really long time
crafting you know their project page and
it showed that maybe were able to put
together a beautifully crafted project
page that brings to light their product
and a really compelling way this is a
you know a creator called Ana corn and
they've done two projects they're you
know designers of timepieces and you
know they did an amazing job I mean each
of their timepiece has a inspiration
story behind it you know like has an
inspiration story about what you know
inspire their design and and it really
adds a lot of value to the product their
inspiration story but then what they had
to do they spent a lot of time
prioritizing you know the content
they have you know so many different
parts of their story there's a part of
other design then you know mechanical
that like underpinnings of the watch and
this Grayson story so another great
product to look at for inspiration and
then there's sweetie blur you know these
guys are pros now they've done two
projects and both of their products they
do a beautiful job of telling their
story in a really compelling way so one
of like when you're thinking about
launching a project I think you know we
often use the word launch and you know a
creator the creator of that project
moment case always talks about like
thinking about this is building and not
launching and I think it's a really
important approach and perspective for
you to consider if you're building a
hardware project and this is what what
what it means you know the fact is like
you know some companies like for example
pebble that's just launched our product
on Kickstarter they take this approach
of launching a product so they keep
everything hidden until the day that
they're ready to tell the world but a
company like pebble has you know a lot
of resources such as you know they have
a PR team working with them they have
money to spend to really be able to
launch in a really powerful way to get
that message out to kind of hide that
message and then one day get it out in a
really big way the fact is most startups
when you don't have a lot of budget you
are you know you don't have the
possibility to do this kind of crazy big
launch on a big day so what we see works
most often is when creators start
actually sharing their work and building
a community early on you know and early
on means you know not just to to the
months before project you launch a
project ideally you know six months
before you launch your project you know
though two to three months can also work
and and when I say you know like build a
community and share what you're doing so
here you know I say like share and then
well your product as early as possible
like go to events go out of the world
and share what you're doing you know
collect emails and and you know get
people to follow you on Facebook and
Twitter
I'm all these things like you know the
level of sharing that's right for your
project doesn't always have to
be the same I mean I've worked with
creators where you know building a
community didn't mean that they told
everybody in the world what they were
doing it actually meant that they were
being very targeted but you know there
is like again using mark from from the
moment team again like when they
released our first product you know they
started engaging people who are
passionate about photography you know a
long time six months a year before they
launched our product they weren't
telling the whole world about their
product they were being very targeted
about which people who are passionate
about photography that they were sharing
their product with but they were making
sure that they were sharing their
product and sharing prototypes and
eliciting feedback early on so that they
were getting a like a group of people
who are passion about photography
including some influencers who were
passionate about their product and they
were building that you know for months
and months before they launched a
product so whether you know you go with
this full-out approach or go with a kind
of a more targeted approach going out in
the world and getting feedback and
building community before you launch is
crucial to your success you know like
when a creator comes to me and says I
want to launch a project two weeks from
now and hasn't done this work that is a
huge red flag even if they have an
amazing product you know it is their
huge red flag it's really it can be
really hard to get you know traction
quickly in this world where you have so
many products launching you know and so
many people doing cool stuff out there
it's not a sign of what you're doing is
not cool is it that you're competing
with all these other people that are
also doing really amazing stuff and
putting really amazing products out in
the world so just a few examples I mean
this product austech which was highly
successful that launched earlier this
year they actually did a tour where
their goal was to have a thousand people
try their prototype before they launched
and so they did a tour around the west
coast and they were able to get you know
over a thousand people to try their
product and a lot of these people were
super excited about what they tried and
they were able to you know convert a lot
of these people Quebecers you know again
this is momen which i just talked about
as well and kind of the whole philosophy
they have for launching products which
is not to launch but actually to build
community you know
to build to a campaign as opposed to you
know hold things in secret and then go
live and this is pretty you know I mean
print is another project where you know
they they actually had you know a
working prototype
you know I six eight months before they
launched a project and they were able to
like oh during those six to eight months
go out in the world and share with the
world what they were doing share with
the world you know even with with
TechCrunch they got written up on
TechCrunch about four months before they
launched their project and what they did
really smartly is that you know when
they were out of the world sharing about
what they were doing they made sure that
they had you know social channel they
had an email capture platform set up so
that they could actually as people heard
about their their product they could
keep in touch with those people and the
other thing to consider is when you when
you aren't doing this work of building
community and you're out of the world
and you're sharing stuff it's not just
about getting you excited and then
capturing their email it does also
become about keeping those people
engaged until you're ready to actually
make your your product available so you
know if you get people to sign up for an
email list make sure that you're sending
those back community emails every you
know once a month or once every two
weeks then giving them updates about how
you know the product is coming along I
mean this is part of this whole notion
of creating in public creating a product
in public is a core aspect of running a
Kickstarter project and products that
are successful Kickstarter often haven't
embraced this idea of creating in public
you know long before they've come to
Kickstarter and you know you know people
when I talk squares they're always
asking me how do I get that momentum on
the first day you know the heart rate is
that momentum on your first day is
usually a product of work done months
beforehand so there isn't the shortcut
to getting momentum on your first day so
you know if you are thinking about
running a product in the future start
you know building to that now and start
you know yeah start preparing for it now
so that you don't have this last-minute
thing and then you know just it's always
important to keep in mind there is no
right way so you know like you're gonna
there's many craters that I've written
out there about like this is the way to
do that
starter project that's the way to run a
funding campaign there's no right way
you know there's a lot of different ways
that creators have used them that have
worked for them and you know it's great
to read about all those successes so
that you can you know inform your own
strategies based on what of what has
worked for other people but I always
caution you if a creator you know you
know it's telling you that their way is
right don't don't you know take that at
face value I think you know their their
advice is very valuable because their
way does clearly work for them but it's
not there is no right way and with that
said I'm gonna now you know go back and
and we can open it up for any Q&amp;amp;A
all right it's very questions many money
in their annoyance
well
um no I I can't but I'm that can I hear
you I can see are your group chat though
okay so the the first question we
received is how many people need to be
on a team that's a really good question
and you know as you can imagine there
isn't a right answer of like this is the
number of people that need to be on a
team
what we do see of course is the number
of people on your team will have an
impact on how fast you can put together
a Kickstarter project but you know I
know that if you read out there in the
world I mean I know that you know the
ball the team from both out in Boston
I mean they've written a lot of things
about hardware startups and I think that
I don't know that they say it's like
eight people should be on a ideal
hardware startup team and I think it's
you know part of what will depend on the
number of people that you on your team
is also the ambition that you have I
mean if you are really trying to launch
you know start a company and and this is
just kind of the first product of that
company you know chances are doing it by
yourself is too little you know you
because at the very least you know when
their campaign is running like if things
are doing well running the campaign
itself is pretty much a full-time job
and I think they're not doing well then
you're trying to kind of build momentum
so even if you're not doing well then
running the campaign is still kind of
like a full-time job so that leaves the
job of continuing to develop the product
continuing to do any engineering or to
prepare for manufacturing something that
has to completely standstill if you
don't have more than then a person on
the team so I mean what we've seen is
that the very least you know the
smallest team that we see that have done
successful hardware projects are you
know usually you know three to five
people like there is of course anomalies
that I'm just like I know that there's
been projects of just one person doing a
hardware project or even or two people
but in general the smalls we see is
three to five you know and and we see
that get pretty much higher than that I
mean like you know it's sometimes you
see private teams of 15-20 people I
think what happens there what what I
think is importantly to consider is that
you do need to have somebody who does
that work
of everything from those tasks that
we've talked about developing the
project page writing that copy when the
product was live you know engaging with
your community and and so if you have a
small team a solution can always be if
you do have a little bit of money to
actually work with consultants so you
know because again like for example just
doing PR PR takes a lot of work if you
have to do it on your own because you're
probably having to learn how to do it
you're having to do all this research to
identify what are the key journalist in
your that cover the type of product that
you're making but if you work with a PR
firm you know they might be able to help
with a lot of that because they already
have experience they know that the
ecosystem they have contacts in various
publications so you know I always tell
creators you know glass me like should I
do PR myself it's like if you have
somebody to that's able to devote a lot
of time to doing PR yourself then you
should have to do it if you don't you
know then then it becomes a question you
know how important is PR to your success
so so I think you know when you're
thinking about the size of your team
like what you need what you need to
think about is you know what is the size
of your team right now like what is the
time frame that you want to launch your
product and on Kickstarter because you
know what will often happen what I see
is like when I talk to a team of like
three people if they don't have a budget
to get any external support then a lot
of that becomes you know a time frame
consideration it's like okay well if you
really have three people that's all you
have and that I'm gonna have to do
everything you know run the company as
well as run the project then chances are
you might rather than need eight weeks
to get your product to get to get your
project page together you might need to
plan to have you know four to six months
you know like sorry rather than then
meeting two months to get your project
together you might need four to six
months so that because you're you know
kind of taking those things on little by
little so yeah so that's and again of
course the complexity of your product
you know also plays a really big part in
that
you know I mean we work with teams that
are doing super you know complex
products that require a lot of complex
engineering and in that case you know
you probably would need a bigger team -
okay so how do you know when a product
is ready to post on Kickstarter I mean
that's a that's another you know very
common question I think a couple of
things to think about in an ideal world
you know again I think the litmus test
the basic litmus test that I brought up
earlier is that you must have a
compelling prototype of you must have a
compelling prototype of your product
that can bring to life the user
experience of your product in order to
launch a Kickstarter campaign I mean
that that is a requirement from the
perspective of if you don't have that
you you won't be able to succeed and
also our rules require that you have a
prototype
however like that's I think the base
minimum in a from an ideal standpoint
where you want to be is you want to be
at a place where you've done enough of
the design for manufacturing work that
you have a really clear sense of the the
cost of your of your of your bomb you
know your bill of materials though you
have a really clear sense of the
processes you can each manufacturing
that you're already have some partners
lined up and that you you know we're
ready started working on pricing with
them because what you want to do is you
want to set yourself up for success and
from the standpoint that you need to be
able to price your product really
accurately because the last thing you
want to do is you know price your
product wrong and then later not be able
to deliver or you know underestimate the
amount of work associated to bring a
product in life so that you're
delivering your product a year late and
then you're delivering your product or
community that's very you know
unsatisfied so you know as much as our
rules would let you launch a product
earlier when we talked to Craig is what
we recommend is you know doing more of
that be diligence you know don't like be
in too much of a hurry
to launch like it's better to launch
once again you have you know
partnerships lined up with factories you
have you know a really clear
understanding of processes and the Bill
of Materials associated with your
product so that you can also understand
the risks you know associated to the
manufacturing processes that you're
going to use and you can be really
confident that the goal that you're
setting for your campaign both like the
price for each individual reward but
also the overall goal for the campaign
you want to be really certain that
you're setting the right goal and that
your goal is going to get you to where
you need so then the next question that
I got here is how do products typically
get featured with products we love tags
on Kickstarter um so you know to become
a promise we love product on Kickstarter
there's a few different things that that
are that you should keep in mind um are
cute we have a curation scene my
Kickstarter that's responsible for
selecting products to be featured as a
product we love and they look at
everything from you know the product
itself like is this is the thing that's
being created something interesting you
know if you're doing a USB cable you
have a very high likelihood that you
will not be future you know like
products that are very derivative very
small design chains on an existing
product but not to say that those
products are not good they're not worthy
but you know our our team is trying to
feature things that are innovative you
know things that are new and that are
newsworthy and so as much as you might
have created a really beautifully done
new version of a USB cable chances are
you know you're gonna have a very hard
uphill battle to get that feature the
other thing beyond the product itself is
you know how do you engage your backer
community as I mentioned earlier you
know a funding campaign is not just
about the product it's also about the
churn you know for us you know
Kickstarter is a platform that's all
about you know celebrating creativity
and celebrating the whole creative
process so for us you know we do like
projects that celebrate that process and
that are open you know with that process
so so that's
other things to consider you know as
well is like if you can embrace that
openness I mean if you can bring your
your community into your process you're
gonna have a much better chance of being
featured other things that matter you
know the the way that your project is
structured and how clear it is is really
important you know as I was talking
about earlier having a clear title
having a clear sharp herb you know
structuring your project page in a way
that's really clear I mean that really
matters like you know what our curation
team is not going to feature any project
that is not like clearly presented and
then the last thing to consider is you
know aesthetics new matter I mean we're
not looking for a project that it that
like look super over design but we are
looking for parties that it looks like a
creator spent some time and care to
actually develop a project page that
looks nice you know and that then that
can mean even just things like you know
that you're using photos that were taken
like like we care and that you know if
you're using a bunch of diagrams and
graphics that you're using you know
fonts consistently across all those
graphics so presentation doesn't matter
so again like the product that you're
doing matters you know embracing this
kind of trends like like oh I'm not
collaborative or just open creative
process matters and then you know having
a clear story and having that story be
clearly presented you know all of these
things are things that that matter its
turn and the next question we have is
growth hacking is growth hacking good
for for PR I mean in general you know
like I think you know growth hacking you
know that's a term that's using a lot of
different ways when you're talking about
growth hacking as a shortcut like you
know in all honesty you know we we're
not big kind of shortcut like we find
that you know in general when creators
try to shortcut things like trying to
shortcut a community building process
like yeah I've seen campaigns do it and
work but in general we don't see that it
works you know and like like of course
you can point to some examples of like a
campaign here there where a both hacking
tactic might have worked and I'm not I
like
I think blow tacky hacking tactics can
work as part of like a best part of like
a smart strategy around getting the word
out of the building community for your
project but but I think you know like
the idea that like oh I'm gonna do
growth hacking stuff and then two weeks
I'm going to be able to make up you know
like for all the the lack of community
work that I've done for the past six
months
you know that like is the big risk that
you're taking you know and and and of
course if you're finding yourself in a
situation where you just you know don't
have much time to get the word out
you know yeah you want to try creative
ways to to get the word out you want to
try the creative ways to get PR
attention and trying to get you know
people in your larger community or in
the larger community the larger audience
and people who might be interested in
what you're doing to find out about your
product so so yeah I think that's
definitely you know you want to be smart
and kind of creative about it but I
think our concern is sometimes this
notion that like oh I don't need to do
that and I'll just do pro tacking and
it's gonna be fine like that's where you
know we see like like that being not a
smart strategy for your project who do
can hear me yeah I can't
there you go thanks a lot for moderating
the questions when I quickly at last
announced the last question we have is
you mentioned back in your slides about
clickbait titles or hype titles do you
have data on whether or not people click
through more or fund more when they see
these types of titles we don't have data
that says that they click through and
fun more and I suspect that like I mean
on Kickstarter if you you can easily
look at the most funded projects and
what you'll see is that they don't have
that but again it's the thing to discern
there it's it's hard I mean in order to
really get at whether click maybe titles
work is would we we'd have to do a/b
tests to really get at that because you
know when you look at different projects
it's really hard to know like is it
working better because of the title is
it working better because the product
itself there's so many variables that
even the data that we have even if we
try to
the process that the United wouldn't get
to the answer of this question and you
know like on Kickstarter having click
baby or high title will definitely work
again to from a purely future
perspective and you know what I would
suspect you know and this is totally my
own my own gut feeling not based on on
data is that you know click baby titles
you know might even and some points get
people to click on your project page
more but I would suspect that once they
get onto your project page
the conversion would go lower because
it's different when you're when you're
just like an organization trying to get
something to click into your into your
you know tarita like a blog post and and
so you get the revenue from ads like
having a quick baby title does the work
enough for you that you get people onto
that page and you get them to look at
that ad but when you're trying to like
on Kickstarter where what you really
want is not just to get them to get your
page but you want them to convert to a
backer you know I think that click baby
title I would suspect you might get more
people on your page depending right
where that title being shown but I don't
think it will help you you know with
with the more important action which is
to get people to actually back your
project so so yeah so the answer there
is no data but just my gut feeling all
right and I believe we have one last
question which channels are best for PR
oh that's mean you know if the PR
channels it really really matters what
you're working on so let's say I assume
over here are working on hardware type
product like there isn't any kind of
secret channel that's especially good I
mean a lot of the standard news outlets
that write a lot about Kickstarter
products can be really powerful I mean
so in that world you're talking about
the techCrunch's of the world
Gizmodo you know the birds you know all
of those kind of you know tick tech and
gadget focus blogs I mean you also get
to a lesser extent you get like
like blogs like box like also like wired
you know like Fast Company those are
also ones that can can be can resonate I
mean and the interesting thing that when
you when you look at you know PR stuff
as well is like if you are doing for
example a piece of hardware focus around
photography you know then a lot of times
you know what will convert best for a
project is actually going to more niche
publications that really focus on you
know that community you know that really
create content targeted around tools for
photographers you know or targeted
around creative tools for that community
and that's why you know like outside of
like the standard kind of like vanilla
like tech press and tech blogs I would
suggest that whatever you know you're
working on if there's a sub community
like think about like what's the niche
that's kind of into it so if you're
doing something that's really like
electronics focus you know you might
have like engineering belongs you know
or or maker community focus blogs that
you want to go after and there is no I
mean they're really the best thing to do
is to you know spend some time and and
and and like do the research to find out
what those are I mean one little growth
hacking strategy that we've seen work is
sometimes you know people will use like
Mechanical Turk or one of these other
services to help them do some of that
research you know to help identify you
know bloggers within a specific niche
and they even help find contact
information for those bloggers or that
media those media outlets because that
research can take so much work that that
has been something that a few creators
have have have used to great success all
right perfect
well once again thank you who dear for

hope you enjoyed presenting I know I
definitely learned a lot more about just
