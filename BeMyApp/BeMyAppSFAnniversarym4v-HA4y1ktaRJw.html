special event and one that's very dear
to me it was one of the first hackathons
I've ever been to and it had this this
energy a lot of people with ideas a lot
of people that really could build stuff
and it was it was an exciting
intersection of of ideas and the end
skills to build them and I pitched an
idea the first one I went to a bit
intimidating getting up there in front
of everyone yeah and and it just went so
smoothly and I had such a good time
doing I think if you're if you're
pitching an idea that you're passionate
about and then you believe in and you've
talked about with other people it comes
really smoothly and it's a really open
welcoming audience I went because I
enjoy hackathons and I saw it somewhere
online then and I'd been to a bunch of
other Packer ponds recently and and I
was working in the mobile space hit just
that afternoon left left my job as a
developer at a Palo Alto startup and and
so it was a it was a great opportunity
for me to build stuff which I really
enjoy and and is what hackathons are all
about as well as to meet some other
people in in the space and do some
networking and form some some real tight
bonds with people and I kept coming back
because I've met a lot of really great
friends and I really enjoy the the the
intenseness and the competition of the
VIP experience
the first thing is you meet great people
and you meet other like-minded people i
think i think it attracts people with
who just love building things who love
creating something out of nothing that's
seeing it take shape and regardless of
what your skill set in in what you're
making it well it's tricky I mean it's
if you're standing up in front of bunch
of people if you haven't been done a lot
of public speaking I think it's probably
a little intimidated you know but if you
get there early and you walk around
shake hands now and you know pitch your
idea a few times to practice with me
with people that are there I think it it
you know this is an idea you should be
telling everyone about you know you
shouldn't be really protective about it
people aren't going to steal your idea
if there's one piece of advice it would
be just meet everyone in the room that
you can and tell them your idea and see
what they start putting it before you
get up on stage
I think some ancillary reasons are it's
a great way to network and meet and meet
new people and form new relationships in
the community and really deep really
ocean so it's a great opportunity to try
out new things so as a developer to try
out new technologies or try out a
different way of working with a team the
the pressure of 48-hour time window
really forces you to think about what's
important what what's going to show my
app off the best yeah and how am I going
to spend that time and I find when I
come away from a hackathon I'm always in
a much more fluid faster moving frame of
mind for weeks to come so it has huge
productivity boosts for me everyone has
troubles with with remembering names and
and so we we set out to to address that
problem was to build an app that helps
people remember names and so I may I
think it made it it really easy to pitch
him because all I didn't stand up there
and say anyone forget names and
everyone's like yeah yeah
had two designers yeah I remember dad do
other developers and then my self injure
3d hands me lemons finally getting it
out and it wasn't that it was a lot of
heavy lifting at the end there was just
lots of small things that that we sort
of have to keep plugging away while we
were both doing other so we got feedback
from beta testers that we incorporated
not the time start by saying it's it's
not an easy task it's try to do things a
little differently um and we tried to
sort of attack that problem in a
slightly different way and creates
really good some really fun assets some
sort of creative ways of contacting
people you know that turned out to work
really well and sort of get over a
threshold and where you're seeing within
the top 25 apps we've got a lot of
positive press we had a really a really
great a great video we had a lot of
other great things that attracted some
viral attention and that really happened
really really worked well and once you
get some momentum the App Store does
contribute to that momentum is it sort
of just that snowball rolling yeah and
so that was our goal is to to make
everything hit at once yeah and you know
all that the continued press is great
because it increases increases the
exposure but we truly really tried to
get everything go
we used free other day but we we tried
to get all the reporters to report on
the same day about it okay yeah and it
got some great articles and on 48 absent
and moment lifehacker and yeah got to be
identical in new york times over twelve
thousand downloads in the first weekend
oh wow so yeah we felt real good about
that when I was a graph spikes up yeah
you're excited night so we founded a
company together called out monsta that
focuses on helping businesses and
various companies in the app ecosystem
better understand the app economy
through really detailed analysis of
large amounts of data great so you guys
might be my app and your later yeah your
yeah well that's that's a good that's a
good ending I really like that are you
coming to the next day way up absolutely
absolutely that wouldn't miss it for
anything cool i'll see you there yeah
thanks you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
