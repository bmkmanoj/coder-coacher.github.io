platform for local multiplayer games
that are controlled by smartphones so
what that means is when you as a user
you go to air console calm you with your
PC you then go to air control calm with
your smartphone you enter a connected
code which is what you see on this
picture here and then you have your
phone connected to the to the screen and
can use it as a controller the whole
thing is entirely web-based so nobody
needs to install anything and it's
completely free for the for the users
and the way you will be finances by
adding advertisements after games but
that is only like getting implemented
right now um we've been we've launched
in the September so I've been online for
seven months when we started we had six
titles in our store that people could
play and right now we have 29 so we've
been growing pretty fast quickly going
to check if there's any okay no comments
yet good so I guess you guys can all
hear me and see my screen all right um
good so this is my current project just
to give you a quick impression of what I
do it's a minigame collection that's
somewhat inspired by the mario party
games if you guys have played these for
one to eight players there's currently
three mini-games in it but we will add
more in the months to come you just
released an initial version of it last
Thursday so two days ago and it was made
by um two people they are the entire air
consulting is five people but two of us
were working on this yeah let's let's
get started um so for a developer what
air console or what like the platform is
or what a game is to be precise is just
to HTML files basically so the what
happens on the big screens on the
computer is is an HTML file under
controller as well now
for for us unity developers of course if
we want to make our game a HTML file
we're going to use WebGL um and to make
that work with air console we use like
we developed an air control plugin the
developers can implement into their
project that they can use to to handle
everything and if a game is built from
unity using the plug-in with WebGL it
can then be uploaded to air console
where you can worsen play all four with
the using the smartphone the controller
itself is also an HTML file and that is
that is also true when you build it with
unity so the controller is actually
written in HTML and not like exported
from unity it's not a WebGL build or
anything it's just a file so the
functionalities that we want on a
controller we have to write using using
HTML CSS JavaScript for URI developers
that don't have any web developing
experience air console offers a
controller generator where you can like
place buttons and the code is generated
automatically so if somebody doesn't
know a lot of web development they can
still make an air console game because
like the main the main work the main
programming is done in unity and there's
this controller generator um
alternatively when somebody wouldn't
want to work with unity games can also
be made in in just html5 using
javascript or we also have a plug-in for
the construct two game engine now
obviously I'm going to focus on the
unity part in this presentation but yeah
just FYI now the basic like the most
important part of using your smartphone
as your controller for a game that is
happening on screen is of course sending
messages from from the smartphone to the
screen and the other way around
so how does that work what you like the
code snippets that you see on screen
here or how I as a developer or you as a
potential developer for control would
would send messages on the left you can
see the the code of a lickin a script
that is using the the air consoled
plugin script so in the awake event we
register a custom events that is called
on message and and we then receive this
as soon as the the smartphone sends it
and can can log it or can do whatever we
want with it so if the in this example
here on the right you can see the the
script from the controller so that is
the the HTML file that is the controller
where is the left side is my C sharp
script that I'm using in unity and on
the right you can see that if this
button is pressed and I send a message
jump so what happens here is like this
function is called that is defined up
here and in this sense like using air
control it sends the message to the
screen and then of course in my own
message event on the on the screen in
c-sharp i can define what happens when
this controller sends jump i'm probably
going to move a character make the
character jump or something that's the
general idea of it it goes the other way
around too of course so um I just notice
i used inconsistent examples here but
you'll get it in c-sharp i'm using the
send a message function i'm using air
control send message and then sending
this to to the first controller and
controllers have device IDs so that
every controller that every smartphone
that joins gets around ID which I can
use to to send messages to that phone in
particular so that not every phone has
the same info maybe or I need to
distinguish distinguish of course like
which phone is sending me messages so I
can you move the appropriate character
or whatever
and this way around okay i send the i
send a message to the controller and
here in the JavaScript on the controller
I received this message and I login or
here I check if this data is jump then I
can make the character jump or something
like that it's just example scripts of
course if you if you want like working
examples of air control script both in
c-sharp and in j shtml you should
download the unity plugin the air
control plugin from the unity asset
store because in there we have working
examples with all the functions that are
available with the plug-in and so
there's like no need to screenshot these
scripts because they're just examples
okay um then this is sort of behind the
scenes how it works what you see on the
left is a a script or a snippet from the
script that is like the plug-in itself
and I personally did not write this so I
um I realize it's using like these
external calls to talk to the phone sort
of if you want to see how that works I
also recommend downloading the plug-in
and just having a look at the code
because I cannot really go into detail I
didn't write this and um I only started
working with jas and HTML like when I
started to work for air control and that
hasn't been that long if you have any
questions about how this works in detail
you can send them to me and I will
further forward them to the developer of
the plugin i will quickly check the the
chat if there's anything okay no new
message is good all right oops latency
it's like a very common reaction for
when we tell people about air console
we say like explain what it is people
say something like yeah but wouldn't
work because latency is legacies too
much so you can only make like very
simple games or whatever um we're
experiencing actually very low latency
numbers I'm assuming everybody knows
what the term latency means it means
like how long does it take for a message
from the phone to arrive on the screen
and the other way around so like how
much input lag do we have because we
need to send the message over a server
we we distinguish between WebRTC and non
WebRTC currently Android most Android
devices have WebRTC which is like a a
faster way to communicate between phone
and screen because they don't have to
the message doesn't have to make a round
trip over or server basically um and
most android phones have reber IDC most
an iOS doesn't at the moment it might be
added soon but we don't really know yet
but so this is sort of the numbers that
we have to calculate with it's about 80
to 120 milliseconds of latency and
that's not a lot less like a point one
second of course but depending on your
gameplay it can be very noticeable so in
most cases we have to keep that in mind
and work with it or work around it and
what is also important to note of course
is that this latency will not be the
same for everybody that means it depends
on where in the world who are how far
are you from our nearest server what's
your internet connection and all that
sort of thing and even with the same
internet connection and in the same
place you will have variation in latency
so you cannot just ask for the latency
at the beginning of a game and then and
then use that you have to check it with
every input
yeah we have a latency debugger that
developers can use where they can check
how much latency they have so it's
easier to ya 22 to work with and to know
what you're dealing with so to find out
what the current latency is like if I
have a game and I received the input
jump from a player and I want to know
how how much delay was in that input
because I need to sort of calculate that
into my gameplay or my my game logic so
what I do is this the top part the with
a black background again is from the jas
of the controller um the this first part
here is just that it's a it's a swipe
pad meaning it's another button but
swiping on the on the phone so if the
player swipes up I send the message
containing like two key value pairs the
first key value pair is key action value
Jung and the second one is TS for
timestamp and as a value it sends the
server time that's a top part where the
arrow points out so what I do here is
first I yeah I sent this dis value that
ok this is jumping what I want to do is
jumping and I send and I want to do it
at this specific point so we're using
synchronized clocks that means like the
phones and the the server they all or
just the server knows the exact time and
the phone here is asking for the server
time then on message that the the part
below the script with a white background
is C sharp again in unity and when I
received this message um I check first
of all I
I check if like if is this action jump
or is it another action that i sent i
also check if it's from a valid player
number and not some device that just
joined in is naturally in the game and
then I I compare the timestamp that I
got with the current server time so then
I get I know how much latency the input
task because I know okay this input was
sent at this and that time and I can
compare it and now is that time so the
difference between those is my latency
and then according to to that like if I
know okay I've point 1 seconds or point
two three four seconds whatever based on
that I can then make some adjustments to
my gameplay because i know that this
input was actually sent earlier than
when i received it now how do we use
that i'm going to show you a quick
example from a game of ours that is
called air shields you see a an
animation of it on the side you see that
players shoot these these missiles into
into this or onto the circle and
shooting one of those from the moment
player taps until it arrives always
takes point five seconds so if the
screen receives a message saying shoot
and time stamp point two seconds ago
that means the screen can then spawn a
missile a little bit ahead to compensate
for the latency I'm not sure if that is
clear so I'm quickly going to check the
chat if there's any question about this
particular issue did you get what that
was about like adjusting the input so
that it has you compensate the latency
no question so I guess everything's fine
can you go over again that make sense
please provide mode DJ
all right I'll try to make it a bit more
q um so it's important to know when a
message was sent the moment when I tap
on the phone it's i send the deep Zac
time at that moment and when i receive
it I compare it to the time that is now
and that gives me how long it took for
the message to arrive and I can then
pretend as if the message arrived
earlier so I can spawn my mess up when I
get the the input jump at timestamp 0
and then I receive the message but I
compare it with the current time and
current times like 0.2 whatever then I
can spawn the the masala a little little
ahead so it so the player doesn't notice
because tutor player it will feel it
will always feel the same regardless of
their latency because the time between
the player tapping the screen and the
missile reaching its goal will always be
the same I hope that's clear now I'm not
going to go over it again if you still
have questions maybe saving for later I
can also point you to some explanations
on it online um in other things we we
also use a similar we use similar
methods to for example in one of our
games we scale animations so animations
are shorter when there was more legacy
so that the time between giving input
and the animation being over is always
the same and that really helps the
player it may sound sort of important
but it's really noticeable if you don't
do it and of course even even though we
use tricks like these there will always
be certain limitations like for example
it will probably be hard to do a precise
platform
or on your pencil because of the latency
that we have and because because it's
not always possible to do this backwards
calculation of what would have happened
in the game have this message arrived
point two seconds ago all right next
point controller reviews um of course
when we have a controller and there's
buttons on it or spaces where you can
swipe that's that always is dependent on
the on the situation in the game so what
you see here is three different
controller views from our game silly run
Valley which is a endless runner game
where you have to swipe up to jump and
down to you two let's slide under
obstacles and and so I have to have to
run as far as you can and the three
different views you see here is like on
the left you see the in-game screen and
with the instruction to swipe to jump on
Doc the center one is the character
selection where you can swipe left right
up and down to choose a character and
press the red button when you're done
and the third one is sort of a special
situation in game when you're holding a
bomb where you can then swipe left and
right or shake the controller and it's
important to have these different views
because they give the player information
on what's currently going on in the game
and of course they're also like we
couldn't fit all of this information in
one screen so it makes a lot more sense
to to not show the controller on the
in-game screen because there we have
more important things to convey maybe or
something like that or we we don't show
a certain button when it's not when the
game is not in a situation where you
shouldn't use it and how do we do that
we are like most of our games are
friendly using a hue manager and what
this does is just show different parts
of the HTML file in different situations
so the HTML file that i have were of my
controller where everything is
where everything is to find where I have
sections right assign buttons and these
swipe pads or whatever it's all divided
into into dips diff containers and and
these have like you IDs so i can show
different tips depending on the
situation in game now of course to show
these situations i need to let the
controller know that a certain situate
like what situation the game is
currently in so to go back to the
example of Silicon Valley I need to
control it to know okay right now is
character selection time so you need to
show this or II need to know okay right
now is in game time so you need to show
this and the way I do this is by setting
a device state divided States can be you
is can be used by from all devices so
both the screen can set a device state
and every controller can sedative I
state and for this particular example
the screen sets a device state and
divided state is basically a lot of key
value pairs so um what you see here is a
such a device state as I'm using them as
a tee box in unity so I have like my
first my first key is seen and the value
of that is another key value pair
another or another this list of key
value pairs know the dictionary so to
speak and it gets rather complex pretty
quickly so my first key is ID and then
sorry my first key is seen and then I
can go into the scene info to check okay
the idea of that is in-game character
selection or whatever and they have
additional info for for the players like
which players are ready or which players
have chosen which characters that's all
sort of the information that is in here
and then in the in the controller that
new code snippet is showing the
controller again I ask ok i just got a
device state change from the screen so
i'm going to check does this device
stage have a key scene if so does it
have an ID if so it's that ID character
selection or ceiling run Valley or
whatever it should be and then based on
that i use my view manager here to show
which view would current which view
should currently be shown and yeah
that's sort of like maybe that's already
going into a bit too much detail but
it's sort of important to know because
it also shows you a bit that you can do
a lot of complex stuff in in air console
and to you shouldn't like as a developer
if you should you decide to make
something for air consult you wouldn't
have to limit yourself to a single
controller view you would have to limit
yourself to attend any of that kanya um
just a second alright um then I'm gonna
take a moment to talk about controller
design and by design I mean yeah just do
what is seen on the controller in terms
of how many buttons or how many how much
info is conveyed on the controller and
it's actually sort of a when we at the
beginning when we showed our console to
people who didn't know about it a very
common reaction was something like but
why would I want to use my phone as a
controller that sucks and what people
often have in mind is when you try to
use small buttons on the controller like
for example when you
try to emulate a regular controller a
regular game pad and you you display ad
pad or a joystick on the controller
screen and then think the player can use
that just as well as he could use a a
regular game pad that doesn't really
work because of the lack of tactile
feedback so in a regular for a regular
controller I always feel where my
fingers at if they're on the buttons or
not but when I use when I use a touch
tween that doesn't work so that sort of
limits us but it also gives us other
options because what we don't want to do
for air console is use a lot of tiny
buttons which the players can see
because if we do that they're constantly
confused and don't know where to press
um so that's why I sort of listed these
do's and don'ts it's our what we gather
gathered in experience over the past
couple of months of making games for air
control what works really well is using
smartphone specific stuff so things that
a regular gamepad couldn't like swiping
shaking gyroscopes the Excel
accelerometer that gives us a lot of
options already that gives us plenty of
things to control the game with but of
course it needs to be thought of at the
beginning we cannot it's not a good idea
probably to design a game and then try
to port it to air console some will work
of course some work very well but for a
lot of game mechanics you need to like
plan it from the beginning um it's a
good idea to use pretty big buttons
again for the reason that you place your
thumbs on the phone once and if you then
find everything blindly that's okay but
what you don't want the player is to
have to look down from their action game
to press a button because they don't
feel where it is and you can use the
controller of course to convey info
because since it's a screen as well and
not just not just the gamepad you can
have
cific info on there so for example you
can use it for something as simple as
you are this character or like you are
the blue player but you can also use it
for information that is maybe secret
from the other players we have one game
that is called samuria that it works a
little bit like werewolf we're part of
like you played with a group of people
and part of the group are like sort of
the evil guys or but but there they do
that in secret so the players see on
their own phone which faction they
belong to and need to keep that secret
from the other players which is of
course something that you could not do
with a traditional gamepad you cannot
use a gamepad like a xbox 360 controller
or whatever you cannot use that to to
communicate that sort of information and
the blog post that I linked here is a a
write-up of these controller design do's
and don'ts that I that I published um on
the air console block so if you should
you plan to do something for air
consoler should you be interested in
what it takes to design a good
controller you can have a look at that
the don'ts is basically I already
explained it above it's just small pot
small buttons as well as the pads and
joysticks don't really work in our
experience alright and that's about it I
guess um I have included a couple of may
be useful links for you guys here the
developers page here the second link is
pretty important in case you want to
know more about air console and how it
works of course the unity plugin which
is free to download and you can just try
it if you like our social media where
you can find this if you want to keep
being updated about what we do and about
new games that are released um thank you
all for listening I hope you sort of
understood what I was talking about it
felt like I was talking about you fasten
was a bit nervous um I added my email
address and Twitter handle so if you
want to stay in touch or have further
questions or just want to follow me on
Twitter or whatever you have those now
and I'll get you to check in a minute um
if you I still have one on one slots
available like these interview thingies
so if you want to know more about air
control or like developing for
smartphone controllers you can still
sign up for first lot I have slots right
after that one slot open right after
right after this talk at about eight and
I can also take some time on tuesday and
wednesday but i think you see that all
in the schedule all right i'm gonna stop
sharing the screen all right good um
blog post URL plz i see in the chat
amazing talk thank you very much all
right yeah the the blog URL i'm gonna
post it in the in the chat but you can
also find the exact blog post that i
talked about not going to search it
again right now but you can find it in
the slides which will be made available
to you then i will also share them on on
twitter ok I'm quickly going to look
through the questions somebody said on
previous project we call this the
anti-lag rewind the server goes back in
time to perform the players action yeah
that's basically what we do um I'm slide
17 yeah that's a blog post that I posted
okay um how's the game smooth sorry too
many questions somebody asks how does
the game submission work outside of
contests can anybody submit games so
what they mean by contest here is we had
a couple game developer contests where
we offered prize my
and with developers and will let
developers submit games we will probably
do that again at some point but yes
absolutely you can submit outside of
games outside of contest sorry and we
are working on adding the monetization
at the moment so that when you add a
game you can actually make money off of
it um hopefully and so yeah there there
should be like as soon as we have the
amount is a shin and there will also be
more incentive for developers to add
their games even if there's no prize
money involved but if we launch another
contest then your game is already online
we can still take it into consideration
as long as it wasn't participating in
the last contest I hope that answers
your question I'm going to move on to
the next one have you considered making
a lightroom messaging protocol rather
than Jason over HTTP to improve latency
I'm thinking something that tax by data
over just a raw socket connection for
example um I got to be honest and say
that it's not really my expertise here I
cannot answer the question because I'm
not the one that writes the actual
platform itself I just work with unity
work with the plugins so for an answer
that I question maybe um put it in an
email and send it to me and I will
forward it to the people who could
answer that then next question to
quickly go back to the latency issue you
were talking about where you saying the
game will show the output at point five
seconds regardless if the actual input
is faster um not really um think about
how to best explain that so we sort of
want our games too
a to have a bit of thinking games need
to be able to accommodate for a bit of
latency that's why I said not all games
would be a perfect fit for air console
because some just worked too fast or are
too precise and cannot account for that
latency what I meant was that when I am
I am assuming you're talking about the
part where I said that the moment for
the input to arrive f sorry for the
input to be given until the action being
executed that that is always the same
time oh sorry somebody just clarified
example if the missile is supposed to
take 500 milliseconds arrive for the
input comes in 100 milliseconds late
than the emissions for different seconds
yeah that's exactly you think it's
pretty much exactly what I was going to
say hey thank you um does have answer
your question p yes okay perfect um yeah
please ask away still have time for more
questions I think or did I miss
something I think I didn't put it
quickly check the chat again
anything else have you played a game
that does a virtual game pad on the
touchscreen that you liked for me they
never end up feeling quite right um I
think there's an important distinction
to be made here and that is like I've
played what was it final fantasy 5 on my
iPhone and that gets is sort of like a
virtual joystick and that is ok but the
important thing Shin is that there i'm
always looking at my phone screen and i
always see where my fingers are because
i'm like constantly looking down and I
see my fingers but for air console I
don't I look on the I look on the big
screen and I want to use my gamepad
blindly and that is why it's like
especially it's just different and
therefore no I don't think it will I
don't think it works quite as well um
I'd love to be proven wrong on that
matter I'd love for somebody to develop
a game that actually does it really well
well and I have to apologize to
everybody that I didn't believe in it
but um no I haven't seen um I haven't
seen a like virtual gamepad that feels
quite right either or not maybe some
some detail until we get the next
questions some people like asked about
maximal maximum player numbers and the
cool thing is air control as a platform
actually allows about up two maybe three
thousand players we haven't really
tested it with that many but it's it's a
very high maximal player number that you
can technically make games for which of
course is really cool and something that
no other console has okay new question
can the user sign in to a developer cert
def service when the game starts say
they have their own portal where they
want users to log into before playing
the game on air console um not really we
don't really want to limit we don't
really want to want users to have to go
through a a login an additional one like
the for air control accessibility is
really
important and we want the games to be
playable really fast so people don't
even have to download an app they just
have to go to the browser just enter the
code and it's not really our our plan to
put that behind P&amp;amp;O a further login like
we do ask for email addresses after a
game was played but um I don't think
that what you're asking for is possible
but again I'm not the main developer of
the platform so if you how to get player
data sorry okay I was just wondering how
to get player data I guess um we can
provide you with some player data like
we do have some like air consola
analytics that we share with developers
for example how many players were how
many players are in a game per average
how many how long is this session how
many players do you have that sort of
thing you can see in the air console
insights has air consoled on VR games
like with gear um no no we have not um I
don't know if that would work I don't
know if you can do a mobile website
you're like if you can use we are with a
mobile website but might be able to try
it we haven't um somebody asks how many
have been developed so far you mean how
many games right we currently have 29
games in the store games that have been
worked on are a lot more like probably
about 40 50 not all of those were
finished some were just prototypes some
had to like we had a couple submissions
for our first game contest where the
submission wasn't it wasn't quite ready
to be published and you wrote the Jets
our feedback but they didn't get back to
us so obviously that's it there's a
couple games that have been made but
developers didn't have time or didn't
feel like continuing it after the
contest
so there's a lot of half developed games
but about 30 completed ones and of those
30 I think about maybe 15 or so are our
own games like games developed by the
Corps Air Control team and the rest is
from external developers all right I
have about eight more minutes of
question time can he have drastically
different UI on different player phones
for an asymmetrical experience yes that
is absolutely possible and I would
strongly encourage doing that because I
think it's super cool idea and very few
people have done it so far you can show
every player a completely different UI
and you can divide them into teams you
can give them completely different
options it's everything possible and if
you feel like doing something that
absolutely do I think there would be a
really cool like here I would want to
make something like that myself but we
me and my colleague have sort of been
been busy with this uh with the other
project this sounds so awesome thank you
for your job I'm very glad that people
like it and I hope some of you will look
at the Arkansas API or the plug-in and
maybe um maybe even make a game who
knows it's got its got a lot of
potential like even with the 30 games
that we have there so I could give you a
ton of ideas like game ideas that I
think would be really cool but I don't
have time to implement mall bullet well
I guess every developer can name ten
ideas that they would like to do um so
all the games are free currently yes and
they will remain free that is one of the
I mentioned it before that accessibility
is very important for our control and we
don't want to put that behind a paywall
we don't want users to have to log in or
pay for the games um so yes they will
absolutely remain free and the only
thing that we will add is advertisements
because we need to pay wages somehow and
there might be a subscription to UM to
don't get ads so that that might be what
users can pay but they can also just
watch as if they don't want to pay can
the end users pick their controller
format I'm not sure what you mean like
the developer divine I defines what is
visible on the controller maybe you can
clarify your question in the meantime
somebody asked for Apple TV integration
we tried that and if I remember
correctly there was a problem where you
can't can use a browser on Apple TV or
something our tech lead tried it and
actually we would have loved to get a
work on Apple TV but friendly it's like
just not possible with the way Apple TV
works currently we do have Android TV
and on samsung TV apps though okay
somebody clarified their question
virtual d-pad for those who like it tilt
phone interface for those who prefer
that you could do that as a developer
that would be like if you make a game
you can give the user that option but i
would i would recommend just like
testing in with a couple people and then
choosing the one that works better but
you can give the option that's that's
possible i can just give a selection
dialog choose controls we I think we
have that in one of our games you have a
bumper man style game that is called
tick tick boom and that there you can
choose which which kind of the input you
want to use have you tested on Wii U or
any consoles that do have browsers yes
at some point
the problem with those browsers is that
they're really really really slow and so
our unity games usually don't work we
are also not quite there with having
unity games work on Android TV for the
same reason because those browsers are
always a bit like when you run something
via the browser can quite use the whole
hardware as if it were an app for it so
yes we have tested on consoles it's
technically possible to play air console
on your Playstation but we're not really
optimizing for it at the moment so it's
it's not the best experience I hope that
answers your question it's it's not a
priority at the moment for us because
like I said where is your a really small
team and we have a lot of stuff that we
want to do all right I have about three
more minutes of question time in case
any of you can think of something to ask
thank you thank you too very interesting
talk Thanks what's your favorite game on
the platform hang my own of course no um
I I've to favorites I think one of them
is actually the one that we just
released because I'm super happy that
release went really well and that's the
mario party like game collection that i
mentioned before it's called silly World
Series and we actually made a let's play
of that like from the air consulting and
that was a ton of fun I playing with a
couple people is just it's really cool
we just we were just five people you
could you could play it with eight so it
was really fun i have to try it with a
at some point and my other favorite game
is it's called castle hustle and i was
developed by student at the zurich
University of the Arts which is where I
studied too and graduated about a year
ago and they made this game as a
semester project and because what's your
best score at cream for speed yes about
300 meters but I'm not a hundred percent
sure and Castle hustle was um was made
in just a couple of months by a bike
game design students and they plan to
still develop it and the cool thing
about it is it's for two to five players
its co-op and you have to plan your
moves like it's sort of it's got grid
based movement and you have to defend
your castle from monsters and you always
have to plan for moves and then when
everybody's plan their moves they all
get executed in like at the same time or
just like 1 2 3 4 and so you really have
to communicate with your with your team
like with your fellow players yes sir ok
so I'm on turn 3 can you can you catch
that because i'm going to throw hbu a
barrel and you can throw it at the
monster and and that's just really cool
because we have very little co-op game
so far with mostly player versus player
so that's what
my favorite games definitely got out of
the question how are you promoting you
mean like in terms of what we're
marketing with you for the platform
ourselves or okay um very little to be
honest we were mostly so far we've
mostly relied on organic growth so we've
been we've been in a couple of tech news
outlets like we've been on on TechCrunch
and on the next web and that's mostly
due to Raphael who is responsible for
product management and marketing on the
team and he writes rights to a lot of
journalists and tells me we're doing
this cool thing would you like to write
about it we were then on the we were on
the front page of reddit one sphere
which obviously also brought a lot of
users and but actually we're only just
now sort of getting into actually doing
marketing because so far we've been very
focused on getting games and providing
like if the best possible experience for
the user so that we can provide a good
experience for the users that do come to
the to the platform so um in terms of
promoting promotions that are planned
one of the next things that's going to
be released as a a video that it's just
like a promotional video a trailer or so
to speak of explaining what air console
is and why people should totally use it
because awesome that's going to be the
next bigger promotional thing that we
will lose I hope that answers your
question all right um so it's about ten
to eight um I think I should be going so
that you guys have time to go to next
conferences um in case any more
questions should come up don't hesitate
to contact me I'll say it again my email
is Ellis at n minus Green Comm I will
share the slides if you have any
question
send me an email write me on Twitter
whatever yeah okay um in that case
thanks you thanks to you all for
listening if you want to know more
they're still what I want interviews
available if you also feels like very
specific questions that you didn't want
to post in the chat and yeah that's
about it thank you so much for listening
and thank you for all your questions in
your interest goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
