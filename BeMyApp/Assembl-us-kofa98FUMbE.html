of times people proactively book
conference rooms and the conference
rooms end up being underutilized
employees complain about rules not being
available and facility management says
that are enough rooms available wouldn't
it be great it's a would be some cheap
software that could manage conference
room imagine a restaurant that failed to
fill tables that have been reserved just
imagine how fast they would go out of
business restaurants have already solved
that problem by using open table such a
solution does not exist today for the
enterprise thanks to the new I peak and
technology we can now solve this problem
after human beings facility management
is the number to call spots for
companies a good insight in room
utilization effectively brings down
costs for enterprises the systems
currently installed costs four hundred
sixteen dollars a month with insulation
guards or four thousand dollars thanks
to our system we can effectively break
down those costs fifty seven thousand
dollars over the course five years and
now on to the devil
so we're also going to use the trick of
bringing the room to us so we don't have
to so that you can actually see the the
devices all right so you could write an
app over here so here's the fou-fou is
in this simulation going to be outside
the room and this is bar inside the room
so far as you saw it the video has a
meeting actually going on foo this man
has the meeting is approaching the room
hi Yuki come on Yuki is bringing our
room so this works what's going to
happen here is that what we wrote is a
Heroku server up in the cloud all right
and so Yuki is bringing the room so what
if the if Heroku responds properly to
what we should see is come over here
with bring your bring your app closer oh
did it go nope well there it did work
here we go so actually got the
notification inside the room
notification popped up that says
assemble says another meeting begins in
2-minutes there are people waiting
outside</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
