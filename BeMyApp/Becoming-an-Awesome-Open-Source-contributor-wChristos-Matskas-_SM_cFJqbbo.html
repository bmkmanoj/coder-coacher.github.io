minutes once again we'll be starting in
five minutes see folks to
you
hi you hear me I creases how are you can
you hear me I can hear you fine sorry
for that I am so sorry no worries i'm
sitting on out an email because i'd say
i wanted to everybody saying that you
were late so let's meet up an hour so
okay right so you pushed everything back
or I was still doing it now I'm sorry
can you repeat that I said that are we
pushing everything backed by an hour or
we think are not saying I'm just good I
say we're gonna start in at 6 15 or 515
for you so about like in six minutes
okay good thanks cool no problem how's
things with you pretty good over here
and sunny Paris how about you yeah it's
all good i'll give ya and you can figure
the comer here are we haosheng camera as
well uh right now we're actually pretty
live so if you want you can start
sharing your screen yeah right no
problem
how do we how do we display the screen
here on the left is a green screen yes I
saw that yeah so you can just select
window you were like to share yes that's
the wrong so let me know if you can see
that can't hear me fine as well is
everything okay on your end cool work
right now I currently see your the black
screen okay Jay you mean the other logo
but no I just see a black screen oh ok
case yourself now coming yes good I
can't shine used to being in power point
ahead mode okay um actually I think will
be easier if you share your whole screen
and then all right presentation okay no
problem go back into that just scream
turn hi screen okay just can't right now
any better perfect there we go your
screen is now set brilliance and what's
the form of the we here take questions
from people as well throughout the
session near the end correct at the end
people will just if anybody sometimes
they don't have questions if they have
any questions at the end yep the
comments section I'll just be moderating
between you myself and you cool okay and
how long is the session for usually it's
about an hour it's entirely up to you so
we like 40 minutes usually it's 40
minutes and at the end of those 40
minutes views they are 15 10 minutes of
Q&amp;amp;A fantastic okay well lot more or less
fits with the time but you know we can
stretch it or squeeze it as much as we
can depending on what people want to do
brilliant sounds good so I paused again
for mixing the time zones it happens we
need a one universal time that's it
exactly get lots of events i lined up
for yourself and coming months yeah we
actually have a we are actually fo point
for july nice is our webcasts well yeah
we do actually have a lot of webinars
but we also have a lot of like
hackathons and workshops in that sort
nice that sounds nice I still haven't
been never hackathon to be honest you
should roll it to go after the years see
the problem is that most of them are in
london and i'm quite north which makes
things it'll be hard if i say i'm going
to take the weekend off to go to a
hackathon especially now that i'm
traveling so much with work and makes it
almost impossible to do any
extracurricular stuff outside work
definitely i didn't even I didn't
totally agree with that yeah it's a life
of a developer prisoner pretty much oh
ok so we're officially we're officially
gonna go live in two min or we're
already live ok so in two minutes we're
officially gonna start sounds like good
thing are you gonna do a quick intro or
deal to avert excellent ok everyone can
actually hear us right now that's
fantastic maybe I should join in as well
in the conversation do you know how many
people we have looked in currently I
have no where to find out right now
nothing i have a friend of mine that
he's logged in so i'll know at least one
person is watching the webcast that's
good sad at it tom he's probably the
only one listening anyway it was
definitely good race home today thanks
for doing that i had to change the sport
mode in my car just to make sure i can
make a home on time
that's good let me see ok so we're
fishing and start going live ok are you
recording that as well for later on yes
this link anybody can just watch it or
reload it so at there any of the basic
convenience they can rewatch it
fantastic yeah well i've seen i appre
bishop engine away alright a silly
question I'm gonna meet my second for a
second ok should put some music in the
back out so people can enjoy while we're
showing our cooled logo for open shores
ok so crystals were fishing in a start
hi everyone thank you for coming welcome
to another be map webinar once again I'm
Fernando and it's a pleasure having all
of you here in this session we actually
have crystals he's open source expert
and without much hesitation and no we're
pretty much running late again apologies
on that to everyone else who couldn't
feel free to watch this video as many
times as you need to and yeah so I say
let's get the show started so I'll
present you to crystals macos hi
everyone thanks for joining in apologies
for the delay again and let me start by
saying I'm definitely not an open source
expert I would say I'm an open source
enthusiast because I like to top and
shorts but not an expert in any case
what I'm going to be talking about
today's mainly about open source and how
I got involved and how get started as
well so from a beginner's perspective I
think it's quite important to understand
how to get started with open sores and
why you should be involved with often
shortened what the community has to
offer and all it takes is a little bit
of enthusiasm and a keen eye for doing
some development work so a few words
about me um first of all I'm a geek I've
been a developer for
over 12 13 years now mainly the.net
stack I've done a bit of node and
JavaScript show you know server and
client side which is quite interesting
keeps things like and quite nice but
apart from that i'm also dad and husband
my wife has asked me to disclose that
because apparently i'm more than a geek
so I'm a dad to two beautiful girls and
the husband to my wife who supports me
wholeheartedly in this endeavor again
developer for 12 years with dotnet stack
I'm a speaker I tried to speak to as
many events as possible another
professional speaker I'm not getting
paid to do that so it's all about being
enthusiastic and trying to share my
passion about technology with the
community hence the reason why I'm here
today as well so i hope i will aspire
you to that take it on as well because
if i can do it anyone can do it i'm also
blogger and author i try to blog about
my adventures with software and i like
to blog about how i get around to solve
problems i also like to blog about new
stuff and signee things i like to store
my machine and how to break it and
author i'll try to write a few blog
posts so I write for msdn in the UK
right for Red Gate as well they have a
couple of websites over there so the
idea is to spread the word around and
again it's all about having fun and
getting bored with the community I was a
max of MVP at the beginning of this year
also the shortest MVP in the UK I've
only managed to hold that for about two
months and that's only because I joined
Microsoft as a Microsoft Azure engineer
so I work on the other team and we go
out practically help developers take
advantage of the cloud so it's a very
enthusiastic role it's very hands-on and
very forward thinking as well so real
exciting stuff so I'm gnarly too upset
about missing my MVP title although it
was a nice accomplishment and today I'll
be talking to you about my passion which
is open source and and like a lot of
people do out there I go home and the
first thing i do is i log onto my pc
once everyone it goes down to sleep and
I like to agin vote with a trying new
stuff and after this lovely commits trip
fake which more or less explains what I
do and this is me so that's the first
part and hopefully ever had the chance
to read by now and I'll move on to the
next one which is this this is me
starting small projects every single a
week or so living the other ones in the
background and that's only because I
like to be involved with the new
technologies and trying new frameworks
and breaking stuff around in fact and
I've broken my machine so many times
last year that I promote that to a
monthly task now because I'm certain
that i only saw something that will
screw things up so don't be afraid to
play around that's my message more or
less and have fun play around break
things because this is how we learn so
usually when I give this talk I have an
audience front of me and the first thing
I ask is how many people are involved
with helping trolls and how many people
are ready maintainer of products or
foreign source projects and how many
people have never tried this before and
never had a chance to get involved and
this is quite important because it all
comes down to your first request or your
first and submission your first
contribution to open source everyone
said tip to open source and everyone's
endeavor to open source is total
different to what you do and you don't
have to approach the exact same way not
for me I when I was talking about open
source in the past before I ever got
involved I thought that it was it was
all about linux linux and linux kernel's
and writing graphics for linux and c++
and things that I would never be able to
do and even though I was developing as a
throughout my career and I was getting
more experience and i felt quite
comfortable I never never thought about
having the ability to get out there and
contribute and my first contribution to
open source was totally accidental I
joined a brand new team and they had
this package manager that was taking
every single package into the repository
and I thought it was a very silly idea
to do so and within the first couple of
hours i joined the team i managed to
break the CI the continuous legation
server and i broke the build an eye
ended up staying laid back to fix the
broken build and as always every time I
account a problem I tried to blog about
it so i went home and blocked about my
silly thing and how to restore it
because apparently it's very easy to
remove those packages from the
repository by checking in one check box
but then again i'm doing that it
requires a lot of manual effort around
social files internet so i blogged about
it and around 11pm at night i tweeted
that to my 820 and tweet bots in hope
that someone would retweet that and I
could help someone else and apparently
the the team that maintains that package
matter picked up the message and said
that's a fantastic article we have a gap
in the documentation would you like to
contribute I was really excited about
that so I said yes absolutely i will
send you an email with the document and
they said no no no this is the github
repo just go and do a pull request and
will accept it and i had no idea what
they were talking about I was totally
alien to me get github a pull request so
I spend the next three hours now we're
talking a middle of the night Aaron's
asleep spending a lot of time trying to
work out what pull requests mean and had
to do work with get after three hours
I'm asked to submit my poor requests and
that took me almost due to a.m. in the
morning I feel really proud of myself
because as you can see here that's my
first ever pull request being accepted
then I run to my wife in the middle of
the night Walker up and the rest is
history in fact she was quite excited
but then again she couldn't really
understand what I was explaining to her
and that's what means leaving with a
geek but overall that was my first and
able to open source and i realize that
it doesn't take a genius to be able to
write the Linux kernel code to be able
to contribute in fact it's very easy to
get started with open source but before
I show you how to get started what
ensures i think it's important to
understand so these are this is you know
me getting excited about open source and
starting to contributing to open source
you can see that's a 18 thousand
downloads of my different open source
packages it's probably a tiny number
comparing to millions and millions of
packages out there but to be honest for
me it feels great to know that I have
helped 18,000 people by downloading my
packages now God knows how many of them
are still using them but so far I
haven't had any issues or problems
helped a couple of people with some
minor issues but you know it's out there
so it's not just only getting started
with it but also I've moved into
contributing which is quite exciting but
what is open Sean strain let's discuss a
bar open source and the definition so
first of all open source is software
whose source is available you can
download it you can change it you can a
city can add features and you can have
full access to source code which is very
important and sometimes and these open
stores comes with different types of
open-source licenses so it's important
to know what the licenses are because we
have TPL and we have MIT and so on which
gives you slightly different types of
access to the open-source software but
in general as an idea open source is
software that we can download install on
your machine change it to your heart's
content and then you can either
contribute back to the original source
code if you change something or you can
keep your own copy that you don't have
to merge back but it opens up the the
road for so many different possibilities
for me open source is a lot more rather
than just license open source is
community and a concept it's the idea
they get all developers really cleverly
established developers in the community
and working with the brand new
developers have never done any serious
workers never really worked on a massive
project sometimes have students that
participate in to open source and they
work together to create software that
anyone can use and help each other which
is quite fantastic sometimes all the
developers are quite tired and they're
fed up with maintaining a project and
then someone new comes in all this yes
they can all keen to help out and then
you know they rekindle that passion
about open source I think this is a
brilliant brilliant idea and open source
is changing the way that we deal with
software today
so open source is communities definitely
a community thing you know you can't
really do anything and you can see that
the open source is starting to encompass
everything now and we use open source in
almost everything what do we hear League
is it let me give some examples we have
the US Department of Defense the use all
open source the city of Munich in
Germany runs all on open source and the
whole public sector in Spain is also
driving an open source the Federal
Aviation Administration or internal
controls stock market the French
parliament Cuba most of your submarines
out there and scaly the last hydrant
Collider as you can see in the picture
on the right hand side so if these
things are running on open source and
can trust the day they can run fine it's
also funny because in the past we would
think that the security would come from
hiding the code and obscurity so it was
security through obscurity but in fact
today the more things are open stores
the more secure they are because more
eyes rolling of them and the best
example is open SSL as we all know and
yeah I mean everything is running out
the other day I was talking to a fellow
developer and he was talking about this
kind of embedded open-source software
that is so secure that nobody has heard
of it but everything is running that in
fact the summaries I was talking about
lay down on this type of software
because they have custom-made computers
or servers are running on the submarines
that are very very small factor and very
very optimized for what they do and they
have to run specific software hence why
everything so you know it's still open
source of me can still download stuff
but apparently it's a different kind of
open source that nobody has heard of
exciting so who's who's getting involved
open source today first of all let's say
let's see Apple Apple apparently based
on this announcement that they came out
last year in 2015 is the first major
computer company to make open source
development and now we all know that's
not true so what happened is the
community had a big bucks less about it
and then Twitter and LinkedIn and
Facebook caught on fire and then Apple
decided to backtrack and say well in
fact open source software is at the
heart of their
platform and we do contribute to open
source code which is fine I mean we want
any way everyone to contribute and Apple
has made a significant contribution by
open sourcing the Swift a programming
language currently own version 3 and
then Microsoft you know we I work for
Microsoft and it's it's really exciting
to see where we are today but 15 years
ago this is the statement as I said that
they made out this is what they put out
Linux is not public domain Linux is the
cancer touches are an intellectual
property sense to everything now I
wonder what Steve Ballmer has to say
today when almost fifty or sixty percent
of max of designing on open source so we
support linux within a Windows 10 and
most of the azure stack supports Linux
in fact about twenty five percent of the
Linux stack as of the other stock is
running on Linux which is pretty
exciting the last five years have seen a
massive transformation and it's not just
the fact that we support or mac supports
open source the fact that they also run
the dotnet foundation which is
foundation where anybody can submit
projects that they feel that they can
contribute the community and as long as
they're active as long as they are fully
maintained and as long as there's good
documentation you get massive support
for my crop so you get free space for
advertising you get lots of publication
for Microsoft you get massive help with
resources we have max with employees and
max with developers contributing to your
projects and you also get legal support
so if you ever come across any problems
like the I think it was a let's encrypt
or yeah so let's encrypt which allows
you to have openssl sorry you can have
ssl on your websites for free and it's a
free organization where they try to
promote an ssl for every website they
came across a legal lawsuit against the
Komodo where Komodo was saying that
let's encrypt stole their source code
and in fact that cost them a lot of
money in legal fees
obviously I don't know if you'll ever
come across this issues but having the
support of Microsoft behind you and the
legal support that they offer you it's a
two piece mind if you're coming down
that way but you don't have to submit
your project to make sure thing you
don't have to to do that in fact there's
tons and tons of open-source out there
that run on open source and they're not
meeting by any big companies example
nodejs angularjs bootstrap and Tim a
little easier I mean up I was thinking
to developer the other day and they were
saying why did he do it man yyp he do
open source and answered him I'll ask
you this how many and time is when you
start a project do you think whether
you're going to be using open source or
not in fact today I don't think you can
even start or work on any open source
without using some kind of any project
without using any type of open source
even in enclosed companies like finance
and staff they have to do you things
like node and angular and they are using
open source it's it's it's ingrained you
can really go about without it in fact
we will see a massive shift from having
to pay for software to being able to not
only get the source of the code but
being able to contribute as well which
is very exciting so open source is
everywhere these days and it's still
exciting to see where things are going
to go especially with IOT coming into
play now and knowing that every single
device other will be connected we're
going to see a lot more adoption of or
open source so you decided to get
involved now I've convinced you that you
know open source everywhere but why
should you personally get involved with
open source what do you have to gain
this is usually the question why why do
I care why me I'll give you a few good
reasons first of all it's cool if you
tell anyone that you work in open source
they think they're doing some really
cool I I always thought that people were
working on open source and Linux and
things like that were quite lucky you
know there were really exciting so it
was it was quite inspiring to to know
that I know someone that works in open
source and when I started getting
involved i also got that feeling I might
be
doing documentation updates I might be
just doing simple additions to code or
write a unit test let the fact that I'm
part of that community makes me feel
cool so tell your friends tell your
people tell your peers that you work in
open source and you'll see that you know
the either they get that kind of spackle
around you you'll make new friends
working open source it's something that
will force you to come out of your
comfort zone it will allow you to
communicate with a lot of people and in
fact you can't even get started with
open source without opening the channel
of communication it's important you can
contribute to a project before speaking
to the maintainer saying that you want
to contribute into something so you want
to write a guinea test or you want to
contribute a new feature it makes sense
to contact them and say look I want to
work on this one can I can help out or
we have any advice so it opens the
channel of communication and what
happens throughout the the months and
the weeks and the years as you work on
open source you'll come across some
really clever people some really
impressive people and eventually you
might get a chance to meet them in
person I know quite a few people in the
UK I wouldn't know otherwise unless I
got involved in open source and even
going to conferences you'll see that
it's usually these same people that are
excited to participate in speak at
conferences so not only do you get to
meet them online but he also gets us to
meet them impression and maybe say a
beer or coffee and it does really allow
you to make new friends you also make a
massive massive network of resources so
if you ever come across a problem you
know that you've spoken some on the past
that the help tab with a specific issue
are on your project or a different
project it's always nice to have someone
to turn to when you have a problem
you'll definitely become a better
developer that's not a lie once you
decide to participate in open source
then you're opening your code to review
your opening your code to anyone to see
and that's important because with our
reviews you can only get better I mean I
would never say I'm the best coder then
if I say that I will probably feel very
complacent and there's so many clever
people
that I can do so much better so working
a team that them you know comprises of
very enthusiastic and very excited
people about technology it's very very
good for your career because you'll
definitely become a better developer
especially if you're starting as a
developer now so a lot of students ask
me how how do I build up my experience
how do I build my career and it's hard
to get your first job without an
experience which is almost like a
catch-22 where employers will ask for
experience and you can get experience
until you get a job and so on so the
best way to get experience is by doing
open source it does require you to leave
your house all it requires is an Indian
connection and the computer and you get
to work on really exciting projects you
find something that you're really
passionate about or something that you
feel like an contribute and we'll see
how later on you can get involved if you
never really got any experience with
open source but the point is that even
at the early stage of your career you
can really help you get started in a
later stage of your career it will
definitely help you become better by
seeing how other people think and how
other people solve problems next one
it's great for your CV i was giving this
same talk at NDC london just a few
months ago and i was on state saying
that open source will definitely open
your career opportunities because by
putting your code out there you
definitely get a lot more ice you get up
and get a lot more publicity and it's
the best advertisement can do about your
job you can do whiteboarding test you
can do you can ace your interviews but
it will never be a true reflection of
how you can code and how you do things
whereas by saying this is these are my
repo on github and this is my code on
github there's no bear proof by seeing
how people and change the code
throughout the the evolution of the
project and how they think about solving
problems so an employer can just go into
your github repo and look into that and
see why you can do sometimes it just
Trump the whole interview and you bypass
the whole interview process and go
straight from so because I know you now
this is nikki kaye I was given this talk
in the UK and
you know people agreed and nodded and
then Rob Connor who is very being the
daughter that community came to speak to
me after the talk and said I agree with
you about the open source contributions
being good for your CV but in fact in
the US you can't get a job with the one
of the top employers unless you do work
in open source so in the UK is optional
it's good for you when the gig is almost
in the US it's almost mandatory they
have a good work on open source projects
because that will help you to get a
better job so you know you never know
how things will change on this side of
the pond but be prepared put your code
out there and make a name for yourself
now the last thing is a very very
selfish but i find this one of the best
rewards you get free stuff just before I
joined Microsoft where we I was getting
lots of free stuff anyway but just
before I joined Microsoft I probably had
something like seven grands worth of
seven grams in pounds which probably a
quiz about eight grand in dollars eight
thousand dollars or free software on my
machine just from doing open source so
red gate will give you the full suite of
tools for free xamarin which use the
charles some like a thousand pounds per
license would give you all this for free
if you could prove and you could present
your open source work so it's not just
saying that you do open source were
obviously proving it and so these tools
are very expensive some of them are in
the thousands and I was quite surprised
when i got my MVP title you also get
free stuff so much the most valuable
professional we get lots of free stuff
and i jumped on the opportunity to get
some more free stuff and apparently i
could get more as an open source
contributor rather than an MVP for
Microsoft which is a bit odd so tell us
or read kate gave me half of the stuff
on my MVP title but gave me the full
suite of tools on open source nothing
makes sense because if you do all this
open source work you have a network of
developers you have other people you
work with and obviously you go to your
day job and you present your staff and
you say I'm working this really cool
tool so it's free advertisement for them
and the free
benefits for you so these are like some
really compelling reasons to get started
you'll definitely become a better
developer you'll build an amazing
amazing cv and you'll made some really
good friends that can help you you know
in your career and hopefully solve some
problems in the future for me personally
there's one other reason I like open
source because it makes me feel like I
can do a lot more we can make better
software by standing on the shoulders of
giants there's a lot of clever people
out there a lot cleverer than me and I I
can freely admit that they have
contributed so many thousands hours
doing open source and being able to use
those tools that they've created to
propel my my project and work faster and
smarter it's amazing and imagine what we
could do as a community overall if we
could get together and work on making
better software out on trying to fix
bikes on the day-by-day basis but that's
the ideal world also with open-source I
don't have to wait around for things to
be fixed if I find a bag in a repo that
or a project I'm working with I will
pull pull it down I'll fix it for myself
and then you know I have the choice to
either push it back to the original
maintainer to the original project as a
pull request and you know they can
either accept it or not does matter but
for me I've must solve my problem but I
have to wait for their six month or a
yearly release to release a bag takes or
a new feature I can go and do it myself
which is fantastic that that's why I
love open source it makes the evolution
of project of code matts faster and it
makes me solve my problems much easier
so it's really exciting now after having
all these years of experience and having
worked in a few projects myself I'll
give you the recipe to a successful open
source find a project to contribute
let's step 1 write some code submit a
pull request and somebody happens and
you make millions of pounds or
and force it doesn't work like that in
open source I'm afraid and to be honest
I've never really met anyone that made
loads and loads of money in open source
but as I said the benefits that you get
out of contributing to open shorts are a
lot more than what you would get in a
monetary value and in fact if you would
like to put a value into that having a
better job or better prospects in your
career by contributing to open source I
think in fact will bring back some money
so it's a solid investment so how did he
get started I hope I have convinced
quite a few of you to get involved and
why you should get involved so for some
of us never done before for someone that
has never been involved with the open
source what are the avenues for getting
bold there are quite a few tools out
there to help you in your quest and for
those ones that want to do something
very simple or very small because in
fact you don't really have to write code
as your contribution to an open source
project there's so many other things
that go into open source we're talking
about maintenance documents we're
talking about documentation we're
talking about organizing the code we're
talking about all these meetings that
take place and somebody that needs take
notes they release notes every single
time somebody's to write all these
things down what about uniqueness you
know there's so many people out there
that put code out but they don't have
enough time to write the union test or
documentation and there's always demand
for either documentation or a more urine
test because let's admit it who wants to
ride in testing who wants to write
documentation I'm pretty sure that all
of us like to write code and this is the
most mundane task but then again there
are people out there that would like to
contribute and that's what happens so up
for grabs net and up thus for describes
the net is it a nice repository that you
can go in and you can select project
types you can say I want to work with no
door I want to work JavaScript or Python
or dotnet or go or whatever and they
allow maintainer ste put their open
issues out on
website so you have some really mature
products out there that require a lot of
help or require some complex
contributions but there are some other
projects out there that require some
very very simple tasks and in most cases
there are quite human thing is that are
encouraged to do that to get more people
involved so have a look through there
and find something that you think it's
appropriate to your skills another very
good source of open source and projects
and information is github github com
it's probably their de facto tool now
for any open source project out there
and they also provide some really good
analytics like most our projects how
many projects on the top 10 by language
or by by frameworks and so on and you
can go there and again choose something
that you're passionate about or a
project that you like to contribute to
something like a tool that you worked in
the past and you found it was Mary may
be inadequate or didn't have enough
documentation so you can go there and
find something like this and then
there's a specific site which is
addressed only to first-timers again
this is another initiative that allows
you to go to that website and find tasks
that are specifically addressed to
first-time contributors again that's
very important because you don't want to
be inundated by complicated tasks or
writing linux kernel code as I always
say so these are three sides to get
started with and every single day
there's more coming out so this is not
the extensive list that you would find
anywhere and i'll be happy to provide
some more information in the end if
anyone was to follow up so there's also
a twitter handle which is called my
first PR at my first PR which again
allows you to to do things like finding
projects so you can contribute for the
first time and so on you can also
advertise and and tweet back saying this
is this was my first contribution you'll
get some retweets and so on so now let's
say you've identified your project how
do you go about contributing and in fact
if you've never done it before then
these the so many traps
can fall into and I find that the list
will go into next it's a really helpful
checklist to allow you to stay in line
with what you need to do in fact if you
follow most of these things you'll find
that the more so than not you'll be
quite successful now I would never happy
where I am today if my first pull
request I had not been accepted
sometimes people get really discouraged
by like getting knocked packs and we'll
discuss about how maintenance can also
help with this later on but for now I
think it's important to know a few
things on how to approach your first
contribution and what you need to do as
your as a first time contributor so
first thing first learn how to get
obviously this is not a verb but then
again we get things all the time it is a
it's airport story for code it's the
same as a suppression and the same as
mercurial and you know is it's it's
really good though because I find get a
lot more versatile and much easier to
work with now there's a lot of command
so that I think this book the size of a
Bible I have 500 pages worth of good
command and they're very very
complicated but in fact this nine or ten
commands that you use on a daily basis
and you'll rarely go outside this but
knowing how to use get at a comfortable
level is quite important because it will
speed up your contribution to open
source another important thing read the
contribution instructions why is that
important because obviously every single
project has different contribution
instructions it's not always the same
and you'll find that that quite a few
open-source maintainer zar a bit
eclectic to say least they have this
specificity around how to approach your
open source contributions so in most
cases and hopefully most cases there
will be a contribution dot MD or a
similar similarly daughter named
document which will allow you to go
through a quick checklist and see what
you need to do if you're in contributing
they will have step-by-step instructions
you should be quite comprehensive
now contact the owner again remember
that we said open source will allow you
to make friends and because it opens the
channel of communication before you even
get involved with writing even your
first line of code or documentation or
whatsoever make sure you contact the
owner raising an issue or condom then
directly by email and ask them whether
you can work on something because you
might find out that even though they
haven't put anything out there might
already be working on that same thing or
there might be already halfway through
producing the documentation so before
you do anything you don't want to
duplicate effort and you don't want to
go through a week's worth of coding only
to find out that your pull request code
rejected because somebody else was
already working on it and they forgot to
make it public so contact the owner
either by raising an issue and saying I
want to work on this or I found a bug
and ask them whether you can help them
out now another important thing that
you'll find it's very very common is
changing coding standards so I have my
own style of coding and most of you
obviously have your own standards of
coding and in most cases they don't tend
to to be consistent but it's very
important when you work on somebody
else's project to ensure that you don't
break their coding standards you have to
abide by them now this may be sounding
odd because you want to name your
private properties in a different way
that they named theirs but if you go
around changing code in that manner then
you can be guaranteed I can guarantee
that you're not going to get your poor
request accepted and also working with
different coding standards across
different projects definitely allows you
to adapt easier to different coding
styles making you a better developer
going back into the argument that we
said earlier on why should get involved
because working on different projects
and different repos and different coding
styles definitely allows you to adapt
faster and that's good so make sure you
don't change that don't change four
spaces two tabs and vice versa because
we know that this can click over the
whole thing of a mess now what thats
related unit tests if you are adding new
features or if you are adding a new
piece of code
make sure that you are related unittest
that's very important because not only
will make your pull request easier to
accept but it will also prove that what
you've added and not only add value to
the overall project but it can be easily
tested and it can guarantee that it
works in an expected manner there's
nothing worse than getting a new class
file or a new function and then having
to go and prove that the function works
in the expected way so make sure that
you add value by adding unionists so
that's very important and it will
definitely definitely helped propel your
pre request into being accepted if you
find a bug on the other hand and say
well I found a bug and I'm raising this
issue then there's nothing worse than
saying just that because we all been
there we've all got that ticket that
said this doesn't work on my machine for
this indecision and then they said
nothing else and you have to scramble to
figure out what the steps were to
recreate the bug and what the outcome
was rather than I got an exception so by
doing yourself a favor you're doing the
other side a favor by saying I found a
bug this is a screenshot this is my
stack so I'm using Windows 10 or Linux
on this hardware and this is my latest
update and i was using this browser and
this is the error i got this will
guarantee that you can definitely
definitely get your issue or bug moved
into the top of the line when it comes
to all the top of the priority when it
comes to finding out how to do things
and hopefully and by touching that you
can say i can also work on finding a fix
for your bug will soon make things even
easier and lastly that's slightly off
screen it says be patient but if you can
see the whole thing but you need to be
patient if you want to contribute to an
open source you can really make
assumptions that the maintainer only
works not most of us we do open source
we do have daytime jobs as I said we're
parents and husbands so taking time off
our and free time to work on open source
it's a sacrifice and sometimes we have a
battle in fact if you go into most
the open source projects are there
especially the active one so the other
ones are used by a lot of people you
realize that there's a massive backlog
of poor requests and issues and
everything is being discussed so if you
are going to get involved just be
patient and even your even if you're
poor request is the only one out there
my advice is raising issue and once you
get acceptance then do the work then do
your pull request submit your request
and wait for it and then if after week
there's nothing back then feel free to
ping the owner or maintainer of the
project and say look up something might
pull request I'm not sure if you're too
busy or not but King let me know whether
is anything else you want me to do or if
you have a timeline in your mind and be
patient just sit back and enjoy the ride
and then try to work on something else
just don't get hung up on your first
request if it doesn't get accept it and
if it doesn't get accepted then make
sure you ask why in most cases people
are quite helpful to come back with some
people I can say well I don't like this
or don't like that you've missed
something here or you don't have enough
unit tests or I need some documentation
so they will tell you just ask you don't
get frustrated and don't get
disheartened so we've seen what happens
when your first time a contributor and
hopefully this checklist will help you I
get up to speed there's lots of
tutorials out there about get and how to
use gate but trust me in most cases most
of us use nine ten commands if we have
to divert from our script and the usual
commands and I usually get a second pair
of eyes I mean I had to reverse some
commits the other day and I kid you know
I've been working with kid for five
years and you know I had the same wish I
had to get somebody to look over my head
just to make sure that was the right
thing and I get called into looking I'm
popular soldier from somebody else just
to make sure they do that I think and so
you know it might be nine ten commands
but knowing what you're doing around kid
is quite important now let's see if you
are a maintainer then let me say from
the get-go that you're rock stars and we
won't thank you for all your effort and
all the work that you do because
maintaining an open source project is
big its biggest possibility
games a lot of work and it takes time of
your personal schedule which site I
appreciate because i have to the same
even though my help in source projects
are a bit behind with regards their
updates but no I've got a plan to do
them but we thank you because the
community wouldn't be where they stay
without your help but even if you're
contributing or even if you've been
contributing for quite a few years I
think there are still a few things that
I can say about how to become a better
maintainer as well and you might already
be doing this which is awesome but I'm
pretty sure that we might find something
in the list that you might not be doing
already so let's see what do you need to
do the maintainer checklist don't create
software for the sake of it it might
sound like a good idea to work on a pet
project and over the weekend and then at
the end of the weekend put it out there
and it's out its out in the open and you
put on github and you forget about it
for another six months and you ignore
the emails you ignore the issues you
ignore the poor requests and so on open
source is not just for Christmas it's
it's a big commitment so I'm hijacking
that line but to be honest it's a big
responsibility so if you are prepared to
put software out there then people will
start using it and then they will
definitely definitely need your support
and help if they come across issues so
if you are putting things out there just
be prepared that there might be some
extra time required to maintain stuff
now looking into contribution from your
side of things make sure that you put
add some contribution guidelines you
obviously want people to come and help
you out if you got a very exciting idea
but having instructions about how people
can contribute to your project and what
are your specific requirements about
those contributions is quite important
because it sets expectation from both
sides for brian newman tayag
contributors then it tells them how to
go about contributing to you and four
people are quite experienced in
open-source it gives them a very quick
checklist on how to do things before
they get started
test your project now I already said
that sometimes we can really be bored a
writing documentation in fact I am the
victim of the same thing I get really
excited about a project and I put it out
there but I make sure that I ad unit
tests so for every piece of code ahead
that can be hearing tested i will add my
unit test and sometimes i will even put
indication test which make the whole
thing easier so if i'm writing a library
then i will try to put some proof of
concept that on that library that helps
people see how you can use it in your
code and that's sometimes even better
than putting documentation out there
because we all know that documentation
can go stale because i have time to
update it but unit test cannot go stale
if you add new features or if you change
codes so having gained testing around
your code definitely helps people
understand how your code works and also
makes adoption rates higher if you want
people to help you out as well you might
want to add some setup instructions
because we all know that there are some
dependencies on third-party tools like
if you are using things like or Python
which I required compile your code in
the background even though your project
is a.net library then it's important to
let people know how to set up the
environment so they can work on your
code what are the dependencies out there
and there are a few cases that you find
that even though you can get a very nice
library and there are good instructions
you want contributing have no idea
what's missing there's a component
missing or some instructions they have
to go back and forth asking questions so
if you don't want to be if you want to
be a maintainer and make sure that
people don't really bother you with
things like how how do i set up the
environment because this is missing then
add those instructions again setting up
expectations I think it's quite
important be open to criticism again we
said putting code out there will
definitely make you a better developer
but you need to be open to criticism you
need to be open to feedback I am in some
cases you might have to develop a thick
skin because not all the criticism will
be rosy and nice and will say well I
think you could do this better sometimes
she will be quite harsh and
I tend to ignore them if you think that
people become really abusive than you
can always move away but in most cases
people tend to be quite good and they
will give you some feedback by saying I
think into this better by doing this or
I can he can improve your code by
cutting out there shooting because it's
a demon lines of code or is very hard to
maintain and so on and this how we learn
and I think it's a great opportunity to
become a maintainer of a project and
having people to come back with feedback
feedback orchid this is maybe I should
change the word from key decision to
feedback because I think it's a more
constructive and unfortunately we go to
the states now where we have to add
codes of contact it seems like it's
becoming in 10 now in the last couple of
years especially now how open source
becomes more popular and as more people
get involved you do you see that kind of
a hostile environments in certain cases
and I think the best way to protect the
people I work with you or for you or
contribute to your projects is by adding
a code of contact so I've never been in
the situation I had to apply this code
of contact and I've never been in a
situation where you know I a big project
that I was involved with had any issues
like that but it's been out there and we
all heard it so I think a code of
contact I thing is just for the
protection of everyone the project and
making sure that everyone is kind to
each other if they're not then we can
get kicked out based on those rules and
I think that have a couple more things
so a very important item in the list is
adding an explicit open source license
now a lot of people put code in the
public domain github or other publicly
post and they automatically assume that
this code is open source well it's a
short indefinitely because people can
see it but unless you attach the
specific license to it and companies I
want to take advantage of your code they
can't because you need to explicitly
give them rights to your code so by
missing that open source license we
which you can download for free or you
can get a copy everywhere like search
for MIT license then it means that these
people and these companies can you
you're open source project in a
meaningful manner without really
breathing any licenses or copyright
licenses so that's very important to
make sure that if you want people to use
your code especially in production and
then in pay for projects then so be it
add the license for it be very
supportive two new members I think as I
said I wouldn't be here were and I
wouldn't have gotten here unless Jeff
from the nigga team had accepted my
first pull request and he was very
supportive because I had no idea what I
was doing and then he came back with
some meaningful feedback to help me out
change slightly the contribution but he
didn't say oh that's really silly of you
you should be doing that or you should
be doing this and we've seen it I've
seen in the past where people be
aggressive to new members and there's
nothing worse than turning away a
brilliant developer just by being bottom
or a misbehaving so please please please
if you get involved neither side be
supportive new members because we all
head start from somewhere we've already
said included code of context but maybe
we need to emphasize that I suppose and
when things go wrong life changes we
change circumstances change you know we
get families and we have kids we have
responsibilities and we change job we
move across countries do to get a better
job we move across scientists to be with
family and so on and our life changes in
which case we don't have any time for
open source and especially maintainer do
fall into that trap the best thing you
can do is let people know and ask for
help if anybody wants to take over your
project you can show do it and hopefully
we'll have the same vision with you
because that's quite important
especially if you're working on a
popular project and and you know it's
used by a lot of people you don't want
if you are in the spirit of open source
you don't somebody else to come in and
start monetizing from that so if your
circumstances change find someone
there's the same ideals and the same
vision for your project as you and ask
them to take over and if you can't find
anyone then there's a nice tag out there
which says I think you can add a tag on
to github on your repo that actually
says not maintain
in which case people come into your
project will say and realize say the way
that you know even though they can use
this code it's not actively maintained
by anyone it's important you can always
say I'll come back in a couple of years
when I have time and as long as you let
people know then that's quite important
you don't want your project go stale
again it's not just for Christmas it's
for a lifetime so I think that almost
brings us into our time and I would like
to say thanks if you decide to get
involved and you feel that the talk
today was quite inspiring for you then
thank you very much for attending and i
hope i hope that we inspired a few
people to get involved the community and
get out there and put the code out there
and help us out and at this point i
think we can open the floor for
questions and i'll be happy to answer
perfect sounds good um Chris does
actually I think you explained
everything really well I don't think
nobody has any questions I know I don't
today was released fellow and Yemen
everybody else is once again this video
is online so in case you need to rewatch
it please just refresh the page and it's
a your own convenience and a big THANK
YOU against the Christos I know I had to
rush at the last couple minutes I really
appreciate actually doing the actual Oh
driving and speeding to the street to
get here nothing in legal a promise it
was all under the limit but just
slightly faster than usual it will be
better seat the better late than never
so yes so anybody if you have any
questions or any point please do feel
free to email me email me which I'll be
happy just like creepers know so if you
ever had some free time you be happy to
answer questions and yeah absolutely
i'll be here to answer any questions
from the community and feel free to pick
me up later on and thanks very much for
having me today it was a great honor and
hopefully will help a few people get
involved with helping shores definitely
i know i will actually it seemed a lot
more simpler than what I thought it's a
lot less time eating just add some
documentation into a public repo and
then that goes straight at the top of
your list and then
as your entry to a very good job look at
that then crystals awesome and I
appreciate all of it and to everyone
else have a kick ass day and till next
time cheers everybody thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
