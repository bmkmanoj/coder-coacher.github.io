background is basically computer science
or IT software engineering maybe some of
you know the positive agency to the
bathroom as well start to study because
I always liked like computers and stuff
but I never really liked programming but
sometimes I grew up with early computers
everybody in the family and friends
asked me to fix their stuff so I can
like get annoyed I thought ok computer
nice but we should somehow work on
usability and user experience so
everybody can is able to you know use
machines themselves that's why you'll
find a lot of user experience
suggestions in my presentation not long
ago I think like two months ago I joined
up here and I will talk about basically
all we have planned to update on you
android app that's coming out I think
you may be the next two weeks in
parallel with ios7 today's short outline
personal start to that show what we do
at appeal and then how we planned the
clinic line application what are our
main goals what are our UX principles
then I'll show you our old touch talk
about some touch interactions that I
found on the Google homepage that are
quite useful if you design for mobile
devices and then I have a comparison of
our old flow comparison to a new flow
because we found out that people just
wouldn't find the nice features that we
offer on our app and then in the end
I'll basically show what the outcome was
off the way we planned on um okay so
this is the key text of up here we're
basically a online radio music company
so much like like radio you can select
from multiple stations and you have the
ability to filter stuff biped wrong like
rock
and since many people cannot decide on
which younger they want to listen to all
they then a different mood they also
want to use the service to discover
music we also offer a way to to look for
music by mood so you can say I'm unhappy
right now and I want to listen to happy
music for something yeah we basically
were founded in 2008 in in Berlin and we
have a team of I think 110 music experts
that are sitting there every day and
build new or music station to update the
existing ones so it's kind of like
professional way if you want to broaden
your horizon of music because we
probably all always know that the top
chart it hits and with the top singles
from Phil Evans but there's also much
more sub to discover so it's nice to
have experts and in I think was in April
we were bought by Panasonic other models
from North America that's why big focus
is also on in Kyle usage of our app ok
this is how we started we basically
start with a simple website where you
could choose your music and we later
like reef activate to html5 to be more
compliant with current technologies you
can basically see the player year and to
customize the station that you listen to
you can either laughs attract then it
will be saved and those artists will be
paid more often or if you don't like it
you can you can ban a track and then if
you been like one artist five times then
we never bother you again with that
artist and just play other stuff yeah if
you want you can share with your friends
obviously and buy the stuff so yeah this
one we started we had these buttons here
I don't know I assume nobody will
initially understand what those buttons
mean it's why we also
had to change our new design and after
building the website we thought okay now
we have those nice internet-capable
radios like soon as player on cue in the
house and people don't want to run the
computer all the time so why not support
those devices and what credible on our
way of those smart TVs as well as I said
when I owned by Panasonic automotive so
we have contacts so quite some companies
and if you sometimes read driving our
cars you might have already discovered
our app you can connect it to the BMW's
or the mini stand out there browser in
the mercedes and you can also find us on
pioneer radios that are used in car and
we also serve all major mobile operating
systems iOS android of course was 17 as
we talked about earlier not that many
people obviously so we can like you know
don't take much care of it we serve yeah
phones and tablets but you will see
later that basically the tablets or the
new high-end devices with
high-resolution basically brought
product problems to our existing app
because it didn't have responsive design
so now when you open the current app you
if things if you have next and Samsung
as for today's and a tablet and it will
show you the tablet UI which is not
working very well and small device with
a high resolution that's when we
actually start to think about coming up
with a new app okay here's like the main
the primary goals that we had in mind
when we plant them we needed a flexible
architecture so we could extend it very
easily because there's like so many more
features and things we want to offer in
the future so we have to keep that in
mind and obviously you always want to
save developers costs it's another
problem that
you have to face although yes someone
said advanced html5 workshop next week
I'm a big fan of html5 and I like my
private time I tried to develop html5
web site that you could include in iOS
and Android apps by just using the web
the web viewer for you use of framework
like like my colleague just introduced
so that's kind of nice idea but right
now we know that thanks book try that
the performance didn't work out very
well I believe in the future that should
work very fun I mean we try to climb
like to consolidate our apps but there's
still different design flows in iOS and
Android so you really have to take that
into account and you cannot develop one
thing and then just put it out on
multiple platforms yeah we obviously
have so many things to cancel we want to
pace up the development and we have like
a core set of features and the next of
your next clients will have even more
feature that will come out next year at
the beginning of next year so we have to
plan that still the work the current
stuff works and also the next stop will
be integrated very easily and for new
content that we will probably on
reversal and since Panasonic is like a
pickup that's not only selling their
products under their personal name
that's also very often branded so we
also take that into account that you
could exchange the existing UI by just
replacing certain elements with the one
of a branded we're going to sell it
under so before we started to deplane we
also look into our statistics and then
we saw okay android a gingerbread this
like below two percent market share so
we decided oh we were actually quite
happy that we could drop support because
it's not a significant amount of people
writing
it's always the problem developers
talking about because when you see to
the right at the right column you see
that in general among music apps it's
still 20 per five percent so that would
be if we had such high numbers we would
still support gingerbread but gives you
a lot of restrictions and you want to
try to avoid that so here we come to our
design and Jack's principles I mean the
the first rock scene was don't reinvent
the wheel it you just don't have a
benefit from it and so we really looked
into what the big providers like Google
or Apple offered as UI patterns and we
wanted to reuse like as much as we could
to yet to save time and also to enable
people to use the app very intuitively
yeah and another puppet was just reuse
the design assets that you get from
those companies if you download the SDK
it already comes with so many great
graphic said at the end we came up with
I think we counted it was like only 10
graphics we needed to get through the
designer to change to fit our brand yeah
what one point was also to simplify the
app because the current one is quite
cluttered and you have so many things
that keep the focus away from you and
since we will add a lot of new features
we need to find a way to extend the UI
in a way that we could easily attendant
that it doesn't feel bolted on and as I
said earlier we don't only produce our
own air but there's also it's also used
for vinyl series and odm bmv so we need
to enable them to come like we produce
the app for their customers by
exchanging some graphics and by reusing
a existing tool that we offer to them
mmm maybe if you develop an app you
should think of it as a canvas that you
can easily repaint once it's necessary
and I mean this only a small amount of
information or you I lamented you have
to change to like promote your your
brand so here we come to the touch
interactions that you can find on the
Google picture nice thing here there's a
link down there you should just stick to
them so you deliver a great user
experience to your customers one that I
really like this use color elimination
to give feedback for your users because
very often you know we press something
and we're asking ourselves did it work
it and really pressed it you have to
press it again you know usually it slows
down the app so if you can feed back the
person knows that something is happening
that the action actually took place so
it's like very important Tyson
especially sometimes you think apples
change it now with iOS 7 you cannot
really distinguish buttons anymore it's
just all one flat thing it's kind of
hard for the user to you know estimate
it ok i can press this area so the next
one is you always want to give the users
or put them in a position windows what
state I'm in because usually with
context-sensitive interfaces where I
have to clearly distinguish between
which actions are possible which are
disabled and what can I do basically and
then there's they also gave like a rule
of thumb and how big you should design
your elements so that people can
actually touch it very easy with
different thump Titus so they are just
as you
use 48 DP Scion like elements it will
translate into like almost one
centimeter and that's easily to touch
for different people this is also very
important for us because our apps are
used in the car and in the career of a
lot of restrictions right you have to
focus on the street you shouldn't focus
on how can I touch on little little
buttons that you can hardly touch it's
really one of the most important things
was and they also suggest that between
elements you should have at least eight
DB difference so you don't accidentally
touch on the different element maybe you
could dislike something we going you
mean right now hear this pair they're
definitely there's another button in
between but that would be something that
you wouldn't we try to avoid and someone
tries to like a song but unintentionally
that touches the band button and then we
might not be able to revert it Red Lodge
is actually implemented like this if you
press one button then you cannot revert
your choice at least not in the player
so that's kind of like a bad idea so we
will change them in there's the list if
you can let go up here into your account
and then you can see the whole list of
songs you've band and songs you love but
at that moment of time right now you
cannot switch it so it's kind of bad
idea and so now we come to the current
flow as I said we have stations and to
choose the radio station you first
select the genre which would be this
button here and there are those little
grayish overlays you can turn them off
and on but I mean you don't have to
implement such great helpers if the year
is clear that basically shows that this
is just a workaround to
to fix the Lots optimal current design
so the flow with the choosers Allah
first so you should go with for example
withdraw and then it would immediately
start playing best of rock but most
people don't you listen to the best of
rock they have like more specific which
so then they would actually have to
understand that they have to click this
strange round circle to really find
their they music taste to like more like
a sub-genre like alternative rock so
that didn't work too well in the past so
we thought okay how can we improve that
flow and then we came up with this this
the better the screen design for a nexus
4 which is actually kind of interesting
because I have that the Galaxy Nexus
which has the screen resolution of 1280
x 720 p and the UI looks very good on
this but if you have the nexus 4 which
has just 48 pics listen with more their
map is rendered as a tablet app and
doesn't work so when whether it was
designed the way was thinking of that
high resolution is now we have the
problem that we have to change the UI to
be more responsive so that doesn't
happen again and this is actually one of
the reasons why we split the development
of the app in two parts because it would
have taken too long to develop the whole
app from scratch to like and right now
the app contains all SDK so it supports
android 2.3 4.0 4.1 4.2 but that's like
a huge APK package as you have to
download you don't want to do that to
the user so now Google supports two are
not separate SDKs so now you can slim
down the app by just separating it by
SDK version and to increase our
development Speedway I mean actually the
developers also outsource to a different
company so we told them okay we have
this bucket with high-resolution park so
why don't you take the UI first because
that's what users
right that's the main issue if the UI is
bad then you have better user experience
and people don't want to use your app I
mean in the end we will also have to
refactor the other line cut the back end
basically because perform a scan of the
font l will depend on that so there will
be the next step but right now we're
focusing only on the UI level and should
be done I think in the next two weeks so
this the new design and you can we have
this basically this tabs up here when
you can choose from you can choose
you're wrong or you can choose your mood
and if you click for example where's the
same floor you click on rock then you
will get to this screen where you can
select your if you have further photos
by suffering decade or different other
suggestions our music experts life maybe
etcetera actually this is an old design
because we've already figured out what
happened to people that just want to
listen to bet on rock it's not still not
possible right now right person the
design did think of it but then when we
fell about it was like that's another
thing because people still want to
listen to desktop wrong so now we have
another item on top which days messed up
rock but the idea is pretty clear is
just look into the database fetch a list
of elements and then just just
displaying analysis generating list is
very simple right and it scales very
well so now the flow is Pete goes wrong
the pic the sap xong for example or say
you want to hit the sack wrong and then
you can collapse a list of supplements
and then you would actually start
playing very simple very intuitive you
don't have to think of where you have to
go what's the other button what does it
mean just click click click first simple
straightforward and as I said earlier we
try to speed up the whole process that's
why we used like I say ninety percent of
stock Android
elements that come with sdk so we will
just think about these little tiles for
the roundest then we gave them for
example to the developer end and say
okay why don't you come up with some
creative way to design Zhang icons so
this is basically our existing logo then
we designed with a couple of colors and
Ruby come even simpler just so people
don't get confused this was one of the
elements that we gave her and this is
the now playing screen so I marked all
the elements that needed to be
redesigned because they're not part of
the SDK we up here we have a slit
already I came because what we offers
radio stations so now it actually won't
be this this tower it will be more like
a small radio and yeah we will probably
change the heart and the band I can to
have something more prettier maybe even
a flat better thing because everything
we used to have gradients and 3d
animations and we're like okay look at
iOS as well they flatten everything
simplified everything so we want to do
the same for Android as well and since
we are offering radio stations our
licenses are limited so it's not like
Spotify where you can say I want to
listen to this specific song and you
rather say or listen to the station or i
can say i want to listen to this artist
and related artists and so if you could
skip unlimitedly and you probably would
somehow could you go somewhere get to
the point where you actually find the
specific artisan specific song so we
have to avoid this and that's why we
thought okay it'd be nice if the person
knows how many skips they have do I have
left right now it's like six skips over
an hour it would be Netflix another you
express it right show the user what's
possible what can you do in what's left
so that's why we added this label
okay that's it for me if you want to
make well if you want to listen to our
songs you can go to appear calm you
don't have to sign up you can just
choose the grounder hit play or just go
to facebook.com I think my liquor in
from marketing will probably publish
informations about our new upcoming appt
as I said should be within the next two
weeks maybe even earlier if you wanted
to be a bit of beta tester and you can
sign up and provide valuable feedback on
what we can improve yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
