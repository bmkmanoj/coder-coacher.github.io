alright this is an educational
interactive application and I really
like the idea of using their blended
reality so that you have a real
interface so I created these shapes that
represent molecules this is to teach
about molecular reaction and this could
be used in a classroom or a museum and
what's the module that I finished is
showing the idea of collision theory
when two molecules collide and there's a
reaction and the effect of orientation
that depending on the angle that a
molecule hits another angle and which
atoms collide there is a reaction or not
a reaction and in this program if you
hit the two molecules the physical
objects that I created in the correct
angle it turns into the new molecule
reaction so okay and in the future I
would like to have more animation so
that the screen the vertical screen
would have the molecules actually
turning into the new molecule and have a
nice animation right now it's just a
still image of the new molecule and have
nicer graphics projected onto the mat as
well oh I have more time I've talked
really fast okay yeah and this I think
using your hands to move molecules
around will make it easier to comprehend
the idea of molecules instead of just
watching demonstrations with your eyes
actually moving them will make it easier
for people to memorize the angles and
the whole concept of the effect of
orientation other applications are also
the 3d orientation of molecules and the
way that Adams connect to each other in
a 3d orientation i'm using the depth
sense of the camera as well
this is a educational program that
teaches the concept of collision theory
and the effects of orientation and I
created these objects that represent
molecules the this is the interface you
move these objects around and you try to
make them collide and turn into another
molecule and the way that it should go
is is in this orientation for it to
create a new molecule okay so I'm going
to start it and it's going to scan the
object so it'll take a minute or two
okay okay so that's the these are the
objects and their scanned and they're
being represented on the screen and I
can hit them in ways they don't enter
intersect but if I hit them just the
right way it turns into another molecule</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
