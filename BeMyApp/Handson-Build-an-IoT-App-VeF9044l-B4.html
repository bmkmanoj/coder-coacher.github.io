this is Jessica from be my app and here
we also have Naja from IBM glad that you
are able to join us for this hands-on
IOT webinar so before we start I just
want to make sure that every one of you
have registered for the bluemix so if
you have not registered I have the link
on this slide that you can open while
waiting for the others to come in so
today just a brief detail me Raja will
be showing us how to build an IOT app
using the bluemix node-red and also the
simulated sensor so make sure you have
that bluemix with you and if you have
any question at all please post your
question at the comment section below
and at the end of the presentation we'll
be addressing them and ready we'll be
answering them live so without further
ado I will switch the screen near the
screen thanks Jessica we weren't
actually able to see the screen that you
were talking about earlier so is there
any way you could just put that on for a
bit all right then the bluemix screen
it's not the blooming screen the one was
the link and you know like your
introduction screen yeah here it is can
you see it
oh I have a necklace share my screen so
sorry okay can you see it now
yep that's the link I'll wait for a
couple of minutes so and hi everyone
near here so Jessica's put up a link
that says register for bluemix and that
particular link so I wait for a couple
of minutes for people to join and
register and then we'll start
alright then let's get started
I'll just share my screen right now and
Jessica let me know if you're not able
to see the screen
alright so hi again everyone my name is
near Jagannatha and I'm a developer
advocate for the IBM's digital business
group and here's my trehalose so if you
want to hear me rant more about
cognitive variety or anything related
just following on that so uh thanks for
joining today we're going to be doing
this little workshop of 101 a hands-on
workshop and basically how to get
started using Internet of Things use the
bluemix platform and bluemix is a cloud
platform platform as a service so we'll
be using that platform along with a
simulated device or assimilated sensor
use node-red as a tool and then we will
try to create something using IOT and
once we create a we'll try to measure
that data because all the data that you
have is basic
pretty meaningless as long as you know
you give some sort of meaning to it so
let's get started so if you were able to
log in to bluemix after you register for
it
you should be able to see a screen like
this and if you have any questions
please post it in the comment section
below
of the chat so this is a screen is going
to look you're going to see a section
that says create apps something at the
bottom that says create a service and
you're going to see how much of space is
remaining in your service and your ad
section so uh I have about 80 services
remaining but generally when you join
three tier of bluemix you probably see
about 10 to 20 services and you see
about 4gb to a GB excuse me so 4 GB to a
GB of space that's available the whole
thing runs on flat foundry and was
drawing on the diego architecture and
you'll also be able to see the number of
days that are remaining on the job and a
few other things that you should be able
to notice is the region so the regional
which we'll be deploying our apps is
us-south simply because that's where we
are right now or more like we're in the
US so that future will deploy everything
the fastest we also have this Sydney and
the UK region and it also has the
facility to let you create multiple
spaces so think of each space as the
collection of apps and services that get
together to do something so you want to
segregate it in such a way that it makes
more meaning to have them out put
together or separated together or
separated and you can also give control
to somebody else to a certain space
within your organization just to make
sure that you know the remaining apps
are shielded away from somebody else's
view and you can be part of multiple
accounts I have a few cars in my system
and you have multiple organizations so I
have an app that's already running out
here so
if you guys are ready let's get started
by creating an IOT foundation app so
we're going to click on the catalog
button that is there to the top so this
catalog button is going to open you to a
bunch of applications our budgets API
services that's basically offered to you
as a marketplace from bluemix and you
can use all of them to be creating your
apps as many as your space lets you do
so if we go to the boilerplate section
to the left of the pane under apps
there's something known as boiler plates
so we click on that and this will open
you to a few applications about 15 to 17
of them these are our templates that
have already been created so think of it
as starting from you know like more than
a ground zero so we'll be clicking on
Internet of Things platform startup so
when you click on that it will open to a
page where you can create an application
for this instance and you can enter a
name for the application as you want and
just make sure that is unique because
the same way that you cannot have two
Google cars you won't be able to have to
move the same map names so I'm just
gonna call this ninja the vance's and
I'll sure you see that the default
domain is my bluemix.net but there are
also multiple other domains available
you can add them toward I've added a few
other domains as well and if you scroll
down you see that this boilerplate comes
with three services already added to it
one if it is in node.js runtime the
other is the Cloudant database and third
is your internal things platform starter
so as you see out here these three
components come together to make an
application and you want your default
plans to be selected for both no js' so
things and for Cloudant there are lots
of other options available but will let
everything be default right now and
there's also a pricing plan mentioned at
the bottom but you don't have to worry
about it right now since you only a 30
day free trial and you can just click on
create so I'll click on I'll create
right now is basically basically go to
have your application staged and it's on
the process so the verge of being
created and a few things that you'll
notice is that there are a lot of
documentation on how to get down with
Watson IOT with no tread and a hardy are
simulated device to it so we will be
doing all of these things so you can
totally read about it free time and you
see that it says applications will
create Rob dated but while we waiting
for it to be created so if we go back to
the dashboard page you see that a lot of
applications been added so this is not
running yet cuz it's closed station and
it also shows you how much of Emery is
being occupied in that process and what
are the different devices and what are
the different services that are being
added we have two services we had the
note 3 the node.js runtime here to
Cloudant databases and you know to the
to the internet-of-things platform so
while we wait for that one to get
created let me just show you what it's
like what will happen well it on monthly
would be started so this is the page
that would open when you were to click
on the URL and you see this huge button
out here that says go to your node read
flow editor you can also notice that out
here it says learn how to password
protect your instance right so clicking
or learning how to password protect your
instance will basically attach this
username and password to the URL so not
everyone's gonna have access to it the
other things that you can do is probably
make it only read-only
so you can share the URL and you know
people can only see what to do that as
opposed to making changes on ER so we
are
by clicking this one that says go to
your older flow editor and by default it
should open to a page like this so I'm
going to wait for another few seconds
when everybody gets up to speed up to
this part so just to quickly recap what
we did right now was an absorbance
dashboard page we clicked on catalog
went to the boiler plates clicks on its
net of things platform starter entered
your name i'm Tilikum create and that is
pretty much it doing that alone after
the application gets started
she basically opened to a dashboard like
this so the dashboard when you open it
you already see this floor that's
already been created for you
so two different things to the floor one
of it being sending data to the platform
the blue one being the device and out
here you're receiving data from the
platform so if we look to the pane on
the left all these nodes that we have so
each of these rectangular components are
known as nodes because they perform some
function we also have Commons nodes
which you can add and drag and drop just
add comments you know so the flow
becomes more self-explanatory so we have
a few input nodes then output nodes lots
of function nodes function nodes being
there are certain functions nodes but
you can supply some kind of an input
turn it into an HTML and get an output a
supply and return to CSV get it onto an
output so each of these nodes have
already has already been defined to do
something for you so you don't have to
write the code for it all over yourself
all over again so it's worth it is file
some time to already
and understand what loans are available
so you have the range you have split
that you can join some data together
sequence of Lazarus Excel all nodes a
function load right then we have social
media nodes the meaning that you can
send and receive data both to and from
email and Ferrari and the storage node
out here it basically shows you how to
sell data into your cloud database or
into your Mahadevi or get data from
MongoDB get data from Cloudant or even
from HDFS filesystem and below that we
have a lot of Watson nodes being
sentiment analysis then there's after
IBM acquired weather company we have the
weather cells not to be able to find out
what the weather was like then we have a
lot of Watson IOT knows virtual devices
and in the catalog page if we go through
beside boiler plates there are a few
other Watson notes all of those Watson
api's are available as nodes out here
which means a few would have seen a
conversation API available in the
catalog page you also have a
conversation around here or if you saw
text-to-speech API on that page you have
a text-to-speech around here meaning you
can basically sandara's text and receive
it a speech and all these nodes are
pretty useful when you can interconnect
there laughter getting data from the
device or you can send speech data to
the device or after you get data from
the device you can perform some search
for computational and sends a message
back to the device so this is how your
default flow is going to look you have
all of these notes so what we are going
to do right now is basically open a new
browser tab open with simulated device
and once you open that simulated device
we'll be getting data from there
laughter you get data from there or the
mac ID we're going to be plugging that
mac ID out here onto this flow and then
we're going to see her executed further
so now that we have this workflow for us
set up our next step is to basically
open the simulator device so mostly the
new browser tab and this is the URL that
I'm entering to basically open a device
so let me just paste it maybe on Google
Docs or something so you guys can see it
so it's called IBM dot biz /i ot Sam so
easy to remember so once you copy that
and paste it in your browser let me do
it right now by minimizing screen it
should open through see your device that
looks like this right so you see a lakh
address on top and it will be different
for each person the only thing you
remember is when you close the browser
right now you basically lost the device
so if you want a new device you need to
restart again and you'll be getting a
new MAC address throughout the course of
executing this workshop I would
recommend basically not cross closing
your browser at all because if you do
you just gonna have to copy and paste
the MAC address again so we can let it
live on a different part of your browser
screen and you see a device that opens
up which basically says 15 degrees
temperature a couple of other things
that it does measure as the object
temperature and humidity so you can
navigate through all of those three
panes back little the arrow out here so
you have objects I'm too sure
temperature and humidity and you can
also play around with the value setters
as you selling dinner from this device
to the front end which is not node-red
let's say if you want to show
fluctuating value
you can increase the arrow out here and
basically increase and decrease these
values and play around with it so as Mun
you increase that it will send the value
that you can't see seeing on the screen
so is everybody good up to this part
alright so I'm going to assume that you
are just to recap what I did after we
opened IOT foundation Starro open new
browser tab and paste this link to open
a simulated device do I'll close it
right alright so the next thing that
we're going to do now is just plug this
MAC address into the device so I'm going
to copy this and we're looking at the
flow
the bottom out here so double click on
the blue no that says IBM IOT happened
and there's gotta be one tab that says
one text field that says device ID with
an example of how supposed to look so
just based up there don't worry about
the case sensitivity uh let be exactly
the way it is and you're not putting any
spaces or commas in between and you see
the goth education is automatically been
set to quick start so think of it as a
way where you say that you quickly
getting data from a simulated device so
it's just car QuickStart then you have
an input type known as device event and
you have a device ID like this now while
you bring in your own device so these
devices that you see on IOT foundation
with this simulated one is something
that's already been set so uh when you
bring in your own device like an Italian
or a Raspberry Pi you basically should
be able to add the device ID and make
the device re part of your foundational
instance so that device ID can also be a
QuickStart so uh after we finish this
workflow I'll walk you through how what
the process is like to add your own
device so you basically received a
device ID now you name this if you want
so each of these knows L to do so I'm
gonna call it's related I see it click
on done and okay so I'm going to put
this device basically in the background
and not the lead of it or closing it I'm
just explaining my screen here and to
the right there's also a debug pane so
the shortcut for that would basically be
either command and space or ctrl + space
depending on whether you using a Windows
or Mac and it has two tabs out here
called info and the debug tab excuse me
so the info tab basically shows
information on each of these nodes for
the ones that you click so right now
showing you information for IBL IOT in
node so if you are a power on earth like
any other know the end
will change economy information will
have things like how do you send data to
the node how do you get data from the
node useful things as one you have come
across in your notes and you also have
the debug tab the debug tab is who shows
you the output think of it as a console
well no so after we've pasted the device
ID click on deploy and remember that for
each change that you make you have to
deploy it else the screen will not
record that change has been made so this
is what you see so you're automatically
getting data from your simulated device
now it says 24 other cells temperature
24 little safe limits and you're also
seeing adjacent data what's the topic
the device ID the device type etc so
both of these outputs alternating
outputs are coming from the debug tab
the debug tab being the green tab so if
you click on that CPU status it says
output is message dot payload and then
if you were to click on device terror
you see the complete master job check
the complete message archive being this
JSON if you do not want to see it you
can either disconnected or simply turn
off the display once you turn off the
display there's a garbage can button on
the top right to basically get rid of
all of the messages that you saw before
so you got rid of the JSON later this
place and now you're only singing this
message now let me increase this
temperature let's say let me crank it up
to 41 all right so our 44
so now that I've cranked it up to 44
establish a file false critical so how
do I switch from safe limits to critical
read the logic flow for that was written
out here in between see basically taking
data from the device you're saying
message knock pillow
la-dee-da temp take that data pass it
through a threshold and you're basically
saying if it's less than or equal to 40
you want to follow this path on top and
if it's greater than 40 you want to
follow the path at the bottom so the
path of the bottom says temperature is
critical
the path on top says the temperature
sole-source
within safe limits and both of these
outputs are directed to the console
which is the debug tab and that's how
you see it on the screen out here so so
this is a great way to basically get
data from the simulated device and if it
were an actual device you would see
pretty much the same thing what are the
other things that you can do with this
right now only if you remember I showed
you that there was a social media tile
where you have the Twitter node and the
email so the first thing that we're
going to do is basically try to get this
data and display it on Twitter so I drag
and drop the tote and what I'm trying to
say out here I'm sure there are better
examples of actually selling there Roger
twirl but what we're going to do is
basically send these two messengers
there is safe and danger of Twitter and
say that you know whenever your
temperature is safe or dangerous just
Twitter for what it's worth right now
have you connected to your Twitter
account so after you drag and drop the
note just double click the note and it
says here's youtuber ID all right so
what you're doing with each variety is
basically you want to add new Twitter
credentials click on that one silicon
and it says out here click here at Santa
case forum so when you click on that the
Twitter called us already opened the
background is the one that I gently put
stuff excuse me
so if you do not wanted to pick up the
default account then just log out of
that account and then the screen will
let you arise with the new logins so you
click on authorize app closest window
and then once you return back to the
screen you see that the field is
automatically populated so much for a
handle so one click on ADD and there it
is so I'm just saying tweet temperature
from
simulated device right and click on done
and like I said after every note that
you add or delete is essential that you
press the deploy button in the top right
so I'm gonna flick him to fly and I'm
gonna play around with my temperature a
little bit dropping it a fattie then he
want to drop it at 35 right so now let's
open what Twitter account and Seifert
was actually pasted out here there does
so I see three Twitter messages would
say temperature at 35 wouldn't say
flemeth's temperature party within safe
limits and temperature party for being
critical so this is how easy it is to
basically authenticate your app to
access Twitter follow straight out there
so if we switch back to this node right
now since Twitter's got this little
condition that he cannot put in
duplicate messages noted also gives you
an arrow that says forwarding message
and it says status is duplicate so for
now I'm just going to delete that will
denote since we've already seen what to
do with it
and I'm redeploying the app without any
Twitter or credentials on it so that was
fun right so it's a good way to let
people know that you're in a room that's
safe or dangerous the next thing we're
gonna do is drag and drop the email node
now it's also easier out of all of these
details of seven via email excuse me
now let's think of a scenario where
email would be useful right so assume
that you're in the manufacturing plant I
mean the manufacturing plant is kind of
heating up so you want the administrator
of this plant based will receive an
email as when the temperature is
dangerous so we can set we can drag the
email or out here connected up to let's
say the danger message and now we just
go try and sell an email so I'm going to
send an email to my email address and
it's automatically connect to the Gmail
server but we can change it so or
anything that you want to send email
arrows along with the port number and
my user ID which is my login credentials
click on done and then click on the Play
right so now we trying to send data to
email so if I were to open my email
account all right let's see what's
happening here all right so this will
get triggered only if the temperature is
dangerous right because we've connected
only the danger note to it the
temperature 35 is not dangerous anything
about 40 years so I'm just gonna crank
it up to let's say 8:45 like I see sell
selling an email so if I want to go back
to my email account and refresh right
there does a received a lot of messages
from node-red right now which say that
you know message from NORAD Township 45
is critical so I would think this is a
good way to let Madeline know that you
know the temperature is going out of
control so you're reducing that lag by
basically avoiding her to have somebody
else contact the admin the node-red flow
itself is taken care of for so just to
recap what we did so far we created base
via node-red flow with the
internet-of-things foundation connect it
up to a simulated cell so got arrow from
the sensor we've both tweeted it Alvie
basically sent an email with that same
message to it that's pretty awesome I
think so what we're gonna do next is
basically store all of this data right
so storing this data now if you remember
we basically already connected to a
cloud node so we will drag and drop the
cloud run or out here and we'll try to
store this data I'm saddle database so
it's useful for future reference and for
those of you who just joined or join a
little late or please post your
questions in the comment section below
and I'll get the word after we get done
with cellular
at this level are all right so we've
already played around with the
temperature data what we're going to do
now is basically try and put in the
humidity data so first thing we're going
to do is format the data the way we
wanted to some will drag down drop down
the storage node drag and drop the cloud
load and after you click on cloud and
look at the info tab so the info table
out here basically says you can insert
message lot payload which means the data
that's going into this database has to
be of the pod master lock payload right
so larger format of the way we want it
to be I'm gonna drag and drop a function
note animal can
functional to the device and I'm going
to connect that function or on the other
end to the database so I will open the
console of the database and take a look
at that before that let's just see how
to basically put data here or far out of
the way we wanted to so what I'm doing
right now is basically getting data up
I'm taking the timestamp data and the
humidity data and then I'm going to be
selling that to the database
so I will leave the screen as it is
while I explain what I've done out here
so we're going to be sending both the
humidity and the time to sounds right so
so basically getting date hours
milliseconds and formatting them went to
the way I wanted to look that is from
your date object and we'll be getting
that form at a time stored in the
variable and I'm creating another
variable called message dot payload cuz
the clearly said the data needs to be
sent as a payload and I'm placing that
out here and the name of the R or the
name of the column make you think of a
database you need to have both the
column name writes the column name out
here as time and when you got lesser dot
payload d dot humidity which is coming
from this device you want to store it as
humidity and after you've got both these
values you want to save return message
someone say cats data from every camera
table but we do one thing I'll just copy
this code and basically placed it in the
chat window so it might be easier
failure to appear as well so pasted in
the chat window so hopefully that's
visible all right it's not
space turd later after we're done so now
that we've received the humidity and we
formatted it the way we wanted to we've
connected it to the cloud of note and
when you click on that note double-click
on that note we basically want to
connect it to the cloud on to service
and if you see out here it says it's
automatically populated what's this
service that's connected to the app who
says service you know like many IOT
cloud and no sequel you can also connect
it to a different or an external
database but you can external excuse me
when you click an external it basically
lets you add new Cloudant credentials
and in my case I already have it
connected up through bluemix so i'm
going to leave it that way
and for database so if the database does
not exist that is if a table name does
not exist let's just create one let's
call this time humidity right and we try
to insert data so we will say in ok so
the database name was something that I
made up right now so this data is going
to go to that table right click on done
and do you want to click on deploy so
that is pretty much it so you're
basically getting the time stamp later
are you getting the humidity and you're
inserting it and let's just go and play
around with the humidity to increase the
values a little bit so you see some sort
of fluctuation one goes and sits on the
database increase data 81 let's hope
that 83 goes and sits in it except then
I let's drop it down again - let's say
73 right so what we're gonna do now is
basically open the database and see this
data has actually sat there so I'm going
back to my club madwoman's dashboard and
opening the database of the same name
the one that we connected to
and you want to click on a lunch so
clicking or launch out here basically
opens your database right now and I'm
also going to actually stop selling data
now to the database because we seem to
have had about 30 or new rows of data or
37 so as you see out here the name that
I entered for creating the database time
humanity is automatically populated out
here has about 37 documents right all
right so what
so if you click on time humidity right
now it opens to show you a bunch of
documents that look like this and how do
you see the timestamp on the humidity
that's inserted onto this check the
button on top and click on include Doc's
so when you click on include talks you
basically see time and you see the
humidity and similarly for each document
you will see the timestamp and the
humidity so with an increasing timestamp
we've had varied values of humidity
right so we have about 37 documents as
37 rows worth of data so our next step
is to basically analyze all of this so
we've completed the task of taking data
from a device and storing it into a
database along with the timestamp so in
order to analyze it our next step was to
basically create a warehouse out of it
and use some sort of an analytics tool
in it so if you look at the cloud and
database to the left pane there's a
button that says analytics so I'm gonna
click on analytics and it's going to let
you create a warehouse so click on
create a warehouse and what you see out
here is that for creating a warehouse
and finalizing data there are two types
of databases that are used both - DV and
db2 and we're going to be sticking to
dashdb which is the first one and in
order to use that you basically need to
login with your bluemix credentials
again so these are the credentials that
you used while creating a blue box
account and click on authenticate in
bluemix
and after you authenticate with bluemix
you know that because it lets you see
the name you want you want to enter a
name for the warehouse so I'm going to
call the warehouse name also stand
humidity and the data sources being the
database which contains out the
documents right so if you start with the
first few characters it should
autocomplete for you so I'm choosing the
second one time humidity and only for
autocompletes can you be sure that the
database exists if flora just tell you
to wash his spelling log out log and etc
I'll try it on a different browser
window and there's an option out here at
the bottom that says create a new dashdb
instance now we don't already have
pre-existing dashdb instance this cuz we
didn't create it so let's go with the
option that says creating your dashdb
instance and click on create warehouse
so creating a warehouse out here is
basically going to import data or export
data from Cloudant into dashdb so after
it creates the warehouse it says my
house has been provisioned and you see
the screen that opens with a link out
here that says open and dashdb so click
on that and that'll basically open to a
new page containing data from dashdb so
there it is so there's a quick
run-through tour so you want to click on
tables again it tells you how to
navigate through tables like any other
database it lets you run SQL queries as
well and what you're going to see out
here is there's gonna be a schema name
that's already populated for you so
don't change the schema name and tools
right there's a drop-down menu that lets
you choose the table names so click the
drop-down menu and choose the name of
the table which is the same as the table
name that he saw in Cloudant so
basically the data has been populated on
same exact table so if you were to go to
browse data you see that your humidity
and your tile are based filtering out
your along with lots of other fields but
you definitely have these two as well
right so it says 37 rows total the way
you wanted it you can browse through
them now what we're going to do is try
and create a charge with this humidity
and your timestamp data given that you
have everything in the row column format
and note that all this data was imported
from Cloudant we did not have to do any
sort of manual importing so - TV also
has a few other options like you can
define a filter to basically restrict
the amount of data that's being seen
you can configure columns that you want
to include in the view or hide in the
view there's a refresh button out here
which you can use if you have more data
coming in and the second-to-last button
out here is basically the export CSV
button so you want to click on that
button and just click on ok and allow
the pop-up block meet again so there is
so the CSV file gets downloaded so what
we've seen is haruka data from a device
stored in a database and download all of
that as a CSV so we can use this CSV for
analytics so if I were to open that CSV
right now it opens as a comma separated
value of course like in rename it now
save it on my desktop let's say
and click on the save right so if you
have Excel as the tool of your choice
and if you were like double click on the
CSV it should open up as an excel file
which will automatically let you do
everything else you want to do with it
so what I'm going to do now is basically
analyze this using Watson analytics so
I'm opening a new browser tab looking
for Watson analytics IBM and it'll open
to the first page out here wasn't
analytics then I'm going to open the
product but I have
but where was that all right there Alice
so this is how you Watson analytics
screen offers to look so I'm gonna click
on add new data and adding new data will
let me import it on various different
formats see our data from box you can
get or SugarCRM from Survey Monkey
Twitter from the Cognos reports or bi
servers onedrive PayPal and Braintree
data Eventbrite so uh this tool
basically tries to give you various
options where you can get data from
possible annular if scenarios and then
analyze it
so I'm going to import a local file
basically that's my CSV so I click on
local file click on browse and
but what do I save this data at yeah
well let me just read all over I think I
lost it my desk so I'll put on Browns
hmm all right I guess it doesn't matter
I have another CSV anyways so I have a
CSV file that I've uploaded click on
import and after you import the data you
see that it tries to calculate the
quality of the data how clean this so
the sample data out here says 75% so
let's see what this data says meanwhile
another way I realized it was basically
before also an excel file or spreadsheet
file so I uploaded the data I got
payload humidity payload time I was able
to plot a graph with it to show how your
data is fluctuating and with this data
losses are very few rows of terah's has
only funny 4% quality the more this
Apple said you get the better is so when
you click on that what you see is an
automatically tries to ask you questions
right search or adharma he tries to
understand what the data has so says
what is the child of payload humidity /
ID or one of the breakdown of payload
humidity back payload time the next
question that you can ask is what is
average of payload
he would is he in case you want to try
to find out what is the summary of it
right in case you want to try to find
out the average of the total Sun check
this out so it automatically says that
my average is eighty two point one even
though I don't have to do any kind of
math to it uh so this is how Watson
analytics works there are math least
tries to guess the kind of relations
that you would want to form of the data
that you have now if you want to plot a
graph of our temperatures change in
versus time what you could do is what is
the breakdown let's try to like plot a
graph with a line chart and you want to
set the X and the y axis so I'm going to
click on x-axis set it to pelo time
click on y-axis Center Palos humidity
and there it is so plotted how the
humidity is changing versus time you can
play around with a few other things
choose the column names in the bottom
change the color scheme if you want or
change the multiplier scheme and after
you've done with all of this you can
also share it you can either download
this charters or as an image or PDF so
download both of these things for you
click on download and there is your
discovery set and it basically says this
is your chart our monthly downloaded
this is your average right very memmove
work that you had to do now if we want
to go back to a better sample set there
is a sample sentence they have already
populated there are lots of other things
that we can do like predict things for
you like a tries to ask you questions
and what is a trend of cost over month
for a sample set which had all of these
columns in it so the samples that
basically had the yurt arranged the
region city by region that country it
also tries to plot a world map for you
if you choose other questions so this is
one other questions
what is the predictive model for unit
sold I guess what I'm trying to go ahead
with this is to say that it can also
predict data for you given that you
already have some considerable amount of
data to supply it with then amongst
these questions are ones that I added
and I'm given point in time these are
questions that automatically come up so
you can break down the profit by region
and category and you see some sort of a
map out here to say that you know in
Asia Pacific America the Middle East
this is how you break down US so you can
keep it or exclude it
so these are the things that we can do
with a lot of things so once you get the
data from a device you can give it
meaning and then try to analyze it so
you have a complete wholesome study of
all the data that you have you can try
to analyze how much your household is
consuming consuming electricity how your
companyÃ­s been doing in terms of sales
you can try to basically collect data
from one device to another right and it
doesn't stop out here you can also
connect it up with a lot of other Watson
nodes as well like you have language
translator or personality insights one
thing that we did last year was
basically we try to perform a
ghost-hunting hackathon at the Queen
Mary right so the Queen Mary is a
paranormal Asha butchers got a lot of
paranormal activity as history says and
us based on Long Beach so this is what
we did we had much but we set up a
control room structure we have multiple
rooms where we basically placed a
Raspberry Pi and we connected up to a
camera to get devices from there and
after you got data from those cameras
you basically open it up to a screen
like this the control center shadolla
analyzed to see if there's some sort of
motion going on it was a fun little
thing that we did but lots of fun things
that you can do with devices the other
thing that I had was I built my own
voice search engine size class' fine I
know if you heard that but I was trying
to say 5 plus 5 it gets picked up
by the Intel ensign five plus five
equals ten and the answer is given out
by the Bluetooth readspeaker and the
next thing that we did was we had a
foosball we connected it up to so that's
basically what we don't we basically
take data from a foosball collector up
to a no to not read using Raspberry Pi
try to find out where the goals are
being scored on either sides so so this
was an example of what we did and you
can find everything that you created you
can basically go to your bluemix
dashboard explore and play around with
it and you'll find multiple tutorials
online so let me switch the screen back
so yes so that's basically been my
little webinar on how to do all these
little things thank you so much for
watching and listening a lot this if you
have any other question then just tweet
about it asking questions around be able
to get back to you thank you alright
thank you so much you know yeah so I'm
looking at the live chat right now and
apparently there are no questions for
now so perhaps we can give like around
15 seconds if anyone of you have any
questions please post them at the live
chat I was checking on the common
features and it's not there perhaps
because it's life so I have the live
chat on the right side of the screen so
I can see that far there are 47 people
watching right now so if any of you have
any questions I'll give you a few
moments to post a question in the live
chat
so there's one question from there Derek
it says can you please go over adding
devices our own like Raspberry Pi
alright thanks for the passport so what
we're gonna do to add devices is
basically go to Internet of Things
platform so click on that platform
service and it should open a page where
it should be able to launch it but after
you launch it I'll show you how to add
the device so probably close all these
lips in the background so if you click
in the lavish page that's the button out
here that says connect your devices it
says user recipes to see how to add your
own devices little launch dashboard and
when you click a launch dashboard on the
pane on the Left there's something known
as devices so click on that and I'm sure
it says added device so here's where
we'll be creating device type and
creating device type I'm gonna call it
let's say a Raspberry Pi exception let's
say to get Peter click on next so after
you get that you basically should be
able to define it through a template
either the serial number or you should
be able to add some sort of a MAC
address to it
you wanna set the device serial number I
don't have any Raspberry Pi on me right
now that of assuming if I would have
like a some sort of a device serial
number you can also add some sort of
metadata and that's how your device gets
added does that answer your question
while waiting for an answer from Derrick
there's also another question its Intel
Edison modules support it as well yes
absolutely you tell Edison sausage
supporters so I'm going to look for a
link online right now if you're
following the screen so through that you
should be able to navigate to your
recipe to someone say Intel as an IBM
works so uh if you type flag the first
one or two links that show up is what is
the Intel Edison Watson IOT recipe right
so click on that and it's going to open
to a tutorial page which basically shows
you a step by step guide well how are
you connected Intel Anderson or Curie or
Arduino all the way up to bluemix um
until it shows you that it's connected
as a connector and registered so any
device are the devices that have been
supported so far as I have seen
Raspberry Pi photon class we also have
the bb-8 the Sphero then little aerosol
so yeah so there's more there are more
question from Derek well that for
example be linked via a Raspberry Pi
note in no trend and how would know
track pick up pick that up or the
instance pick it up and you network
settings required etc
so are all node-red as you see there's
no doubt here that says simulator device
and out here you have an input known on
the left pane and an output node so you
want to drag and drop the input node and
basically change the authentication to
bluemix service like add the device ID
or you can change it to an API key or
even if you want to learn from an
QuickStart
you can basically change the device
status and application status to add
your device ID out here and the device
ID is going to be registered to the IOT
foundation where you added the device so
that's how is going to get connected
once you add I assess Schad disabled for
this livestream do you want to try it
with something else or maybe go
incognito mode yeah perhaps you that
person has to browser for it to be a
novel because right now I'm using Chrome
and it's working just fine so I think
great that it works on Chrome all right
I think that's all for the questions
quick Q&amp;amp;A session thank you so much
energy and people that have posted the
question on the live chat just so you
know the webinar will be posted and
uploaded on our YouTube channel so you
can refer to it in the field refer to it
in the future and if you have any more
question for neeraja
here is our twitter twitter handle if
you can see my slide right here so if
you have any question you can mention
her on twitter and ask her any question
that you might have and also just a
short announcement if you are interested
in knowing more about webinars and all
the same the same kind of topic or a 10
even a 10 events on your air around your
area you can open events the be my
