on react es will be live or will be
starting in two short minutes are we
starting in two short money folks
alright folks welcome to this series of
webinars once again by be my app my name
is Fernando and it's like having all of
you here and this webinar we're gonna be
speaking by react GES and we have Pascal
Whelan who he's a developer from Germany
he's here to speak about it so this is
an intro so this is perfect for all of
you has been curious on how to start
react this is the day and with that
basically as always if you have any more
questions or if you want to find out
more events or future webinars Ito is
visit us at DMACC calm and you get to
click on the joint committee you can get
updates on our next webinars and their
next webinars and hackathon so much and
without further lay game introduced to
the man of the hour
well if you were so hello
so yeah thank you for joining this
webinar I'm very excited to do that and
it's actually kind of the first time I'm
doing it every now and this forum so I
will just start with introducing myself
my name is Pascal violence
I'm dr. Valley Park currently working in
Poland at a company called bit crowd and
we are doing like at experience in
JavaScript and I mainly work with react
at the moment before I did work with
backbone J ass jQuery but recently I
just have a chance to only work with
react um I was starting with my
development when I was 11 years old so
I'm doing this for over 10 years now and
it's still exciting for me
with react I started at Christmas 2013
as it's always when they are Christmas
holidays way a lot of time and I
randomly on github jump over react I was
playing around with it and since then I
was always
having smaller side projects will react
but at that time I was mainly working
with angular I'm at starting in 2014 I
was managing to work more and more with
react I also like emojis and cookies I
think a it's a lot of cookies I'm going
to produce good software I wish all of
you about this webinar
name is to give you a short like an
overview and a basic introduction to
react I don't want to convince you to
use react
instead of anything else that's just I
wanted to do the basics and I want to
show you why and how I like it
and that's it's so far I will start with
some basics and will also mention some
yes 2015 basics in case you not familiar
with them then I will talk a bit about
the virtual Dom jeaious act the react
components a bit about flux and redox
web pack and I also will do life coding
to show you how to start with react yeah
when I started he has some charts about
react there basically from Google Trends
on the left-hand side you just see the
interest if say at the end of 2013 the
peak is very low or the graph is very
low and sspeak in 2015 which was really
away I react or the popularity of your
react was exploding the second diagram
shows the interest and angular react
backbone or angular as we really see
currently like angular is really beating
but you also see that this also this
high peak of reacts recently backbone
and ambrosia is a really pretty low
compared to the others so what is react
the website for Facebook describe it as
javascript library for building user
interfaces they even have this in caps
lock
and that's also to refer to the V in NBC
like NBC is model-view-controller
which is very famous pattern use many
other libraries or Rubin trails then it
has the batchford um and which is an
abstraction to the real browser dumb and
they build that they have the problem is
slowly for updates in the process on a
slowly so they have this virtual Dom
most lots of different algorithms in
order to make clever updates then it has
a one-way reactive data flow which means
the data only goes into one direction
like a stream and it's not like for
example angular where you have a two-way
data-binding react doesn't have this and
this makes react that's kind of easier
and faster also react was first
introduced on May 2013 at railsconf us
and currently there are about six
thousand seven hundred twenty two
comments and more than six hundred
eighty-nine contributors which is really
amazing and on his current version as
15-1502
which was released on the 1st of April
then I want to focus that react is
library which means for example backbone
or especially angler as a framework and
the difference between a framework and a
library is that a library has a fixed
API and that's a framework for example
that's way more things we can do way
more things than a normal library does
and this is actually the biggest
advantage of react that says ok we do
have a fixed size of a pea ice you can
use but also as they say they are just
the view layer and we see it means that
react doesn't really care about how you
handle data where the data comes from
and how the data goes back to the
backend but
is only the view so it cares about
showing the view and doing stuff in the
view all the other things I'm Ana's a
concern of react and this is also why it
one can use react with other frameworks
example of people using react with
backbone or even with angular it's
really simple and you can also actually
put react into everything that you have
if you've known framework you can just
say okay hey want to use react for my
view on the air but also it's important
to mention that react is not really a
template thing it's of more than
templates and reacted us actually have
three or four main api's the first is
just the react epi ayah which of all the
methods attached to the react object
then there is the react component API
then this is the reactive Dom API which
is just a factory for index but this is
something which you later
and there's react Dom which is actually
an impeccable react on a snare to
interact with real done because all the
other things are virtual done they will
show you this later okay let's start
this is react is fire API and we see we
have a variable called hello and I we
have react not create class and in the
constructor create class we pass an
object that has one attribute and this
is a function called render this
function returns and react element which
is created by reactor to create element
which is a div the second power meters
none of the furthest hello and the props
name what this is basically doing it's
just returning a div with hello or not
this is the same code and below is the
react on render which is taking the
component that we created
and it's rendering this component into
the container with the ID app the
now a different size if I switch back
here we see rank dot create element and
here we have a div this is often
confusing zuv also which confused many
people in the beginning the sign tax is
called to joyous acts and this looks
really like there were people putting
HTML into javascript which actually if
you see this is true but actually it's
not true because this gets transpired
that it's look let's look like react or
create element this is a kind of
shorthand rotation so you can easily
build your interfaces because age exam
our aging is familiar to you they will
also easily see okay what kind of
element is list and if we focus below on
the render method then we do the same
thing we switch from reactor create
elements to just hello and this is to
being the same thing excavating an
element from hello and instead of
passing up like with nine hello we just
have this attribute green and this is
also like it is working and both both
cases also now we go to years 2015
because here we just have our normal
variable and here we used the
classification and this is kind of
important because since react older
fourteen the class notation was
introduced so one can define components
with s classes there people in
JavaScript world who don't like classes
because JavaScript doesn't really have
classes and because of that there are
people saying our classes are evil in
general this is a kind of clean notation
for rare components and in the end it's
actually resulting into the same result
so under the hood it's just react or
grade class anyways this is a different
equation that we will also see later
this is just a pure function and we use
the arrow function that I will explain
you what error function or later yeah
let's start with is 2015 that we've also
formerly known as year six but as far as
I know lay officially said okay this is
years 2015 and this year is 2016 which
is the current JavaScript standard all
the links are clickable and I will see
to publish the slides so you can just
visit rulings later the first link is
nice overview of all the equivalents of
es6 and years five and recently there
was a tweet they went kid that I said
WebKit now is 100%
es6 compatible which means every WebKit
and zoom when they implemented they have
all six features below other this this
compare table which is amazing we can
see where which features are implemented
from es6 and if you want to play around
with that I can recommend paddle j s io
snatcher Apple which is something I use
a lot and you can just play with all
your JavaScript things and Walton Babel
is the transpiler which transpired Z is
2015 code - yes five code which will run
in all browsers and it's really helpful
to see okay how it does this result but
does this even work I can really
recommend also you can use the scratch
is browser extension which is just the
same I think they also have support for
CoffeeScript and typescript
another important notice you can use P
is 2015 and James Bonomo jsfiddle and if
you have the modern browser which I
think you can also play with many
features in your console from the
browser
left and cons on the left-hand side we
have our name is equal to cake
all right hand side we use let name is
equal to K which is just a small change
but in general is 2015 it's a good
practice to use Const for most of things
but when your variables changing at a
certain time then it makes sense to use
that instead of Const the same example
is a limit which is a constant where we
definitely say ok this is a constant a
third example is a for loop and instead
of using bar we use let and this has a
very huge advantage because if we use
let the either variable I is block scope
this means it only lives in the block of
the for loop it doesn't exist afterwards
which which is an advantage because so
we don't pollute any global scope this
example it's just on how to use the
common giant modules for example and
node most recent load version they
support constants as well so you could
just make on react as equal to react
instead of bar statement just as
conclusion don't use var use Const or
legends that and then they are also
modules these modules are not yet in a
browser or in any or no directly you
always need a module order but they have
plenty out there and this is just the
sine tax which changes it looks maybe a
bit like Python or something like that
but in my opinion it's superior and
easier psychics to use the first example
just imports the default which is normal
the exporter sorry it's 44 or module
exports the second one shows if not
multiple values I can just use this
notation to say
the prop types from react and the third
example the right side shows ok I can
import the default which is react but I
can also import approp types from the
react package yeah
then there are classes as I said this
are no native or real classes this is
just a class notation which it gets
basically transpired to the thing that
we see in the right side because
JavaScript doesn't have classes laid
still have the prototypal inheritance
and this is just an isolation may be for
people who come from the Java world is
not really changing they must work on
things we have a constructor and instead
of writing function hello we just write
hello in classes and the other arrow
functions which are basically they just
save you a bit of typing they also have
from second very important advantage
which is they don't have an own scope
because usually every function does have
an own scope which means if I want to
use this I cannot access the parent list
so that I have to put the parent listen
to a variable which Muslims it's a bit
annoying and he's just an example how I
normally use map I mean the second
example shows ok how to use it with an
arrow functional I'm the third example
looks a bit weird but this is what I
want to say with a with a scope of an
arrow function we just map this name and
the console and usually this wouldn't
work at a normal function because the
SML property name all oppression but
since arrow functions inherit the parent
scope you can just access it this is
also something we'll use a lot in react
because it makes things things easier
and then there is the destructuring
objects pretty helpful we have an object
with first
last name I can just say a comments
first name last name is equal to object
they will distract these two properties
from the object which means that creates
two variables I can use some then I can
also just attract erase with the same
method there may be some people using LX
here it looks a bit similar to that and
I had to really use it show you a second
example where I just use the match the
regular expression and usually the first
expression contains everything units in
this case I want to look for the work
which comes after hello and I can just
easily obtain it by doing using this
notation and then there are the four
poems which is just yeah people coming
from the Java will already know this
when they are the rest parents which is
also helpful in this case I can just say
yeah this is the first parameter I want
to work with it and only address
parameter so I don't really care how
many parameters are they I just collect
all of them in the art array and then
there's the spread operator which
basically takes an array and spread it
so if you're familiar with the math dot
max API I just passed the area but this
API it takes comma separated every value
and the spreader rate is just um
spreading the array and the end of 42 is
the highest value um also I can concat
and race with it which is pretty helpful
I have this area numb with three four
and five and I have a second array or
one two and then the spent of radio was
none and afterwards there's another
element and in the end it's just one two
three four five six the last case is in
react or James X there's also the thing
where we have properties which is in
this case a hello level and when I pass
properties to a component I can
also use in this case the is better
greater they will just take all these
properties and apply it to this
component here's just an example who we
use the previous one together and react
in this case we say we take out the name
and then we use just the rest the rest
terms and we apply this to a HelloWorld
component where you say okay we only
want to give the rests and props so this
will receive all the other crops except
name another really important feature of
is 2015 our template literals which
basically have they have two huge
advantages one thing is kind of this
interpolation we just say dollar
breaking it's a variable or basically
expressions you can't really put in
statements but you can use like the
ternary operator things like that you
can also even pass a function to that
and the second most important features
are multi-line strings because in
JavaScript you can really do multi-line
strings you always have to kind of
concat them because then this break is
not really supported this is something
which perfectly works in with template
literals so basically one can say if you
use strings which are more complex if
you can always use should always use
template literals then just some terms
in general like this is playing with
little string object which is an object
and I don't know which is something like
documents get by ID or document query
selector and some reactors react
basically has some kind of types there's
the react
element which consists of a type
properties a key and a reference the
most important thing our type and crops
and you create an element by react
create element an element is basically
can be everything that we create but I
will show the API of this later and the
lesson react node which can be in react
element string or a number of areas of
react nodes a red node is often used
when we pass you into a red component
then there's the react component which
has only component lifecycle methods
then it start with a virtual Dom virtual
Dom is basically director to create
element which is the react equivalent to
document create element which is just
the yeah but virtual Dom and there are a
lot of shortcuts which can be found at
react under diff or reactant of ul all
these things are also internally used in
J's X button can use them for once to
vertical always use reactor create
element yeah then the react FBI the s
react dot create class which is the
basic method to create a rare component
and I just pass an object with all the
settings although attributes I want to
have in this case this and the render
method in Orkut initial state and all
these things and then this reactor
create element this was it's just
creates and react element and it's takes
either a screen or a react class and
normally a string is lower case because
it's a div button spend whatever or a
react class or a plus is something to
create above or a red component we're
just saying the next thing is red
component this is the basic component
which we extend when we use the class
notation but it's the same as on the
first example with react
create class then this record um this
was the virtual Dom a factory thing and
then there are reacted pro types where
they contain lots of prop types which we
can apply to our component and unless
also they react Dom API which is not too
important
this is just how no reactant reacts to
the real world although we have done it
just takes and react element and a
second argument it it's a Dom element
and optionally this was a callback and
with the react element it's something
usually we pass our component there but
we can't just possibly have to create an
element of the component but this is
possible because the reactor a diamond
also accepts the react less and it is
react Dom unknown component know that we
can just unloaded we can also find the
Dom load and then they s wrecked on the
server which has two methods render to
string that whenever static markup they
are almost the same except that render
to string can be used for server-side
rendering so you can create Universal or
isomorphic apps they just have a node
server which does that and if you use
rendered string you can react on the
browser find out that it's already meant
of that we just attach some event
listeners and then you can have
perfectly show rendering a second method
render to static Markov i'm also renders
the back component as HTML but it
doesn't attach any react things to it so
it's basically static markup you can use
if you want to use this as a template
thing but it's just outputting markup no
react code then there's the component
api which is pretty simple every
component has a constructor which we
don't even have to use because it's
there automatically and it has in this
state and
props and this is basically like those
are the only two things that comes with
the component when we extend another
component we have to we receive the
props we have to make sure that we pass
the props to this props we can also
define a state which is this day that we
can say what the state should be and
when there are any updates we want to
talk to this component that is from said
state define a new state also this
method force update which is something
we usually don't use we only use it if
we know there were changes for example
if there is a very huge state and
there's a change of the very least
element or a down on the tree then react
well maybe not know about it because it
doesn't really do this deep equal thing
which means we if we know we changed
something we can call force update and
we'll force the update and also when
there were changes happening from the
outside world which is possible we can
also then say ok we call force update to
make sure that the component is
up-to-date and then the component API is
when we create a component with
classification format was react create
class the most important thing is the
render method the render method always
returns a virtual Dom and there's always
returns like I will not go around and
everything that we want to have the
components then this get initial state
which is something we don't have when we
use the class notation because there we
define the state in the constructor it's
the same as get default props these two
methods are only used when we use react
or create class then there are prop
types where we can define types for our
properties
basically for development to make sure
that we passed my types and their
mix-ins
which are also only available and
reactor crate class and statics the same
and the display name which we can define
the name of the component but JSX
produced automatically for us next thing
are the component appear I methods and
as I said has this render function or
the random method which is really
essential but there are more kind of
life cycle methods for example component
will mount will be called before the
component knows then component did mom
will be vote after the component did
mount and in this method we can attach
some event listener so all these things
because they know okay this is mounted
and it will stay like that then there is
component will receive crops this will
be in a vote when there are new props
applied to the component and we can just
make sure - yeah what will happen with
these components and with these
properties then there is should
component update which is something
where we can define by ourselves
and when our component should be updated
we will see the next stage and the next
props and we can just do our own
calculations just to make sure whether
component update you can say okay there
are different things but this is not
necessary for my component to updated
and this component will update which is
something which is called shortly before
the components updated where we have the
next props in the next state can just
make sure to wear with that and then the
S component did update this will be
invoked after every update
we also have the previous props and all
previous stage I do some calculations or
maybe through the fire events
and the last one is component will
unknown and this will be called shortly
before the components unwanted usually
when we attach event listeners or stuff
like that in component it mode we have
to destroy these component will unmount
one thing about we act are stateless
components because usually when we build
because absolutely have state and in
react we have the advantage to build
stateless components which means this
component does not have any stay we just
pass properties in this case the H
property and we display this but we can
also now have this notation we have this
before and now as you know this is an
arrow function and this is just a
function taking a props parameter and
returning a reactive element showing the
prompts then that's jump to Chinese s
J's acts as an embeddable XML and
JavaScript and tags are basically
transformed to function of occasions and
every days extech must be closed
so either we use as next example of div
with a slash or we have to close it
manually and then when we write
lowercase this means it's an action
element like a diff if we use uppercase
we basically almost I refer to an
existing react component and that's also
thing and when we use JSX it doesn't
require react can also use JS x for own
things were with any different adapters
but it's not necessary for using react
and also using react doesn't require to
use JSX so it's optional as well this is
a bit hojae's
x looks like on the left hand side we
have a div on the right hand side we say
okay just react create element diff
well the same with a component component
this Briton upper case will first that
is our case and this is basically
creating an element of the component and
we'll shows our element with a class and
we can't use class like we use as an
ancient L because as you know it's
transpired to JavaScript and a
JavaScript class as a reserved word so
we're not able to use it and this is why
we have to use classname and on the
right hand side you see nowadays a
second a parameter which is just an
object with the class name and the last
example shows like all three pyramids
like we have an attribute and also we
passed a child to the element and on the
right hand side we see it's a div with
the class object and the third parameter
is just a string with hello
and all the string could also be for the
reaction element or component this is
basically like HTML works and then let's
talk about binding and in usually when I
work with normal HTML I may be used on
click on focus or things like that this
doesn't really work with which is acts
just actually just have the camel case
even named and in react it's like they
basically use some event engagement will
show this later
concerning binding we have some problems
but you know we are promised but in the
and click we just say this dot handler
click and handle click is a method from
the class
usually a via stream okay this works but
unfortunately there's a problem that and
the hand will click we have with this
sad state and also we refer to this
state click and render is an Owen
function so in render we can't access
this state on this sad state this is why
we have to add define this in order to
make this working but this is just one
example and because this maybe doesn't
look that nice we have also an option
that we say ok in the constructor off
this component we say this dot handle
click is equal to this time click bind
this so we don't have to do this in the
render method or if we go back to I'm
the example we can also say ok we just
add an arrow function which in this case
it just takes the event parameter and
passes it to the handler click those are
the two options we have one or you want
to have a proper binding you have events
for example when you work with us J
create what other things before you may
be used in any event listener jQuery
unruhe I said or maybe you don't click
on load and early click whatever and
this doesn't really exist in react
serially you could use it except and you
click maybe but reactors have own
methods for that and it's actually
pretty simple you can attach every
element at one click or on inputs and
unfocused and change written in camera
case and react users event delegation in
order to figure out which event happened
and to do performance events and from
and handling if you want to learn more
there's the nice article about even
delegation and this is how reactors done
handling the events forest
another important things react is CSS
there are some options like we have the
normal style attribute and react which
receives a normal object with the style
of Malaysians then there is a nice
package called class names which is a
bit like classes and angular way I can
reading work when you've multiple
classes with conditionals it's really
great when they are the concept of CSS
modules where somehow import
existing CSS to apply your component and
an auto react has a nice support for
animation itself then there's the thing
inline styles and or CSS modules this
foreign land stylized package called F
Fredette which is a nice one if you want
to work with nine styles then there's
CSS X which is a nice way of using CSS
and JavaScript and there's operational
CSS modules
marios thing and while yours is a scope
CSS this yes yes and there's also a
person who did an overview of using CSS
javascript which is for JavaScript but
also strong focus on reacts but you can
really recommend if you want to know how
to use i'm CSS and javascript because
there will be many many ways you can
also just use your standard CSS which
including that's also fine another
really important thing is the
architecture because reacts has like the
invalid switch which is also a kind of
problem that it's just the view layer so
there is no real architecture you can
build your components you can really
build nice reusable components but you
do not really have any yeah architecture
and this is why facts cover them flax is
in the pattern which comes from facebook
mainly and
for example a facebook package actually
just hasn't dispatcher flux has the idea
from dispatch sure you have stores and
views it has a unidirectional data flow
which means data only goes one direction
go back and work status and user in
actual interview
this creates external dispatch for the
store which holds the business logic and
application states will be changed and
then it's updates reviews which is the
basic idea of flux that I would
personally maybe use read acts and there
are many flex implementations like the
Facebook Likes thing all today s
martinez factor which is something which
I can recommend but there's also this
table where there is a huge comparison
of many flex implementations and I would
personally stick with read acts which is
something I think most people who work
with reactive another body and read acts
basically they have refused from a fact
pattern also from Elm it's really pretty
small and I have this three main
concepts which is suppose of truth so
the entire state is a one store which
means there are not multiple stores
there's only one store then the state is
read-only I can't just change the state
I can only mediator state by dispatching
an action object to it I'm doing so I
think every change is accurate user
function which means I can't really test
them very well but I correct command S
is free I had serious about it getting
started with redux and also the
documentation is really also made really
nice examples I'm the field reason that
I can really recommend the Sacketts
serious because I think that it's the
way it's better than I can explain it
right now
yeah let's continue with my pack my pack
is I think most popular bundler I'm
using which is used with react now also
things like browserify
which is nice as well though personally
I would just recommend my peg at the
moment and why peg we're exposing you
have your conferring chairs where you
have an entry point of your app on the
output we have any bundle we'll go then
you have your loaders where you just use
a bubble loader which is the true
spoiler for trades X that's actually it
what peg will undo bundling for you
which means it's can work with NPM
dependencies and the engine of the
bundle which has a react all these
things and you can also have many below
those for CSS final things as well this
is first up how basic my pet config
looks like I don't really want to go
into detail but yeah another important
thing is testing you can actually use
your favorite frameworks like just mine
mocker tape ever like everything for
testing and there's a nice thing by our
B&amp;amp;B they did build
enzym enzyme which is a really helpful
tool for testing you can just useless
additionally Facebook has just which is
really nice because by default them walk
every say you just unlock the things you
want to test and so my opinion really
clever way to write tests a little less
nice thing for unexpected choice which
is unexpected react which is also
something I can recommend a fear just
testing as actual hold if you want to
work develop real component and enter
debugging make sure that you use the
react developer tools if you work with
redux also again the great readout staff
tools and when you build react
components there some react hot loader
which words work together with white peg
but there were just things for
browserify
which i can really recommend because
this is really amazing replaces your
component but it doesn't replace your
state and it's really amazing for
development um yeah that's coming to the
conclusion before I go to the live
coding part
you know why react my opinion at simple
really abstract a lot des X has the
advantage on that see it as a an air
environment for example to us forever
like a note server but when rails people
using it there's for example react
native which our native app still will
react and partly you can share you know
some components between your native
components and a genome browser app and
it's basically JavaScript so it's
nothing else from JavaScript and the API
is not too hard and it is really
performant like there were people
reaching 60 frames per second even a
JavaScript
JD fixed number 9 has that view which I
were way slower than normal views and
also it has a really nice community
there are always people helping you on
slang Google Groups IRC is it overflow
some downsides of reactors then it's
just the view layer so you have to make
decisions how you want to build your
architecture there are many many ways
you can combine it but you have to find
your way and this is building which
takes some time and maybe you trained on
new things yeah let's so far if you
understand Facebook they provide you a
nice starter kit there are nice boiler
plates for example one from X to Y were
from PJ there's also a Chester KS which
seems my opinion to be a nice
opinionated boilerplate how to use react
if you want to do for the learning there
is I pray these three things which are
nice the first one is where you will
react without J's ax flex web pack
it's just react how it's working the
second one I love your name but it's
actually a good one like the article and
the third one is my opinion has an
amazing concept because they it's a
react introduction for people who know
just a critical eye which means if you
come from the jQuery world it's really
amazing because they tell you
how one way to use react no way that's a
half of a presentation I will just very
appreciate it thank you very much
all right it looks like you went over to
everything really great nobody has any
questions never looks like it will be
clearly understood it the only question
I had is can you share the slides and
put everyone watching this you won't be
able to watch this video back and forth
on your own time so you can as we watch
the videos there 44 degree walks the
slides as always so the people who are
just watching this video later on if you
have any questions you can just type
them in and still in the comment section
and I can still just backtest got nobody
looked at I just want to say Pascal I
really appreciate it thank you very much
for this intro to react and everyone
else as always if you have any more
questions always do let us know and for
future webinars you can always find that
out again at my app be my calm and with
that's basically that's about it alright
thanks a lot folks
let's go once again I appreciate it
thank you very much you're welcome
all right Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
