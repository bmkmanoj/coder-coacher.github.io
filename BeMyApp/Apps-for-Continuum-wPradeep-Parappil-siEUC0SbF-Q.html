on discover Windows 10 continuum will be
my apt we're happy to have you all here
sorry there were some technical issues
in the morning but everything is ready
and set up now so for a very first p
here i'm going to present to you ready
from microsoft he's going to be speaking
on making your app continuum and just
making it really awesome so I'll further
ado imma give the man the screen so if
you have the screen thank you very much
um so my name is Freddie / Apple I work
in the windows and devices group
specifically I work for it in which is
called the developer ecosystem and
platform which is focused on the
developer platform and windows across up
different devices windows windows for
next box and we work with some of our
partners on new and upcoming features in
Windows so but without taking too much
time let me quickly go through what I
have today so obviously we have this
feature or continuum on phone and and
what I really want to do today is to
spend time on three things which are
really important in terms of getting
your apps ready for continued so um so
basically from a developer perspective
there are a few things that you really
really need to take care if you're
building apps which should scale when on
for continuum right one is of course
this is the hardware piece which I will
not delve into because it's already
being taken care of by HP through the
various options through which you can
project your screen but what we really
talk about today is the adaptive part of
what you need to do in your application
um I'll touch lightly upon the other
pieces like packaging testing and
scaling
but I really think that thing which I
want to talk about is about the peace
around the adaptive and peace so one of
the most important things that you need
to pay attention to if you are going to
build applications which need to be
skimmed across a larger screen is to
make sure that a is it's going to be
projected on a larger screen and second
the input modalities on those screens
could be a mouse and a keyboard right it
could be connected to a dog and maybe if
you're on a phone mostly it's some kind
of touch based interaction but on a
larger tip on a larger screen with a
dongle or dock they could be a keyboard
or a mouse attached to it so from a from
a developer perspective you need to be
prepared for this what do we really mean
by adaptive apps right i mean when we
say your app needs to be a doctor what
are we really talking about so there are
really three things that we really care
about when we talk about adaptive apps
one is that the screen should be fluid
and what do we really mean by fluid here
right so let me I'm going to play this
video again and again so basically here
you will see that when the window size
is resize the application basically
automatically resizes the what is being
presented on the screen so yeah you will
see like this is a looking video which
is kind of showing you how when you
expand the screen the app kind of urges
to this layout and when you narrow it
down you kind of so the the UI is really
fluid and you could use things like for
example bra great style controls us to
to essentially reflow the content right
so I mean one way to achieve this kind
of an effect is as you go from smaller
screen bigger screen is to use something
like
redken code and let me give a more
concrete example right in this case for
example we have this um so just a quick
time check how many how many minutes do
I have to on this topic just so that I
know when to stop and a fast or how slow
I need to well now you're probably fine
you can figure out as much time as you
like how cool so basically to give a
more concrete example right this is an
example way we can see three different
UI elements are present one is some kind
of a photo image and there are two
controls um one of which if you look at
it occupies about a third of the screen
and the other occupies about two-thirds
of the screen and it's if this size is
defined more in terms of the percentage
occupied percentage of the screen so we
have said this element takes one third
of the screen this element takes two
third of the screen so what really
happens at this point is if you actually
reduce the size of the screen um follow
the content actually quite neatly
adjusts itself within this smaller
screen size I'm text still visible and
from a user perspective things are still
easily visible to the user so basically
what you can do in this case is you know
actly so one is the fluid UI right um
and you can use responsive panels and
things like that relative panels and
things like that to actually lay this
out in a particular manner the other
thing is one is of course being able to
adjust based on a certain way up the
second thing is this ability to just one
sec the second thing is the ability for
your application what respond to
different types of UI changes right so
just just to give an example
let's say so far from a Microsoft
perspective on what we really say is
that anything which is below 768
effective pixels and if you are not
fully aware of this concept of effective
pixels then you should really take take
some time to read about it because it is
not really the actual physical pixels on
the screen but it is a combination of
the actual physical pixel on the screen
plus the viewing distance so that is
what we use to compute what we call as
effective pixels so from a design
perspective anything which is less than
768 pixels ideally should have some form
of phone optimized do I and for anything
which is about 768 effective pixels you
should try to respond to this particular
type of a screen a through a mood
desktop optimized or a big-screen
optimized you I so just to give you an
example right now one way for you to do
something like this is to use adaptive
triggers so for example here you will
see that it is not just changing the I
mean if you look at what the difference
from what we showed initially to where
the fluid you I was just getting
compressed and the text was being shown
in a particular I mean it was just reef
lowing here you will see that not only
is the screen changing but the change in
the effective pixels is also triggering
certain types of UI changes right so
here you will see for example let me
just replay this video again
so here you will see in this case there
is a new icon which came up in the phone
layout which kind of move the so like in
this case you will see that we when when
the when the size of the screen gets
reduced you use this adaptive trigger to
reveal or hide content right and you can
set different snap points at which these
adaptive triggers coming to click if you
look at the windows UI design guide it
also has guidance on what are the
effective pixel points at which you
should set your snap points which kind
of covers a broad gamut of the different
types of devices on which ultimately
this content will be presented so here
again you will see that you know in this
particular case we are using responsive
sorry adaptive triggers to snap the UI
flow right as I sorry the UI layout in
this case you have two different in may
be some kind of a text control or a text
um and basically what happens is when
this end of moves in to a different
layout then essentially what happens is
that you're not only responding to this
change but you're also G positioning
some of the UI elements so two things we
talked about one is fluid UI and the
second one is responsive UI right so
here again is an example of the same
thing what we saw earlier where you have
this layout of a photo plus two
different elements where you have some
kind of text one of prying and third and
the other occupying two thirds of the
screen and in this case what you will
see is that unlike in the previous
example where you just kind of laid it
out as a percentage and the UI god I
wouldn't say compressed but it kind of
the text refloat in a way so that it
occupied the same percentages on the
screen in this case we have what we have
really done is we have not only
we have responded to this change in
effective resolution by using some of
the adaptive triggers to read layout
sorry position some of the UI elements
so basically what it really means is if
you look at both of these cases is for
kind of preparing your application to be
able to present itself on different
effective pixel resolution so it means
that from a continuum perspective when
you project from a phone to a larger PC
or from phone to a larger screen these
these layouts don't look very abnormal
and they can adjust themselves to this
newly presented screen the third thing
which we are really talking about is
Taylor you I so in this example which
you saw the what was happening is that
the you I was just been laid out
differently right you are using the
adaptive triggers you are using the
relative panels and to basically kind of
reposition some of the UI and to lay it
all differently or to compress what was
being presented on the screen but you
def if you want to go the whole heart
one of the other things which you can do
is to present a completely different
experience so for example in this
particular case which is kind of playing
on my screen you will see that not only
in on a larger screen the UI elements
are presented in a certain format and
then the effective pixel changes then we
use the adaptive trigger to not just to
adjust what has been shown on the screen
but to present a completely different
type of set or a completely different
set of UI controls and UI elements so
you could do the same thing basically
for example if it I mean I think you
must have seen some of these examples in
some of Microsoft's own first party
applications as by Redick things like
nail
cetera when you see it on phone at the
layout and the elements look different
but when you project it onto a larger
screen it kind of behaves in a different
manner so things like navigation things
like layout etc can be we architected by
you based on adaptive triggers which
come into effect based on any change in
resolution I will skip right now the
packaging piece but effectively what
we're really saying is that if you if
you have a universal Windows app it
should really not come with continuum by
default testing is also something which
you need to be really a bear and careful
about because if you think your apps are
going to be used on a continuum based
device or phone it would make sense for
you to kind of make sure that you test
your application to make sure that the
experience is something which is normal
and usable on these different resolution
and on these different external devices
or external monitors and the other thing
which we leveraged by developers to do
is that ok so the other thing which we
really want our developers to do is to
make sure that the assets which which
you have um are available at different
scales so basically you can already
packaged it in your app X and inform
that which are the assets to be used at
different resolutions and windows is
capable of using those at different
resolutions are basically the advantage
of this is that you can avoid all the
issues related to downscaling upscaling
um when the application is projected
onto a screen so for example the
effective resolution of many of the
phones is very high and
and if you were to provide assets for
the phone typically they tend to look
good on a larger screen but in some
cases if the resolution of these larger
devices is lower then it tends there
tends to be some issues around town
scaling so here again I think what I
would suggest strongly for you to go
through and is to look at some of the
content around scaling I will not delve
into it in much detail because i was
told i have much a limited amount of
time to finish this the last thing which
i want to really leave you guys with
this that having a phone and an external
screen or an external projection surface
really means that you can also create
experiences with span multiple screens
right so for example you could easily
take advantage of both the phone as well
as the big screen so these are for
example if you look at it from ph 1
onwards we have made available similarly
P eyes which allow you to for example
cast from within the phone to a large
screen right so in from within the app
you can identify which other nearby
devices and cause you use the cast api's
to cast to those um screams or you could
alternately use to you some of the
projection manager api's to create
multi-view experiences right in this
case for example you have some kind of a
slide show a similar to what PowerPoint
hands where you have the notes as well
as the PowerPoint slide notes um you
know on your phone and you can project
it onto a larger screen and you could
create applications very much like the
using multi view experiences so this is
all I had from my side from a continuum
perspective so probably for you thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
