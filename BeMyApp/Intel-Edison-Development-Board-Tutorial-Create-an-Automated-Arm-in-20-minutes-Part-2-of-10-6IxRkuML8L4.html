to show you how to configure the Intel
Edison development kit in case you
haven't checked out the previous series
which is how to create a connected light
bulb if you check out video number two
that really goes into detail on how to
actually configure that is in board
we're going to add the link on the
bottom of the video have a check out for
yourself and I'll see you want a next
step you link the Intel Edison to a
laptop by connecting the two micro USB
cables we connect the first one so the
Edison then to the computer one is
further communication and the other is
for the power supply for now we plugged
in one and we need to plug in the second
one
we can now see that it turns on with a
small green LED we can now turn to our
laptops and start making configurations
we downloaded the zip file on Intel's
website let's copy and paste everything
on the Edison
meanwhile you can go explore the comport
that you will need for the following
steps you can go to the control panel
which will lead you to the device
manager from there you click on ports
the calm and lpt which that will lead
you to the USB serial comma X you can
see that it's in number 5 calm keep that
in mind for the next steps you can open
putty that is the command you today
today that we're going to be using and
click on cereal and put the comport that
we seen before the number 5 in this case
set the speed up at 115 200 wait until
it finishes to open it now that it's
finished we can open it we are now
connected to the edison we are going to
set up the edison
that's done so now we login and we're
going to set the edison up
we then need a password let's type it in
won't need an 8 character password for
this one
now we need to set the names for the
Edison let's put ours
we now connect to the Wi-Fi we select
the Wi-Fi that we need here it's the
number 11 we type in the password so now
it is connecting we now need to install
no cheers for that you'll have to
install a repo core to that 32 with the
command echo source until Edison repo
core 232 we type in our link etc opkg
you put opkg or AP or Core 2 dash 32 dot
confer you can find this line in the
video description
once the repo is installed we check if
updates should be installed with opkg
update
then we install no Jas of opkg and star
nodejs
we are going to call the updates with
configure underscore Edison dash upgrade
we use the command npm install a serial
port to install the packages we need
then NPM install express dash save
and with that everything is now
installed on the card so now that
everything is set up and configured on
the Intel Edison board let's move on to
next step and start assembling the
circles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
