like Antoine and so I work
you've enabling new technologies like
real sense with you know top eyes fees
in addition to that I work on tablet
projects this is one of my sort of
latest projects that I'm working on with
Microsoft in a company called exert is
so it's a simple cherry trail tablet
which is Intel's latest and greatest
atom platform and it has a nice party
trick slide it into a docking station
yeah I can slide into the docking
station and it becomes like a nice game
in companion running Windows 10 it has
the xbox pattern so it's a really nice
xbox one streaming device really really
cool I'm going to have it here so if you
want to have a look at it and played it
feel free okay now I'll carry on my
presentation okay quick introduction I
know I've only got half an hour and we
have a lot to cover so intro to real
science and talk about some of the
realsense sdk modules the different
camera technologies and we will look
closely into some of the modules and
what all of this means to gain in that's
one going to cover today okay so what is
real saying so hands up who's familiar
with real sense okay not too many people
right so who's even just heard of real
sense not maybe used it just heard of it
okay great so you've release you've
heard about it so what what real sense
does it pretty much adds human-like
senses touch is eyes speech to your to
your computer to the brain of the
computer okay so who's familiar with
Windows hello who's ever used windows
hello on Windows Tim nope okay so
windows hello is like a security feature
you don't need to login with a password
anymore you can just recognize your face
but you do you do need to have a 3d
camera on your device to recognize your
face and then you can log into
device so so we have two types of
cameras front facing in world facing ok
so front-facing we have a developer kit
available well we have developer kits
available today for both front-facing
and user facing and if you have some
nice ideas of applications which can
benefit from real sense let me know
we'll try to get your camera if you want
to just develop by yourselves you can
buy these cameras and have a link on
another slide you can buy them for
around ninety nine dollars and so
products today that you can find is you
can find many sort of laptops all in
ones we have another project called
Irwin ona which is coming soon so that
sure the camera will be sold as a
peripheral right so let a front-facing
usages the rear-facing usage is so you
would see the rear camera on tablets
phablets detachable that's what you
expect to see the rear camera so I think
I pretty much said this on the previous
slide front facing cameras all in ones
notebooks convertibles the crossover or
the sort overlap is detachable where you
can either have a front facing camera or
a rare camera tablets phablets you only
expect to see and rear facing cameras
okay so this is what the front so we
called the front facing camera and f200
the F stands for front and the front
camera it pretty much has an RGB sensor
HD it has a an infrared projector which
projects what we call a coded light
technology so it it projects a pattern
and then it receives that pattern from
what it receives it has an ASIC which
nick can then calculate the actual depth
it can create like a bitmap with that
using the infrared and these cameras
will only work on gen 4 so until gen 4
in above and you have to have a USB free
the front facing camera is designed for
short range so another name that's
referred to the camera it's called short
range so front-facing short-range the
rear camera long range so the sort of
range we expect is point2 to 1.2 meters
and the operating systems it supports is
Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 see the
technology uses coded light and the
depth is vga and the RGB side is i am
1080p ok the rear facing camera so you
can't see the are but that should be our
200 and that works in a different way so
that that works on a stereoscopic
technology a little bit how you have a
lift ir camera and on the right I ugh IR
camera and then it uses that so the the
actual shift in the image that you see
so if you if you ever try this and if
you saw have a fingering you shut one
eye and then shut the other right you'll
see a movement so if you sort of line up
with something something straight I mean
sort of vertical you shut one check the
other and you'll see a disparity it uses
that disparity to work out the depth and
the reason why it has an IR projector if
you have a plain white surface it's very
hard to work out that that movement
because it's just white so what the IR
projector does it projects like a
texture and once you have that texture
on a surface it's easier to work it's
easier to see that that disparity in
addition to the infrared it also has a
color camera so but you can't see it
very clearly but this image to that
image is a slow
movement they're not in the same
position and that's the information it
needs to work out the actual depth
speaker okay okay um let me just here
okay so this is what the SDK looks like
so obviously it's a developer kit you
need an SDK to develop your applications
this is what it looks like so your
applications above their the interfaces
that we support with real sense as you
can see here the common one C++ C sharp
unity unity you do need them what
version was it and 4.6 free with patch 1
and above to make your work of real
sense and then it has all the underline
in modules there so the in the interface
is pretty much higher complexity of
coding directly or writing your own
algorithm so all the algorithms are
there and you have a high level
interface that you can use here are some
of the modules that we have so I'll
split them into two sides in the common
so you have a user facing modules things
like hand in blob tracking you don't
expect to do hand tracking on a rear
camera so it's only a front facing
module so you can do scrolling you can
you know have predefined gestures like
thumbs up a V sign and it recognizes all
of those so these are front-facing
modules gesture recognition background
removal and subtraction so this is
really really cool and so anyone
familiar with background segmentation
and background subtraction no sir pretty
much you are ok so what you can do there
so if I'm presenting and I have the
camera on me I can hide the background I
can remove the background real time I
can superimpose different backgrounds
very very cool and I have some nice
demos of this so once i finish my talk I
have some nice demos and anyone ever
used personify xsplit explict anyone use
xsplit before okay so X
xsplit recently introduced real sense
into their their application so you can
be part you know you can be when you're
talking about games you can have your
picture on one corner you can talk about
the game you can be moving your
presentation for example so very very
very cool things like speech recognition
that can be used for both front-facing
and rear-facing matter its speech it's
not dependent on the camera any any
questions so far oh okay and we got
things like person face tracking free
the objects scanning tracking object
recognition or cuentas reality seen
perception loads of different modules
their enhanced photography you wouldn't
really expect that on a laptop with a
front facing camera so that's a
rear-facing module okay so yep just
moving on now and so let's have a quick
look at the user facing features one
slide here which pretty much explains
some of the modules that we have I am
going to go into these I'm not going to
spend too long so things like finger
tracking so the camera can recognize 22
points on your hand so all the joints
right so it can recognize all the joints
the palm it knows which way your hand is
and gesture recognition so it has it can
recognize 10 predefined gestures so you
know fingers spread you can do a wave a
click it can recognize all of those and
things like face tracking it can track
78 points of your face so you around
your eyebrows your your cheekbone your
pupils you can track all of those and
speech recognition yeah command control
dictation we spoke about background
segmentation so I spoke about the facial
so these are the different points that
you can recognize on your face so your
eyebrow
Elle's your eyes and various points
around your your your chin also what's
pretty cool and with the new SDK it can
estimate your heart rates in your post
it's only an estimation but it can do
that so that could that could be used in
gaming for adaptive gameplay so if
you're getting a bit bored you can
change the game slightly it can if
that's it so you can speed things up so
pretty cool I tracking also supported
not great but their support I tracking
it can also recognize various poses
things like tilting your head and
smiling tongue out and these are all
predefined facial poses that it can
recognize so you can code you know you
can change your game to scan any of
those you know you can do raise an
eyebrow clothes and I and it can it can
recognize all of these different
different expressions also poses which
is quite a good one so if I'm in front
of the camera if I tilt my head rotate
it so it can recognize your roll and
pitch so for example you can just if
you're playing the game you can move
your head around to change your camera
view which could be quite cool ok so
these are some examples some screenshots
of the different things that I mentioned
so detection face tracking and once you
stretch your face so you can move around
as long as you're not out the camera
field of view it will recognize you and
you know who you are so it's also you
know detection it's also face
recognition it can recognize you from
someone else not just a face right in
recognizing it's me it knows my features
then someone else can come into the
camera view and it will recognize in so
that's the bottom right and landmarks so
there you're 78 points but you can see
there your pose you can move your head
slant it rotate it can recognize
that it can recognize and various
expressions which we spoke rights are
the expressions we mentioned in the
previous slide okay hand hand module so
hand is great because it you know it
tracks XYZ meaning six degree of freedom
freedom so you can move your hand around
and it would you can track your hand
it's not locked it's not like a phase
where it sort of locked to this position
you can it's got six degree of freedom
and it understands the body sides i
mentioned that 22 joint so you can
recognize or it can track all of those
positions it can on the next slide it
shows which other predefined gestures so
let me just go to the next slide so it
can it can recognize all of those so tap
full pinch a fist and a pinch sy
different poses v-sign thumbs up thumbs
down so for example we're working with a
a browser company so thumbs up save
bookmark thumbs down close tab some cool
features to having a browser and so in
addition to hand tracking using the
skeleton module we have a blob detection
which it's a lot more smaller impact to
your system takes up less resources oh
nice to use and blob so if you want if
you don't need that position of a hand
skellington you can use a blob right if
you want to just scroll up and down you
don't need to have your he doesn't need
to track your fingers you can have your
hand as a contour or a blob and move
your your-your-your a throw your scroll
okay and little look on background
subtraction module so a background
subtraction this is you real life you
can remove the background or you can
replace the background with something
else and here's some nice examples so
this example here is
an application that you would find in
the SDK so we have sample applications
in the SDK for all the modules that I
just mentioned this one here background
removal so this is me my home office you
can see the background and then you can
remove the background you can apply
different sorts of backgrounds we've
added real sense in the personify
application so the real persons on the
right hand side that's a friends
streaming over the internet and they can
both play a game together they can see
the expressions on how they're playing
so they're paying a simple so tiny sort
of game there so they can be part of the
game and that's a bit like xsplit they
can be part of your purse or gaming
broadcast ok we have a 3d scanning
module the 3d scanning scanning modules
care for recognizing objects face heads
full body and again this really depends
on what camera you have so a
front-facing camera you can use for
objects in the face for heads you would
need her head in full body you need the
rear facing camera because you have more
range in a in a rear facing camera we
have a speech module and speech we can
do speech recognition so you can add
command control in your game ok let me
try and speed up a little bit can I have
five ok let me try to speed up a little
bit i want to show you some examples ok
i'm going to skip this i can enhance
photography that's another cool feature
so you can take a picture of something
and because it has that free d depth map
you can work out measurements rough
measurements so you can take a picture
or pretty much anything and because it
has that depth built into the picture
you can then work out different
measurements and also you can see you
can
focus on different areas okay skip this
get this okay this is quite important so
how can all of this I mentioned quite a
few things here how can a lot of this be
used for gaming right so this is
something that all thought about and
facial expressions hard rate again you
can adapt your cake your gameplay real
time for how you're feeling which could
be a good one and face body or scan in
right so you can scan yourself you can
be part of your game so for example
there's an application is a few
applications that can do this one is it
see which can work with an application
called uranium right and you can
integrate you can scan yourself and you
can be part of your game and webcam
background removal again better
streaming experience and think that the
personify example that I showed you the
game brought the game broadcasting so
you can be part of your your broadcast
and head motion pose you can add that
into your game again so you can move
your head around and change that camera
view if you want to object recognition
yeps or speaks for itself speech
recognition I'm just jumping on now
speech recognition you can add command
control to your game so if it's like a
shooting game you can say things like
reloads ok ok I just need to wrap it up
and just show you one quick video so
this one here is a application by face
rig is it's an avid it's another time he
can mimic the avatar we've used facial
expressions I don't want to spend too
long in this where yeah ok that's one
example what you can do this is a game
called wave warrior which can use your
hand as a blob so it's a bit like a
Kinect game so you can pretty much like
the air game so you can use your hand as
a blob and I have a demo of this if you
want to try or had a true application
yep pretty cool I'm going to speed up so
now we haven't got long gum left in a
lot of these examples I have come over
and see me this one here ah this is the
free d scanning one that I mentioned so
he can scan his face his body and he can
integrate that into his gameplay so
there's some applications today that
support it armor free GTA 5 skyrim more
coming
hello hello hello so this is a scan of
his face body and we can include it into
a game now for example of augmented
reality and all of this you can do with
real sense you know just need camera and
okay just to wrap it up right so I'm
gonna wrap it up now so how to get
started pretty much download the SDK you
need hardware obviously so anything wolf
ginning above intel core OS wise windows
64-bit 8.1 or 10 languages we spoke
about that and also unity okay so i
think we can wrap yeah just wanna yeah
so any any questions guys so had to move
a bit faster day any questions yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
