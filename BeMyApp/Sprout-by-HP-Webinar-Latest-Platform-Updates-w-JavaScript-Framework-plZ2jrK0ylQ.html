team I will give a couple minutes before
getting started with the webinar and to
give another other people to join so
we'll start in two minutes
you
let's get started with the webinar first
of all let me welcome you on behalf of
this proud team and today we'll be
showing you how to take advantage of
your JavaScript skills to create
applications using sprout a couple of
housekeeping before elements before we
get started we have a chat window that
you can access on your right side if you
have any questions we will also have our
engineers from the platform team and who
who's been working on all this framework
they will be able to answer questions at
the end also we will be recording the
session so later you will be able to
have access to it and finally just
comment that for showing the
applications we will actually be showing
live on the on sprout because it's a
best way for you guys to understand or
have a good experience on on how these
api is work so um yeah so let's get
started and this is what we're going to
cover the following our first of all
I'll give you a quick intro to sprout
and the spread of element and then my
colleague way Seto will be showing you
how to take advantage of your JavaScript
skills and to create applications for
its prey you will be doing a live demo
session and also will be showing you the
a the sprout emulator will show you
later when were to find some test
machines and finally we'll be answering
your questions on an accusation wiki not
frontier so let's get started so first
of all sprout is the new immersive
computing platform by HP what we have
done is Raymond personal computing into
what we call immersive computing for
that we created this product that you
see here first of all is a
high-performance all-in-one machine so
make no mistake is a full our windows
8.1 machine without 23 inches full HD
touch screen and it has all the elements
that
machine high-performance machine will
have an processor intel i7 8gb of ram in
a media gb now what makes it very
special is the other components that
comes with the machine so the second
component that comes with it is this a
detachable touch matt it's a it projects
a second screen on top of it and it's a
very flexible detachable removable and
very resistant you can actually spill
any liquid and we have marketed with
sharpies crayons and at the end you just
put a little bit of Windex on it and
clean it off and it will all will come
out it's a twenty touch point it's a
multi-touch it's a capacitive mat so you
can do so the detection is done actually
on the map and the other interesting
part of the sprout is the illuminator so
the illuminator is this part that is on
the top it contains contains an array of
cameras it has a 14 point 6 megapixel
camera as well as a real sense sensor it
also has a built in less a LED LED desk
lamp any has a mirror that actually
projects the second screen onto onto the
mat the projector actually on the back
of the unit now the idea behind the
illuminate error is allowing creative
minds to bring elements from the real
work very quickly capture elements from
the real world only in a matter of
seconds so that is what sprout is for
any hardware's a hardware perspective
now we have also integrated this concept
of blended reality and what we want to
say what it is allowing the creative
minds to bring things from the real war
into the detail work in a very
simplistic approach in a very seamless
way for instance what the this is
actually a picture that we took from the
maker faire here in the Bay Area couple
weeks back and what these artists is
doing is a graffiti artist is is
painting on top of this mask
every time that he been something he is
taking a snapshot in this stop-motion
application and at the end he is able to
create a video with it another another
use case has been that we also show
there was an origami application where
we were users will be able to give this
all right sorry bada Saudi another
application was for instance we have an
origami application in a marketplace
where we actually distribute these
product kitchens where people can take
advantage of the projection to that will
instruct in how to fold the paper and
create origami pieces so this is sort of
augmented reality use case another
important element that we have been
working on is truly so what we intend is
to make 3d accessible to everybody right
now Trudy is very complex you need to
know I know about the technology itself
we want to bring the whole creation
process and pretty from scanning to the
printing in a very simplistic approach
we're still working on parts of it and
there is elements that we have already
by level in or in this proud machine
like the 3d snapshot we are able to
actually scan an element like the what
you see on the screen shot we ask an eye
sea shell and now we brought it into the
drama software and we are printing it
with a remote 3d printer because you can
actually use any application that we
runs on Windows that's the big advantage
now these are a couple of ideas of the
things that are possible or what we
think that can be done with sprout but
what is more important is what do the
developers will be able to bring to the
table so some examples of the n/r for
instance annotation
capture collaboration dual screen taking
advantage of the two screens study out
of the machine bring in a lot of objects
and elements to the digital world and
our augmented reality using the
projector the projected light on top of
real objects it also gives a very
interesting this case now let me let me
tell you a little bit about the SDK and
the platform in order to develop for
sprout you you have a couple options you
have there are very standard development
options first of all you can develop as
you will do it with any desktop
application you can use WPF and I win a
Microsoft the net and you can also use
C++ now we are today introduced in the
development using web technologies like
html5 css3 and JavaScript which is
pretty exciting now in terms of the
development environment you can either
use a visual studio and you can also use
cute creator if you decide so to develop
in C++ using cute but at the end you can
use any C++ editor do you want to use
the good thing about these tools that we
are showing here is that there is a free
Community Edition that you can take
advantage and then you can just download
from the way their website now for
JavaScript and web development you can
use any tool that you currently use that
goes for notepad to whatever it will you
have been using and now in terms of the
API is that you can take advantage of
for sprout I mentioned already that you
normally will do standard windows
development so now apart from these
different the sender development that
you will do for a Windows application
you can use some of the functions that
we make available to take advantage of
the specific hardware elements of sprung
for instance the cameras you can capture
multiple objects on the in a matter of
seconds
we also have functions for performing
text extraction or OCR and we also have
so maybe our object tracking and
recognition so you can put one item on
top of the touch mat then the API will
train which is the object that is being
recognized in from that moment on you
can put down any other element and it
will only recognize the element that are
that it was trained with and it will
also give you the angle that the
orientation of that element so it's a
pretty cool api we also have a couple
api's that to take advantage of the two
screens first of all we have we have the
API that allows to window application to
push one of the windows into the touch
man it will make sure that the that
window on top of the Dutch matt is full
screen and its topmost you also have
some control of the soft keyboard and if
you decide so you can also control some
of the mat events they would normally go
to the windows that here but you can
actually get them before they go to the
windows layer all right so uh now I'm
gonna get the word to my colleague way
Seto who will be talking to you about
using javascript to me sprout apps so uh
let me just go to settle
okay sit all yours Thank You Reuben I
hope everyone can hear me well good
afternoon to everybody my name is why
sato i'm also a technical manager in
this proud team just like Ruben being
with the sprouting for a couple years
now I've been working with a few
statistic partners and community of
developers to develop applications on
sprout so today I actually very excited
to introduce our two of our development
tools to you guys we just made them
available Monday and so I will be
introducing the JavaScript framework
that we have and also also the emulator
that we just made available so I have a
little bit of a drive through today so i
apologizing the events I try not to
cough into the microphone directly but
you won't get infected at least so he's
the quicker gender for the JavaScript
section so we're going to dive in a
little bit and talk about what the
framework contains and how it comes
about and why we choose that way this
particular framework and then we go
through the popular features that we are
get from the sprawl SDK seven integrate
into the framework then the exciting
part is actually do the life coding
their life typing of the offer of a
JavaScript application to show you how
easy it is to arm to create an
application in just a few minutes and
then we'll obviously show you the you
know information on where to get this
framework to develop source for sprout
so this JavaScript framework when our
sprout team started to work on
JavaScript we have identified a
framework all n wjs and previously the
name is actually called nope WebKit
framework from the name itself not
WebKit you probably can imagine it takes
advantage of two popular web technology
communities one is the milk Jas
community and the other one is the
WebKit or in this case actually the
chromium community the great work of
these two communities of providing the
great html5 JavaScript feature so the
framework itself had these two features
building with no Jes support and also
call me and support the sprout team
using this framework and integrated our
SDK API into this framework so with a
very simple set of API call developer
can access to the spa SDK and the sprout
you leaked out where features that way
so so what are the features that we have
made available through this framework
through the small SDK and through this
framework to me the developer developers
can utilize our horizontal screen where
we actually call it a touch map where
rubinettes show you the picture of our
sprout in his introduction we also have
virtual keyboard where developer can
enable and disable programmatically d
our act X access to the camera and the
sensor of the illuminator is also
available through the JavaScript
framework so with that you can easily
capture objects on the touch mat and get
the result back as images or segmented
images for each object itself the other
feature that support all these capturing
and math displays are you can get the
outline and the contour of each of the
object from the images
we have an OCR capability where when you
scan the piece of tracks you can
actually retrieve the text into your
program and and and manipulate from
there last but not this and this is very
interesting use case is object tracking
we enable object tracking through our
sensors where when you put some tea d2d
pictures and objects on the mat the
sprout can actually recognize them and
track them as they move along on the
catchment itself so i will try to
demonstrate as many as possible if the
time is allow me to do so but since we
have also the emulator demo we need to
kind of move pretty fast so from this
point are going to jump directly into
our some coding exercised to show you
how easy it is to do a live javascript
programming so let me get out of this no
just weaken so what I'm showing you on
the screen right now is our framework so
when you go to our website and download
the framework and then sip the package
you will see such a file structure in
the photo um this is a very typical
WebKit or NW Jes structure where it has
NW XD XE which is the executable runtime
that will run the HTML and JavaScript
code and you will have some other HTML
file here and possibly some other
JavaScript if your program is very
complicated um so before I start coding
one thing to call to attention is this
file call pack
json file let me so this package.json
file is very similar to other
application system record the manifest
file it kind of indicate what your
application name is a version number the
the main line here is the interesting
part is kind of the entry point of the
application if you're familiar with
javascript HTML you always thought with
some kind of HTML file and then you from
there you include your JavaScript you
link to all the external sources and
things like that so in this case the
name of the of the main files are
indexed on HTML and you can really use
any file name you like you can call it
app start HTML or main dot HTML if you
like and then the next section is about
what the windows are property is like
this the way for the size or is it
rather a full screen or not full screen
application so these are pretty
self-explanatory the part that is an
interesting is that i'm going to show
you is this toolbar arm attribute so
these actually related to the chromium
toolbar and if we enable this toolbar
attribute it will allow us to debug our
co you with the JavaScript console and I
will show you in a bit when we actually
get to the practical or run the code so
now that I'll make that change and go
back to my main HTML file and start the
fun part so here i have the HTML file
template it's a very typical HTML
template although you can see the syntax
is actually we're kind of simplifying it
is not
really you know with the html5 tech
there but it works on so we have this
script portion in inside their head
section which is typically where you
type your coat and also 50 from the HTML
body where you would define your UI
presentation so I'm going to start
typing code now so in order to use the
framework in XX to our sprout capability
it's very simple what we need to do is
take advantage of the note GS convention
to utilize a module that our sprout team
has created named sprout now these
linings all you need to actually
instantiate a sprout object and from
there you can actually access all the
API that's available through these
object so just one line go on the next
thing that I would add to the code is to
utilize the mat horizontal screen now
the man horizontal screen is another
unique feature of sproul so what I'm
doing here I'm just simply adding a
function called show map and that in
order to use the to open up the map
again like I mentioned before i will
start using this project that i acquire
through the previous line is actually a
global variable so i can just do sprout
dot and the method is open met with the
Prime murder of Matt thought extreme
mail for now and I'll show you so this
method HTML is another HTML file that is
inside the package and it's also a very
simple
HTML file we have so basically what
we're doing there is that opener mat and
load this dictionary fi a color map HTML
now here in this case you can actually
low any Life website onto the mat itself
or you can reload any Life website on to
the horizontal screen as well well you
can do that by just basically changing
the windows location of each of each
other our windows handled so now this
function is done one line of code will
display the math dot HTML on the
horizontal screen in order for that to
work I actually do need a button at the
bottom and we're going to just go to the
corner look at that on click function
and then just read for this to our
function we just created here keep it a
label and close the tag now with this
are three four three lines of code now
we can load the mat itself and the next
thing that I would add is actually the
capture capability of spryer itself now
with the sensor on the on the smile we
can actually capture physical objects
and separate them into different images
so and the co is for also very simple
what we doing here is very similar we
create a function call capture let's do
a lowercase to keep consistent ok
and what we going to use as in actually
describing a documentation is a
JavaScript syntax called promise
basically the promise syntax if you're
not familiar with it is that for
asynchronous operation of the jaws or a
JavaScript we can have very simple a way
of writing them so that when one
asynchronous function is finished the
next function will execute immediately
after that when the function get
returned so what we will do is do some
typing now it could be that you know a
little looks a little complex but it's
actually very easy to understand so we
start with sprout capture which is the
main capture function offer by the SDK
the next our operation we enter is
actually called then basically this is
the arm the syntax for promise when this
prowl capture actually returned the
syntax will take us to the next function
without blocking the the threat itself
so now I have this function here it
would be easier if I now move up so in
saida function what we do is just go and
return sprout not get picture this is
another function that is documented in
that API so when we pass in the ID to
that function now we're using these ID
we can actually get the picture that we
capture from from the mat itself that's
it now that's the first part to capture
and then we using the ID that is
returned and get the picture the next
thing we're going to do is actually
putting the email image itself on the
map and that's kind of just the already
normal JavaScript you know programming
to get that to work so the sprout
specific box already done what Nick's we
doing is actually just common javascript
programming where with displaying the
images onto the onto the screen itself
so what we hear will do is arm we will
find a document element call result
which will create in a moment and the
image tag is or the image element itself
needs to set a source and we're going to
use inline data in this case because we
have the image data coming back in the
function itself
now you notice the function actually got
passing with an object this object is a
tree of our pictures or we call it a
moment in the sprout development concept
where it has all the images where we
second it from the map itself when we
capture the audio objects from the mac
so image and that will return me the
right image so I set the image source
the next thing is very simple I would
then set the arm width of the image 1024
let's say and mix this the height to 720
and say now that's all good if
everything goes well you all know error
and you get everything you need but arm
things not always happen the way we want
it so we added a little bit of a very
handling in this case where when the
function actually fail we at least know
that if L so what we're going to do is
we're going to add our capture barrel
here and now I need to make sure this
stuff are in the right kosher so let's
see if
miss anything and of course it was typo
okay so and as I mentioned or of course
we do need another button to trigger
this function just like we had before
and it's called capture and we'll give
it a label capture okay now we also need
a picture element where we can actually
you know update a picture to our image
element so we can update the result from
our capture moment okay let's put that
and then set the source to also know
okay so so as I'm typing it um you're
probably thinking okay these guys gonna
make a lot of mistake and it's not going
to run and I think the same way as well
but I have some some helper that dicks
to me and catch my typos so let's let's
run this give it a give it a go of
course like any of the cooking show I
have you know complete code that works
in leave i need to replace them i will
replace them so um so that's the Cole
let's close that up and this is the time
we switch to the camera behind me so you
look a little bit string oh but we will
be there
let's see okay the camera is getting the
screen we should have it momentarily ok
so I hope you are seeing the artists
plough itself and and it's still the
same machine then I was just doing
coding so let's let's run the code that
we have just added so we close the index
on XML now to execute the sample that we
just did what we need to do is just run
NW exe remember ages ago when I talk to
you about the package.json file I have
the toolbar set to enable and this is
where you get the toolbar and in order
to debug you just click on it and find
your source and there you go you can
actually use this council to expect
inspect your elements and debug your
JavaScript code here so in order
so let me just quickly set one big point
and it will not look like that already
passed so so to show the screen I'll
click on this button I hit my break
point just to show you that it breaks
here map HTML and I continue to run for
I continue on here so now you can see on
the bottom or a horizontal screen that's
where we have this hello from sproul
matte screen there apologize for the
rainbow in fact that you seeing because
the projector is actually I believe
running a 60 rehearse and then our 60
mike harrison and these cameras probably
not catching it everything but the next
thing that i just want to show you is to
capture capability that way we have just
coded so that's my put two objects on
the map if i type everything correctly
in that long promise statement it will
start the capture and momentarily the
pictures should come back
okay it doesn't so we do a quick oh ok
ok so the co actually was correct so I
didn't well again like I said no just
help her behind me to point out all the
typos that I me but it worked so so
going back I think looking at the co
itself it was only about like five
minutes of coding and I could display
the mat and also run the capture feature
would pretty simple coding and then
stick it into html5 when all this is
very exciting because you got the html5
that features that behind you with all
the vector graphics and offline online
capability and video capability we're in
already ability into chromium plus with
the noche as modules you can access the
file system if you're familiar with the
OGS or excess to abate a big range of
database system like c.coli my sequel is
already building with third-party no
modules and that's the power of web
technology where you know is open and
there's a lot of contribution now that
was the coded I had written in in a few
minutes what I want to show also is some
already built sample code that we have
in particular I want to show you the
object checking that we mentioned before
so the sample codes available on our
website and there are instructions on
how to run them now what you're seeing
is something called the object tracking
our sample so what I did is what I
wasn't going to do is first i'll hit the
initial i object tracking and
will place a postcard on the map and
I'll train the system to understand or
recognize this postcard and then the
training is done now in fact I can train
another object this is a USB package
that we have trained it again which is
one button and take a picture and our
system is trying to be recognizing that
picture so it also say object capture
successful so so at this point what I
would like to do is actually see if I
can maximize this to you for you yes I
could okay so this is the sample go and
let me scroll down a little bit and when
I say start tracking you can see some of
the data
actually updating itself now basically
what we're seeing is the x coordinate
and the y coordinate and the package
itself and it the name is object to
because this is the second object that
we capture so if I move it on the screen
the coordinates are actually updating at
real time and actually is fluctuating a
bit because it capturing the object
itself due time so but it does recognize
the same object and I'm moving around
now if I take it out the data is
actually stopped updating itself now
remember i put the postcard in there now
when i put back the postcard i'm not
sure if you see the taxi cell but it
actually say object once back onto the
mat and now i can move it around and
it's updating is coordinates again and
that's kind of the object tracking for
you arm for each sample code that you
download from our website you can
actually view the co it's very simple
and i'll let you
you know down low I'll go and explore
how these object tracking and training
works but like I said all the code that
available on our website had sample go
in there and you can view the code as
you need it I actually have couple other
samples to show you maybe I'll do one
more before we switch to the emulator
the other one is actually the OCR
capability JavaScript application
similarly I run the application a piece
a piece of paper on the on the madness
l/r with some description so if I click
on scan text in this case i'll do
another capture and our computer vision
library behind the scene and the OCR
engine is actually reading our the code
now I mean reading the text and able to
extract the text and this is and
Wikipedia article from for a big part in
sesame street so again the co is
available is only now let's see one two
three four five see it's only 10 lines
of code and you can capture the article
itself and also extract the text so so
ten eyes plus or minus so that's the
javascript portion that i want to show
you as a live demo and now i'm switching
back to my own desktop and we are about
to go to emulator but before that let me
remind you that the javascript is
available now in sprout xpcom /
developer and all the examples that I've
shown you are also available to download
we have the framework excel and api
reference and packaged packaging
documentation as well so so feel free to
explore our travel
good framework the next thing that we
will do a demo pretty quickly as well is
the sprout emulator we recognize that
getting this ball however as it
sometimes may not be available for
everybody but you can still develop with
the simulation mode on our platform what
we have added to the development to set
is the spa emulator with the emulator
you practically can have these prowl
experience on a non sproul hardware
configuration like this picture that I'm
showing you you can use a regular laptop
and a external monitor to simulate a to
screen experience of a hoss prowl and
with the emulator you can actually try
it out the workspace experience yourself
will show you shortly and we recognize
the sproul itself has a few hardware
keys where I have some very interesting
interaction that when the consumer is
actually using the sprout and so we
actually emulate those key in this
configuration as well so we will show
you how it was basically like a key
combination where you got you heat out
one or two and our free will kind of
simulate the hardware key experience for
you so now I'll stop sharing my
presentation we go to a live camera to
show you the emulator experience so let
me switch that to see dear and so we can
share the camera okay um
here we're looking at a nonce prowl
configuration but we can run the
emulator width so like I explained
before this is an external monitor with
a regular laptop the external monitor is
going to act as a the hour our HD screen
for spre which is the 1920 x 1080 and
then the laptop screen is going to be
emulating the touch map itself so now
the emulator up till you download the
package your install is going to be an
icon on your desktop it's called a
sprawl emulator and let's launch that
from the desktop by the way I have so
heap helping me running the emulator
while I'm talking so when you started
this brow you have this Start screen
just like the sprout hardware itself
where you can tap in the center to start
the section with the spell session what
you will see is the gallery part on the
vertical sigh and a landing page on the
horizontal screen or in this case which
is a laptop screen itself you know this
is the experience is very similar to
actual spot we have three panels on the
vertical screen we have the project the
images and the applications and notice
the application right now is empty
because we're going to install an
application later on but right now it's
empty we will show you how the third
party application interaction is going
to work now with this with this emulator
one of the one of the purposes is
actually give a developer a sense of
what's prowess and and how the workspace
is helping consumer to create stuff so
the create application in this emulator
actually it works
so it's very similar to actual sprawl
when the creative space is on is
available you can use that to draw or
you can are you know track some pictures
and put it in and create your own
postcard a poster but the other thing
that we can directly access from here is
to capture capability we also simulate
the platform also simulate these
capability so let's do a capture from
our from from the emulator mode so with
the camera button we can just click on
it and it will start to emulate the
capture so these what we call the you
know simulation data that because we
don't have the Eliminator to capture on
the sensor on the top so so we provide
saw some predefined data we call the
mock data where you know will simulate
the object creation and segmentation so
so what we just did is we do a capture
of the map and we stimulate the you know
object segmentation with the individual
object so we accept these pictures they
will be part of the creative space and
then we also save in the gallery images
panel so this is again if given a
developer a sense of how our workspace
actually function with the emulator
itself so that's very powerful the other
thing that we would like to show you
mention is the hardware keys so for
example if I want to bring up a virtual
keyboard so here we'll pass out one okay
I think you have to hold it a little bit
longer there you go ice on the vertical
screen I mean the horizontal screen
right now so that is actually a
programmable virtual keyboard where
third-party applications have access to
through the SDK so let's close the
virtual keyboard right all right the
other key that we want to show you is
the what the HOME key of the sprout
whenever you hit the HOME key are you
will toggle back to so let's close the
gallery first the vertical screen so
let's say you're in the desktop mode and
you've been writing documents with word
or presentation and you want to get back
to this brown or the workspace hardware
typically what you do is you hit the
home key weather which is on the buckle
but in this case we simulate the the key
with all to we would be able to bring
back the arm the gallery and the landing
page itself and that's a very helpful
interaction when third-party developer
one to create an application and make
sure the interaction we're going back to
the workspace is working so we provided
the hardware key at this way as well the
last thing we are going to show you is
to actually installing an application
into the emulator so let's close the
gallery vertical so we already made a
installer in this case when we install
this application just like any windows
application has an installer and we're
going to go through the install itself
go ahead and it's pretty fast and this
location is done with JavaScript itself
just like the previous experiment
example we will point to install it's
done so what happened is when we install
a sprout application what we do is
replace it in the application panel so
it will bring up the gallery again you
see this little Pacman figure right now
is under the applications panel so the
other interaction with this brow is
actually you can you can drop this
application onto the landing page as a
launcher so you can drop or consumer can
drop your favorite application onto the
map when we did that you can you notice
on the laptop screen or the horizontal
screen has an application now so and
typical interaction is that you tap on
it and will bring up an application onto
the small screen so this is an image
capture examples from Malcolm and if you
heat the capture button the same mark
data that we mentioned before will
showed up in this application so on all
these mock data and simulation leader is
behind the scene of the SDK so the
actual call to the sdk is the same so
developer doesn't have to change
anything when they get it working on the
emulator they could just no package it
up and running on its prow and they will
do the actual capturing now with that I
have spoken a lot already and so and we
have done our emulator demo as well so i
will switch the presentation back to
ruben yes Rubin
the screen yes all right you should be
able to see my screen now okay so just
to conclude the webinar I'll and before
we go to a quick Q&amp;amp;A we want to share
with you some locations where we have
some testing sprout machines you can
just you can just go there and play
within and and amuse them we have some
machines in the hacker dojo an amount of
you have two units there and we also
have some machines at the tech shop in
San Francisco so you can feel free to
use those machines on those occasions
and if you think about some other
location where you will be interested in
us to have testing machines please just
let us know using the chat window and
we'll we'll be analyzing this
information and just to conclude well
and we have a repository of information
is our developer website sprout at
hp.com / developer you can find their
resources dzk documentation sample apps
in some additional resources like a
firown' developer forum guidelines and
downloadable your ex assets and with
that I will leave it for its own Q&amp;amp;A and
let me see if there is some questions
here okay i think the woods first a
question about nodejs the question was
in just a second
is very small that if we can use the
node.js syntax so maybe you said to
receive Seto you can answer a question
right yeah I'm not hundred percent sure
what the question is you mean the syntax
in terms of getting the modules yes it's
just like it just like I show you you do
a modular require you know so module and
you have the API now um again look Jess
is JavaScript so all the others in fact
you just follow the JavaScript and
that's pretty much it for the modulo
itself there are tons of other ways of
creating those modules one of the thing
that our team has look into is called
the hjs where the edge is actually allow
you to our tap into some tea shop
library and C++ libraries so I believe
he's also work on objective c library
but that's kind of out of scope so i
hope i answer the question please Alice
again if I'm not addressing it correctly
ok and the other question is that is the
marketplace for building sharing and
settings for applications is there a
community room for this yes so we have
unspread marketplace and any any sprout
device has access to this marketplace in
we are actually encouraging the
developers to create an applications in
submitting those marketplaces in the
tools that we are the way of showing so
there is definitely a marketplace for
for those applications I don't know if I
said is there anything that you want to
add on put upon that or nope I think
you're right well for anyone who are
interested in publishing app they all
feel free to contact us we have arm we
have our email here if you have any
other questions feel free to say that
will help you
okay there is another question you're
able to see these very well it's very
easy okay well if you yeah Reuben they
can actually click on the little arrow
button and will expand the question box
itself is easier to see that way ok
here's 3d dead in the SDK okay so we
still don't have an API for being able
to take advantage of the 3d scanning yet
but that is something that we are
working on so I'll say that wait for
some news later on on that there's
another question for you Josh have a lot
the rule when I have instant understand
and it's a touchscreen laptop can I use
that as a touch month three mics and
monitor as a sprung spin city one has
real sure um that's a great question I
we have done some testing with the
workspace and our software on winton is
not officially supported we haven't seen
too many issues with it so it should run
pretty okay if you encounter any problem
feel free to send us an email we will
get in touch with you and see how we can
fix it but uh we haven't encountered any
any any major issues are but i would say
still we have an officially supporting
Windows 10 because it's not official
releases yet and and and so that that's
the kind of the official answer right
now we will try to help you if if you
want to run on it in some issues
okay there is another question it says
can we project an image / capture of
York on the map after capture image
first and change the color of an object
for example I think I can answer that
question when you when you get the image
you are do you can get as many images as
the objects you have on top of the mat
and then you can do within whatever you
want because you basically have the
image itself now if you're projecting it
on the top of the real object there is a
couple things to consider if the image
ed if the element the object that you
have doubled the mac is very flat and
it's not too high normally the
projection is kind of one to one it's
kind of sometimes hard to recognize
which one is image which one is the real
one if the object is much higher imagine
for instance an orange then the because
its projected it's going to look a
little bit are different because there
is some shadow on on it as well that it
gets projected but in terms of changing
the color will it depends of if you
wanna change the color of the rear
luggage if you have a white object for
instance and you're projecting you
modify the image to another color and
project on top of the object you cannot
get a feeling that is a pretty cool
thing about the amenity reality like if
you have a piece of paper and you have
an object on the piece of paper just
scan it and then you can modify the the
image color and then project on top of
this same paper used you will notice
that that's kind of a materiality in
that in that sense I hope that I was
answering the question properly let me
know if you if I wasn't ok there is a
continuation from last question can I
use the laptop screen to emulator de to
emulate a touch not an external monitor
and sprout screen ok so it's can use the
laptop screen to emulate the touchsmart
an external monitor as a sprout screen
so you pretty much can choose either of
the
and so in the in the in the
demonstration that settled provided he
use it he used the monitor as they as
the as the monitor of this product and
the Nocturnals attachment but you can
actually configure it's just a matter of
going to be to the settings in selecting
which is the main screen 11 addition to
what we're going to set also is not
required but if either of your screen
either the laptop royalty on the
external monitors is touch enable that
will help a lot as well it's not
required like I said with with the non
touch laptop or external monitor it will
still work you just require mouse click
but there is something a lot easier if
one of the monitor is touch enabled you
can actually utilize the touch events
from the operating system itself to be
closer to what the sprout can actually
offer and so that's just one addition to
the question go to the answer ok there
is a little question about the hacker
dojo antique shop if you need to be a
member to use the machines ah you have
Cynthia right there with you maybe she
can answer that you know can you can she
come in and up oh okay um so here yeah
they don't have a microphone on them so
the answer i got from the them is that
yes you do need a membership of the two
in order to use this sprout in hockey
Tojo and in the tech shop i also have an
amendment that as well in addition i
just got the information sorry they also
have daily membership so you can go in
and try to get it if you want ok another
question how to convert WPF app to kno
jes you want to
that settle or a sim well III can first
comment but the if she wants to add do a
feel free to after I mean ah so it is
hard to say there is a need to do that
like if your applications are running
well um we support both we actually
originally support more functions and
features in shoe shop WPF so I we don't
really see the need it is running well
but the shoe shops in Texas actually
very similar the JavaScript if you look
at it I mean there has to be certainly
some work has to be done in terms of
some of the special I classes and
utility then offering from WPF arm but
these I mean as you know in terms of
writing this the shoe shop languages in
Java shoe is very very close but not not
entirely knows the same see if you want
to add anything ya know I kimchi's ok
you keep but yeah it depends it on your
knee like again we available to discuss
with you as well if that's something you
really really want to do we don't we
don't see any honest a huge difference
between the two but if you want to do it
we're happy to discuss with you and why
you want to do that ok the thing this is
just a continuation if we can share same
library so i think i'm gonna skip it
because it goes to the same common
question one will there be support for
sprout in australia as the hardware is
not currently available here okay so um
the i believe the DSD k can be
downloaded from any place right setup
yeah yeah so the user k can be
downloaded the right now the hardware we
are not selling it there i I don't think
we have or we have a data we have
announced yet in terms of that but uh
the moment that it is maybe we can come
back to you as well there I don't know
if anyone in the room has any comment
about that yeah we don't we don't we
don't we don't we don't really share any
non-public information over the webinar
but we are we can assure you that we're
working really really hard to get sprout
two to two other you know major markets
and Australia definitely one of the
major market obviously so keep an eye on
our or now or now sprout directory.com
website as soon as we we know we can and
as we talk about it then we'll be on our
website and on our newsletters yeah and
and obviously you know come come to our
program and register and we could we
will also send you know update
up-to-date information as well through
our website another question is what
kind of oh we're actually six minutes
past the hour but maybe we will continue
and if if there is no problem for for a
attend it so what kind of applications
are you looking for from developers how
big is equal marketplace is there any
registration for being unofficial
developer like iOS another so uh I'll
answer part of this question and maybe
city can learn more we are looking for
applications that take advantage of the
sprout of this product capabilities
that's kind of the main elements it
could be of any kind of applications as
long as they are according to some
content guidelines in terms of the
content itself but but that take
advantage of the elements that the
camera the dual screen that's the kind
of applications that we are looking for
we do have a marketplace we are growing
our community we're growing the number
of applications that we have and we are
very happy to do work or if you have any
questions to suppor you guys on on any
difficulty that you may have in or any
big idea that you have we currently we
don't charge anything for registration
you just can find it you can find the
information in this parish pecan /
developer in I think that that's where
you will find all what you need on set
that you have any comment uh so you
don't you don't necessarily need to
register to get our SDK in the tools in
the framework but if when you decided to
publish it in our marketplace you do
need to register um although I mean we
strongly encourage you to register
because that's how we know people are
interested in our platform and we cannot
get you update and it's really
encouraging to people register register
anyway on the publishing side we do
require you register a publisher can and
accept the terms and condition as a
publisher because that's just normal
anything the last common thing is kind
of on the same one is to bring the
sprout into University so thanks for
feedback it ended at something that will
be exploring and we'll be analyzing
anything all right I think those are all
the questions that we have I think on
behalf of the sprout team we appreciate
a lot you were taking this time and
actually going a little bit further away
OOP and I want to help one thing that I
forgot to mention and and then behind me
actually reminded me this play publish
accounts also free so actually virtually
there's no charges at all with
developing sore spot right now so I just
want to make sure people get that
message across okay all right thank you
settle then um I think that if there are
no more questions uh we just hope you
have a wonderful rest of the day and
we'll see you in our next in our next
events or webinars wrong thank you very
much
