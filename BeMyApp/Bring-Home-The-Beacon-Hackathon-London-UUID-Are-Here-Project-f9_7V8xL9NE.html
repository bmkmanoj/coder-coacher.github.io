the market on it's been great how these
people have been and very happy product
practice and developed unless it's a
design concept its new UI dr here and
the ideas because I'm arrived and we'll
go get to go to get used to weakens and
the fact of your home and underneath
where other information can be
transferred via these bitches and more
solution I want to use these for is a
getting studio picture one from events
that you are so if you go to a concert
in this case on this example it's a
Radiohead concert and you can actually
have pictures tables by a high quality
cameras from the stage and from you and
from the site and and the apartment you
will be carrying a mobile phone the
beacon or give arrived in your seat and
and for the
of course that will see yes she wants a
picture taken and it will take a picture
of you so lame delever so I'm the media
you can get daddy or our pictures driver
is the best media orbital energy
affected and any account so any tickets
that you've already and managed to book
online and we'll have this ad on page
and what the ad on page consists off is
a as camera possessions so if you want a
picture from the stage or if you want a
picture from beside your seat the left
hand side on the side you see to the
right hand side or from the back door or
if you want your to tour during program
and a t-shirt and things like that then
you can order it from this page and
that's information what just gets tagged
on to rock retailers were plenty that so
you'd make my point your course over all
these days your life and you have all
the information area and as you go
through the day the beatles danger and
the because and take notes or we take
the pictures we tell the camera the
camera takes picture the informations
update it and tell all your all the
media leave ordered em has been felled
out and you can pick up your merchandise
me and then not sure complete it's all
gone smoothly and
and the distribution is then taken care
of so you can see this picture here put
on facebook despot picture yes budet on
edgewater email me oh you know and I
smell you on youtube so you can actually
and also if your social media room who
you want to distribute onto I'm hoping
to em provide the solution first doing
events such as outdoor the place to get
some opportunities smoothly and the the
project site is used is in the walkway
at work because no ok we can have a
relative who comes out Sarah so the
beacon itself is that extra bit of
intelligence with actually says take a
picture and then send it up to the
horses so and other events might be one
of the Oprah or open forum such
festivals where you've gone quite a bit
of a distance and not you enjoy it from
one stage to the other there's a beacon
see most wish i was able to see oh here
she is now cheaper characters and so
hopefully you know we'll all around a
lot better pictures than that is
pictures of the backs of people safe
great thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
