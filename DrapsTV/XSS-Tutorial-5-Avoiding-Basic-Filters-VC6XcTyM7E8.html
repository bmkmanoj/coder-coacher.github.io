bypassing basic filters in this video
we'll be looking at a couple of methods
that we can use to try and get our
scripts through some basic filters every
video have all slideshows anchored
available in the description most of the
time getting your cross-site scripts to
work will not be as easy as it has been
in the previous tutorials though
sometimes you might get lucky with a
rookie programmer who has just finished
their site and is unaware of cross-site
scripting so we have to try some tricks
for the common defenses that a developer
might put in place usually these will be
through encoding observation or possibly
a different approach okay let's quickly
talk about magic quads GPC I recently
discovered is no longer supported by PHP
5.3 point 0 or higher magic words GPC
was a configuration variable that could
be turned on or off when it was on it
would change all single chords double
quotes backslash and null characters
into an escaped form of those characters
the PHP variable has been removed as
it's not a plausible solution to many
attacks as well as the fact that most
people were learning about SQL injection
and know how to defend themselves
against it more database specific
functions were designed to be used
instead for example the MySQL real
escape string function which you should
always use before you send an inputted
string to a MySQL database make sure you
learn how to set it up correctly for
your character set all right here's the
important part
people still use PHP for many websites
still use old versions of PHP because of
this many sites still rely on magic
quotes GPC as their only line of defense
some websites may add in a simple filter
to convert the magic quotes into the
HTML entity equivalent all right let's
try out by passing this type of filter
with a little trick to generate the
string at runtime
this means we avoid writing any quotes
or filtered characters to do this we use
the from char code in the string library
okay so we're going to come over to our
website and we can try our script like
before so script alert XSS
/script and this is just like our
scripts before except this time website
has a filter so we comment nothing will
happen
so it just gets added and script gets
cancelled out all right so we need to
try a different strategy so we need a
script tag still and we can either use
our alert and now we're going to use the
string library dot from Cha code all
right now what this from chaco does is
it takes s key numbers and it turns it
into a string so each ASCII number for
each character
so the SE number for X is 88 so put in
88 comma and now we need the char code
for s which is 83 so through 83 comma 83
so we have xs/s now we close off our
front char good close up our alert and
now we close off our script so open
slash close script all right so we've
got our new injection and we hit comment
and we get our XSS back cool so this way
the string the XSS string is generated
at runtime on the person's computer
rather than on the server all right cool
up until now we've relied on the script
tag to run all of our cross-site scripts
however as you may know with JavaScript
we can also run scripts from the
browser's address bar known as address
bar scripts you can give this a shot on
any website clear out the address bar
and type JavaScript : alert Open bracket
open quotes a word like hello closed
quotes and in closed brackets and hit
enter pretty fun yeah all right so let's
make use of this knowledge and craft a
JavaScript link the developer may have
straight-up blocked the use of the
script tag so let's create a link
instead
remember that quotes will still be
removed or replaced so we'll have to use
a workaround
get past that filter still okay so come
back over to the website I will just
spread out this comment box little bit
more I'm going to use the a tag I'm
going to set the hate ref to equal Java
Script : alert and now we're going to do
our string from char code again so
string dot from cha code and we're going
to do out 88 83 83 close off that and
close off the alert and now we can close
off our a tag and then we'll put in like
something like click me and then would
close off out a tag all right so let's
give it a shot
let's click comment and we have our
click Me button so if you hover over it
you can see down the bottom we have our
JavaScript alert string.fromcharcode if
we click on it we get our XSS pop-up
cool so let's clear out this table for
now and we can do the same thing as we
did just a minute ago except this time
let's use the HTML entities as a way to
put the quotes in which is a little bit
smaller so a href equals and we're doing
our java script : alert open brackets
and now we use the epicenter and quote
so quote without an e so quot and then
we do a semicolon on the end which means
turn this this entity here this and
quote semicolon into a quote mark and we
can do XSS and then we do the quote
market and so episode quot semicolon and
then we can close off our brackets and
close off our a tag and now
we can stretch it out a little bit and
do another click me escalation mark okay
and if we hit comment get that click me
and if we click it we get our XSS which
is a little bit shorter than doing it
with the string.fromcharcode and a
little bit easier to remember in my
opinion okay so this used to occur all
the time on forums that did not
correctly sanitize the link code all
right the next thing we'll be looking at
is bypassing some more advanced filters
will also talk about good practice for
protecting yourself against cross-site
scripting attacks you have any questions
leave it in the comments and I'll try to
answer it as best as possible don't
