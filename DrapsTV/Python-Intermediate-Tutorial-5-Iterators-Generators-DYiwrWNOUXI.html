iterators and generators every video
have all slideshows and code available
in the description we've used iterators
many times before as most containers can
be looped over with the for loop for
example for element in 1 2 3
Python implements this behavior with a
special method called
itter which returns an iterator object
from the container that has a next
method defined the next method
calculates the next item in the
container to return for use in the for
loop and there is no items left the
iterator stops the for loop by raising
the stop iteration exception this
exception tells python to stop the
current loop so let's have a look at
this quick example of what the for loop
does on containers so we have a
container defined with the characters a
b and c we then get the iterator of that
container using the it our method we
then can step through each one with the
next method of the iterator until we hit
the end and the stop iteration is raised
so let's try our own iterator on a
container for simplicity we use pythons
tutorials example which is iterating
over in a reverse order so let's call
our file reverse spy so M u-verse dot pi
ok now what we're going to need to do is
create a class so what we're gonna do is
call our class reverse reverse and we're
going to have an initialization for it
so death let's go to school in it let's
go on this call and it's going to take
self as well as some data that we're
going to be going through in reverse
order okay now what we're going to do is
we're going to set up our variables so
self dot data it's equal to the data
that we pass in and then we undo a self
dot index we're just going to keep track
of where we are currently it's just
going to equal
data like sorry the length of data so
Len data okay now we're also going to
define L in it our method so I'm just
going to sort eater let's go let's go
and that's going to take self and what
it's going to do is it's going to return
self because we're going to define our
next method inside our class so return
self now we're going to define one one
last method which is going to be our
next method next and that's going to
take our self okay now if self dot index
is equal to zero then we're going to
raise a stop iteration exception because
we've reached the end of that data okay
if we haven't reached the end of our
data then we're going to get self dot
index equals self dot index minus one
and then we're going to return our self
dot data at index and that's our reverse
order iterated done that's what I mean
so we can test it out mean and what
we're going to do is we're going to
create our iterator called Rev just
going to be equal to reverse with the
data dewdrops equal
okay now we can iterate over this with
our for loop so for char in Rueb print
char that's our main done alright our if
so if that's good name I'm just going to
school equal to main then I get a run
main ok let's save this and we'll give
it a shot so if we rerun our reverse be
yet hope we get an error
whatever missed oh I didn't put self dot
index inside that bracket so I open this
up I'll come back down here I forgot to
put a self for my index whoops oh woops
self dot next that should be blessed
except say that from a run TN and there
we go we get
Japs go backwards so II LC i SP AR d
okay so we've also got generators now
generators are another way of creating
iterators but this time we do it in just
a function there quick because they
generate all of the background code for
the next and it our methods the call
statement of generators is the yield
statement this saves the state of the
iterator and sets the point to resume to
when the next method is called okay
we've also got generator expressions
generator expressions are you are a
unique feature that Python uses these
allow iteration to be handled by Python
in just a single line expression in the
next example we'll look at making a
generator and then look at doing the
same task with a generator expression
their generator expressions are
uncommonly used you may encounter one in
another person's code and wonder what
it's doing okay so let's recreate our
reverse iterator except this time we'll
do it with with a generator okay
open my file back up and I'm going to
remove my class this time we'll get rid
of my a class and rather than use a
class I'm going to use a generator it's
just going to have a function called
reverse so def reverse and we're going
to pass in some data through reverse
okay
now inside our generator we're going to
have a for loop so for index in range so
we're just doing in a standard for loop
but in length of the data minus one
because we don't know where to go to the
last element we don't want to go out of
bounds and then we're going to go to
minus one so that way we will go out of
bounds and trigger and stop into the
stop iteration and we're going to go
down in increments of one so go again
and minus ones okay
and now for each index we're going to
yield which is kind of a return and a
pause kind of hard to explain and we're
going to return our data at index okay
and that's our reverse created we don't
have to change main because we called
our function the same thing so let's
save this and quit and let's run it and
we get the same thing out except this
time we use the generator rather than a
homebrew iterator okay so let's do the
same thing again except this time what
we'll do is we'll do a generator
expression okay so I work at rid of the
function this time I'll just add to our
main
so a couple of lines down in Maine I'm
going to create a new variable called
data and that's going to store the
string dropsical and with this data what
I'm going to do is print it out in a
list and then the list is going to be
made up of the reversed data so what
we'll do is we're going to data I and I
is going to be for I in range length
data minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 and close
that all off and that may look strange
because we have a for loop inside of our
in our code but that's actually a
generator so it will generate all of the
outputs and then put it into that list
and then we print that list out so now
if we save this and we run it we get
dropsical out for a mouth from our first
generator and then a second generator
puts it out in our list so ELC is P ard
along the bottom there in our list and
that's a generator expression ok so this
concludes our look at iterators and
generators extra code will be available
in the code text in the slides folder as
well as a challenge task
don't fear if you don't remember all of
this you can easily come back and
re-watch this video consolidate all the
information you have any questions feel
free to leave them in the comments
next we'll be covering modulating our
code thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
