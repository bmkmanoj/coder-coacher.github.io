six functions in this video we'll be
looking at putting together our own
functions and using dot M script files
every video have all slideshows and code
available in the description functions
are a way of associating a name with a
block of code generally the code in a
function is for a specific purpose or to
complete a certain task functions allow
us to give them variables to work with
as well as well as provide functionality
for returning an answer once it's done
in octave you can use functions to
organize your octave scripts and you
will see how in a little bit functions
follow roughly the same pattern as our
control statements however we've
specified that it's a function with the
function keyword then we specify a name
of a variable we are going to return
back as an answer for octave and then we
make that variable equal the function
name so here the function name is my
func name then inside the brackets of
our function we have our arguments these
can be a single variable or multiple
variables that we want to give to our
function to use if you're finding this a
little confusing hopefully it should
become clearer when we implement a
function later with octave we can define
a function inside the octave program but
more likely we'll create a function in
its own file for this we use M files
each function must have its own dot m
file this allows us to reuse our
function any time we like within octave
for example if we had a function called
mini our corresponding m file would be
mini dot m dot m files are just text
files that octave reads when a function
is called we can quickly open our text
editor from within octave by using the
Edit command and then the name of the
file that we want to open for example
edit mini dot m okay let's make a
minimum function octave already has one
called min but for learning purposes
let's make our own the function needs to
keep track of the lowest value in a
vector and compare to each element in
the vector so let's call the function
mini dot M well the function file mini M
okay so come over to octave and we're
going to use the Edit command and we're
going to open a file called mini m so
hit enter and we get your default text
editor so mines notepad plus plus and it
gives us some padding with just some
generated comments so we can take that
out and we can move that function to the
top of the file so we can get rid of
these brackets around our red so our
return variable and we it's going to
equal our function names called mini
which is the same as our file name and
we have our brackets so in our brackets
we want to take a vector X so we'll put
an X variable now now that we've got our
X variable we want to create our
function so we tab in 1 and we're going
to set our read value so return it
stands for our answer that we're going
to send back to octave so ret equals x
open circle brackets 1 so we want the
first element inside the X vector and
the reason we do this is because we want
to make sure that we return at least one
of the answers from inside vector X
because the first element may actually
be the smallest number okay so now that
we have our rep set to a value we need
to compare it to every other value
inside the X vector so let's do a for
font for loop so for I equals 2 up to
the length of X so we're going from 2
because we've already got we've already
got one inside our return so we don't
need to compare it against itself so up
to the length X and now we comma and
then we indent one once again
okay so inside here we're going to have
an if statement so if the x and then the
element at X I so whatever element we're
currently up to in the for loop is less
than the return value then we're going
to set the return value to equal x and
the ILU of x
now we're going to end this if and we're
going to end the four and that then we
have our end function there so this is
our function written so we pass in a
vector X we set the foot return value to
the first element then we go through
every single element inside the exit
vector and check if it's less than the
current return value if it is then we
want to set the return value to be the
lowest number that we found so far then
one once the code finishes inside the
function and it finishes this end
function that return value is sent back
to octave
okay so let's save this it's a roll s or
you can file save and we'll just
minimize it for now now back in octave
we can call our mini function but we
need a vector to pass in first so let's
create a vector V so V equals and what
we'll do is we'll just do random to
round and we want five values in one
column so the vector and well times that
by 10 so this will give us a number
between 0 and 10 so as you can see five
values are three point six nine point
four four point eight five point three
four and three point two five so the
lowest value that we have inside this
vector is three point two so let's test
our mini function to see if it's working
correctly so mini
so we just type the name of our function
open bracket and we pass in vector V and
then we can hit enter and are all run so
as you see we get back our answer three
point two five which is indeed the
lowest number in our vector okay so
that's our first function written so if
we come back over the slide show you
octave also supports multiple return
values this may be a new concept if you
have not used a programming language
that can return multiple values this is
great if you complete complete if you
can
two tasks at the same time okay let's
create a different version of their
minimum function that calculates the
minimum and maximum this is great
because we can do both tasks tasks in
the one loop so let's create a min max M
file for our function okay so come back
over to octave and I'm going to edit min
Max dot m and it will open it up in our
default text area we can rip we can
remove the don't comments and what we're
going to do is we're going to be
returning two different types so we need
the brackets this time so we're going to
return low which is a variable low and
we're going to return high which is our
variable high and high is going to be
our maximum number in the vector and low
is going to be our lowest number in the
vector and once again this is going to
take a value X which is going to be a
vector X and now we can copy the code
that we used earlier over to our min Max
and we only need to make a few changes
so instead of return so rat we need low
we're just going to be equal to x1 and
we need a high so high is equal to x1 as
well okay now we're going to go through
our for loop and it's going to be the
same as before and instead of our if X I
is less than our return it's going to be
if it's less than low so our variable
low if it is then low is going to be
equal to X I now we're going to use our
else--if now so else if X I is greater
than high comma then we're going to set
high to equal X I
and then we'll have our end and now now
this is our mimic max function done and
what we do is we we calculate the
minimum of a vector and the max of a
vector at the same time so we save this
we can come back over to octave and
let's give it a shot so we need two
variables to store it in to so to do
this we open up our square brackets and
let's save it into a and B so similar to
what we're returning we have our a comma
B equals min Max and we'll give it our V
vector so what's the maximum of our V
vector it's nine point four eight so we
should get back a equals three point two
five and B equals nine point four eight
so we run on this yep we get a equals
three point two five and B equals nine
point four eight so there we go if we
completed two tasks in the one function
all right
so we jump back to these slides now
octave also provides some simple simple
to use validation function functions
that we that can be used to error check
inputs into our functions so the N arg
in a variable stands for number of
arguments in it is built into octave and
stores the count of ignore the count of
the number of arguments that have been
passed into octave or into your function
we can use this to check if a vector has
actually been given to our min Max
function we can also use the is vector
function the checks if a variable X is a
vector we can use this to make sure that
we are trying to use a vector with our
for loop there is also the error
function this function stops the current
function and tells octave that an error
occurred at this line and that prints
the string that you give to it to the
user
like the error function the usage
function just prints out a string to the
octave window so let's use the
validation we learned to add air
talking to our min/max function we want
to make sure that if the user of our
function is is informed of Y the
function didn't work so let's edit our
min Max function so we'll come back over
to how notepad plus plus here and we're
going to do a check
straight off let's start here so if n
are in does not equal 1 , then we're
going to tab in and we're going to use
the usage function and we're going to
type min max open bracket vector just to
let the user know that they need to give
a vector to this function and then we
need an end onto that F now we need one
more F which is going to surround all of
our code so we're going to have if is
vector X so the value that's passed in
because we definitely know that
something's been passed in now then
we're going to run our code so it is a
vector so we're going to run all of our
codes so we cannot indent all of our
covered in one and we have our code done
so now we need our else so if it's not a
vector that's passed in we want to tell
octave that an error occurred so error
min Max expects a vector so this will be
an error that gets printed out to the
user and then we're going to end our
original F so if is a vector
run our code if it's not a vector print
out an error message and this is our
error checking done so if we save this
and we go back over to octave we can
give no values to our min Max so if we
just type min Max and expect it to do
something we get an usage so easier min
max expects the vector or
min/max vector okay so we can then say
let's let's create a matrix so hey let's
make x equals open square bracket one
space to Quogue semicolon three four
bakit so this is a matrix one two three
four
so let's try giving this to our min max
function so we're trying to give it pecs
and as you can see we get error min max
expects a vector so this will let the
user know that they're trying to give it
something that's wrong so you could even
go one step further and check if it's a
matrix and if it is a matrix tell them
you're trying to give it a matrix not a
vector but for now this will do and we
can just check that it's all working so
if we try and give it V again you should
get back our three point two five and
our nine point four so cool it's all
working correctly so jump back over to
our slide show this concludes the octave
tutorial hopefully you now have this
still the skills to feel confident using
octave I have plans for a machine
learning series which will use octave to
implement the algorithms feel free to
leave any questions in the comments and
I'll do my best to answer them thanks
