iteration everybody will have all
slideshows and code available in the
description iteration is part of the
third concept of programming which is
repetition repetition is the process of
repeating blocks of code over and over
this could be a defined amount or until
a certain certain condition is met
Python has two ways of repeating code
the for loop and the while loop the for
loop is used to iterate over a specific
number of times which in python is a
list we can use the function range which
takes a number as a parameter which will
create a list of numbers up to that
number but not including that number
then we can use the for loop syntax as
follows for step and step is a variable
that we create in range 5 : and then we
tap in to let the for loop know that
we've got a block of code and we type
print and then we print out the step
current step so this will print out step
5 times so starting at 0 and it will
increase to 1 to 2 to 3 and then to 4
and we'll finish okay so let's look at
how a full loop can be used let's create
a full loop to print out the numbers 0
to 4 let's create a new tooth 6 pi file
so come back over to bunt it and let's
create our file so then to 6 pi now
inside our file we're going to create
our main function to keep up our good
practice
so def main brackets call it then inside
our main function we're going to create
our for loop so for step and step is the
variable we create remember in range and
inside the range we want to count from 0
to 4 so that's 5 so we put in 5 so that
will count from 0 up to 5 but not
including 5 now we can do : and now
we're going to indent into our main and
we're going to indent into our for loop
ok so inside our for loop we're going to
print and print step so this will print
the step after each iteration of the for
loop ok
so now that we've done our main function
let's tell Python to use our main
function so if underscore underscore
name underscore underscore equal to open
quotes underscore underscore main
underscore underscore quotes : we're
going to run main okay so created our
code file let's save and quit this and
let's try running it so we want to do
Python 3 2 to 6 pi and when we run this
we get 0 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 simple and elegant
okay so let's let's create a list of
strings and print them all out will
create a list and add it to our existing
program ok
so let's jump back over and let's edit
our toutes 6 2 pi now we're going to
leave our first for loop in here
and we're going to add in another one
inside our main so what we are do first
is create our list of words so words
equals and open up the square brackets
because this is a list and then inside
we're going to create a string for each
word so cat comma bat comma hat comma
rat comma and we'll do Sat and we close
off our square brackets and that will
create us a list of words now we can
iterate over that list of words so let's
do for word so we're going to create a
variable called word in the list words
colon and now we're going to print out
the word so print word and this will
step over our list of words and we'll
put put each word into our variable word
ok
so let's save this and try running it
so Python three to six dot pi when we
run this we see we get zero to four that
we did earlier and we get our cat bat
hat rat and Sat
it's just that simple okay let's have a
look at while loops so the while loop is
for repeating a block of code until the
boolean expression is false so the wild
expression is true keep repeating the
code so let's create a while loop that
asks the user to input a value greater
than zero if they don't we'll ask them
again so editing our existing program
let's add a while loop so then to 6.5
now we're going to add a while loop
after our falls so aligned down we're
going to create a variable called num
we're going to make num equal to 0 to
start with now we're going to write our
while loop so syntax for a while loop is
the word while and then we have a
boolean expression similar to our if
statement so while num is less than or
equal to 0 colon we're going to run this
block of code so this block of code is
going to be one line so num equals int
open bracket input open bracket please
enter a positive integer colon close
quotes and close off our brackets so
what this whale is going to do is while
the number is 0 or less it's going to
keep asking them for a positive integer
ok let's write quit and try running this
so we're going to do Python 3 to 6 pi
now we get out of 0 to 4 again and our
captor sat and now we get please enter a
positive integer so if we enter 0 it'll
ask us again we enter 0 again it'll ask
us again if we put in a negative number
like negative 2 we get asked again but
if we put in a positive number like 2 we
get the program ends so it exits
the while loop okay
so a while is useful here because we
don't know how many times the user is
going to get it wrong okay so with while
loops there is the danger of infinite
loops meaning the loop that never ends
if we want if we if we want we can make
a while loop go forever until it is
interrupted by the keyboard with the
shortcut ctrl Z okay so let's make one
for fun we're going to create a while
that prints hello an infinite amount of
times okay so let's come back over and
we'll edit our current program serve in
to six pi okay now after all of our
whales are done we're going to create
add an infinite loop so we're going to
type whale we're going to just hard code
true so while true : and then we're
going to run this block of code and
inside this block code we're just going
to print hello close quotes and
closed-off happened now because this
expression will always be true the
program will print hello indefinitely
until the Interop until it was
interrupted okay so let's run this and
we'll just have a look at what it looks
like so python 3 to 6 pi and we get our
outputs please enter a positive integer
and I'll put 2 and then we see we get
hello and it just keeps on printing out
hello so to interrupt this we use
control-c up or control-z nope there we
go
control-z and that'll exit out okay so I
should mention that you don't want this
to happen and this concludes our look at
interaction in Python don't fear if you
don't remember all of this you can
easily come back and re-watch the video
to consolidate all of the information
you have any questions and you can't
find the answer after a quick Google
search feel free to leave it in the
comments next we'll be covering file
input and output thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
