is a port scanner every video of all
sledges and code available in the
description this will be a rather short
video first of all what is a port I
encourage you to read more about ports
and networking concepts but the basic
idea of a port is a virtual slot on a
device that accepts only information
specified for it it may be easier to
think of this as a mail system lots of
mail comes into the post office and the
only way to know where it needs to go is
the number on the letter that matches
the number on the post box the system is
so devices receiving the data not to do
with it for example packets coming in
with the port 80 is HTTP traffic so it's
sent to your web browser to be viewed ok
so we know what a port does what does a
port scanner well a port scanner is
mostly used locally so in a local area
network or LAN and it's used to find out
what machines on the network have ports
listening for information well there's a
few different types of scans a port
scanner can do they'll only look at two
of them full connect and sync ACK a full
three-way handshake is the process of
trying to connect to a devices port if
we get in the acknowledgment response
and then we connect to it then the port
is open then there's the sync ack which
is great because it doesn't require the
full three-way handshake once it gets
any response from the device it knows
the ports open so why use a port scanner
well reconnaissance is a great first
step in any cyber assault it gives you a
rough idea of the networks layout and
setup as well as any possible immediate
vulnerabilities many computers and
devices have vulnerabilities on
unprotected ports knowing what devices
have ports open can also help you
protect your own network by closing
ports are open and shouldn't be or
aren't being used then there's nmap nmap
is a great tool it allows for all sorts
of different network scans and runs
great while nmap was written in c and
Lua it outputs XML so people have been
nice enough to make a Python module to
take advantage of that in a later
tutorial we'll install and map
installed the module for Pythian and
make more efficient and hard to detect
port scanners using the sync AK method
now if you're already running something
like Carly or backtrack you will already
have nmap installed I hope you now have
a better understanding of what a port
scanner does don't fear if you don't
remember all this you can easily come
back and rewatch the video to
consolidate all the information if you
have any questions leave it in the
comments and I'll try my best to answer
it next we'll be writing a basic port
scanner using a full TCP handshake
