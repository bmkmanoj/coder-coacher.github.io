password cracker every video will have
all slideshows and code available in the
description once again if you're
watching this without a basic
understanding of Python you'll struggle
to follow along you can watch my Python
beginner series to get you up to speed a
zip file to crack and a dictionary file
will be located in the resources folder
for this tutorial we'll build very
similar code to last tutorial so feel
free to copy/paste in this video we'll
be covering how to use the zip file
module for brute-forcing and how to add
threading to our attacks to speed it up
ok so what is an archive you should
already know this how however you may
just be unfamiliar with the terminology
an archive is a file contains one or
many other files they can be used just
to hold files or to simply compress
files to use less storage space the most
commonly used archives is zip and rar ok
so why do we need a zip cracker everyone
stores things in rails these days well
the good thing is a Ralph's our module
exists and only requires a few simple
tweaks of our zip cracker to get the
program working people also use zips and
rails for storing a lot of stuff stuff
that may be useful for an attacker why
do people use these well zips and rar
compression is free and widely used by
almost everyone this technology is great
because you can also password the
archives thus allowing people to store
backups of their entire system compress
them and then password it for protection
trust me many businesses do this just a
quick brief on how this works we'll be
using Python to try and extract the zip
to the current directory if you were
using a fancy you I like Explorer it
would pop up and ask for a password
however however because we're opening it
with Python it assumes you'll give it a
password otherwise it's empty so we'll
try and open the zip with each of our
different words in the dictionary if it
fails we move on to the next word
otherwise we extract it out and the
script stops ok so let's get on to
writing this bad boy first we're going
to create a Python file called zip
cracker pie and just make sure that you
have the locked zip and the dictionary
dot txt and we'll start running this
coming up with my VM here login okay so
as you can see in the chart folder I
have a lock to zip and dictionary text
and will start writing our code sir
then zip cracker pie okay all that and
okay that's okay so let's see we're
going to need the OP pass module again
because we want to make our programs
dynamic so we'll import up pass for opt
pass and we're also going to need zip
file module so import the file zip file
and we're also going to use threading so
from threading from threading import
thread so we're importing a sub module
of threading okay
now we're going to use two functions
again we're going to have one function
that we're going to pass to thread which
is going to be extract sip so we'll
define extract zip so def extract
underscore zip and we're going to pass
in the zip file and password to try open
it with and we're going to create a try
except block so try this is just the
case our opening of the zip files so in
our trial we'll try and open the zip zip
file dot extract all and inside the
brackets we need to set what the
password is going to be so PWD equals
password and if this is successful so it
does actually extract everything we'll
print out that we found the password
print
put a plus sign icon in our password
found and then add the password in and
we'll add a new line on to the end
backslash again okay now let's put an
accept in now you now accept so if it
fails we're just going to pass this
means just finish the code just ignore
everything just happened so that our
program doesn't crash okay so now we're
going to define our main function
so the main and inside our main we're
going to create our parser so you
remember from last time we create a
passer objects a parser equals parser
sorry up to pass which is up to pass dot
option parser
then we put in our usage usage percent
Prague and I think we'll split this over
multiple lines so put a plus and then a
backslash the backslash by itself
indicates to Python that we're going to
split this over two lines open up quotes
again - F and then we'll have - F is the
zip file that we're passing in and - D
as the dictionary file that we're
passing in close that off and now we're
going to add the options so a parser to
add underscore option
and as I said before feel free to copy
this across from our last tutorial so -
f is going to have the destination of z
name and it's going to be type string
and then I'm going to split this over
another line again and we're going to
have help as specify zip file close that
off and at our next option
Parsa option and then we're gonna have -
D for the dictionary file destination D
file D name and that's going to be type
string as well split this over another
line help can eagle specify dictionary
file and close that off okay now we'll
run our tests to make sure that the
users actually inputted files for us to
try and extract options and AG is equal
to parser dot
Pass let's go eggs
now if options dot is that name it's
equal to none or if options dot dname
equal to none then we want to exit the
program and print out the usage so print
usage and exit actually with the value
of zero and our else so if they did
actually enter in a zip file and a
dictionary then we want to assign those
two variables so said name equals
options Z name and D name equals options
dot T name okay that's that setup okay
so now let's let's a load our zip file
so in our variable called Z file we'll
make that equal to zip file so the name
of the module dot and then we used a
function in the module called zip file
which it capitals Z so zip and then a
capital F for file so zip file and
inside here we put the name of visit
file so that name and now let's open up
a our dictionary file and we'll put it
in the variable pass file yet pass file
let pass photo open and broken up D name
okay sir for line in pass file
don't read minds we're going to set a
variable called password so each line is
going to be a password need to look to
line dot strip and we're going to strip
the new lines backslash N and now that
we've got what the password is we need a
try
we've also got a zip file we can start
trying to extract so we'll add a thread
in so we'll sign the thread the variable
t thread and a target function to use
for the thread DS so target equals and
then the function is extract underscore
zip and then comma and then we need to
specify the arguments that we want to
send to that function so args equals
because we're sending two things will
open up brackets and sending in zip file
and password close that off and now
we've created our thread we need to tell
it to start so T dot start and there we
go
that's our program done we just have to
throughout if let's go name oops
name equal to this times go main let's
go let's go
then run main and we're done let's
program so if I right quit this and now
we try and run this so python zip
cracker dot py we just run it like that
oh we've got an error okay so line 37
main print EC ah
got to put parser usage on that so fit
setup come down here and this is
supposed to be parser
dot usage my mistake and right-click
that again how we run this it's worked
fine start us with the usage it requires
a zip file and dictionary file so let's
pass a dash F zip file so we've got
locked
zip and we got our dictionary file dot d
Dictionary dot txt and now we run this
it's found passwords login and as you
can see up here it's extracted it out
into the folder and we have a look at
this image that it just extracted so
it's congrats you cracked my zip and
just that's as simple as it is and as
you see it saw it only took us just a
few minutes to write that program at all
will work rather well ok so this
concludes our look at as a password
cracker don't for me don't fear if you
don't remember all this you can easily
come back and re-watch the video
consolidate all the information if you
have any questions and you can't find
the answer after a quick Google search
feel free to leave it in the comments
next we'll be building a port scanner to
find what ports have what ports devices
have open and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
