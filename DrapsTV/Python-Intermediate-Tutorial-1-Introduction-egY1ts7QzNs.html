video is an intro to the intermediate
tutorials I'll keep it as short as
possible every video have all slideshows
anchored available in the description
the topics that this tutorial will be
covering in great detail are classes
methods inheritance iterators and
generators as well as how we can spread
our code over multiple files using
modules I've chosen to keep the amount
of topics short because each are
incredibly important in becoming a
better programmer each topic has many
importances to them and all compromise
what is called object-oriented
programming or over P for short this is
because of this videos will be as long
as required to get the topic covered
hopefully once you've finished this
series you'll have a firm grasp on over
P and classes in Python I'll provide you
with extra code that you can look at and
try writing yourself as practice for
each topic these will either be examples
or challenges as promised I kept this
shot first we're going to cover classes
feel free to leave any questions in the
comments thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
