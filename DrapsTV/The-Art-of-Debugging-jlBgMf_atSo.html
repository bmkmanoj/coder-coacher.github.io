of debugging the slideshow will be
available in the description I won't be
aiming this video at any specific
programming language as hopefully these
concepts should apply to any programming
or scripting language the ideas I'll be
talking about are in no way an official
must-do way to deal with errors however
these are the processes I go through
when solving problems I encounter we
have three different categories of
errors these are syntax errors runtime
errors and logical errors first we'll
have looked at what each of these are
and where they commonly occur syntax
errors are quite self-explaining there
are errors in your programs syntax /
code these errors are the easiest to
find and fix because the compiler will
not compile beyond this point a cappella
will throw an error at us informing us
that it got confused or didn't
understand the code we gave it runtime
errors are errors that occur while the
program is running these can sometimes
be incredibly difficult to locate and
other times incredibly obvious the most
famous runtime errors are infinite loops
and memory leaks memory leaks happen
when your program allocates memory but
does not D allocate the memory correctly
this leads to the program taking up more
and more system memory until your
computer or device runs out of memory
and memory dumps this usually leads to
your operating system restarting last
but not least our logic errors these
errors occur as a fault of us as a
programmer it sure stings when a
colleague points out pointed out to you
let's take the example of a bank account
system someone wishes to withdraw ten
dollars from their account however when
they hit the withdraw $10 button instead
of withdrawing ten dollars it only
withdraws one dollar no error occurs and
no notification is triggered or because
the programmer missed a zero now how do
we go about discovering errors in our
programs
well I'm sure we've all experienced
syntax errors before when our program
weren't even compile or run run time
errors most of the time are pretty
obvious because our program crashes but
this isn't always the case sometimes it
may be a bug with a
rarely used feature of your program and
it goes undiscovered for many versions
of your program memory leaks can
sometimes be small or large depending on
the size of data being handled so your
program not crashed for the average user
but if left running for more than 24
hours it will crash the device if there
is a possibility that your program may
run for a long time run your program for
a few hours checking its memory usage at
the start and at the end logic errors
often go unnoticed but are hopefully
discovered while testing this could be
manual testing edge cases and seeing if
they provide the correct output or you
can write a unit test to test do the
testing for you and hopefully you pick
up any logic errors that may occur
solving syntax errors is usually a swift
process error messages such as
unexpected symbol is usually from
missing a line delimiter messages such
as too few arguments or too many
arguments can mean that you are missing
a left or right bracket and any
undefined reference messages usually is
usually from misspelling a function or
variable all editors should have a fine
function it's useful to use this to find
the undefined variable in your code
search for the word that the compiler or
interpreter got stuck on always remember
to check the error the line the error
occurred on and the previous line of
code if it's getting stuck on a function
double-check the function definition is
the same as the way you're using it
trying to stuff two integers into a
function that is only meant to take one
who's never going to work solving
runtime errors can be painful however I
feel you learn the most when you fix
them the most critical part of trying to
discover the reason behind a crash is
remembering what you were doing right
before the crash so you can try to
reproduce the error if you know the
exact lines that we're executing at the
time of the crash then you cut down the
sets to just a few Cupp few lines if
you're fairly confident with your
programming skills
step through those lines in your head
and see if you can discover where your
code may not be receiving the correct
data or trying to access something it
doesn't have permission to access if
you're still struggling or not too
confident with stepping through in your
head or on paper most ideas come with a
debugger that can be attached to your
program at run
time to allow you to step through your
program just set a breakpoint a few
lines before your crash point and use
the step through button perhaps even
before you step through your program you
can check that your program is actually
entering if statement blocks or actually
executing functions by placing print
statements after inside and before
blocks let's look at this example I'm
having a problem with my program as
Malan isn't being broken I place three
print statements into my code checkpoint
one two and three when I run my program
I get the output checkpoint one and
checkpoint two and then the program
crashes now I now know for sure that the
problem is in my break Melon function if
you're using a programming language that
uses pointers make sure that you create
correctly allocate and deallocate all
memory that you use on the fly have
checks in place to make sure that your
program does not try to access pointers
that are pointing to null likewise with
languages that use aliases when passing
objects make sure you understand how
that object is treated otherwise you may
generate many null pointer exceptions if
you are encountering encountering
incorrect output or behavior from your
program step through the logic of your
program in your head try to work with
easy to calculate values in your head
and write it down on paper sometimes
this isn't always possible but try to
break the problem down until you find
out why your calculation is being thrown
out by a small value or why a window
isn't appearing when you click a button
if you are doing some complex maths
remember to use brackets appropriately
remember back to BOM - or Bom bowed mast
in school and lastly if you are using
someone else's functions or methods make
sure you understand what they are doing
and that you are getting the correct
response you are looking for from the
function it's usually a good idea to
check the library's Docs or wiki on how
the function works it doesn't matter how
long you've been programming there will
always be times when you get stuck a
great way to clear your head is to
a short break make a coffee or some food
the answer may even click while you're
standing there waiting for the kettle to
boil then when you get back you have a
fresh pair of eyes and a clear head you
are still stuck which does happen you
may need to ask for help but if you
don't want to look like a lazy human at
least try googling for an answer first
if you're still struggling to find a
solution then ask on a forum or ask a
mentor then finally continue to try and
solve the program the problem even after
you ask people may not be able to get
back to you with a solution immediately
so to summarize if your code isn't
compiling check your spelling missing
the limiters missing operators and check
error at the airline and the previous
code line if your program is crashing or
hanging check the program execution use
the debuggers step through functions and
check over your memory management if
your program isn't performing correctly
or is giving an incorrect output check
your logic for performing that
calculation or behavior this concludes
the art of debugging I hope you learned
some new tools to help you squash those
nasty bugs if you have any questions
leave it in the comments and I'll try to
answer it as best as possible thanks for
