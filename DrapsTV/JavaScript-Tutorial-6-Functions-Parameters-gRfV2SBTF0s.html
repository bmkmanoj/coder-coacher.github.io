six functions in this video we'll be
learning about how we can split our code
into reasonable blocks using functions
and parameters every video of all
slideshows and code available in the
description so what is a function
essentially it is a set of instructions
that has a name we create one by telling
JavaScript that we want to create a
function then giving it a name with
parentheses on the end here we create a
function called my function we can then
use the code in that function anywhere
in the rest of our script by calling its
name with parenthesis and a semicolon on
the end it's incredibly important to be
aware that the code inside that function
will not be run by the browser until
it's name is called this might look
familiar
that's because we've used one already
earlier I introduced a very basic
function to run code when our buttons
were pressed here we can see a function
called my function that creates an alert
pop-up whenever it is run saying I was
running from my function Before we jump
into a hands-on example let's learn a
great feature called returning often if
code is going to be useful for reuse it
probably performs some calculation on
some variables we can get the result of
that calculation and use the return
keyword to give the result back to where
the function was used or called from
because the value is returned it will
allow us to use a function similar to
how we would a variable in the example
line here we return the value inside the
variable called the result here we can
see it in action
we get a floating-point number that is a
number with a decimal point and return
it back to where the function is called
so we can create two variables called
num and num2 and we use getfloat for
each of them this means the code inside
getfloat is run each time and a float is
retrieved from the user and stored in
the result we then return the result
back and the value is then stored inside
the num variable x' alright let's give
it a shot we'll create the function we
just saw getting a decimal number from
the user with a prompt popup let's call
it floats dot HTML all right so let's
come over here and let's open up our
hello dot HTML and we'll use this as our
template so we'll save that as
and let's call it floats HTML all right
so now we've created that let's change
our script so get rid of fitting in
there all right so now let's create our
function so I shall get rid of our flat
put bit there don't need that for this
alright so inside of our script section
let's create a function so function and
goes green and we're gonna call it get
flirt that's gonna be the name of our
function we're gonna put our parenthesis
on the end and we open up our curly
braces now inside about our function
we're going to create a variable called
result and our result is going to equal
pass flirt flirt which will turn a
string into a floating-point number and
then we're going to prompt the user to
in quotes enter a number colon space
close quotes alright so we'll close off
that and put our semicolon on the end so
now we've gotten the result from the
user so from the prompt let's use the
return keyword now goes green is all
going to return the result semicolon all
right so we've created our get float
function let's try using it so we'll
come down some lines and let's create a
variable called num equals get float so
we're going to call that a get float
function and we'll do a VAR num 2 equals
get float and now we've got our two
variables num and num2 let's alert the
result out if we add them together all
right so let's
but and going to pass in num plus num2
alright so we've written our script
let's give it a shot
so let's drag it into our web browser so
we called it floats enter a number has
two four point two two three and num2 is
six point five four or something like
that
all right if we end up we get ten point
seven six three cool
so we successfully grabbed two floats
from the user using the one function
that we've created rather than having to
write out that line twice cool currently
our functions are pretty limited they
can execute code and maybe return a
symbol value we can make our functions
much more powerful by using parameters
parameters are values that are given to
a function when it is called we can give
functions as many values as we like the
benefit of passing values into a
function with parameters is that we can
make the function do something with
those values the full syntax of a
function looks like the following
replace these parameters in the
parentheses this tells the function to
expect these values to be passed in we
can name the parameters just like we
would a variable and use them in a
similar way if we don't give the
function the values it is expecting
they'll be undefined and may cause
errors later on so let's create an
example and get familiar with using
parameters we'll create a function to
get the approximate area of a cylinder
taking the radius and height as
parameters and returning the area to the
place it was called to save some time
well once again use our add HTML
template to get the values from the user
let's call it area HTML all right so
let's open up our add HTML in our text
editor and let's save it as and we're
going to call it area dot HTML say that
all right so we've got my function where
we get our number 1 and our num2 what
we're going to do is we're going to
create another function above it we're
going to call it function and we're
going to call it get civil area for
getting the cylinders area and we're
going to pass in the parameters radius
which is going to be the radius of the
base and the height as they're the two
things we need to know in order to
calculate the area of the cylinder so
let's put our curly braces in all right
so let's just straight from the return
we're going to return 3.14 so pi times
the radius squared so to square the
radius we're just going to times the
radius by itself so radius times radius
times the height all right so we're
timesing pi r-squared times height okay
so now we've got our function to get the
area of a cylinder let's make use of it
so now what we can do is we'll rename
our two variables here so instead of
num1 and num2
let's call top one radius or R for
radius and we'll do H for the second one
so H for height and we're going to get
our two values and instead of just
adding them together we're going to set
the innerhtml of our output to get
Scylla area and then we're going to pass
in the radius and the height as
parameters the more plus on the end and
add some quartz and we'll use the HTML
for superscript and we'll superscript
three for volume and then we'll close
off our super script tag and close off
air quotes cool so that's our script
done let's save that and give it a shot
so we're going to get a radius and then
a height actually let's not some rename
these text input so that we can see what
they correctly are so we got radius and
we've also got a height we are ready
assign our height and we can get rid of
our equals maybe make it something like
calculate cylinder area so that'll give
us a bit more of an indication of what
it does so let's save this and will once
again drag it into our web browser and
now if you punched in a radius so say
it's a radius of five and a height of
eight we calculate the area and we
output what the total volume of the
cylinder is awesome this concludes our
look at functions in JavaScript next
we'll be looking at using arrays to
store multiple values you have any
questions leave it in the comments and
I'll try to answer as best as possible
