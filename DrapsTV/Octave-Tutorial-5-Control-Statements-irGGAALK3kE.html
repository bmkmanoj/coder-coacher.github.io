five control statements in this video
we'll be looking at getting a grasp on
the control statements that octave has
to offer every video of all slideshows
and code available in the description if
you have ever worked with another
programming language before this will
probably be very familiar for you
control statements allow us to have the
computer make a decision based on a
boolean value of either true or false
the two control statements that we have
in octave is selection being if
statements and repetition which is the
for and while loops whenever we need the
computer to decide if something is true
or false we use comparison operators
once again if you're familiar with
another programming language most of
these should be familiar we have is
equal to which is two equal signs is not
equal to which is a tilde equal sign you
can also use the exclamation mark equal
I believe the greater than sign so it is
for greater than and less than which is
the blessed enzyme and we have greater
than or equal to or less than or equal
to if you are new to this kind of
comparison it's okay you'll pick it up
as you're using it okay let's look at
the if statement the if statement will
use a boolean expression this is usually
one of the comparison operators we just
talked about if the comparison is true
then the code inside the if statement is
run otherwise if the comparison is false
the code is skipped we can see here how
the if statement is laid out in octave
the brackets around the expression is
optional let's jump over to octave and
write a simple if statement okay so in
octave let's set a variable X to equal
six now let's write out if statement so
if X so our variable X is greater than
five comma and the comma is used to
indicate the we're done without if
declaration and you'll see that our
prompt changes when we hit enter to a
single arrow this is our indent so this
means that we're inside our if statement
and we can tell the the if statement
what code to run if it's true
so if X is greater than five we're going
to display so disp X is larger than five
exclamation mark and we can put a
semicolon on the end here now when we
end it you see that we've still got that
indent so that we're still inside our if
to get out of our if we have to use the
end command so end will close up our if
and because we're inside octave it will
also run the if statement so because our
x equals 6 X is greater than 5 so it
will display X is larger than 5 so if we
enter we get the output X is larger than
5 so that's our if statement in working
okay so now let's jump back over to the
slide show we can add more control to
our if statements by making use of the
else if and else statements as well the
LCF allows us to chain together another
if statement if the first if statement
is false the if if all of the ifs and
else ifs are all false then the else
statement can be used to run code as you
can see with the example set up if an
expression is true then do something
else if another expression is true then
do something else
otherwise do the code in the else
function let's modify our previous if to
make use of the else if and else
statements okay so if you come back over
to octave and our x equals 6 remember
now
we can do if X is greater than 10 comma
then we're going to display
hex is larger oh good is big at this
time is bigger than ten exclamation mark
now we can know that with the determined
our display we can do our else--if so
else if and then we do X is greater than
zero comma and we're still indented
we're going to display X is greater than
zero but less than ten exclamation mark
now let's write our else so else and we
don't need to come up videos we're going
to display X is a negative exclamation
mark and then we're going to write our
end end and what I've got a error so if
not to go into a class char what's this
by mucked up how I wrote - I totally
wrote display my bad so if X is larger
than 10 then we're going to X is bigger
than 10 else if it's larger than zero
we're going to display that X is larger
than zero but less than 10 exclamation
mark put protocol in there and then our
else which is going to be X is a
negative end
now as you can see it outputs X is
larger than zero but less than 10 so it
skipped our first if because X is not
larger than 10 but it caught it in the
elsif which is is X larger than zero so
yes it was so it ran the code inside
that F which was the display X is larger
than zero but less than ten so that's
how we can use else ifs and else's to
determine what happens in an if
statement
okay so let's jump back to the slides
okay now we can move into onto
repetition statements first we will
start with the for loop the for loop
will repeat a block of code a specific
number of times for loops are great when
you know exactly how many times you need
to repeat something in octave the for
loop can loop over any vector this
example shows the syntax of a for loop
in octave that iterates ten times let's
try the for loop in octave and we'll
print out the current index to screen
okay so we come over to octave and we'll
clear the screen now we can do for I
equals look for I equals 1 to 10 comma
and then we just see we get our indent
again now inside our indent what we're
going to do is we want to display so
we're going to display and we're going
to display s print F so we're going to
do a format printed string and inside
that string inside s printf we're going
to do % I so this is for an integer and
then next to the eye we're going to do
th so for the 8th and then we're going
to do a space and then index now that %
I will be replaced with a number so
we'll close that quote off comma and
then we want to pass eye into the
esperan death ok and then we put a
semicolon on the end there and now we're
still indented so
user end function our end statement now
when we run this it's going to iterate
ten times one to ten and it's going to
print out each index so you enter and
you see we get one index second power
tooth index third three index fourth
index fifth and x6 and x7 index etc and
that's how we set up for loops okay so
now that we know the for loop let's move
on to the while loop so this unlike the
the for loop is great for tasks where we
don't know exactly how many times we'll
have to loop over some code the while
expression is true repeat but while the
expression is true repeat the code until
the expression is false be careful with
while loops you can if you can never
reach a false comparison the loop will
go on infinitely forever if you do it if
you do accidentally create an infinite
loop just close octave and try again
let's write our while loops similar to
our for loop
okay so we'll come over to octave again
and this time we're going to use the
keyword while so actually before this we
need to set up a a value for I so we'll
set I to equal one okay so while I is
less than ten comma and we get out
indent so while I is less than 10 we're
going to display I so disp I now we also
need to remember to increment our I
values so that it does eventually get
larger than 10 so I equals I plus 1 and
now we can do our end statement and as
you'll see we'll get 1 1 2 9 this time
because I eventually becomes 10 10 is
not less than 10 it's the same okay so
we'll just clear screen quickly again
now if we come back over to
a PowerPoint sometimes we may need to
break out of our loops early if a
certain condition is met for this we
have breaks daemons break statements
will stop the loop controlling the
current block of code let's have a quick
look at one in action okay so let's have
a variable n which will equal one so
while true so we're going to eat all
true we're going to use the value true
so it will always be true so this loop
will go on forever what we're going to
do is we're going to get a variable V
and make it equal to V plus n okay now
if n is greater than four comma so we
have an if statement inside our while if
n is greater than four we're going to
break and that's a keyword we put a
colon on the end then we want to end
that if and then outside if we want to
set n to equal n plus one so that we
eventually reach n greater than four and
now we're going to end our while loop so
and again and as you can see it's run
our while loop but we're not displaying
anything so it ran it in the background
so let's type V and see what value V is
so if you remember B is equal to V plus
end so we type V you can see that we get
how four values which isn't quite right
because I didn't set V up before so oh
that's a bugger I was supposed to I was
supposed to create V next to n so see
I've got n plus 1 N equals 1 I was also
supposed to do V equals 1 whoops
quickly redo this while so while true V
equals and if n is greater than 4 then
we're going to break and then we want to
end out of this and then n plus n plus N
equals n plus 1 and then we're going to
end again okay now that run again now if
we look at V V equals 16 so because we
iterated four times and we started off
as one then it was plus n so it was two
and then etc keep the looping through so
that's how we set up break statements
inside our walls ok this concludes our
look at control statements in octave
feel free to leave any questions in the
comments and I'll do my best to answer
them next we're going to look at
combining everything we have learned so
far to construct octave functions thanks
