bypassing advanced filters and
protecting against cross side scripts in
this video we'll be looking at evading
some more advanced XSS filters will also
look at protecting our websites against
cross-site scripting attacks with the
use of HTML entities and content
security policies every video of all
slideshows and code available in
description generally if you make it to
this point and need to start encoding
your attacks it's pretty likely that the
defenses have been implemented well
however it's best to at least give these
techniques ago as not all filters are
made the same you may be able to just
squeeze through with an encoded attack
let's just quickly describe two places
you can do sanitizing first on the
inbound this is before you touch or do
anything with the imported data or
information you sanitize it before you
place it into your database or before
you do any calculating this is where you
make sure your server and site is safe
from attacks like SQL injection remote
file inclusion etc then there's outbound
this is where you want to sanitize any
data that we are sending out to the
users we protect the users of our site
here we want to make sure that any
possibly exploited sections of our site
that may have gotten past our inbound
defenses are nullified before sending it
to the users all right let's look at the
method that will most likely work if
you're not having much luck so here we
can see what looks like a bunch of
gibberish however this is just a string
written with HTML entities for each
character in decimal ascii these
entities will form our familiar
JavaScript colon alert XSS after the web
browser evaluates their characters this
is great for bypassing black lists and
strong quote filters this is also great
for hiding the purpose of a reflected
attack we can do the same thing with
hexadecimal as we could with decimal it
will turn into our same JavaScript alert
XSS there is plenty of text to hex and
text to decimal converters on the web
google and find one you like looking
into HTML entities is also a great idea
ok let's give this encoding attack a
shot grab an ASCII converter or just
copy the code from the code dot txt file
to save yourself the pain of typing it
out the new web page now has a simple
black this set up to stop you from using
the script tags or the alert word
right so let's jump over to our web
browser here and we're going to try our
link that's going to be encoded so I'm
going to copy and paste it in here
so it's just a standard a tag with a
href and that H ref has all of our
encoded characters which will be
equivalent to JavaScript : alert XSS you
just have this link saying click me and
then we close up our a tag so the
comment it'll go through we get our
click me here if I hover over it down
the bottom you'll see in the bottom left
JavaScript : alert XSS so we click it we
get our XSS pop-up cool so it's just
that simple all right if you believe
that it's possible that the target
website has only inbound filters on get
requests you can try and slip by with
encoding your URL get variable in you
can try and slip by with encoding the
URL get variable info in hex for example
here we have the script tags and the
alert XSS encoded let's give this a
quick shot so if we jump back over to
our web browser and we grab our URL
encoded string so I've got it copied and
we got to just get our name area which
we've used before and we can come up to
the top here and we can put in an hour
and coded string so it's all these
percentage and then hex values and if we
hit go we get our pop-up of XSS and you
can see after it's been translated it
comes out as script alert XSS and then
closing script cool there is many
one-off tricks that may work against
certain filters in certain browsers I
suggest looking at the OWA espys filter
evasion cheat sheet for an idea about
how they work
my favorite is a malformed script tag
that will pass a lot of blacklist
filters but still execute in browsers
that
unknown characters in known tags you may
also notice that the script file that is
linked to has an image extension if you
rename a JavaScript file the web browser
will still try to execute the file as
JavaScript no matter what extension it
has I've set up a second page which you
can navigate to by clicking on the next
link at the bottom of the test page the
page has no blacklist no specific filter
except for the HTML entities function
that turns all characters with meaning
into HTML equivalent can you manage to
get an XSS attack through leave your
results in the comments ok let's talk
about the important point to this whole
series how to protect your website there
is several measures we can put in place
to protect yourself and your customers
against cross-site scripting attacks the
first and probably strongest line of
defense against cross-site scripting is
making sure that every untrusted
variable that is echoed out to the
webpage is encoded with HTML entities
PHP has the HTML entities function other
languages will have something similar or
along the lines of HTML encode now this
is a good start and will prevent most
basic forms of accesses attacks the
second thing we need to do is find a
pre-tested library or code snippet that
sanitizes the JavaScript colon from you
our eyes keep in mind that if you write
this yourself
that word javascript in the address bar
scripts is not case-sensitive so it
could be possible for a capital J in the
JavaScript colon to throw off a script
that just looks for little lowercase
JavaScript colon thirdly we need to
remember to sanitize inbound as well as
outbound SQL injection is still a huge
problem your protection against SQL
injection may even stop a few sneaky
cross-site script from making it into
your database if something malicious
makes it into your database it may not
be a problem until the day you forget to
sanitize your output when you're testing
a new page or section of your site and
we can't miss content security policies
or CSP s
this is a relatively new feature for the
web csps is great for a very strong line
of defense
csps are rules that your server will
send in the header of every response
CSPs allow use to specify exactly what
sources are trusted and to disable any
inline resources that we
being run I highly recommend reading
about CSPs html5rocks has a great
write-up about the content security
policy standard alright finally a few
really useful resources if you really
want to get into cross-site scripting or
protecting against it check out these
sites all the links will be in the
description alright the next thing that
we'll be looking at is the magnificent
and beautiful cross-site script that hit
Twitter in mid-2014
