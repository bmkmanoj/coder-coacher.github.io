five control flow loops in this video
we'll be learning how to repeat sections
of code everywhere you have all
slideshows and code available in the
description computers are really good at
repeating instructions using what we
learned from last tutorial on true and
false expressions or what are
technically called boolean expressions
let's start with the last concept of
control flow looping before we dive
straight in let's take a few moments to
learn two really useful operators
increment and decrement these operators
are shorthand for adding 1 to a number
or subtracting one from a number in the
example here we look at X plus plus is
the same as x equals x plus 1 similarly
X minus minus is the same as x equals X
minus 1 this will come in handy in a sec
the for loop is used when we want to
loop every section occurred a specific
number of times a for loop will loop
until its condition is false just like
an F won't run its code if it is false
the loop structure follows the pattern
iteration variable with a value which in
this case is I equals 0 compare it to
its finish condition so here we are
saying loop until I is no longer less
than 10 then finally we incremented
using our new operator friend plus plus
we increase I by 1 at the end of each
loop in this example we just pop up the
value of I which we should expect to see
10 pop ups from 0 to 9 in them because
our loop finishes when I is equal to 10
all right
let's build a script that gets the sum
of all numbers up to a specified number
this is it adds 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4
plus 5 etc all the way up to a certain
number let's call it sum dot html' we'll
reuse the template from our earlier add
example alright so I'll come over here
and we'll open up add dart HTML in our
text editor and I'll save it as a new
file calling it sum all right and what
we're going to do is we're going to
remove our second number that we're
going to get from Music's we're not
going get it will remove num1 and just
call it num because we only want one
number from the user then we'll come
down to our HTML
remove the number two and just ask for a
number and the ID will just be numb so
when they press the button will change
that so it's called run rather than
equals so they put in a number they hit
run and then up in our script we're
going to get the number that they input
it we're going to create a variable
called sum and we'll make that equal
zero to start with which is what we're
going to store the result in now we're
going to create a for loop so calculate
the sum of all the numbers up to the
specified number so we'll do four then
inside brackets we'll create a variable
I which can equal one to start with and
we're going to go in till I is less than
or equal to the number inputted so we're
going to go through all of the numbers
up to the number they inputted and then
we're going to increment I after each
loop all right so inside our curly
braces we're going to do some equals sum
plus I and because I will be incremented
each time it'll be 1 and then it will be
2 and then it'll be 3 all the way up to
the number that's inputted and that will
add on to the current value of sum
awesome now that we've got some we're
going to set out in our HTML to sum
which is going to be the end result now
we can save this and load it into our
web page
well zoom in a bit alright now we can
put in a number so let's do something
like 10 we get run and we get 55 so we
have 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 all the way
up to 10 gives us a total sum of 55
which put in something like 100 and we
get 5050 cool so we can do all sorts of
numbers and we can find out for the
addition is of all those numbers up to
that number
awesome to make our life even easier
javascript has shorthand for every
arithmetic operator here we can see by
placing the arithmetic operator before
the equal sign causes it to add subtract
multiply or divide onto the variable and
setting this will save us a lot of space
when our code starts getting bigger next
we have while loops while loops are used
when we are less certain about how many
times we need to loop in the last for
example we knew exactly what our final
number to stop out was because it was
entered by the user there is two styles
of writing a while loop the standard
while like we can see here on the Left
which checks at the start if it should
run the code in the loop and we have the
do-while which will run the code in the
loop at least once before checking if it
should run the code again so in these
examples depending on what the value of
x is we can have two different effects
if X is 15 then the loop on the left
will not run because X is not less than
10 however on the right that do-while x
will be changed to 16 before the loop
finishes because the loop is always run
at least once all right let's create a
script that uses a while loop to output
the remainder of a whole number divided
by 7 normally we would solve this with
the modulus operator but because we are
learning how to use while loops let's
try solve it ourselves let's call this
one remained HTML alright so we'll open
up our sum again and we'll say this has
and we'll call it remainder alright in
our remainder what we're going to do is
we'll renames in variables so we'll
rename some to result and result is
going to equal the num inputted by the
user and we'll get rid of our for loop
all right now to get the remainder of a
number we need to have the total number
that we want to divide by and then to
divide instead of actually using the
divide operator we're going to minus the
number we're dividing by it and we're
gonna keep my nursing until we can't -
anymore and that means we've got our
remainder all right so let's create our
while loop so while
our result is greater than or equal to
seven because we're dividing by 7 we
want a minus seven each time so while
our result is greater than or equal to 7
then we can still continue dividing so
our result he's going to - equal 7 so
we're going to take 7 way each time we
loop over and if our result falls below
7 then we don't need to minus 7 anymore
because we'll have our final result so
let's that's actually you know what
let's put in a document output so we can
see the changes so let's plus equals on
our innerhtml to append data on to our
web page and will output the results
plus then we'll add the string of the
HTML line break cool and then at the
very end we'll plus equals house our
final result except we'll do the string
answer answer :
plus the results and then we finally
finish that line off let's save that and
let's give it a shot so we drag that in
to our browser we can type in a number
so let's say we put in 8 which if that's
divided by 7 as a whole number then we
should get a remain remainder of 1
because there we 1 left over
yep and that's we can try some larger
number so we could do something like 56
let's not do 56 because that is division
now it's division dividable by 7 so we
can see that 56 minus 7 is 49
42:35 28 21 14 7 0 so the remainder of
dividing 56 by 7 is 0 if we were changed
it to something like 148 and we run that
we'll see that we have
but I'll just refresh and clear that up
148
yeah 141 all the way down going down and
we get a result of one cool have a try
at allowing the user to specify what to
divide by instead of only seven just
some final notes to keep in mind when
working with loops make sure your loop
always has a way of finishing or exiting
if your loop can never end it is called
an infinite loop and will probably crash
your browser or your tab the full loop
is rated in this lesson was the most
common form however JavaScript allows
for for loops to be manipulated in many
ways for example semicolon X is greater
than 10 semicolon works just like a
while loop but it's much less clear of
what it's doing this concludes our look
at different types of loops in
JavaScript next we'll be tackling
functions if you have any questions
leave it in the comments and I'll try to
answer it as best as possible don't
