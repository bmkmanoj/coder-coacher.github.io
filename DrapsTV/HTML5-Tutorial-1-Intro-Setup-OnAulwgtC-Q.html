setup in this series I'll be covering
HTML and the basic building blocks of a
static website
this series is aimed at people who have
never used HTML before and I'll be
assuming that you have no prior
knowledge of the language every video of
all slide shows and code available in
the description this series of tutorials
will try to cover as much of haich-d ml
as possible the kinds of things we'll be
looking at are what are tags in the
basics of a page attributes and links
formatting and images the head and
styling tables and lists forms and
iframes and media though not all of
html5 features will be fully explored
this will form the basis for the other
primary web languages like CSS
JavaScript and PHP so what is HTML HTML
stands for hypertext markup language it
is the base language for the web our web
browsers like Chrome or Firefox turn
HTML code into the pretty websites we
browse each day HTML uses a tag system
to tell our browser what the page should
look like though websites these days are
more than just HTML you still need to
understand HTML before you can move on
to other languages as you'll see it
starts off very basic let's get them to
getting ourselves set up to start
programming in HTML the great thing
about HTML is that it runs in a browser
just like the one you're using right now
we can also write the code in any text
editor you can use notepad WordPad vim
notepad plus plus anything that allows
you to write text some are better than
others though I suggest getting notepad
plus plus it's free and will highlight
the code for you to make it easier to
read
to download notepad plus plus we need to
go to the website notepad plus plus org
a link will be in the description once
notepad plus plus is installed you can
right-click on any text file and click
Edit in notepad plus plus first we'll be
looking at what tags are and the basics
of a web page if you have any questions
leave it in the comments and I'll try to
answer it as best as possible
