and iframes in this video we'll be
looking at how to create forms for data
entry as well as how to place a web page
inside another web page every video of
all slideshows and code available in
description forms in HTML allow us to
get data from the users of our website
for example the fields on a website for
entering your email or username and
password etc there are many different
input types
if you've ever filled out an online
survey you've probably seen most of them
text boxes checkboxes radio buttons
buttons etc I should mention that this
section may be a little boring as you
generally require another programming
language to actually do anything with
the data that the users would enter for
now it's useful to know what you're
looking at the form tag can be basic but
can also be quite a busy tag the
attributes that are commonly used are
action which is used to tell the browser
what what page to send the submitted
data to there is also a method which
tells the browser how to send the data
to the page there is also the name
attribute that works just like it does
with any other element there is also the
target attribute which works just like
it does with links here we have an
example of a form that will send data to
the my page dot PHP web page and we'll
send it by post the form is called my
form inside our form tags we use the
input tag the input tag allows us to
create the actual data entry elements on
our web page the input tag requires the
attribute called type the type attribute
tells the input element what kind of
input it is for example text button
check box etc in the example here we
have a text field that might be used for
a user name now we have to talk about
the submit button the submit button is a
special input type that appears as a
button the submit button told the
browser to submit the data in the form
to the page we specified in the action
attribute of the form depending on what
we specified in the method attribute of
the form the data will either be sent to
the URL which is called get or hidden
through the header of the web request
which is called post ok now that we have
a good idea of the kind of things we
will find in forms let's add a basic
form to our index dot HTM
document will add a form section and get
a name age and gender then we'll finish
it up with a submit button ok so I'm
gonna come over to folder here index
we're gonna open up in notepad plus plus
and we want to add a form section so
we'll scroll down and we'll do it after
our images after our images I'm gonna
create a form section
h2 forms h2
okay and we're gonna create our form tag
and we won't put any attributes in our
form tag for the moment because when I
can actually do anything with our form
so close up our form tag now inside
we're going to create a box for the name
so put it the text name and colon and
we'll put a brake line in there and now
we'll put in our input so we're going to
use the input tag then we need to set
the type attribute and we'll make that
equal to text and we'll set the name to
equal name alright
and we'll do a self closing tag on that
now we'll do another line break so BR
and we'll do the age and then another
line break and now we'll get another
input so we're going to do input and
inside of our input we're going to set
the type to equal a number and we'll set
the name of this element to equal H and
we'll soft-close do another line break
and we'll do gender and we'll do another
line break and we'll do another input so
this time we're gonna do an input radio
button so we're going to input type
equals radio
and now for a radio button to work all
of the parts of the same radio button
section have to add the same name so
we're gonna set the name to equal gender
and we'll set the value to equal male
first soft close tag and we'll put the
word male on the end okay now we're
gonna do a line break so be our close
tag and we're gonna do another input
book input and the type is going to be a
radio button again and the name has to
be the same so gender and we'll set the
value to equal female and close tag and
we'll put female on the end there and I
will do BR break and now we'll put our
submit button so we're the input and the
type this time is going to equal submit
and we're going to set the value of the
button to equal submit we'll put a
capital S on it this is what's going to
appear on the button alright and then
we'll self close that
okay so we've written our form so we've
got a name and age and a gender where
they can choose either male or female
with the use of a radio button so let's
save this and we'll open up our index
okay so if we scroll down there are
images we got a form so here we can put
in our name so open in drops having put
an age so I could do no say that I'm 107
I'm 100 and you can also use the
increment and decrement is and then
we've got our radio buttons here so we
can select either male or female and
when you click on one of them it'll
deselect the other one you'd only have
one selected okay
and then we can click our submit button
and it'll submit back to this page and
if you're really interested it sends it
by get by default and you can see it up
in the up in the top browser URL after
the question mark you have our name egos
traps and our age equals 100 and our
gender equals male okay cool
okay so that looks nice but it doesn't
really do much and sadly it won't do
much until you move on to a language
like PHP so to make this a little more
interesting let's look at the button tag
there is a separate button tag that can
be used in and out of the form tag we
can use this button to run some
JavaScript in its own click attribute it
also has a type attribute that can be
used to set up a reset button for a form
you haven't looked into JavaScript yet
and it's quite a big topic and will be
covered separately however it is
important to note that javascript is
around plays a large role in today's
websites so let's add a button element
to our index.html just under our form
we'll use a very basic line of
JavaScript to make a popup message okay
so we'll come back to our code and just
underneath our form we're going to
create a button and actually we'll put
it inside of a paragraph so put it
inside some paragraph tags so get some
nice spacing I'm going to use the button
tag and we're gonna set its type to
equal a button and we're gonna set its
on click attribute to equal alert open
brackets single quotes I am a script
exclamation mark then we'll close our
single quotes close off our brackets and
then we'll close off our double quotes
for the onclick attribute and we'll
close off the tag and then inside the
button we're gonna just we'll just call
it a button and this is a text it'll up
here on the button and then we'll close
off our button tag like so
now we can save this and we'll come back
over to our browser refresh our page and
we can come down and we've got a button
now we cook the a button it'll pop up
saying I am a script you have to click
OK to close it you can continue clicking
it and we'll keep popping up your
browser will probably tell you that the
page cheap current keeps trying to
create pop-ups do you want to block them
okay cool
so let's move on to a more interesting
and functioning topic iframes iframes
are a powerful tool for static web sites
we can use them to load another website
or web page inside our web page the
iframe is very easy to use and can be
changed with the target attribute on
links the iframe tag is easy to use we
must use the source attribute to specify
another source webpage to put in the
frame other attributes we can use is
width height and frame border frame
border is by default set to 1 in the
example here we have an iframe with a
nut with a my frame dot HTML web page
inside the 500 by 500 iframe okay so
let's try adding an iframe to our index
HTML document well first need to create
a basic HTML page called frame dot HTML
then we'll use that page inside the
frame okay so we'll come over to our
folder here and we're going to create a
new HTML document so a new text document
and remove everything and we're gonna
call that we'll call it frame HTML all
right so you know create it yes we're
going to open up it in notepad plus plus
and inside notepad plus plus we're going
to specify the doctype so every one tag
exclamation mark doctype Capitol's HTML
close the tag off now open up our HTML
tag and we'll set the Lang to equal
en - Us close tag and we'll do our
matching closing HTML tag now we'll just
do a quick title and we'll set the title
to be a frame exclamation mark we'll
close up our title alright now we'll do
our body buddy close off our body ok so
inside of our body we're just gonna put
a simple h1 title set the actual title
to equal this is a frame and we'll close
that off close off the tag and inside
the heading we're gonna say this is an
iframe then we'll close our h1 tag all
right and we'll do a quick paragraph as
well so the P tag I mean we can learn
this insight and now the web page
alright and it'll close up our P tag
alright so we'll save this and this is
going to be our frame dot HTML now we
come back to our index we've got a
insert the frame so underneath our form
section we will create another heading
for the way h2 and we'll call it I
frames and then we'll do a slash h2 it
off and now we're going to create our i
frame so to create our iframe we're type
the tag i frame
and we're gonna set the source attribute
to equal the frame HTML file that we
created just a second ago
we're gonna set the width to equal 500
and the height to equal 500 and we'll
set the name of the frame to equal my
frame
and those will come in handy a little
bit later I've closed off the opening
tag and then will also come down the
next line and close the iframe tag off
all right
so we've created our iframe we can save
this and we can come over to our web
browser refresh our page and we can
scroll down to our iframe and as you can
see we've got this border going on
around frame it's a pretty big frame and
it says this is an iframe and it's the
page that we loaded inside the frame so
cool it's all working yeah I think this
is a little too big so I'm going to make
it a little bit smaller so we'll make it
a 200 by 200 we'll save that and see how
it goes come back and it's a bit smaller
now bit easier to manage all right cool
all right so as mentioned a couple of
times before we can change the page
that's inside an iframe by using the
target attribute and a link to do this
we just set the target to the name of
the iframe in the example we have the
target of the a tag set to my frame
which is the same name attribute for the
iframe okay so let's add a link above
our iframe to our second page that we
created in earlier tutorial all right so
come back to our code and just after our
h2 gonna create an a tag and we're going
to set the page ref to equal second page
dot HTML and we're gonna set the target
to equal my frame all right we'll close
off that tag now inside about a tags
we're gonna say I'm gonna call the link
set frame to second page and then we'll
close off our a tag
now we'll put in a line break beer and
we'll have a look at how it looks so
come over to our web browser and we have
a link refresh and it says set frame to
second page so we quickly if we click
this link it'll come to our second page
and you can see that it's got refresh
stuck on come back here I'll just remove
this out sort of freshing every 10
seconds say it that again come back over
here and the roof refresh now we can
click this and open up this is my second
page this is a paragraph and we're gonna
say back a page and now we're looking at
the current page that were already on
inside of our frame it's looking a bit
like a frame ception all right cool this
concludes our tutorial on forms and
iframes if you have any questions leave
it in the comments and I'll try to
answer it as best as possible
