video on exploding unvalidated HTML form
elements the slideshow will be available
in the description some quick preamble a
basic understanding of HTML and
especially forms will help you in
following along with this tutorial /
discussion alright so what is exploiting
unvalidated HTML form elements it's
pretty common to hear about SQL
injections into sites stealing data or
compromising web servers and because of
this when you learn any web back-end
programming at school it's drilled into
your head to sanitize any parts of the
form that i can have SQL written into it
such as text and password fields however
many developers either don't know or
forget about form elements that have
hard-coded values things like checkboxes
radio buttons dropdowns sliders etc so
what can we do to make use of this lack
of knowledge or forgetfulness well as we
know HTML CSS and javascript is sent to
our browsers all of it the development
no longer has any control over the HTML
CSS or JavaScript we can modify the HTML
form values that might be unvalidated
this used to be a little bit of a pain
however now dynamic HTML editors are
built into some web browsers like
Firefox and Chrome this makes our jobs
super easy because we target the drop
downs or checkboxes it may just be
possible to slip by the validation and
exploiting the website it's always
important to keep in mind that
developers can be quite forgetful when
you're given a certain time frame to get
a web app up and running you may forget
some of the security side it may even be
that developer doesn't believe that
someone will try and attack their silly
website as a developer you should always
believe that every user is trying to
attack you until proven innocent okay
now let's get on to the fun little
demonstration an example I've put
together a simple survey on a local web
server the survey is of five movie
titles from 2015 that visitors can vote
on from one to five five being great one
being bad the rules enforced on the user
is that they are only allowed to vote
once on each movie so let's have a look
and exploit the voting system okay so
i'll come over to this web browser here
and we've got this little web app that
i've got here and
this year's movies and these are the
current remove ease up for voting so
we've got Kingsman which is currently
winning with an average rating of 4.6
and as we can see it says how would you
rate it and we have a little drop down
here with 125 and a vote button Oh got
taken three which is got an average
rating of 1.9 we've got black hat which
is an average rating of 1.5 we've got
inside out which is an average rating of
3.1 and we've also got American sniper
which is an average rating of 3.6 so
what we want to do is we want to exploit
this voting system so we have a look at
how it works so let's say we want to
devote five on Kingsman and we click
vote and it comes through and runs and
as you can see we've increased the
average rating just up a little bit as
there's obviously been a lot of people
that have already voted on it but
currently that's not going to really get
the movie that we want to be at the top
see we really liked the movie black hat
and we really really want it to be the
one that's winning so let's see if we
can exploit this voting system so in
Firefox we can open up the dynamic HTML
editor by right clicking and inspect
element so we're going to inspect
element on this drop-down now over here
we can see that we're at this little
form here that's our vote so it's got a
hidden input type which is of the value
black hat which is an ID and we've got
this little select and it's got the drop
down values so inside of our drop-down
we got the value 1 2 3 4 and 5 as we've
seen when we hit the drop-down / hit the
drop down with the 125 but let's say we
don't want to give it the value 5 we
want to see if we can get a higher value
through that so let's double-click and
it opens up the editor so we can edit
the values now so let's change the value
5 and let's say let's put in 1,000 so
we're going to essentially boost up our
vote by a long shot so now we can click
off and it'll set the value to 1,000
now if we come back and we click our
drop-down and select the five value
which is what we've just added the
option and we click vote it nothing has
gone wrong and we can scroll down and we
see that no longer Kingsman is no longer
winning and we scroll all the way down
to our black hat we can see that black
hat is now winning and it's got an
average rating of seventeen point eight
nine which is way higher than it that
should then should be possible but the
system still takes it and it wasn't
validated but if we say let's say we
wanted to try and vote again for our
Kingsman we want to keep voting five
it'll say nope you've already voted for
that movie so we're just cheating the
system and sending through a higher
value that's not validated cool so we've
got our favorite movie that's now
winning and our job is done here so to
summarize as a developer be mindful to
validate any data that comes from a form
through the post and get when looking at
forms and testing them think about what
elements may be left unvalidated and as
a final note it may interest you to know
that you can inject SQL through this
method to allowing for some pretty nasty
database attacks so this concludes our
look at exploiting unvalidated HTML form
elements I hope you got something out of
this video hopefully this will stay in
your mind when testing or creating HTML
forms you have any questions leave it in
the comments and I'll try to answer it
