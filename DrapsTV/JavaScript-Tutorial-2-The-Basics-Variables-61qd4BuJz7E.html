two basics and variables in this video
we'll be covering the basics such as
where we can place our JavaScript and
how we structure our code then we'll
also look at variables what they are and
how we use them then we'll finally see
how we can use arithmetic with our
variables everybody to have all
slideshows and code available in the
description first let's look at the
basics so we can get our hands on the
language javascript is a programming
language like most programming languages
instructions are given to the computer
and executed in sequence one after the
other to use JavaScript we place it in
our webpages using the script tag you
may have heard or see this tag used
before
well JavaScript is what it's for there
is one simple exception which we'll
cover in the next video we can place the
script tag inside either the head or the
body of the HTML in our web page
alternatively you can store JavaScript
code in a separate file or on another
website and load it into our web page an
important thing to remember is that
javascript is a client-side executed
code this means that our web page will
send the raw code to the viewers web
browser then the code is executed inside
their browser to change the web page for
the viewer ok let's try out our first
bit of JavaScript we're going to build a
base html5 template that will continue
to build on over the course of this
series to get some immediate feedback
from our JavaScript code we're going to
use this line of code called an alert
this is a function recognized by
JavaScript that completes a pop-up
action a webpage is going to start out
quite boring but it will become much
more interesting I promise okay
so we come across through an empty
folder or wherever we're going to be
running our JavaScript and we're going
to create a new text document let's call
it pop-up dot HTML alright so once we've
created our file we can right-click and
open it up and our editor so I'm going
to use notepad plus plus all right so
first thing we want to do is specify our
doctype
don't use HTML all right now I'll
specify our HTML page template so HTML
and I'll just do a body down close our
body and close the HTML all right so now
we've got a basic template for our HTML
page let's put in some JavaScript so
we're going to use the script tag and
then we're going to do an alert alert
open parenthesis inside the parenthesis
we can put a some words we want to
pronounce so we're gonna put up some
courts and inside the quotation marks
let's put hello close quotes close
parenthesis and then we put a semicolon
on the end this tells it this is the end
of the line of code alright now we want
to close our script tag so slash script
and we've written our first bit of
JavaScript so we can save this so then
ctrl s or file save once it's saved we
can open it up in our web browser so
I'll open this up and we get a pop-up
that says hello cool
so our javascript is working and we made
a pop-up it says hello now that we know
how to get set up and have a line of
code running let's start learning the
concepts and start building our
JavaScript knowledge variables are a
critical concept of all programming
languages they allow us to store data
and use it later in our code javascript
makes it really easy to create and
manage variables we can create a
variable using the VAR keyword var is a
special word recognized by JavaScript
that you intend to create a variable
with a certain name in the example here
we create a variable with the name X in
the second line we create the variable Y
and we set the value inside it to be the
number 10 then in the third line we
create a variable Z and set it to a
string of the text hello in JavaScript
text is surrounded with quotation marks
or apostrophes as you may remember from
our
box we use the equal sign in JavaScript
to set the value of a variable
on the left hand side keep in mind that
the names we give to a variable must be
unique if we want to store separate
values they must begin with a letter or
well they can start with a dollar sign
or an underscore but I suggest trying to
avoid this to save headaches later on
let's create some variables in our
practice web page will create two
variables and store our favorite number
and our name then we'll make them pop up
with our alert line of code by placing
our variables inside the brackets
alright let's come back over again and
we'll edit our document and we're going
to create a variable so var and we'll
call our variable name and we're going
to make it equal in quotes and I'll put
my name so drops and put a semicolon on
the end to tell JavaScript we finish
this line of code we'll go down to the
next line will do var again and we'll
call this number for our favorite number
that's gonna equal I'll do 17 and we'll
put a semicolon on the end to let
JavaScript know we've finished with this
line of code now we're going to create
our alerts so we'll do an alert open
brackets and then we can put our
variable straight in here so let's put
our name and on the end we're gonna put
out semicolon and then in the next one
we're going to alert the number which is
our favorite number and that's our code
written so we created two variables a
variable called name which has traps
stored inside it and we have a second
variable called number which has the
number 17 in it so we can save this we
can open it up in our web browser by
dragging it in or by double clicking it
and we get the pop-up traps we hit ok
and we get another pop-up saying 17
which is our number that we put in
awesome so we were successfully storing
the number 17 and our name cool now that
we can use variables we can start to
perform some arithmetic we can place an
arithmetic on the right-hand side of the
equals
9 in this example we have a variable X
and we are setting its value to be the
result of 10 plus 5 just like you would
in a calculator javascript allows us to
add subtract multiply divide and use
brackets there's also a few more such as
power modulus one thing to keep in mind
is baaad mass just like math from school
the order in which arithmetic is
calculated by the computer
it's brackets first then orders division
multiplication addition and subtraction
alright let's try it out okay so if we
come back to our code here we've got
we'll remove our var name and we'll just
keep our number and let's store 10 plus
5 so we're gonna store the result of 10
plus 5 and then let's alert out our
number so we can see what it is and then
we can modify what's inside our variable
number without having to specify bar
again so let me just say number because
JavaScript knows what number is it's a
variable that we created let's make it
equal 10 minus 5 I will put a semicolon
on the end and then we'll alert that
result out a number so whatever the
result was thought inside number and
let's do one more for good measure we'll
do number equals number so whatever is
currently stored in number times 10 Oh
Chris let me call on the end so what do
you think that's going to equal let's
alert that out and put in a number again
and colon semicolon on the end I miss
the semicolon up here I've got that in
there cool so we've got our six lines of
code here so we created a variable
number save 10 plus 5 to it so we'll
assume that that'll be 15 and then we
have our number again and we say 10
minus
five so will she Mets five and then a
third we're getting whatever is
currently stored in number timesing it
by ten and saving the resulting number
cool so let's save this and give it a
shot and see what we get so we can put
that into our web browser we get 15 so
10 plus 5 is 15
yep we get 10 minus 5 is 5 and we get
our final one is 50 because 5 was stored
inside number and we times 5 by 10 and
saved that side number cool so it's all
working our arithmetic did exactly what
we expected this concludes our look at
variables in JavaScript
don't fear if you struggle to grasp
everything we'll definitely be using
variables for the rest of this series
and slowly building on the basics we
learned here so you'll get plenty of
opportunity to get familiar with them
next we'll be learning about input and
output this is getting data into our
script from our web page and back out
again if you have any questions leave it
in the comments and I'll try to answer
it as best as possible don't forget to
