in this video we'll be looking at
networking and how we can use it to
communicate between our Python programs
this will be a rather long video as the
topic is quite complex every video of
all sliders and code available in the
description so what is networking
networking is a field of its own so we
won't go into it in too much detail the
more you know about how networking works
the more easier this will be for you
however it's not a necessity to know how
every inner working comes together to
make our programs communicate the
concept of networking is the
communication of two programs across a
network whether it be a local area
network or LAN or over the Internet
these connections can be between clients
or between client and server a client is
an end device interfacing with a human
whereas a server is a device providing a
service for clients there are two main
models for networking paradigms
the first being client-server model in
this model is the most common because
the server can run constantly and be
available for clients to connect to at
any time to receive the information they
require an example would be a web
browser being a client and the Google
website being the server you always want
the Google server to give you the web
page so you can search for the
information whenever you like the second
model is the peer-to-peer model this
model is more complex to set up however
it's useful for software that doesn't
have to be constantly available or for a
more private connection take voice for
example you don't want to have your
voice going to a server to be stored
before going to your friend though deep
down peer-to-peer is the client-server
model just the client acts like both the
server and the client
ok let's quickly clear up some
terminology we have addresses and ports
addresses our IP addresses all computers
connected to a network should have one
usually looks something like four
numbers separated separated by dots for
example 127.0.0.1 this is the loopback
address it points to your own computer
next we have ports port select
pigeonholes on your network card
they tell income coming data what
program to go to port numbers range from
1 to 65535 however the first 1,024 are
reserved for core protocols now what are
sockets sockets at the programming
concept for connections they allow us to
communicate in a bi-directional manner
from program to program across the
network once they connect or are ready
to transmit we can send data into them
and receive from receive data from them
sockets easily handle the implementation
of TCP and UDP here are some of the
methods that we'll be using the
Constructors socket takes 2 optional
parameters these are the socket family
by default is AF underscore inet meaning
the address and port are given in a
table and the other parameter is the
socket type which is either sock stream
or for TCP or soft diagram for UDP by
default it's set to sock stream the
method bind will bind a socket with a
port this takes a terpil of an address
and a port we will use this for our TCP
server as well as a UDP server the
method listen will instruct the socket
to start listening for incoming TCP
connections we then use the method
except to instruct the socket to accept
and forge the TCP connection with the
connecting socket this will return a new
socket object on our client side we use
the method connect to request a
connection with the listening server we
then use on both the client and server
the receive method which takes a buffer
length and then the send method which
takes the bytes to send finally we can
use the close method to close the
connection and the socket now before we
jump into the code let's look at what
TCP actually is
TCP or transmission control protocol is
a reliable connection based protocol
this means the protocol forms connection
with the other device and keeps the
connection going until it's closed the
reliable part is built into the protocol
if a piece of data is lost on its way
through the internet the protocol will
organize the data to be resent protocol
protocol also checks if the data is
corrupt and arrives in an ordered manner
TCP is slower than other protocols
because all of this checking and making
sure that all the data is there so it's
used in programs that must have all the
data of arrive such as web browsers
nobody wants a half half a web page when
if data went missing okay finally on to
some code let's create a simple TCP
client / server program that allows the
client to send some text to the server
and have it come back capitalized so
let's write a TCP server PI first and
then our TCP client PI a second okay
I'll come over to Dante here and we want
to create our files
so order them TCP server dot pi okay now
we need to import socket because we're
going to be working with networking so
import socket this will allow us to use
the socket module now let's define our
main because we'll do everything in the
main here so main okay so we want to set
what our host is going to be so host
equals 127.0.0.1 that means we want the
host to be this machine and we'll set
the port to equal five thousand because
it's easy to remember now let's create
our socket so we'll call it our socket
object s and we'll make it equal to a
new socket so the socket dot socket
open closed brackets so this will create
a new socket object now let's find that
socket to a port so s dot bind and it
will take at apple of the host and port
so we we type this in earlier so host
and port and close the brackets now we
want to tell our server to start
listening for connections so listen
and inside the listen we'll put in one
so we only want to listen for one
connection at a time okay now we're
going to use the accept function that
returns a connection which is a new
socket and the address so see for the
connection and a ddr4 the address that's
going to equal s dot except so we're
going to accept a connection that tries
to connect to us now let's print out
that we got a connection so print
connection from and then we will output
the string of the address okay now that
we've done that what we're going to do
is we're going to talk to the person
that's trying to send this data so while
true so forever while we're talking to
the client we're going to receive data
so let's create a variable data and make
it equal to the current connection dot
receive so this is going to receive some
bytes from the connection and the buffer
that we want to receive is the maximum
of 124 bytes
1,024 bytes so now if the data that we
were if not data that we receive so how
C dot receive will return false if the
connection was closed so if not data
we're going to break so that will end
our connection if the client ends the
connection now let's print out to the
server what we got from the user so the
data that we got from the user so from
connected user and string the data that
we received from the user
oh and either plus or plus their ice
let's plus the data and now what we're
going to do is we're going to set the
data to equal string of the data upper
so we're going to turn it to all
uppercase then we're going to print out
the string that we're sending so sending
plus string data and then to the connect
current connection we're going to send
the data okay now after our while so
when the connection is closed we want to
close our socket so C dot close okay and
that's our server done we'll just write
out if mean so if I'm just going to
scored name and scan score is equal to
let's go and score main let's go to
school then we want to run main okay so
I tell us over done let's save this and
now we have to write our client so our
client will call TCP client by
and once again we'll need to import
sockets to import socket and we'll
define our main so def main now we want
to set the host in the port that our
client is on so our host this is going
to be for our connect so this is this is
the host of the server that were
connecting to so the host is on that
current machine so 127.0.0.1 and the
port for the server was on five thousand
okay now let's create our socket so s
equals socket socket it's a new socket
okay now we want to try connecting to
the server so we're going to do s
connect and we're going to put in a
terpil of the host and the port okay now
if that succeeds it'll sit on connecting
or try and connect and then when that
succeeds it will now ask the user for a
message to send so get the message
message equals raw underscore input and
we'll put a little arrow to say you can
enter stuff after this line after this
error okay so we'll get a message from
the user
now while the message does not equal Q
we're going to use the letter Q to tell
our program to quit so while it doesn't
equal quit we're going to s so our
socket send and we're going to send our
message and that will send our message
down that down the socket to the others
to the server okay now we're going to
receive the data from the socket so
create a variable data that's going to
equal the socket
receive so this will wait for data to
come back from the server and we'll grab
a buffer of 1024 again and then we're
going to print out the message that were
just returned from the server so print
received from server plus string of the
data that we received back and then
we'll ask the user for a message again
so a message equals raw underscore input
put a little arrow in there okay now
after the whale is done we're going to
close to close the sockets or s close
now let's write out if if main so if I'm
just going to school name is equal to
main then run main okay so we can now
save this and we should have a working
TCP client server so you want to run
Python TCP server dot pi and what we got
to put an arrow so connection from our
we forgot across in that so open that up
again and we need to change this to plus
that's right quick again
okay trying it again and this time it's
sitting there waiting okay so it's
waiting for a connection our cup I'll
come over to this other terminal here
and I will run the TCP client PI okay
now see over on our server we've got a
connection from ourselves
and on the port fifty-seven thousand and
eighty five now over here we've got a
line totes asking is for a message so
hello my name is traps now when we send
that oh we got an error message not
defined okay sorry about that I have to
edit our TCP client and I've got a miss
miss type with the word message I'm just
trying to send so it's trying to send it
right there there we go I quit we'll run
our server again that's running and we
need to run our client again okay so
we've got a connection again this time
we're on a different port where the next
one up and I'll send again hello my name
is grabs and there we go we received
from the server the capitalized sentence
so over here I'm server you can see we
got a message from the user saying hello
my name is traps then we turned it
uppercase and we sent it back and we
received from the server hello my name
is traps and that's a basic TCP
connection we can press Q to quit now
and it will close our connection on both
ends cool
now now that we've seen that the TCP
works we'll have a look at UDP UDP or
user Datagram protocol is an unreliable
connectionless based protocol
this means the UDP never actually
connects with the other device it purely
sends the data off to an address whether
there is a computer there or not the
protocol is also unreliable meaning that
there is no guarantee that the data will
get to the other device if it's lost in
the internet it's lost forever
however because of because the protocol
doesn't resend and check every piece of
data it's very fast which makes it great
for real-time software like voice over
IP or online video games let's create
the same program as before however this
time we'll use UDP and see how the
program's differ you'll notice that we
use the methods received from and send
to these other UDP specific methods for
sockets okay so this time we'll call our
files UDP server and UDP client ok come
back over to bunt it and vim UDP server
dot pi okay now we're going to need to
import sockets again import socket and
define our mean okay now we want to set
our host for the server so again we'll
set the host to ourselves or 127.0.0.1
and we'll set the port to 5000 again
because it's easy to remember okay now
just like before we'll set our socket
objects to the value s make it equal a
new socket so socket dot socket and this
time we're going to override the
defaults so we need to pass in the
family and the socket type so the socket
family is AF underscore eye net so
socket dot a
f underscore inet and the type is a sock
diagram so socket dot sock underscore D
gram okay so now we're sending data
grams which is the UDP packet style
we need to bind our socket to a port so
s dot bind and we pass in a terpil of
the host and the port okay and what
we'll do is this time we'll print out a
statement saying the service started so
print server started okay now while true
we're going to grab data and an address
from the socket and we're going to
receive from and it's we're going to do
our 1,024 again for the buffer and this
will try and receive UDP messages in our
socket and it will keep waiting for a
message to come in okay so now we'll
print message from and we'll get the
string of the address so this will be
the address of the person that's sending
data to us and we'll print out a message
from connected user
Plus string of the data so you notice is
sort of similar to our last program okay
now we want to set the data to uppercase
so our data equals string data
upper turn you to uppercase again now
we'll print out the we're sending it
again so sending plus string of data
that'll be in uppercase and this time to
send back to the person who sent to us
we need to use the socket send to and
the send to method takes the data that
we want to send and then we have to
specify an address the sender too
because UDP isn't connected all the time
so we just need to know the address that
we're sending to so we'll send back to
the address that's sent to us originally
now outside of our while we'll close the
connection to s dot close and set up our
if so if it's going to have name equal
to main then we want to run main okay
that's our server a UDP server so you'll
notice we don't we don't listen and we
don't accept connections there is no
connections happening here we're just
receiving data and sending data I'll
save this and now I'll write the client
so our UDP client okay now for our
client I'm going to need sockets again
so import socket
and deaf our main okay so now we want to
set our host name so our host equals 1 3
7 0 0 1 and our port has to be different
because we're setting up technically
another server so we'll set our port to
5001 okay now we need to specify the
server that we're sending to so create a
variable called server and that will
equal a terpil of the address of the
server we're sending to so the IP is
127.0.0.1 which is the address of a
current machine and the port was on
5,000 okay now let's create our socket
so s equals socket dot socket and we
need to override our family so socket
dot AF underscore eye net and we need to
set the socket type so socket dot sock
underscore diagram okay that's our
socket object now we near bind it so f
dot bind and the terpil of the host and
the port and now let's get a message
from the from the user so we get message
equals raw underscore input and just put
a little arrow little error
now well oops well the message does not
equal Q again while we don't want to
quit will s send to our message to the
server okay now we are going to receive
back from the server so we need to store
the data and the address and that's
equal to the socket receive from and our
buffer size of 1024 okay
now let's print out what we'd received
so print received from server plus
string of the data oops
okay now make sure I've spelt message
correctly everywhere yeah yep looks like
it now message again is equal to raw
underscore input as we'll get the
message the user wants to send next so
whether they want to quit and then after
the while is done I'm going to close the
socket so s close now that's our client
done so if name is equal to main
we want to run the name okay that's our
client done so let's give it a test so
save this and we'll run the EGP server
python UDP server hi and says server
started so now it's just what's waiting
to receive data from somebody trying to
send messages to it
so over here we'll run our UDP client
UDP client and we get a waiting so it's
waiting for a message to try and send to
the server so I'll do hello my name is
drops and as you can see it's made to
the server and it's received a string
capitalized it and then it sent it back
to us and we can keep entering messages
so hello and we receive it back capitals
until we press Q and we quit and you'll
notice that the server doesn't shut down
and this is because we haven't put in
any methods to tell with the shutdown
yet okay you may have noticed in our
programs that the program will sit and
wait for a connection on the or to
receive the data sometimes we may not
want our program to hold up and wait we
can solve this with threads or setting
the socket to non-blocking non-blocking
just tells the socket that if there's no
data to grab try to grab it anyway and
continue this way our program always
continues however if no data is present
an error will be caused so make sure you
deal with that I haven't I've made an
extra video in which we build a command
line chat program hopefully this video
may help your understanding of how
networking is set up I also use the non
blocking state that we talked about in
the last slide an annotation will be
on-screen to take you to that video now
I hope you know if you have a feel for
networking and how to go about adding it
to your Python program
next we're going to cover CGI
