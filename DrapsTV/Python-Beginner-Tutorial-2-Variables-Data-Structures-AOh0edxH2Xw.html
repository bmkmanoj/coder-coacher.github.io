and data structures every video will
have all slideshows and code available
in the description variables are one of
the most important parts of programming
variables allow us to store data we can
store different values like integers
real numbers boolean strings and more
complex data structures like lists or
dictionaries parks and reserves space
for a value and the variable is declared
to declare a variable we use the
structure variable name equals a value
so let's test this out what we're going
to do is I'm going to open up my Ubuntu
VM and we're going to do some Python so
let's open up our terminal and open up
the interpreter by typing Python in the
interpreter will create a variable
called my number my number and we'll
make it equal to three now let's create
a variable called my number and it
equals three we can now print out that
number so we can check what's in it so
let's take print and then the variable
name so my number and it will print out
three we can also change the values of a
variable and we use the same way we
declared it except because we're reusing
it we're changing its value so we get my
number equals 10 and we've just changed
the value to 10 and it's printed again
to see it
and it prints out 10 this is pretty cool
however it's not very useful currently
let's look at some arithmetic math we
can do with Python Python allows for
seven basic arithmetic operators
that's addition subtraction
multiplication division modulus exponent
and floor division now most of these are
pretty self-explanatory modulus is
dividing a number by a number and
getting it the remainder exponent is ^
and floor division is dividing and then
rounding down okay so let's try out some
of these some of the operators we'll
start with the plus so what we can do is
we can make our our number so my number
equals 10 plus 90 what that'll do is it
will add the two together and then save
the answer into our variable so that we
can print out my number and we'll get
100 first is very nice for doing math
let's subtract 50 from my number so what
we can do is we can actually use my
number on the right hand side as well so
if we make my number equals my number's
current value minus 50 so what this will
do is will get what my number's current
value is minus 50 and then save it back
into itself so we set past that into
improper and then print it out my number
get 50
so we can do the same thing but we can
use a shortcut now most of arithmetic or
in fact all arithmetic operators in
Python have a shortcut for modifying the
original variable so instead of having
to type my number twice we can just type
my number - equals - Eagles but - Eagles
50 so what this does is it does exactly
the same thing as our last line except
we only have to write my number once so
what it does is get my number minus 50
and make it equal so we hit enter on
that print my number will get zero now
there's a lot of shortcuts and it does
it for every single operator in Python
and there's a link to all the other
sorts of operators in Python in the
description now float division five
divisions a little bit more complex when
we're dividing if we were to just divide
121 by 50 we would get an incorrect
result let's test it out so we do
let's hear mine number equals 11 times
11 now if we print that out we get 121
now let's try dividing 121 by 50 so we
do my number divide equals 50 now if we
print out my number
well we'll get the number my number we
get to which isn't correct because we
should get to point four two so let's
let's talk about flirt division so
flight division is dividing correctly
two decimal places so if we do we do my
number equals one to 1.0 so this makes
our our number a float rather than a
whole number and we divide it by a float
so 50 point zero and then we print it
out my number we get two point four two
and that's the correct division so
remember that we need to specify that
the number is a float if we want it to
be divided as such otherwise it'll be
divided as an integer and will be
rounded down if you want to do for
division so that was the double slash if
you remember your back double slash for
division what we can do is we can also
do that on floats so we go back to our
VM my number equals all the slash slash
equals so for division actually what
those with make equal one to one point
zero for division 50.0 so we do this and
print it up should get to
this is because we're forcing floor
division so flooring the number after
we've divided now let's look at some
more complex variables the string type
is basically text so we surround our
strings in quotes just like we did with
their hello world so a string is a bunch
of letters that we want to remain as
such not turn into numbers so we can
make up our variable so let's make
however a variable called text and we'll
make it to hello world and close it
quotes then we can save that to the
variable so now that text variable holds
a string that contains the letters hello
world now if we type print text we'll
get hello world strings are that easy in
Python
of course there's more we can do with
strings however that will be covered in
all the time
now we come to more complex variables
lists for lists lists hold an array of
values we declare a list with us with
square brackets so for example nums
equals square brackets we can then help
add values to that list by using the dot
append function names dot append 21 this
will add the value 21 to our lists and
then we can print out that list with the
print function now let's let's have a
look at it come back to our Python
interpreter let's create nums equals a
list
and then numbs dot append open brackets
and then the value what we all want to
put in there so it's put 21 in there and
then let's add some more so let's go
nums dot and 40.5 numbs dot append I'm
not a number so there we go we've added
three different types of variables into
our variable of lists or our list
variable you can now print it out that
list by typing print nums and python
will handle everything and we'll print
out our list in square brackets lists
are just that simple it has many other
functionalities but for but again that
will be covered later lastly we have
dictionaries now dictionaries are
similar the lists but use a hash map if
you don't order hash map is pretty much
it uses a string key and a value and
like store the value to that key so we
use a colon to separate the key from the
value so if we think of a dictionary
called services and we have we set the
values FTP 221 and the value ssh 222 we
can print the data dictionary three ways
so let's let's quick quickly have a look
at it if we create a old dictionary call
it services and make it equal to FTP :
21 and then SSH : 22 and we'll add
SMTP and save that 2508 that equal 25
and then make HTTP and set that to 80
and then we close it off with this
squiggly bracket now we enter that'll
save our dictionary to that variable
name and we now look at the dictionary
three different ways we can print the
whole dictionary with our normal print
function print services and we'll get
our list just how it looks when we
entered it or we can print it to see the
keys or just the values so if we want to
print it to see keys we type services
dot keys and we put brackets on there
and it will print out just the keys so
FTP SMTP SSH and HTTP or we can print
out just the values so if we do services
dot values brackets it will print out
just the values in the list in order of
how they're stored so that gives us a
list of values and this concludes our
look at variables next we'll be looking
at input and output don't fear if you
don't remember all of this you can
easily come back and re-watch the video
to consolidate all the information and
if you have any questions and can't find
an answer after a quick Google search
feel free to leave it in the comments
next we're covering input and output and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
