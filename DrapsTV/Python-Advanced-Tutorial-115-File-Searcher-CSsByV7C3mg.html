searcher with pickle in this extension
video we'll be looking at using pickle
to save the current position and state
of a file searching program every video
have all slideshows and code available
in the description some quick preamble
this is a tutorial extending on the
topic of pickling from the Python
advanced tutorial 11 i will also assume
you know the basics of Python okay what
is it we will be creating a file
searching program that can search the
insides of files in a directory and all
of that directory sub directories it
will also use pickle to store the its
current progress in the search just in
case the program is shutdown before the
search finishes because we don't know
exactly when the private program might
end we'll use a thread in the background
to pickle the file the key methods we'll
be using is the get state and set state
methods because pickle cannot save an
open file handle we must make sure that
doesn't try we can use get state to get
the current state of an object the
default behavior is that it just returns
a copy of the classes dictionary but
we'll have to change the default
behavior to delete the file handle from
the dictionary before we return it we'll
also use the set state method which sets
the state of an object it's default
behavior is to just update the
dictionary this method will be where
most of the magic happens as we'll have
to create the file handle here and
return it to the point it was last then
update the class dictionary okay let's
get on to the code let's create the
searcher program we can use it to search
entire directories of files forwards or
regular expressions we'll call it search
or PI inner in order to make this video
shorter I pre-made some of the simpler
parts but I'll still have a quick
overlook on them so I'll come over to
Ubuntu and I'll open up my such a
program now as you can see in here we
import pickle because we're going to
need pickle import regular expressions
which is re we import the OS and time
because we need to be able to access the
files and the directories
we abort up past to make it just a
little bit more friendly when we're
running the program and we import
threads from threading now we have our
file such a class here now this file
such a class is where most of our
program is going to happen so we're
going to need our initialization
function so def I'm just going to scroll
in it and let's go down the school and
it'll take itself and a file list and
we'll also take a search string okay now
we're going to create our attributes for
our file cetera so self dot file list is
going to take the file list that we pass
in self dot search string it's going to
take the search string that we pass in
and we're going to need some state
variables so self dot curve file it's
going to be the current file we're up to
in the list self dot cur line is going
to be the current line we're up to and
no birth data 0 we're going to have our
file handle so self dot file it's going
to equal open self dot file list and
then inside the list we're going to pick
the self dot current file Soaker file
and we're going to open that up ok now
we're going to have a self dot result
which is going to hop via list that
holds all of the results that we find
and we're also going to have a self done
which will be so equal true once we're
done so let us start off as false okay
now we have a couple of just get our
functions here so is done will return
whether it's done get results will
return the list of results and get
current will get where it's up to
currently inside the search now we need
to define our search line function which
will be where we do all our searching so
def search line now that's going to take
just self now we're going to immediately
set self dot current line Soaker line
plus equals one so we're going to bump
it up to line one if this is the first
run otherwise we're going to keep
incrementing the line that we're up to
now line is going to equal self dot file
dot read line and that will get a the
line that we're currently up to now if
the line that we have well if it's not a
line sorry if not line so we get an
empty string back then we're going to
set self file to plus equal one so we're
going on to the next file now we don't
know if this is going to be outside of
the file list so if not self dot curve
file is less than the length so Len of
self dot file list then we're going to
set self dot done to equal true and
we're going to return because we've
searched all the files returned so if it
is on to the next file and we haven't
run out of files to search I'm going to
set self
curl line back to zero we want to start
at the first line in the next file and
self dot file to the file handle we're
going to dot close because we want to
close that file now we're going to self
dot file again this time we're going to
make it eagle to the next file so open
self dot file list and serve her file
and we'll open that up okay now outside
of our ifs back to our search line
function we're going to actually search
so search result is equal to re search
so our regular expression and self dot
search string the line and the flags
were going to give it is re dot M for a
match and re dot I for B case
insensitive okay so if there is a search
result then we want to add it to our
results so self dot results dot append
and we're going to append self dot file
list self curve file to the current file
plus hangout put a backslash in here
just so it's easier to read plus comma
line : plus string of self dot curl line
so the current line that we're up to and
then we're going to end that append okay
so that's our search line function done
no method and now we're going to write
our get
state now set state so def def
underscore underscore underscore
underscore get state I'm just going on
the score and that's going to take just
itself and get state we want to create a
temp dictionary to store the Dixit their
classes dictionary and so we'll call it
temp dick and that's going to equal self
dot underscore underscore dict
underscore underscore dot copy now we're
going to delete the file handle so deep
del for delete temp dipped and we want
to delete the file attribute so this is
our self dot file attribute of the class
and then once we've deleted it we want
to return temp dipped and at Dow get
state function done now we can write our
set state to Def underscores or set
state and this takes its self and a
dictionary now we want to create a
temporary variable for our list so list
temp and this is our list of files
that's going to equal the dick that gets
passed in file list so the file is
attribute and then we want to create a
temporary file handle so f temp should
be a file handle equals open and this is
where we open up our file handle and
it's going to be list temp which we
created just a second ago and that's
going to take inside it dict current
file
and then that will be our open so we'll
open up the current file that we're up
to now we need to do we need to go
through our current file back to the
line that we were at before week when we
saved so for I in range dict curl line
so the current line attribute door up to
what is to be dipped the current line
we're going to F temp so our file handle
we're just going to tell it to read line
we're not going to actually do anything
with the result from read line we're
just going to read up to the point we're
up to okay now we're going to set self
dot underscore underscore dict let's go
underscore dot update and we're going to
pass in the dictionary that we passed
into this function and now we want to
set self dot file to equal F temp so we
set our file handle to our attribute
file and that's our set state done and
this is it for our class so our class is
done now what we need to do now is we
need to create our function for our
thread so def and we'll call it save
progress and this will take an object
and a file name and what we'll do is
just in two easy lines with open the
file name in write binary as out we're
going to pickle dot dump the object into
out and that's our threading function
done okay so we'll go down to our main
and as you can see here I've already
setup opt pass and I'll pass we'll just
handle all our options in the command
line so now that we've gotten all of our
options and stuff in we need to start
writing out our core programs so telling
our file searcher what to do so we need
to write an if first
so if OS path dot is file so we're going
to check if a file is there and we want
to check s data so we'll use s data
pickle as our save file so this will be
our save state and we want to check if
it's there then we want to open it so
with open and s data dot pickle as in
file we want to create our search or so
such a equals pickle blowed and the in
file is where we're going to load it
from okay and then we'll print out after
we've loaded in print zooming out and
then we'll print out the current place
at attack put a backslash N and in there
to make it look pretty plus searcher dot
get current so this is the string
function that we wrote earlier and that
will just print out its current position
in the search okay now if it doesn't
exist so else we're going to find the
files that we want to search so files
equals an empty list and then we're
going to do for the dirt path the dirt
names
and the file names in OS walk and then
the path so the path is what we passed
in by a command line we are going to go
into our four and then we're going to do
another for loop so for F path so this
is for the file path in file names and
file names is a list of all of the files
in the current directory that the walk
is at we're going to set f path to equal
dur path plus the string forward slash
put forward slash plus the F path for
the file itself okay and then we need to
append that to the files list so files
dot append F path and that will go
through and add all of our paths and all
of our parts in our sub directories to a
list and now we can create a so our
search also searcher equals file search
up and in our file feature if you
remember it takes the file list so files
and it takes the word to search for so
the search string and then we'll just
print out that we're searching and put
some double dots in there okay now
outside about if-else we can continue
with our programs running now because we
don't know how many lines there's going
to be will do a while not well not
search uh dot is done so while it's not
done we're going to search our dot
search line
and that will search our line and if
there's a result found in that line it
will save it into the results now we
need our thread to save the progress so
we'll just call it t1 for the thread 1
equals thread and then the target
function for the thread is going to
equal save progress and the args is
going to equal such a and file name s
data dot PKL
okay and that will create our thread now
we just need to tell it to start so t1
start and that will go off and it'll
that'll save our progress and then it
will end and that will do that every
time we such a line now because I want
to show that we can cancel it halfway
through and resume I'm just going to add
a time dot sleep here and I'll sleep it
for 0.05 seconds so if not not for very
long and then but comment this out when
you actually want to use it so just put
a comma hatch in front of it to comment
it out oops and now we're going to do
our for loop so we'll do a for I in
searcher dot get results so if it finds
any results that will go through the
list of results get results and will
print I the result and then we're going
to do another time dot sleep and this is
just to make sure that the thread is
totally finished with setting saving the
pickle lipids if it happens to be doing
it so that we can use OS remove to
delete the file so s data dot pko we're
going to remove it so we're going to
delete it after we're done with it and
as you can see I've got my if main so
just going to make sure we have that in
there so run our function and hopefully
haven't missed anything and it's all
been right should run first go so I'll
save that out and we'll call python
searcher dot pi and become a release
filesystem here we've got my such a code
file here and then we've got some other
files in this directory and then we got
another subdirectory that has some files
in it as well and as you can see I got I
got a thread in here and a Jeff if we
come back look at another thread inside
this file so we should see two Fred's
pop up at least so if we search for Fred
so that's W forward we'll search Fred -
D for der and we'll just go to current
directory so a dot now if we start
searching and then we interrupt halfway
through so we've got an interrupt we can
search again and it will resume so
resuming it file 2 out of 12 and it was
currently at line 24 when it came back
and we can interrupt again and we can
try the search again set file 6 out of
12 and it was at the first line and if
we just let it go there we go it's found
in names.txt
line 3 in line 8 and in the directory
something in test 2 on line 1 so if we
come over here to our names
we've got line 3 which we have Fred and
we have line 8 which is Freddy
ok so that seems to have worked and
something we've got what was it in test
to come across something test 2 and yep
Fred's the first first name inside that
so it's on line 1 cool so everything
worked silky smooth come and come back
over to side show you I hope this gave
you a more hands-on look at how to use
pickle to save class data as well as how
to save the state of an object that has
an open file handle
you can use this method as well for
saving soccer connections as well
feel free to leave any questions in the
comments and I'll do my best to answer
them thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
