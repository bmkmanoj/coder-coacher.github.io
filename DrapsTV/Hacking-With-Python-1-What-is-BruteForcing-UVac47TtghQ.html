brute forcing every video will have all
slideshows and code available in the
description a brute-force attack or also
known as an exhaustive key search is
known in cryptography as the process of
trying all possible keys rather than
decrypting the key systematically every
possible combination is tried until the
correct and matching key is found the
time taken to search every possible
solution increases exponentially with
the keys length to shorten the time we
use dictionaries dictionaries are a list
of common passwords or keys however a
brute-force attack has limits with
increased cryptography technology keys
such as 256 512 1024 and even 2048 bit
are deemed safe from brute fault
brute-force attacks even with a series
of today's supercomputers a 256 bit key
is estimated to take 3 times 10 to the
51 years a dictionary brute-force attack
is always much faster than that of a
full key search however is not
guaranteed to produce a successful key
if this happens another dictionary could
be used or possibly a different approach
is required dictionaries are usually
most successful with passwords because
people find it easier to remember words
rather than a random sequence of length
8 to 16 a lot of great dictionaries can
be found online such as the dart code
list which is quite popular and has also
been quite successful in the past
it contains 1.7 million passwords in
keys with a 4 to a core CPU it will take
roughly 2 hours to complete the whole
list have a copy of the list in the
tutorials folder in the description
smaller dictionaries are a great are
great to use to making your own or using
others are possible ways to obtain these
usually you want to keep it low in words
for quick completion before resulting to
a large dictionary like dark code if you
can there you can eliminate the most
common passwords and even the default
passwords for certain devices looking at
a manufacturer's website you can find
the default password for their model of
device in the support section you'll be
surprised how many people do not change
the default password
the most common passwords are admin
password and welcome if one of these
passwords are set for your wireless
routers web interface suggest changing
it immediately our finer tacks are hard
to be prevented because the attacker has
all the time they need to crack the key
to be able to perform an offline attack
to require the hashed key as well as
knowing the method used to hash the key
so you can reproduce the hashing
procedure to try and match the hashed
keys a hashing system can sometimes be
hard to discover online attacks are
trying to attack loading screens of
websites usually these can be prevented
most of the time with attempt
restrictions for example only allowing
three to four attempts before locking
add for 12 hours or something or even
detection systems if more than five
attempts are made in less than 30
seconds lock the account and notify an
admin obviously online attacks are
easier to detect with so many requests
slowing the website as well as proving
some sort of notification system however
online attacks still work sometimes as
people are forgetful and don't think of
security it's possible to build cracking
machines the purpose of fast processing
allowing you to speed up the cracking
process majority of the time these are
in a way array of GPUs which the work is
split over to find a solution much
quicker this can be quite expensive and
use more power to run so keep that in
mind I hope you now have a better
understanding of what a brute-force
attack is don't fear you to remember all
this you can easily come back and
re-watch the video to consolidate any of
the information you've learned if you
have any questions leave it in the
comments and I'll try to answer it as
best as possible next we'll be writing a
UNIX password cracker using a
brute-force attack thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
