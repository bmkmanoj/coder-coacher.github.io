non-persistence groups in this video
we're looking at some very basic
cross-site scripting in the form of non
persistent scripts every video of all
slideshows anchor it available in the
description if you want to follow along
and try out everything we learn you can
watch the setting up our XSS environment
video this will give you a legal and
safe testing environment the video will
explain how to download and install the
xampp web server under windows and how
to setup all the files for this tutorial
series ok what is the non-persistent
script well it's just as the name
describes the script does not persist on
the website this means the attack only
affects the user running the code
directly a benefit of trying a non
persistent attack is that any success
with injecting a script may indicate
that the website's Creator may have
gotten protection in another section of
the site now it's not very useful to
attack yourself so we need to be a
little crafty a non persistent script
can also be referred to as reflected
cross-site scripting as we'll see you I
in just a moment so what is reflected
cross-site scripting I personally like
to make the distinction between non
persistent and reflected XSS reflected
XSS is harnessed by attaching the
malicious script to the end of a URL
such link though it may be obvious to
see code in the end of a URL there are
many possible techniques of hiding it
also keep in mind that some less
technical internet users would have no
idea what to look for in addition link
shortening services can make this a very
deadly approach so what can a reflected
XSS attack do reflected attacks is the
most popular cross-site scripting method
of choice for example common attacks at
things like redirect to a phishing site
steal cookie information or even force
the user to make an action like clicking
on a button on the site they visit all
right let's move on to giving it a shot
the PHP code file can be found in the
description if you followed the setup to
true you should know where to put it
we'll try some very basic mucking around
with some HTML tags then we'll start
trying out the JavaScript ok so I'm
going to come over to my web browser
here and I've got the tutorial open
and it's at my local host /xs follows
h2so4 tutorial 2 or in the 2 folder so
we've got this search field here and
this is a very basic website and it's
try my new search feature and we can
type in a such term so let's say we want
to type in test and we hit search there
we go I haven't got any search results
so the results of your search for tests
is sorry no results found and we can
also notice that up in the top bar of
our URL we have the search parameter and
the word test as the value and this is
because it's centers get okay so let's
see what happens if we put in a HTML tag
so let's try putting in the eye tag for
italics and we won't close it it hit
search now we'll see that the rest of
the page after the results for your
search and it's invisible is all in
italics as we've opened up the italics
tag but not closed it cool so what what
other things can we put in here let's
try the font tag and we'll set the color
to equal blue and then we'll close off
the font tag but we won't end the font
tag we won't have a matching closing tag
and we hit search you'll notice that
everything after our search term becomes
blue so it's actually placing this tag
in where our search term would be
printed back out okay so this is
interesting so let's see what we can do
if we start using the script tag so if
we open up our tags again we type script
and inside of our script tags we're
going to type alert which is a pop-up
box and we're going to just alert XS x
the string XSS the XSS and then we need
to close off our script tag so we don't
actually have to close it but we want to
make sure we don't cause any problems on
the
website so we're going to close the
script tag now if we'll hit search
you'll see that it pops up with the
alert box saying XSS so we've found a
cross-site scripting vulnerability in
this search now you can also see up the
top we've got our search and it also got
the script code for us to send this link
to somebody
providing this was on a external web
host then they would get the same pop up
as it would be trying to search the same
term cool
so hopefully you get the basic idea
let's quickly talk about the attack
strategies you might employ to attack
your victim or victims the nice thing
about reflected attacks is you can
specifically target a certain victim
through perhaps an email or an instant
messaging service alternatively if you
are aiming to target a crowd of people
you could publish link to a website or
social media trying to trick them into
clicking it once again URL shortening
services make this much easier in a
later video we'll also talk about other
ways to hide the code the next thing
we'll be looking at is making our
attacks stick with permanent scripts if
you have any questions leave it in the
comments and I'll try to answer it as
best as possible don't forget to
