inheritance every video will have all
slideshows and code available in the
description inheritance is the concept
of a class inheriting features from
another class making it a subclass this
is useful if you have more than one
class that use the same variables or
methods so rather than adding them to
both you make a base class with them and
have your other classes inherit them
keeping your curtain eat and specific to
the class for example let's say we're
making a pet history program while we
have a class for each type of pet they
all have things in common they have
names ages and details rather than
adding each of these fields to every
class we can create another class called
pet and all the other classes can
inherit from so let's talk about some of
the terminology used in inheritance
first of all we have the base class this
can also be referred to as the
superclass we also have the subclass sub
class inherits from a base class or
superclass hence being a subclass if you
like you can even have a subclass of a
subclass in fact you can inherit as many
times as you like so let's have a look
at inheritance and what it looks like so
let's create a file called pets py so I
come across Ubuntu and I'll create a
file called pets UI okay so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna create a class
called pet and this is going to be our
base class so class class and it's gonna
be caught pet
you know inside our pet class we're
going to define our initializer So Def
im just gonna score in it I'm just going
to school and we're gonna pass himself
as always and we're gonna pass in a name
and an age and we'll set those
attributes up so self dot name equals
name and so dot age equals age and
that's our pet class defined now what
we're gonna do is we're going to create
a cat class so class cat but this time
we're going to inherit from pet so we
open up brackets and we type in pet
because that's the class that we want to
inherit from okay so now we go into at
class and what we're gonna do is we're
gonna create another init function so
initialization for this class underscore
underscore and we're gonna pass hidden
so a name and an age okay so now inside
our in initialization function what
we're gonna do is we're going to call
the initialization of our superclass so
the pet class and to do this we type pet
for the class dot underscore underscore
init underscore underscore open brackets
and we just pass in all the stuff that
we did before name and age okay so now
what we've done is we've created our cat
class and it uses all the attributes
from our pet class okay now we'll test
out using this inherited class so we'll
define our main function
def main
and what we'll do is we'll create a
object called the pet and this will just
be a pet class and we'll set the name to
pet and we'll make it age one so this is
a object of pet the base class now we'll
create a object called Jess which will
be a cat and the name of the cat will be
Jess and Jess will be three years old
okay so now we have two objects we have
a pet object and we have a cat object
and the cat object also inherits from
the pet class so we can test to see that
inheritance is working by using the is
instance function so what we'll do is
we'll write some print printouts so
we'll do is Jess a cat and then we'll
add a string and inside here we're going
to do his instance of Jess a cat so is
our just object a object of class cat
and we'll close that off and now we'll
do another print statement so is Jess
pet then we'll add our string is
instance Jess a pet
and then we'll do two more so print is
the pet put the pet cat
string is instance the pet a cat and
print is the pet
pet plus yeah is instance the pet a pet
okay and now what we'll do is we'll just
print out just that name so the
attribute from the pet class that was
inherited into the cat class is the name
okay now we'll call our main so if it's
gonna stall I'm just gonna store name is
equal to main oops
then what run main oops I missed a quote
okay so let's save this and we'll give
it a run a Python pets py now as you see
we'll get our print out so this is just
a cat that's true so just is an object
of cat is Jess a pet which is true so it
did inherit it inherit from pet so it is
a subclass of pet true is the pet a cat
it's false because the pet does not
inherit from cat cat inherits from pet
so the pet can't be cat and is the pet a
pet which is true and then we print out
the name of Jess
so that works quite well okay so there's
one more important topic to inheritance
which is called polymorphism
polymorphism is the concept of defining
a method in your base class that must be
overrated by a subclass each subclass
has a different implementation of the
method so when the superclass method is
called it chooses which method to run
depending on the subclass so let's add
some basic polymorphism to our program
so what we'll do is we will create a
method that's called talk which will
make a different output depending on
what the subclass is so we'll also add
dogs okay so let's open up to edit again
and we're going to create a method for a
pet class called talk so DEF talk self
and inside this method because it's
going to be an abstract method meaning
that it needs to be overridden we are
going to raise an exception if it's
called without being a subclass so
arrays not implemented error and we can
also put a custom string in here so we
say sub class must implement abstract
method and that will be the error
message we get if somebody tries to call
the talk method on the pet class okay so
now that we've got that method ready to
be inherited inside our cat class we're
going to override it
so def talk talk
and that'll take so okay inside this cuz
it's overriding we're going to return a
string of meow the sound of the cat
makes and we've overridden that there so
let's also create another class and this
is gonna be our dog class and dog is
also a pet
now we'll define our initializer for it
underscore in it it's gonna school self
name and age and we'll call our pet
superclass you know and we'll set how
variables by attributes okay now we're
gonna create a talk functioning because
we must override it
the DEF talk self and we'll return what
okay so we've written our functions well
our methods and now we can change up our
main to test it out
so inside our main will remove all of
our current code that we have so we
don't need that anymore
and we'll test out our polymorphism okay
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
create our list so we'll call the list
pets and we'll make that equal to a cat
object it's gonna be in the first slot
and I can have to name Jess and just can
be three years old and we'll add a dog
object
and the dog can be jack and that can be
age too and we'll add another cat and
that can be Fred and he's seven and then
just for testing and to see how how it
looks when we try and call a coal the
top function on pet will add a pet
object and we'll call it the pet and the
pet can be five okay so we've got a list
of four objects we've got a cat object a
dog object and another cat object as
well as a pet object okay so what we're
gonna do now is we're gonna go for pet
in pets so we're going to go through
each of the objects in the list and
we're going to print out some
information about them so print I will
do the name plus pet name and then I'll
do age and we have to turn that to a
string because pet that age is a integer
age and we'll add what it says saves
plus pet dot talk and we call the talk
function now it will automatically
assume that inside that list are all pet
objects because there are all instances
of pet objects even though they're
subclasses because they still inherit
from a superclass it'll generalize them
all as the superclass okay so now we can
save this and run it
so if we run it you'll see we get named
Jess age three says meow and named Jack
age 2 says wolf and named Fred age 7
says meow and then we get an error which
is our pet class and you'll see on the
very bottom just before we go back to
the terminal we have not implemented
error subclass must implement abstract
method this is the error message that we
wrote inside those brackets so if you
get this kind of error you know that
you've not implemented it correctly okay
so now that we've covered that we'll go
on to one last subject which is called
multiple inheritance it's just as it
sounds you can have inherit from more
than one class by separating each class
with a comma when defining a new class
however be careful when doing this you
can cause yourself a lot of trouble if
you have identical attribute names in
two or more base classes the same goes
for methods and this concludes our look
at inheritance I hope you now have an
understanding of how inheritance works
extra code will be available in the car
txt in the slides folder as well as a
challenge task I highly recommend doing
the challenge task for this tutorial
because it will give you a much greater
understanding when you actually have to
do inheritance yourself don't fear if
you don't remember all of this you can
easily come back and rewatch this video
to consolidate all the information
inheritance can be quite hard to grab if
you don't try it out so if you have any
questions feel free to leave them in the
comments next we'll be covering
iterators and generators thanks for
