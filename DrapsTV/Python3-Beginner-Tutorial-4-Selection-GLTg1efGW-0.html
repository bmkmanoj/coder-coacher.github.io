selection every video have all
slideshows and code available in the
description selection is the second main
concept that makes up a program we've
already learned the first which is
sequence sequence represents the program
executing line after line selection is
the concept of choices allowing the
program to decide based on a boolean
expression whether to execute a certain
block of code or to not in Python this
is through the use of the if statement
if you have learned any other languages
you'll have also heard of the switch or
case statement pattern does not have
this it is important to notice that
Python use the indents to decide when
code is inside of an if statement this
could be a single space however I
suggest a one tab width of four let's
write our first if statement now like
the last tutorial let's create a Python
file this will help us better understand
the concept of selection so let's call
this file to 4 PI and open it in your
text editor ok so I'm going to come
across to Ubuntu here and then to 4 PI
ok now I'm going to set up my tab width
so I'm going to go colon set space tab
stop equals put equals 4 and that will
set my tab width now like before we
press a to get into our insert mode and
let's start writing some code so let's
create a variable called num and make it
equal an INT of the input from the user
and let's ask them please enter a number
colon close quote close bracket close
bracket ok
now let's run our if statement so let's
write if our variable num is equal to so
we use 2 equals so to represent is equal
to and then we'll put the value 0 then
to let our if statement note that if
this is true we're going to execute a
block of code we're going to press the
colon
going to go down a line now once we go
down the line we want to indent one so
as you can see we've been indented from
the left-hand side of the screen now
we're going to print out is string so
we're going to print out the number is
zero close quotes closed brackets now
we're going to press ENTER again go down
to the next line and we'll go down
couple loans and we're going to stay
back on the left-hand side we've done
without if statement now we're just
going to print out number num just to
see what it is just in case you have a
problem so let's press escape : WQ 4
right clip we're going to save that okay
now let's try running it so python 3 to
4 dot pi now we see please enter a
number so let's put it in 5 now as you
see we get the output 5 because we're
checking to see if the input that the
person inputs is 0 not 5 so let's run it
again this time let's put in 0 so we get
the number is 0 and this is cause our if
statement once it sees that num is 0 and
it is equal to the number 0 which we
hired coded in it outputs the number is
0 okay the common comparison operators
that we use for boolean expressions is
the equals to sign so equals equals the
not equals 2 which is exclamation mark
equals greater than which is the greater
than symbol the less than which is the
less than symbol so the left hand side
is less than the right hand side the
greater than or equal to operator which
is either equal to the value or greater
or less than equal to operator which is
less than and then the equal sign so
let's try some of these out let's edit
our script to a naught equals 2 instead
of an equals 2 so let's open back up our
script here
and I've edit and we're going to change
this to an exclamation mark equals so if
num is not equal to zero then we're
going to change our print statement to
the number is not zero
okay so let's save this again so exit
right quit and now let's try running it
again and if we enter in five again we
get the number is not zero and we run it
again and we put in zero we get just
zero out okay so let's try the greater
than operator so let's go back in and
edit e editor again and let's change
this to number is greater than zero and
then we'll change our print statement to
the number is greater than zero we'll
save this again so escape colon right
quit and let's try running it so we put
in five again we get the number is
greater than zero and if we run it again
and we put in a zero you get the note
number zero just output it it doesn't
tell us anything okay so while this is
good we can also use the else Clause to
have another block of code executes if
the first if fails so let's add our add
to our current code and else statement
so what we'll do is if the number is
greater than zero we're going to print
out the numbers greater than zero else
we're going to print out the number is
zero or less okay okay so come back over
to your bunch of you and we're going to
edit our file now we're going to use the
else statement so we're going to go down
a line after our if statement and our
print and we're going to do else and
then we're going to put another colon at
the end of the else to let it let it
know that we're going to indent one so
the indent and this time we're going to
print out print
over bracket the number is zero or less
close quotes closed brackets okay
now let's save this and we'll check it
out working so it's Python 3 - 4 PI and
we get please enter a number so let's
enter in 5 again and we get the number
is greater than 0 now we run it again
and we type in negative 5 we get the
number is 0 or less because it's not
greater than 0 so we go result to the
else and the else will print out the
number is 0 or less ok we can also
combine the else with another if
creating an LF statement
so as you can see here we've got the if
expression we're going to do something
else
if the expression we're going to do
something different else we'll do this
instead ok so let's edit our code and
combine an else with an F creating an
else if statement so let's come over and
we will create a simple else F so we're
going to edit our current else too the
number is 0 so let's remove the or less
at the end now before our else if else
statement because that needs to go at
the end we're going to create an else if
so let's do else L if and then num is
less than 0 then we're going to do our
colon to let it know that it's going to
indent 1 I'm going to indent and then
we're going to print out open bracket
the number is less than 0 close quotes
close brackets okay so now we've got an
else if statement as well as our else
and we're going to print out the number
at the end okay so let's save this so
right quit and let's try running it so
we'll enter in a positive number again
so we'll do six this time the number is
greater than zero then we'll run it
again
this time we'll do zero and we get the
number is zero and we run it one more
time with a negative negative six we get
the number is less than zero so as you
can see if we're trying each one of the
if statements okay so now let's create a
little program to let the user input
their own two numbers and then we'll
compare them so the user will import the
first number and then a second number
then if the first number is greater than
the second number we've got to print out
the that the number is greater than the
second and we're going to print out the
difference and we're going to have an
else--if to check if it's less than and
we'll print print out the difference and
that it was less than else we're going
to print out that the numbers are equal
okay so let's come back over to one to
you and we're going to edit out to four
so let's just remove all of our lines
except for the first line so I'm going
to remove all of our ifs and we're just
gonna be left with our first num we can
have num and we're going to change the
name of our non variable to num1 so
please enter the first number okay now
let's do our number 2 equals int open
bracket input open bracket please enter
the second number colon space quotes and
end without both our brackets okay now
let's write out if statements so we're
going to if num 1 is greater than num 2
:
we're going to indent so if number 1 is
greater than number 2 then we're going
to print over bracket
the number is greater then the second
well let's let's change that to the
first is greater than the second that
might be a bit more readable
the first is greater than the second it
will close off our brackets and we'll do
one more print statement this time we're
going to do print Open bracket open
quotes the difference is space close
quotes plus and then we want to get the
string of our difference so we do STR to
get the string open brackets num1 - num2
closed brackets and then we're going to
close brackets again to close the print
off so this string function will turn a
number into a string so we can print it
out okay so let's end out if there so as
you can see our block of code there has
two print statements in it because
they're both indented so let's do L if
this time so I'll live L if num 1 is
less than num 2 : we're going to indent
and we're going to print out that the
first is less than the second close
quotes closed brackets and now we're
going to do the same as before and print
out the difference so print open bracket
open chords the difference is space
close chords plus the string STR of num1
- num2
closed brackets and then closed brackets
again okay so let's do our else : and
we're going to indent one and we're
going to print open brackets the numbers
are equal then we're close quotes and
then close off our print alright so now
we've got our if our else if and our
else statement let's save this and we'll
run it so we save it and write it and
now we're going to run Python 3 to 4 pi
and we get please enter the first number
so let's do 5 that's that first number
and the second number we'll do five
again so this will be our else the
numbers are equal let's try running it
again this time we'll make num1 greater
then num2 so 7 is greater than 5 and the
difference is 2 okay so let's run it one
more time and this time we'll do if the
first number is less than the second
number so let's do 5 is the first number
and the second number is 7 and we get
the first is less than the second and
the difference is -2 so as you can see
we're going through again through each
of the different ifs
to making sure they all work correctly
all right this concludes our look at
selection in Python don't fear if you
don't remember all of this you can
easily come back and re-watch this video
to consolidate all of the information if
you have any questions and you can't
find the answer after a quick Google
search feel free to leave them in their
comments next we'll be covering
