scanner add on the code will be
available in the description if you're
watching this without watching the
hacking with Python 5 video this won't
make much sense you can go back to the
original video with the annotation on
the screen in this video we'll add a
feature to our port scanner to allow us
to scan for a range of ports let's start
modifying our ports can fail okay so I'm
going to come back here to you bunt it
and we're only going to be editing our
main function so we open up our file to
edit and we scroll down to our mean okay
so we want to be able to take a range of
ports so let's first of all edit the
help for our port passing and we'll put
a comma and we go separate separate
ranges with a dash okay now we come back
down here what we're going to be editing
is al else statement so our host is
still fine because we want to scan all
the pots on a host we're just going to
rather than just having this one
statement here we're going to add an if
so go to your if there's a dash in
string options dot target port
then what we're going to do so I'm going
to go to target ports is equal to
options dot target for it and then we're
going to split it split with the dash
separator and then once we've split it
up we're going to set up the port ranges
so we'll use target ports again reports
going to override the value in here and
we're going to set that to range the
range and we're going to use an integer
of target ports and really use the first
value they put in and for our second
parameter in the range function we're
going to make an int of target ports and
it's going to be the second value that
they put in okay so that's that written
now we'll put an arrow else so if they
don't put a dash in the line and we want
to run it as normal with the comma
separator and that's that's all we're
adding so it's just that easy to modify
our program to do different things so if
i write quit and we try running a scan
on the same host as before what we can
do is we didn't say scan from 60 4500 to
65,000 so we should get a bunch of ports
that aren't open and we should get a
port one port that is so if we run this
and the host and scans okay oh we've got
a error
okay we couldn't start a new thread to
must've run out of thread makes sense as
I'm running this on a vm okay now if we
we can have a look at at the output
inside our console so get a bunch of
clothes ports and at the very start I
think it found our open port which was
that uh 60-64 738 so the reason that
came back first is because it was a
successful connection so the thread that
opened up with that connection the
connection was successful because
overall and whereas all the other ones
had to wait for time out so you'll also
notice that they finished in different
order and that is because our semi for
is locking the output so because this is
only running on a vm processor we
obviously don't have the limits of being
out of skin 70 pots in the threads so we
can make checks for that inside our code
if we want or we can just make sure we
scan smaller amounts so we go 502 I know
800 hopefully what 64 800 hopefully that
won't crash on us and we should get our
successful connection to the port yep
and all the others are closed so as you
said it's a quick way to scan a bunch of
ports and it was very simple to modify a
code to do that this concludes our
add-on hope you enjoyed this little
extra and shown you how easy it is to
modify programs in parkin if you have
any questions and you can't find it
after a quick Google search feel free to
leave it in the comments and thanks for
