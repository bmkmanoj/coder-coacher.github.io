is cross-site scripting in this series
we'll be learning what cross-site
scripting is and how it works we'll also
learn how to craft different kinds of
cross-site scripting attacks and learn
how we can avoid some filters trying to
stop our cross-site script every video
of all slide shows an code available in
the description cross-site scripting
otherwise known as XSS is a code
injection attack allowing the injection
of malicious code into a website XSS is
currently one of the most common website
attacks with almost every website
requiring the user to have JavaScript
turned on as well as large websites and
services that have large amounts of
input fields that could potentially be
vulnerable rather than being an attack
on the website itself XSS uses the
website as a means to attack the users
of that website when you can get your
XSS permanently on a website all those
who visit that page will have the
JavaScript executed by their browser
this can lead to some very serious
damage so what can XSS actually do to
its victims javascript can be crafted
into executing all sorts of malicious
tasks for example stealing users cookies
allowing someone to pretend to be that
user and access the site list if they
are logged in as the target user you
could also modify the page after it
arrives at the user's browser changing
links to malware downloads or editing
the look of the website it can be used
to send you to a completely different
website where you Pat where you may have
your login details fished so what is
happening how does it work first of all
we have to discuss how HTML works
because hTML is a tag based language
when we open a tag such as the B tag for
bold all the text after that tag will
become bold until a matching closing
bold tag is found but what might happen
if we were to open that bold tag in for
instance a search box that doesn't strip
the tag well let's think about this
slide if I place the bold tag in the
start here but didn't close it then the
rest of this slide will be bold
the scary part of XSS comes when we
introduced the script tag which is
invisible to the user and tells the
browser anything between these script
tags is JavaScript keep in mind I'm
keeping this very simplistic to get the
concept introduced easily and steady
we'll get into the basics next tutorial
with some simple examples now quickly on
to what topics we'll be looking at in
this series we have non-persistent
scripts persistence groups malicious
attacks avoiding basic filters avoiding
advanced filters and finally analyzing
Twitter's TweetDeck XSS script that made
a self retweeting tweet to a thousands
of people in mid-2014 just a heads up
have some small prerequisites a fairly
strong understanding of JavaScript is
required if you wish to easily follow
along a fair understanding of HTML is
also required
as well as the rough idea of how web
backend works of course without skills
in JavaScript you weren't possess the
power to construct your own scripts the
next thing we'll be looking at is the
basics of an attack and non-persistent
scripts if you have any questions leave
it in the comments and I'll try to
answer it as best as possible don't
