ago news broke out of leaked nude
celebrity pictures this news was on
almost every news site as well as
televised news stations the leak was
originally on an on IB however it spread
onto 4chan and took off like wildfire
4chan even crashed from the huge influx
of traffic the attack is thought to be
conducted with the Python script called
I brute hybrid makes you sued the
negligee ssin of anti brute-force
security on Apple's Find My Phone login
this oversight allows a user to attempt
as many times as they like to try and
log into an iCloud account once it Logan
is found they can log into the iconic
cloud account like a normal user this
script was even released on github which
is as of making this video has almost
900 favorites and 364 Forks and climbing
there you can find the code as well as a
dictionary file with the top 500 rocky
leaked passwords looking at the code
that the most complex part was making
your requests appear valid this just
sends a login requests to the final
iPhone page with the given Apple ID and
password this try pass function is
simply in a for loop being passed a new
password from the dictionary each time
it goes through each of the passwords
one by one until one is a match or it
runs out of passwords to try thankfully
the night of the news outbreak that
Apple's Find My Phone was to be blamed
Apple patched the issues giving a max
tries and timeout to defy my phone login
I hope you found this interesting a link
will be in the description too I believe
you wish to look at the card or ninja
the password list credit to hack above
for posting the code on github thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
