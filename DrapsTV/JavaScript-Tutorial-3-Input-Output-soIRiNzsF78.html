three input and output in this video
we'll be covering the different output
and input tools we can use to interact
with a user every video have all
slideshows and code available in the
description the good news is we've
already learned how to output
information with an alert however an
alert can be very annoying imagine
visiting a site that constantly pops up
with information there are several other
ways to output information and present
it on screen we're going to focus on one
specific way as I personally believe is
the best way to seamlessly integrate
your JavaScript with your web page or
web app here are two less common ways of
outputting information document dot
write which will write out to the screen
but it will overwrite any other HTML so
it tends to be only useful for testing
purposes we also have console.log that
will write information to the web
console you can see the web console in
most browsers by pressing f12 alright
the best way to display information is
to modify a section of your HTML that
you set up on purpose to hold the
results of your calculations and data we
use document dot get element by ID in
HTML to do this now this might look like
a long scary line of code but let's
dissect it firstly we want this document
ie the web page and we want to get an
element inside it by an ID then we
actually specify the ID name of a tag
inside our page and then we want to get
its inner HTML the inner HTML part is
the section between the two HTML tags we
then can put our result in it by using
it like a variable here I have put the
result of 5 times 5 it's that easy
and will work on any element inside your
web page so long as you give it an ID ok
let's give it a shot let's create a test
page where we put the results of
multiplying two numbers together into
paragraph tags on our page we'll call
our file in HTML all right so let's come
over here and create new text document
and we're going to call it inner dot
HTML
yes we want to change it and we open it
up in our text editor all right so once
again we'll use our template from before
so I'll copy it from our last document
across and I'm gonna remove everything
between the script tags and I'm also
going to add in a new P tag which is
what we're going to store our result in
and inside the P tag we're going to put
an ID equals and let's set it to output
close quotes so now we've created this
paragraph we'll close it off P and now
we can store the information in it so
inside there are script tags that's to
document don't get element by ID now
each each word after they get start to
the capital letter
so get capital e for element capital B
for bi and capital F ID then inside
brackets we want to put what the name of
the tag the ideas of our tag so it was
called output I close off the chords now
we want to get the dot you know HTML and
the HTML part is in all capitals that's
gonna equal let's do 5 times 5 and we
put a semicolon on the end to tell
JavaScript we've finished with that line
let's save this file and let's open it
up all right so to open up we double
click it or drag it in to our web
browser and we get our result and it's
placed straight into the page no pop-up
nothing we just get our result awesome
so now that we know how to output
results on screen let's learn how to get
data into our script to make our scripts
more dynamic there are many potential
ways to get data into our script but
we'll focus on a couple an easy one is
prompt it works just like an alert
creating a pop-up however there will be
a space to enter information so we can
enter something like our name and hit OK
and it will be stored into a
okay let's test out prompt this will be
a simple modification of our last script
but let's call it hello HTML and
practice writing our webpages we'll take
the user's name and say hello to them
all right so let's save this file as and
we'll call it hello don't HTML alright
so we've changed it so now let's get a
prompt from the user so we'll keep our
paragraph how it was and we're just
going to modify this line here so
instead of five times five what we're
gonna do is we're going to do a string
hello so open quotes hello space will
put put a comma in there space close
quotes then we can use the plus sign to
add on to the end of this hello and
we're going to put in prompt and then
inside the prompt brackets we're going
to ask the user to enter their name so
enter your name then we can close off
the quotes they'll put a colon on the
end there close up courts and close off
the brackets and we got our semicolon on
the end so that's how a whole line of
code written there so now we'll prompt
the user for their name and we'll add
the result of their name onto the hello
and then it will store it inside the
inner HTML of our output paragraph all
right so we save this and we come over
and we drag our hello HTML into our web
browser or double-click it and it will
pop up going enter your name so I'll put
in drops we hit OK and we get hello
drops so we've successfully got an input
from the user and printed it back out to
them on screen inside the paragraph
awesome there is an even better way to
get data from the user in a more
friendly standard way we do that with
forms forms are great because there is
already plenty of element types for our
forms such as text boxes dropdowns check
boxes etc we can even change how the
form looks with CSS just like we used in
HTML to get the information between the
tags we can also access the forms value
attribute like a variable - meaning we
can grab the information out of it and
spit it back out somewhere else on the
page let's test it out and create two
text boxes that add two numbers of our
choice together we'll also be using
what's called a function to run code
when a button is pressed because we
haven't covered functions yet I'll keep
it as simple as possible let's call our
file add HTML all right so let's come
back over to our script and we'll save
it as a new and we'll call it add dot
HTML all right now the first thing we're
going to do is we're going to get rid of
this script section this will recreated
up higher I'll move that output down to
the bottom all right so let's create our
form so we're going to take a number one
you're just going to be the first number
we want to add and that's gonna have an
input tag next to it which is going to
be of type equals text and it's ID we're
going to set it to num1 all right we can
close off our input tag and we're going
to put not going to put this inside of a
form because we don't want to actually
submit the form so we're just going to
add the elements I will put a plus in
here because we're going to be adding
the two together and we'll put in our
number two and that's going to be
another input type equals text ID equals
num2 and we'll close that off now we're
gonna have one last form element which
is gonna be a button so a button on
click so when it's clicked on click it's
equal to we can actually put JavaScript
inside these quotes here so our
javascript is going to be my function
and my function is going to be a block
of code that we want to run later all
right so we've created our button
and we can put something inside of it
after we close that button tag which
will do it equals and we'll do our
closing button tag all right
so we've created our output section our
button to make them equal like to the
calculation and they're number one and
our number two let's create our script
now set up a top we'll do our script the
script we want to create a function so
the function my function and then now
that we've named our function we use
curly braces to tell JavaScript what's
inside this function all right so we've
got an open curly brace and a closing
curly brace and we're going to have
three lines of code inside this function
let's create some variables so gonna
have two variables var num1 which is
going to be our first number field so
we're going to be getting texts from a
text field so we need to turn it into an
into a number so do that we use pass int
we pass it into a whole number and
integer into with the capital I and
inside the brackets we're going to get
doc document dot get element by ID and
we're going to get the number one
element and we want to get its dot value
so the value inside of that input field
and we can close off those brackets for
the passing and put a colon on the end
okay now we want to get our second
number so what we'll do is we'll just
copy this whole line put it on the next
one call it num2 and we're going to get
the ID number two okay now we're going
to create our third line which is going
to be our outputs or document dot get
element by ID and we want to get the
output tag which is our paragraph and we
want to get its inner HTML we're going
to make that
cool num1 plus num2 and we're gonna put
a semicolon on the end cool so that
finishes our function our block of code
now we can save this and give it a shot
so we save it and we drag it into our
web browser or double-click it open up
and we get this form so we get number
one so we could put in some like five
number to put something in there like 20
and then an equal sign so we could hit
equals and we get the output down here
in our paragraph so we've got number one
five number 220 equals number 25 we can
change this to some reduce ludicrously
large number here equals and it will do
the calculation happily happily for us
cool this concludes our look at input
and output in JavaScript next we'll be
looking at how we can use the control
flow statements if and switch to make
decisions inside our JavaScript code if
you have any questions leave it in the
comments and I'll try to answer it as
best as possible don't forget to
