three loading saving and using data in
this video we'll be looking at getting
data into and out of octave as well as
using the data every video have all
slideshows and code available in the
description there will also be two data
files in the slides and coded folder
called single and double before we can
load data in we must first navigate to
the directory that our data files are
located octave supports both windows and
unix commands for navigating through the
working directories we have CD for
change directory and we have LS order to
list the files in the current directory
we can also see where we currently are
with the PWD command
so let's jump over active and navigate
to our files okay so over an octave the
current working directory is PWD so
we've got C octave 3.2.40 CC and the bin
folder so that's not where my files
located
in fact they're located in the e either
our e Drive and they're also in a folder
called opt data so I'm going to change
my directory to e backslash opt data so
that's where I've stored my my data
files so now that we've changed
directory when PWD and now we're in e ox
data to the folder on the e Drive called
octave and if i type LS you can see that
we're on the e drive and we're in the
directory ops data and we've got two
files double dot and single data so
these are my two data files and these
are just a bunch of numbers each
separated on a line okay so now we've
navigated to our data we've found my
data so let's start having a look at
loading that data in okay octave has
inbuilt load and save functions that
make it incredibly easy to get all that
important data into octave and ready to
go loading is as simple as using the
function load and then the file name
alternatively you can call the function
brackets and give the file location as a
string saving is just as easy by using
the save function then the file name to
save it as a variable just and then the
variable to save out
okay so let's load our data into octave
remember we need to have a few set in
the de same directory as our data files
so over here in octave so I want to load
my single dot so I type load single dot
dot dot dot and then this will load in
our data so now I've got a variable
called single which has all my data in
it so it uses the file named to name the
variable so if I type single we get a
list of all the data that I just loaded
in so as you can see it's just some
random numbers okay so I can also load
in data into a into a variable of my
choosing so if I use em I'm going to
save my data into a variable called M
and make that equal to load and I'm
going to use the brackets this time and
specify the file so load open quotes
double dot dot close quotes so I'm going
to load the double dot file in this time
and now it automatically printed out
what our M value is now so as you can
see over to I've got a matrix which is 2
by 20 probably 50 different lines
okay so we've loaded our data into this
M variable now so whenever I press M
it'll print out all my data that are
loaded into M now we can also save data
out so let's create a variable called V
and we'll set it to equal a random rand
and we'll do a 5 values in a column and
only one row okay so that is vector V
now so it's got 5 values in it so let's
save it out to our own file so we use
the save from
so save and I want to call the file name
my data and we'll give it the extension
dat and then we want to save out the
variable V and that'll save it out so
now if I open up my Explorer and I go to
e and I go to ops data we see we have my
data data so we've saved out our data
into a list okay cool
octave also supports temporary files
which can be very useful when dealing
with very large quantities of data or
when another program may need to access
the data while octave is still running
the temp files created by octave will be
automatically deleted once octave closes
we call the temp file function octave
saves a file handle that we can use to
save and load from okay so let's jump
over to octave and we'll create a
temporary file so let's call our
temporary file F so that's going to be a
file handle so F equals TMP file so it's
we can see that F equals 3 so F is a
file handle with the value 3 now we can
use F to save to so let's save our our
random vector V to our file handle so
save to F so instead of a file name we
just use F and we want to save v2 into F
and that will save our data now let's
set v2 equal an empty vector so V now
equals 0 now what we're going to do is
we're going to load back in from our
temp file so load F now when we load F
if we type V again we notice we've got
all our values back now octave stores
what the variable name was when it saved
out to a file so that way when you load
the value in it will load back into the
original variable name
so let's jump back to this lecture so
now that our data is loaded in we may
need to move the data around before
working with the data we can join two
matrices or two vectors together
providing they have the appropriate
dimensions for merging let's have a look
at the example shown here moving around
the date the vectors a and B then we'll
merge our data that we lock loaded in so
a equals one semicolon two semicolon
three and B equals four semicolon
five semicolon six and what we do is
we're going to merge them in on top of
each other so concatenate then we can
use our C variable and we'll store a and
B placed next to each other so in a
column matrix so we'll come back over to
octave so it's a bit easier to visualize
and we'll just clear the screen okay so
a equals open square bracket 1 colon 2
colon 3 so we've got our column vector a
and then it's cruel create B which is
equal open square bracket 4 colon 5
colon 6 and we got our two different
vectors so let's just see what it looks
like when we concatenate the two
together so a STEMI : so we're going to
go down to the next row B now when we do
this we get the Macan candidate
concatenate it onto the end of each
other so we've gone down a row from the
end of a and we've placed B on the end
okay so we can also set a variable to be
the result so we'll get set C to equal
open square brackets a space B close
square brackets now as you can see it's
become a matrix and they've been put
next to each other so we've joined with
merge the two together okay
there is two very useful utility
functions for determining the size or
length of a matrix or vector there these
are size and length size will return a
vector with the dimensions of the matrix
or vector whereas length will return a
scalar value of the length of the vector
or the longest dimension of the matrix
so let's have a quick look and see how
it works so we'll use l-c variable that
we just created so if we do size both
see we get back a matrix a 2 by 1 matrix
so we get 3 &amp;amp; 2 so let's the car it's
got 3 rows and 2 columns now we can also
use lengths so if we do length and we do
length of C we'll get back three because
that's the length of the longest side of
the matrix now if we also use lengths on
a vector so a which was out 1 2 3 if you
remember we get book just G we also get
3 as that's and we just we get just 3
which is the length of a ok so clear
screen Optive supports quite a few data
formats for loading in octave can load
and save MATLAB data files as well as
CSV files so comma separated values and
tabulated slash white space separated
data finally a few extras it's important
to note that when you use the save
function and you do not specify a
variable to save octave will save all of
the user created variables in the octave
session to that file if you want to save
out data to a text file you can use the
dash ASCII option there is other save
options like binary and MATLAB versions
which you can find in the octave Docs
lastly if you've set a folder for all of
your data files you can use the add path
function dispatch
fire path for octave to search for files
and functions in this concludes our look
at loading saving and using data in
octave feel free to leave any questions
in the comments and I'll do my best to
answer them next we're going to look at
plotting data in octave thanks for
