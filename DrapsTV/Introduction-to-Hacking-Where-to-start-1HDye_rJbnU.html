to begin this is an introduction to what
hacking is and how to get started
first of all let's get old
misconceptions out of the way you will
not be a hacker in a few days or even
weeks it takes years to learn how to do
lots of different stuff hacking is a
lifestyle we have to learn and explore
while hackers have a bad stigma
associated with them it's purely because
the majority of people are afraid of
things that they do not understand
the media takes a few hackers who have
found themselves in tight spots just
from exploring or stumbling upon things
they shouldn't and pull them into the
bad guy group so disclaimer hacking is a
skill set many jobs in the IT field love
people with this skill set the skills
that can be used for good and it can be
used for bad if you're here because you
just want to learn how to access
someone's Facebook for a laugh I
encourage you to reconsider
not only is accessing someone's
information online a crime it
encompasses multiple crimes so to cover
me I am NOT responsible for how you use
anything you learn also it should be
noted Internet traffic is highly
monitored so be careful where you tread
onto the meaty stuff welcome if you're
asking where do I start
where you've already taken the first
step already remember hacking is to
learn and explore seeking help and
information is a critical part of
learning so I encourage any questions
and I will try my best to answer them
all skills that are incredibly important
to know for a computer hacker are
networking so how practice traverse and
network wireless and wired what
protocols are and how they work routing
proxies is also programming so writing
your own tools and program is a great
way to learn how things work how program
runs in a computer's memory the stack
and the heap there's web technologies
such as PHP JavaScript and cross-site
scripting is also the all-important
command line and there's much much more
but the list goes on forever it's never
too late to start learning if you find
out it's too hard or it's not for you
after a few days or a week or so no harm
done I'm sure you learnt something also
if you want to really grasp the power of
computers use Linux if you have never
used Linux
four and not very confident with the
command-line get Ubuntu it's easy to use
and gives you way more power than a
Windows or Mac machine however if you
are experienced with command-line
analytic systems get Kali Linux comes
with all sorts of pen types testing
software Python has the nickname hackers
language because it's quick to use
efficient and endless amount of thumper
third-party modules and it comes on most
Linux and OS X operating systems I have
a Python beginner tutorial on my channel
so you can learn that here or you can go
to a Python site for all of this I will
be using Ubuntu
I'll also be uploading a hackers hacking
series with Python so subscribe if you
want to learn some cool stuff with me as
well as many other tutorials and content
all tutorials will be completed before
uploading so don't fear of a half
complete tutorial in the description of
this video I have put a list of useful
resources for learning specific to
hacking and programming the first is a
hacking community called hack this site
org that I definitely suggest being a
part of the site contains all levels of
challenges for Explorer exploiting as
well as the thorah of useful information
as well as a great forum do not ask for
help with legal activities nor ask
someone to perform such activities
the second is Python I suggest learning
Python if you haven't already it's free
and the website has a full tutorial
third is C++ a compiled programming
language this language is incredibly
powerful and the website also has a full
tutorial as well the fourth is Ubuntu
use this if you plan to take this
seriously you can also run Linux off a
live CD or a USB if you don't want to
install anything the fifth is Kali Linux
if you are new to Linux or command line
don't download this it will make your
learning slower and the sixth is
security tube there is lots of great
videos there as well as some great
tutorials thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
