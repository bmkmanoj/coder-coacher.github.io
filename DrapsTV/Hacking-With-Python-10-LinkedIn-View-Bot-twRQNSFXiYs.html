LinkedIn viewbot in this video we'll be
looking at automating web interaction
with selenium and beautifulsoup
every video of all slideshows anchored
available in the description I'll be
assuming you already have an
understanding of HTML and have a fair
idea of how JavaScript works also I
assume you have a decent understanding
of Python so what is look.this linkedin
what going to do well we're going to
take advantage of LinkedIn system of
telling people that their profile was
visited so our goal is to visit as many
people as we can that is connected to
the people we know and then visit people
from the jobs area of LinkedIn maybe our
future employer will be someone we visit
after running the bot for about an hour
and a half I came back to about 23
visits a couple of days later on an
obvious fake profile that could
definitely be set up better ok so how
will it work
the first thing we are going to do is
some research on the LinkedIn site we
need to find the login field names find
a pattern in identifying what is the
profile and how to find new profiles so
knowing from previous experience the
link insight uses JavaScript on profiles
so we're going to need to use something
that supports JavaScript because of this
we're going to use selenium this
selenium will create a Firefox tour
webdriver we will then used a library
called beautifulsoup
which you may or may not have heard of
which we'll use to find the links and
other information ok so what is selenium
selenium is a library that interfaces
and controls a web driver for browsers
like Firefox and Chrome selenium runs on
a high level browser so it can handle
processing JavaScript which makes our
job a little slower over a pure HTML
site its primary use is web automation
next quickly what is beautiful soup
beautiful beautiful soup is your go-to
library for handling HTML it sports all
sorts of features for finding selecting
interacting with HTML tags and
information so let's jump into making it
we need to make sure we have selenium
and beautifulsoup installed to make sure
these two libraries are installed we can
use our ez underscore install command
from the Python setup tools an easy
install selenium and beautiful soup
okay so jump rusty bunted and we need to
make sure we have a selenium installed
so sudo easy underscore install and we
want selenium and this will go up and
grab selenium for us which already got
installed and just in case selenium
doesn't automatically install beautiful
soup for you you can use the same
command and type beautiful beautiful
soup and that will go off and get whoops
screwed that up can't spell beautiful
beautiful soup and that will go off and
get beautiful soup for us which I
already got installed okay so now we
need to do some research so let's go to
the LinkedIn site so come over to a web
browser go to linked in com now come to
over the LinkedIn home page and we see
it has our email address and password
fields so we could use this but there's
a lot of other clutter on site on this
page that we could get messed mess
they're messed up with so let's just see
if they have a backup login page which
is usually you'll get to if you import
the we put the wrong details and yep we
get a alternative login so this is the
LinkedIn comm slash uas slash login -
submit so I'm wondering if this last
bits not that's not optional what about
which type it in QAS slash login um and
yes we get this so that - submit on the
end was optional okay so now we need to
find out what these two fields are so we
can access them so let's inspect the
element so you right click on the area
you want to inspect and right click
inspect and we can see here the input
for this email address is session
underscore key - login and you can also
see down here in our console we've got
the session underscore key - login as
the
I D so let's also find out what let's
write this down so I'll write down that
it's the session underscore key - login
and let's inspect the password field as
well so this is the session underscore
password - login so as we can also see
down here the IDS session on is called
password - login now we don't have to
worry about this sign-in button because
our web driver already knows how to
submit forms okay so let's close this
off and let's try logging in so I've got
a phase account which is the web web mu
11 and I'll just type in the password
and login
typed it and wrong and there we go
locked us in now as you can see it takes
us to like our harm profile here so it
has like a few few things on here but
there's not much on here so the first
thing we need to do is go to a profile
like if we can find any profiles on here
so we've got our profile for the profile
here and we go to our profile you need
to find out what what identifies
people's users on this on this website
so let's see what these links of people
that have viewed my profile have in
common
so we inspect the element of this link
you see the H ref has LinkedIn profile
slash of view ID so it has the IDS
inside this sum link here so let's check
another one to see if the IDs are
consistent yep says profile / view and
then the ID of the profile so let's
check some other links on the page so
just make sure that they don't have the
ID field as well nope this one this one
doesn't
this has slash profile and stuff on it
let's check this link so profile doesn't
have ID or anything like that so we can
identify people's profiles by having the
forward slash profile ID equals and then
our profile ID so ok so we know how to
find profile links now so what if we run
out of profiles defined so we need more
profiles so we can from previous
experience I know that this jobs page
has jobs on it
which I think we can identify these jobs
by slash jobs or something yep we've got
slash jobs here which is view jobs check
a few links on this page see they don't
all have slash jobs this has less job
but it doesn't have slash jobs now if we
go to one of these job pages we can see
usually that yep they have a contact the
job poster which if we check this link
it should be a profile link so LinkedIn
such profile such review ID yep
so this is another profile link so if we
were to follow this link it will take us
to another profile and we can also get
more people's profiles by this one so
we've got three people up here which all
have links ownership so all that is good
don't have a link it's an image but
we've got all people also viewed so it's
like seven different people here so if
we inspect these it should have a
profile search view ID so we know that
if we run out of people to view we can
go to the job section and we can find
people via the job section okay so we've
got a brief idea of how how things work
on the site so let's let's jump into
site coding so come back over to
terminally ill I was close down this web
browser okay so come across this
terminal over here and let's start
writing some code so well BIM and we'll
call it linked in bot pi
ok so inside here we're going to need
imports and stuff first so we need to
import we're going to use AG pass so we
can take in the use the email and the
password and we used OS for clearing the
screen and we use time to add some
random
minion making sure that all the
JavaScript is loaded so import we're
going to also import the URL pass module
which will allow us to grab the IDS out
of a URL and we're also going to import
random okay so now we need to grab our
import a selenium
so from selenium with selenium we are
going to import add the web driver okay
so also from selenium so from selenium
but it's selenium web driver dot common
keys we're going to import the keys
module so this will allow us to enter
data onto the screen okay now one last
thing we need import is the beautiful
soup module so from PS for a beautiful
soup for we're going to import beautiful
soup okay okay so now that we've got all
of our imports done let's start writing
a few utility functions so we're going
to define our get people links function
so I get people links function is going
to take a beautiful soup page source so
page which will pass in letter and what
we're going to do is we're going to get
a list called links so that's going to
be an empty list and we're going to fill
that list of links with all of the
profile links on a certain page so for
link in page find underscore all so
we're going to find all and the a tag so
the link tag so for all links on the
page we're going to make a variable
called URL make it equal to the link dot
get
and we're going to get the H ref part of
the a tag which is the actual link
address so if we do actually get a URL
out of this get so if we do get a URL
where you're going to if and then this
string profile because remember they all
had in common profile slash view
question mark ID equals and then we'll
close up our quotes in the URL so if
this is inside the URL then we know it's
a profile so we're going to add it to
our links list so links dot append and
the URL we're going append in that now
outside of our four we're going to
return back a list of links okay so this
get people links paid function done so
let's let's do a similar thing but this
time for the jobs so get job links so
our job links is going to take the
beautiful soup page again and it's going
to be very similar without links equals
an empty list and then for the link in
page find underscore all we're going to
grab the a tags again we're going to
create our URL equals the link get the H
ref part of the link and if you are L so
if we did manage to get URL URL edit
that we're going to check if there is a
forward slash jobs close quote
in the URL so this all of our job links
had the forward slash jobs
okay so if we do find a jobs link we're
going to append it into our links list
started links dot append and it's going
to take the URL
okay so now that we've got our links we
can return it to outsider for return
turn links and this is a get job links
function written so now because we've
got our people links but we grab the
whole link we need to be able to grab
the ID so that we can check it against
other other IDs to make sure we we
haven't already been there before so
let's create a deaf get ID function and
this will take a URL so I get ID
function is going to use the P the URL
path module so we're going to create a
variable called P URL so this is going
to be our passed URL equals URL paths
dot URL pass object I'm going to give it
the URL that we pass into the function
now with our passed URL we're going to
return we turn we're going to return the
URL pass dot pass underscore Q s and
we're going to pass in our P URL query
so this is our query of the URL that we
object that we created and we're going
to grab the ID portion of the URL and we
want the first first ID that it finds in
the URL okay that's going to return back
the actual you are you are the actual ID
from the URL so that random number of
you know eight digits okay now let's
create our main function first before we
create our viewbot logic so once we
create our main it'll give us a better
idea of what's going on so let's def
main and our main is going to our main
is going to have our parser so our
parser it goes
aaaggghhh pass dot argument parser now
we're going to add our arguments for an
email and a password so parser dot add
underscore argument this will take our
email and then we'll give it a help of
your linked in email okay and we need to
add our password field so parser dot add
underscore argument and this will take
the password and help equal linked in
password okay so now we're going to grab
our args
so x equals parser dot pass and the
squat args and now we're going to create
our browser so let's create our browser
object so browser equals the webdriver
so webdriver
dot Firefox so we're going to create a
Firefox webdriver okay so now that we've
created our browser we can get a web
page so let's get the LinkedIn login
page so browser dot yet and we're going
to get HTTP colon forward slash forward
slash linked in comm forward slash and
it was the UAS forward slash login page
okay so now that we've got the page
it'll load and then it will continue
executing our code so we want to be able
to grab the email field so we can put
out our email in and we need to grab the
password field so we can put our
password in and then we need to submit
the form so let's create an email
element
the email element equals the browser dot
find underscore element underscore by
underscore ID so we're going to find an
element on on the webpage by its ID and
if you remember we wrote down the login
field ID which was session underscore
key - login and we can close that off
and that will get the email element so
now that we've got the email element
we're going to put our email into it so
email element dot send underscore keys
so this is going to type into that field
the string that we give it so we're
going to give it the args dot email okay
so that's going to type our email that
we give to the program into the email
field now we need to grab our pass
element to a password element so pass
element OOP OOP got that right element
equals browser dot find underscore
element underscore buy and store ID and
we're going to grab the session
underscore password - login ok so now we
password element we're going to send
keys again with that password so pass
element dot send underscore keys and
we're going to give it the args dot
password ok now we need to submit the
form so we can either use email element
or pass element that both belong to the
same form so let's just use pass element
dot submit so that will hit the login
button ok so now that that's all done
what we're going to do is we're going to
OS dot system and we're going to clear
if you're running this on Windows
which you probably won't be just type
CLS rather than clear okay now we're
going to print out open square brackets
with some positive information and we're
going to success logged in bot starting
okay so let's let us know that we've
successfully successfully logged in and
then the body's starting okay so now
we're going to run our viewbot function
so view bot and this will take our
browser that we created
now we'll write our view bot function in
just a second so once our view bot is
done we're going to browser dot clothes
okay we'll write out if means we don't
forget about it later so if I'm just
going to score name I'm just going to
score equal to open chords underscore
underscore main underscore underscore
closed quotes we're going to run main
okay so that's our main written so
that's going to log us into LinkedIn and
start getting us ready to run our bot so
once we're logged in to LinkedIn we're
going to run our bot logic so def view
bot and this will take the browser as we
passed in okay so inside out the inside
of our view bot we're going to need a
few a few variables to work with so
we're going to have a visited dictionary
so visited it's going to equal an empty
dictionary now we're going to use
visited to store the IDS of the people
that we've already visited or that we
already plan to visit that way whenever
we find a new person we check if they've
already been planned to be visited so
that way we don't visit the same person
over again and the reason we're using a
dictionary is because the dictionary
hashes the identifiers so it's a lot
quicker to find if something is already
in there than it is to look through
whole list to see if it already exists
in a list okay so let's create another
list but this this time it isn't is
actually a list and it will be an empty
list called P list and this will store
all of the people that we plan to visit
and we'll create a count variable to
know how many people we've already
visited okay so we're going to do while
true so we're going to repeat forever
we'll just put in a quick comment here
so we're going to sleep to make sure
everything loads and we're also going to
add random to make us look human so we
don't want to be caught being too
suspicious so if we're constantly
changing page every three seconds then
somebody might get a bit skeptical of us
the web - on time it only takes us three
seconds to look at a page but if we add
a bit of a random to it it may look that
it look like we're just browsing really
fast so time dot sleep and we're going
to sleep a random dot uniform and it's
going to be a uniform and we'll do three
point five seconds - six point nine okay
so you can make this shorter if you like
but I just want to make sure that
everything loads this is running on a VM
ok so now we want to grab the beautiful
soup of the page source so we're going
to create a variable called page then
it's going to equal be EA UT full soup
and it's going to be a beautiful soup of
the browser dot page underscore source
and this will grab the source of the
current webpage that we're viewing so
hopefully by the time that we grab the
page source all of the JavaScript is
finished running and we have up-to-date
source ok now we want to grab the people
links that we find on the page so let's
create a variable called people this is
going to be a list that's going to equal
the get people links that we created
earlier and we're going to pass it the
page so this will now get people links
function and it will turn all of the
people links that are found in the page
so if people so if it did find people
then we're going to start visiting them
so for person for person in people their
ID so their ID is going to equal get ID
of the person so we're going to get the
ID of that person
so if ID not in visited so if it's not
inside of our dictionary then we're
going to add it to our list of people to
visit and make sure that it's added to
our visitor dictionary so P list so
people to visit append person and we're
going to set visited open square
brackets the ID of the person equals 1
okay so outside of our people if so if
if P list so if there's people to visit
so a little comment here if there is
people to look at then look at that okay
so if there's people to look at we're
going to get person equals P list so a
list of people to visit dot pop and
we're going to pop off the top the top
person on our P list and put it into our
person so that way we're slowly taking
the people off the list so
the browser dot get am I going to get
the person so we're going to go to their
their their their profile page and then
we're going to increment our count so
count plus equals one
okay so else so if there isn't any
people to visit so otherwise find people
via the job the job pages okay so if if
there isn't any people to visit we're
going to find some people so jobs equals
get job links and this we're gonna get
that from our current page so we're
going to find job links if we do get
some jobs back which we should because
there should always be that little job
button on our profile on that top bar
then we're going to get a job equals
random dot choice
Boop andum dot choice out of the jobs
list so we're going to get a random job
if there's more than one and we're going
to create a few utility variables here
so root equals Omega notice to the HTTP
colon forces for such wisn.com and we
need a root s as well so root S equals
HTTP colon false s /ww linked in comm
and these are going to be used to make
sure that our job links carry the
LinkedIn address properly because
sometimes they can just be routes
just slash routes so we're going to make
sure that they're inside of our URL so
if root not in job or routes
not in job we're going to add it in so
job equals HTTP colon forward slash WWE
linked in comm close quotes plus job
okay
and now after we've gotten our job link
to go to we're going to browser dot get
captain bracket job so we're going to
get the job web page and then we're
going to do else so if if we don't get
any job links on the page which
shouldn't happen we're going to print
open chords I'm lost
exiting and then we're going to break
okay so now back on our our if lines
we're just going to do a simple output
so hash up output make an option for
this we're going to print open quotes
square plus some good information close
quotes + e browser dot title so the
browser title is the little title that
appears on the top bar of your browser
so this will let us know the kind of
pages that we're visiting so the browser
title open quotes visited so we visited
this page and then we'll do a backslash
N and open up some circle brackets those
quotes backslash go down to the next
line so we've got some plenty of room
plus the string of count so the amount
of people we visited plus open quotes
will do a slash close quotes plus the
string of length of P list so the amount
of people we still have to go there in
queue
plus open quotes closed circle brackets
visited visited /q and then we'll close
up our quotes okay so this we're going
to print this out the screen so we know
how many people were visited how many
people are still left to visit it just
so we can get an idea and if all has
gone well we should have finished
writing our bot so let's save this and
let's try running it so pipe in linked
in bot dot pi and we're going to take
the email so i use webmail 11 at
gmail.com which was the fake account i
created and the past one was four linked
in now we run this up the argument
passed the problem they're actually add
oh I've mocked up spelling so come back
down to my add argument okay so are you
in my em around IQ mint okay
so I'll save this and we'll try running
it again it'll take a little bit as it
boots up the browser as you can see we
get our browser open here so you can
move around
it'll keep interacting with it and it
comes to our login page and enters in
our email and password and hit sign in
as you can see successfully logged in
fought starting it's taken us to our
profile it's going to view our profile
because that's our first profile link so
now we won't ever try and visit our
profile again and now it will go to the
jobs page because I don't have any
connections or not I do have people who
viewed my profile so to go to their
profile first and as you can see it goes
to their profile it'll grab people on
their profile and I'll start visiting
people in our queue so we've got 22
people already in our queue to visit and
we visited three different people and it
will just keep going through people over
and over again so yep visited four
people we've got 35 people 35 unique
people in our queue and this will just
keep on going and keep visiting
different profiles so success we've
successfully completed our viewbot this
concludes our link LinkedIn bot let me
know in the comments if you think this
is a cool project and if you would like
to find if you if you find it fun I
could put this up on github and we could
make the bot better as a community
I have plans written down to add a
message bot functionality and an apply
for jobs bot 2 if you have any questions
leave it in the comments and I'll try my
best answer is clearly as possible
next topic we'll be looking at is web
scraping with scrappy thanks for
