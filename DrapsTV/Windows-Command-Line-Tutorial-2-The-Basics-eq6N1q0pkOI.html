two the basics in this video we're going
over the very basics of the command line
moving around and how to use commands
every video of all slideshows anchor it
available in the description a critical
concept we need to understand is how to
find files or folders now if you've
never used the command line before then
you're probably used to searching for
your files or a folder using the Windows
graphical explorer that looks something
like this you can find the location in
the top bar and you can see all of your
files and folders inside the window and
you can also double click on a folder to
move into that folder as you can
probably guess there is no nice graphics
in the command line currently we are in
the drafts folder which is inside the
users folder on the C hard drive the
important thing to remember is the
locations they always follow the same
structure you may find it easier to read
the location backwards with each folder
separated by a backslash for example
here we have a sub folder which is
inside our folder the a folder belongs
to the C colon hard drive this is where
our files are saved inside these folders
the letter then colon indicates a hard
drive letter by default C colon is your
first hard drive new hard drives CD or
DVD drives and externals will go down
the alphabet d e f etc so why is this
important it's important to understand
your computer's file structure when we
use the command line we regularly need
to move around our file system to create
files move files edit files run programs
etc because the command line is old text
our file structure would be a text
representation of our usual File
Explorer alright let's learn our first
command the der command this command
lists all of the files and folders in
the current directory directory is
another word for folder so let's open up
a command prompt and type in our command
so we'll come over to start type in CMD
and up and open up our command line now
let's try typing in der so it can be
okay so uppercase doesn't matter and we
press ENTER and as you can see we get a
list out of all of the things in this
current folder so currently we have
these the time that the directories were
made or last modified and the time the
exact time then it has next to it dirt
in brackets if it's actually a directory
and if it's a file it doesn't have a
door next to it so we can see it's
mostly directories in here so we have
like documents downloads Dropbox
favorites etc cool so that's how we can
list what's inside this current folder
and as you can see we're currently
inside the drafts folder which is inside
the users folder on the C hard drive ok
now that we know how to see what's
inside the folder we're in we need to
learn how to move in and out of folders
to move around we use the CD command
however we have to tell the CD command
where we want to go to tell the command
where we want to go we type CD space and
then the place we want to go we can
specify a folder in our current location
for example CD space documents or we can
tell the command to take us to a
specific location for example CD C colon
backslash users backslash we can also
tell the command to take us back a
folder with a double dot for example CD
dot dot all right let's give moving
around a shot so we'll come back to our
command line and we want to say let's
let's say we want to move into our
Documents folder so we type CD space
documents and we press enter and as you
can see it's now changed us from the
drops users see folder to the documents
which is inside the drops folder which
is inside the users folder in the C hard
drive and now we type dough we can see
what's in this folder so there's a lot
more in this folder and we can see we've
got quite a lot of directories and we
got some files from documents and you
can see there's a lot more in this
folder now
maybe we want to go back a folder so we
type CD space dot and when we press
ENTER it'll take us back so now we're
back in our drops folder so duh and we
get the same folder it was porn before
let's say we want to go back again so CD
dot dot now we're in the users folder
and you can see it's represented on the
left now if we go here we can see we get
a printout of currently in the C and has
the traps and the public folders in here
and we can go back again if we wish now
we're in the C hard drive and we can cut
der and you can see all the base folders
in the C hard drive alright cool so
let's try changing directory and we want
to change back to the C colon backslash
users backslash traps folder back where
we started we press ENTER and it will
take us back there cool
so that's how we change directories so
far we have learnt our first two
commands currently there is about a
hundred commands still in use in the
Windows command prompt though you don't
have to be worried you'll probably only
ever use around 20 to 40 of these
commands most of the time you'll be
using the same 5 or 6 commands I find
the best strategy for learning them is
to just use them so now that we have
used command
let's analyze how commands are
structured every command is structured
in the similar way this follows the
pattern command space slash options
space any arguments the command is like
CD order then we can take in options
which we haven't touched on yet and
finally the arguments the arguments are
information we need to give to the
command so we have an example option
here for the CD command this question
mark option which means help more on
that in the next slide and for example
of arguments we have the CD command
which requires an argument to tell it
where to move to currently
we only know two very simple commands
don't have many easy-to-understand
options alright now for one of the most
important skills getting help getting
help for a command in CMD is very easy
we simply use the help option after any
command we need help with the option is
forward slash question mark if we wanted
to get help for the der command we would
type der space forward slash question
mark let's try getting the help for the
der command we'll also learn a new
command the CLS command which will clear
the command line of all previous
commands okay
so we'll come over to the command line
and we'll type in CLS this is going to
clear the screen and as you can see it's
clear the screen okay now let's get the
help for the der command so we're gonna
type du space forward slash question
mark we hit enter it'll come up with all
of the help for the der command so we've
got how to use it so der then the Drive
or path of our name and then any
attributes and the options and we can
get a detailed list of all of the
options right here and we can press
ENTER to continue all the way down to
the bottom okay so here we've got all of
our different options but they're all
pretty complex okay so say we maybe want
the help for the CD command CD space
forward slash question mark press ENTER
and we get to help cool so we'll type to
CLS to clear the screen and we'll come
back to the slide show the next thing
we'll be looking at is performing some
general tasks on the command line as
well as some new tricks
if you have any questions leave it in
the comments and I'll try to answer as
best as possible don't forget to
