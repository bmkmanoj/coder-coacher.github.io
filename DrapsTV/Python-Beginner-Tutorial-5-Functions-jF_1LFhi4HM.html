every video will have all slideshows and
card available in description now
functions our way is splitting up our
program by grouping code to complete a
task
this also means you have to design our
program differently this is more of the
standard kind of style that people go
for for readability and also debugging
by grouping code that may need to be run
more than once we save ourself time
rather than typing it out every time
this also makes for smaller code to work
with functions are quick and easy to
write in Python we define a function
with a name and then associate code with
that name creating a function then we
can call that function from anywhere in
our running code now let's have a look
at a basic function that prints out
hello for x we'll create a new python
file called - 5 dot P Y and it'll have a
function called hello that will print to
the screen hello five times yes let's go
over to linux and then two to five key Y
okay now what to define a function use
the DEF keyword de f and we do a space
and then the name of our function so
let's call it hello and then we put
parentheses after it then just like an
if statement we use a colon to note that
this function is going to continue on
the next line and we indent one indent
indicates that there's going to be a
block of code here at this indentation
so let's type print hello hello four
times so print
hello I would do print print hello
you can copy-paste this if you like okay
so now that we're done with their
function do you want to go to the very
left hand side again and let's start
writing our code for our program so
let's do a print started so you can see
in the console where the program started
and then let's call our function hello
so to call the function we just type the
function name and then we put the
brackets afterwards and then that's
called so it will call that call that
function named the same thing
okay so let's save and quit and now
let's run it so python tute v dot py and
as you see it it says started and then
prints four hellos because it ran our
function hello so as you can see we
called our hello function after our
print started and it ran in the code
that we defined earlier with the death
function at that place in the program
okay so as I was saying calling a
function you call the set of
instructions to be used so hello
function was executed after this started
command was output to the screen and the
DEF keyword tells the interpreter to
save these instructions for later okay
now returning returning allows us to
send a value back to where it was called
so let's make a function to get an
integer from the user and allow us to
use it in our program
so let's edit our current a current file
so let's edit this and we'll change our
function name to get integer so get and
capitalize the I in Ted jar and inside
and we won't have anything we'll just
have our bracket C and nothing inside
them and then inside our function so in
the indentation or remove our prints and
we'll create a variable called result so
result equals int open brackets raw
underscore input open brackets and then
we'll put a prompt please enter an
integer and we'll close that off and
then what we do is we use the return
keyword return so I want to give back
something from to the place where we
told this ROM and we're going to return
results so whatever got put into the
variable result and now after our print
started what we're gonna do is we're
gonna create a variable called output
it's time and then we're gonna make
output equal the result from get into
death so we use we call the function get
get integer and what this will do is it
will call that function get it get
integer and then you know our function
get integer it will ask us for an
integer and then we'll return that
integer back from where we called the
function and place it in the output and
then let's print output so we can see
what the user entered output and now
let's save that
and let's run it so as you see it says
started so it started about our program
and then it says please enter an integer
so let's enter attend our five and you
see it outputs five this is because in
our program it returns the value that we
input into result and the result is
returned into our output variable that
where we called get integer so that was
a lot to take in
okay so let's continue so let's let's
talk about creating main so creating
main if you've studied any other
programming languages you'll notice that
most of them have a main function a
place where the program starts even
though our program will still run it's
good practice design our Python programs
and create a main function
however in Python we have to tell Python
that we're using a main function so
let's edit our last program to have a
main function so let's add our main
function and then check the run okay so
to create a main function just like
before we need to define a new function
so it's def main open brackets and our
colon and then indented one and we're
going to move all of our code that we
had before into our main function
so we'll tab it in once and then after
our main so we go back to the very left
of the screen what we're going to do is
we're going to tell python that we want
to use main so we use the if statement
if underscore underscore name underscore
underscore is equal to
open quotes underscore underscore main
underscore underscore colon then we were
to run main so main open close brackets
so what this will do is we'll ask Python
I'll be current do we currently want to
run main and it will check against name
if it's in the main part of the function
and then if it is it will call them our
main function and run the code there so
as you can see in the flow of the
program main is going to be cold and
then it's going to run this code in main
and then integer get integer is going to
be cold
halfway through executing that come up
to the top here and it'll get an integer
from the years up then it will return
the integer that the user input input it
and place it into output and then we'll
print output and then our program will
finish executing so let's save this
let's have a look at it running okay so
it says started and please enter enter
an integer so as you can see the
program's noticed that we've that were
using main so it jumps to our main
function
and starts executing from that so let's
enter 5 again and our program works just
as it did before now the reason we use
main is because it's much easier to read
if you're reading other people's code
and if other people are reading your
code so the name variable that we used
underscore underscore name underscore
underscore is a special variable that
the interpreter creates when executing a
Python file it's beneficial to to do
this for writing module code but more on
that later
basically how if checks if the current
program was executed then use our main
function
there's one more thing we can do with
functions which is parameters now just
like we're able to pass values out of a
function we're able to pass them in as
well these parameters go inside the
brackets of our function
so let's also occurred to make a
variable for the prompt we want to
output to the screen for the user so
let's edit our code we want to open up
our file again and you now get into jar
inside the brackets this time what we
want to do is we want to type prompt so
this is going to create a variable
called prompt and it's going to allow us
to pass a very value into that variable
and then let's replace the string inside
raw input with prompt so the variable
that we just created inside the
parameters you know because there's a
parameter we now have to put something
into our brackets when we call the
function so output equals get integer we
have to instruct the prompt that we want
to output to the user so let's create a
string inside the brackets and we'll do
please enter a number and now we've
we've put through a string into the
prompt value of our get integer which is
then going to be used in the raw input
function so now let's try running our
program so we need to save we need to
save and then let's run it so this time
it says please enter a number rather
than please enter an integer as it did
previously this is because we're passing
in the the prompts that we want to
output to the user so let's let's edit
we can edit this prompt if we like so to
edit it we just come down and we change
the value inside this get integer
brackets so we could copy this whole
line if we wanted to so let's let's make
another app we'll use output again
output
equals get integer open bracket quote
please enter another number so what this
will do is it will override our output
value with the next number the user
enters but there'll be another out
there'll be another prompt when we are
on the console command line okay so
let's write quit again
save and then it'll ask us to enter
numbers at 25 and it'll ask for another
number within 6 in the left foot 6
because we over override it the output
variable so the program doesn't change
for the user sees however I get into the
function is now easy to use and we can
use it anywhere and change what the
prompt is we can add as many parameters
as we like just by set it separating
them with a comma so as we did we just
change that get into the user prompt and
as you can see we could we can use that
prompt variable to enter whatever we
want to be output to the screen so this
concludes our look at functions in
Python don't fear if you don't remember
all of this you can easily come back and
re-watch the video to consolidate all
the information if you have any
questions and can't find the answer
after a quick Google search feel free to
leave it in the comments next we'll be
covering in iteration thanks for
