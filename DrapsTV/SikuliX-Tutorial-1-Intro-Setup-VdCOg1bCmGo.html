introduction and setup in this series
we'll be learning how to competently use
the automation software scroll the X
every video have all slideshows anchored
available in the description there are
no prerequisites for this tutorial
however I highly recommend that you have
some beginner level experience in a
programming language Python will be
quite useful as the coulee script uses
Python
what is the coulee x so cool the X is
automation software that uses image
recognition to identify and control GUI
elements it allows automating any tasks
that you can visibly see and do yourself
so cool e^x uses the Python programming
language for it's a cool e^x script but
more specifically it uses Jathan so cool
e^x is built with Java and can be run on
Windows Mac and Linux the project is
open source and was originally started
at the user interface design group at
MIT the topics we'll be looking at in
this series are the basics of the IDE
and the basic concepts conditional
automation conditional looping and
finishing off with a practical example
now for the setup first thing we want to
do is go to the Sakura x-com website and
navigate to the Downloads area doesn't
matter what operating system you're on
we download the same jar file once we
have Sakura X downloaded we can install
it however this requires having Java
runtimes installed so if you don't have
Java installed you need to pause here
and go and install it all right so let's
come over to the website so it's Akula
XCOM and over here on the right there's
a get it section and we want to go to
get version 1.1 point 0 at the time of
this video so this will take us to the
Downloads area and we want to come down
to the jar file that we want to download
which is the Schooley X setup - and the
version number jar so you can click on
that and it will start downloading
choose a place to save it and the place
that you place your install file is the
place that we're going to install - and
store all of our scripts so think about
it before you save it somewhere now
we've got it in our folder ready to go
we can install it if you've placed just
a coolie in a folder that requires admin
privileges we will want to run it as
administrator or with sudo
okay we double-click it to start the
install and it will start setting up a
GUI it will pop up and from here we can
follow the prompts it will ask us which
pack we want unless you know what you
want to use school ex4 I recommend just
getting pack one so we click on pack one
hit set up now the Installer will then
download the required files and set up
the environment so you're good to go
all right school e^x is installed and
you're good to go the next thing we'll
be looking at is the basics of school
e^x if you have any questions leave it
in the comments and I'll try to answer
it as best as possible don't forget to
