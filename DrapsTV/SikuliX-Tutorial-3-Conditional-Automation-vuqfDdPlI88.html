three conditional automation in this
video we'll look at some of the fancy
input and output tools so coolie X gives
us and also we'll look at selection in
Python that allows us to add conditions
to ask the coulee scripts everybody have
all slideshows anchored available in the
description interacting with the user
can be quite important and is a great
way for us to hone our conditional
automation skills new in school e^x over
its previous versions is some nice GUI
pop-ups that can give information to the
user or receive information from them so
cool the ax handles this really well and
it is as simple as it gets to use
alright let's look at the six functions
available to us the first three are
output boxes we have pop up which does
exactly as it sounds creates a dialog
with text that we give it and an
optional title as well as an OK button
that will close it we have pop error
which is like a pop-up however it shows
an arrow symbol alongside the text we
then have pop ask which is the pop-up
once again how it rises the user with a
yes or no decision we can then use that
to determine what we do from there the
second half our input pop-ups which
allow us to receive input from the user
of the script the input function will
give a simple input box with an OK and
cancel buttons we can also optionally
give this window a prompt such as what
is your favorite number we can also
optionally give it a default answer an
optional title for the window and we can
optionally set hidden to true turning it
into a password field hiding the input
characters we then have input text which
works similar to input however is a much
bigger box and can be customized to be
even bigger in size finally we have
select which is my personal favorite it
provides a pop-up with a drop-down and
the user can select from a list of
options we provide such as whether they
wish to add subtract multiply or divide
all right let's give these UI boxes a
try and get comfortable so we can use
them later in our decision-making so we
come over to see coolly and let's try
try it out so it'll create a a variable
called name so this is going to be name
and we're going to make that equal input
open parenthesis in quotes we're going
to put up our text that we want to put
in the input so enter your name and we
can close off the quotes and close the
parentheses and then let's use the pop
up the pop up a function open up
parentheses and we're going to open
quotes hello and then we're going to add
on the name to the end the name then we
can put a comma and we can title the box
hello so this gives an optional title
which will make the pop up called hello
and it will say hello to the name that
was entered previously all right let's
try out our input text field so we'll do
some text is our variable so this is
where we're gonna store all our text
it's in an equal input input text with a
capital T open parentheses enter some
text close quote close parenthesis right
and then let's pop up an error and will
pop out the some text so the pop error
put the capital e and inside pop arrow
we'll do our exclamation mark close
quotes and we'll put the some text added
on to the end all right so that should
give us a good look at what pop error
does right now let's try out the select
input type so first we need to create a
tuple of options so my options can be
our variable name that we're going to
store all in my options with a capital R
equals open up parentheses and in quotes
we'll do one that's the first option
close quotes comma and then we'll do two
in quotes comma three in quotes comma
four in chords comma and
five and we'll close up our parentheses
and we have our couple of options
all right let's now store the result of
what the user picks so result this is
going to be what the user picks with the
Select drop-down equals select and
inside the Select we're going to tell
them in quotes
pick a number close quotes comma and
then we're going to set the options for
our select to equal my options and then
we'll close off our parentheses cool all
right now we can use the pop ask output
and what this does is it gives them a
yes on our answer and we can store that
yes on our answer inside of a variable
so let's call that variable choice
that's going to equal pop ask and inside
here we can say did you select and then
we can add on the number that they
selected which was result plus and put a
question mark on the end having closed
off that so this will ask them did you
select the result they pick previously
so it should be yes but just illustrate
how it works and give it a shot all
right let's give this a save and we'll
call it input test all right save that
and let's give it a give it a run so
when we press run it'll pop up saying
enter your name so it grabs okay and
then we get our pop-up which says hello
drops and the title of it is hello as we
setup cool and then we've got our text
box so this is our some text so let's
enter some text so hello how are you
today
and then we can hit enter so we've also
got our little title here that says
enter some text I'll hit OK and we get
us a cool the error so this is our pop
error type and it says our hello how are
you today so it doesn't make much sense
here but we get to see how it works okay
and then we get our select statement so
we've got a list of options one and two
three four or five so we can pick a
number so let's get four let me get okay
and then we've got our pop ask and a pop
ask says did you select four and we can
say yes on our and then we can say yes
and our program finishes so if we wanted
to we could do it another pop-up that
says whether they selected yes or no for
their pop ask but we'll just move on
from here cool all right now on to
selection I'm going to try and move over
this pretty lightly as I did recommend
some basic Python or programming
experience okay so that makes decisions
we use the if statement it allows us to
Jack if an expression is true or false
if it's true we do something otherwise
if it's false we've done it's important
to notice that Python uses indents to
decide when code is inside of an if
statement this could be a single space
however I suggest a one tab of width for
as it makes it easier to read also note
the colon on the end of the if line this
tells python to expect an indent on the
next line now these expressions we check
result in either true or false for this
we have comparison operators we can
check if something is equal or something
is not equal we can check if things are
greater than or less than etc I placed a
couple of examples at the bottom here
five is less than four is false 10 is
greater than or equal to ten is true
five is equal to one is false and you
can solely place true or false as an
expression and it will work alright now
we know how to use the if statement
let's look at two other statements that
go hand in hand with if the else
statement is added on to the end of the
F so if the expression is true do
something else if it's false
do this instead it's fairly simple
finally the LF statement this statement
allows us to check another expression if
the first one was false
so if true do something else if this is
true do something different else do this
instead we can combine as many airlifts
in one if statement as we like okay now
finally back to some scripting let's
create our calculator automation again
this time however will ask the user at
the beginning if they wish to add
subtract multiply or divide also to mix
it up let's use the number five instead
of one alright so we come back to
securely here and we'll create our new
document or close our old one all right
so we want to ask them if they want to
add subtract multiply or divide
so let's specify our modes first so
we'll create a variable called modes and
that's going to equal a couple of
options so our first one can be add
closed quotes comma then we can do sub
closed quotes comma open quotes mul
multiply comma and we'll do div for
divide quits and close up our couple
alright so go down modes so let's now
ask the user for what they want want to
want to do so we'll call our result
option and option can equal select we're
going to use the Select window what
would you like to do question mark close
quotes and then we'll pass in our
options is going to equal modes close
off our parentheses so now we've got
from the user what what kind of action
they want to do with the arithmetic now
we can continue doing what we did last
tutorial so we want to click the start
button so let's use the click screen
shot it'll ask us where we want to copy
let's do the start button
so we want to click the start button
then we want to wait for the search bar
let's just copy from the last the last
one so it's open up old one coke and we
just copy this out so they can copy out
wait in our type because it's going to
be the same you can also copy our wait
really
for our calculator come back over to our
title to paste it in so we're going to
click the start button we're going to
wait for the search bar to come up we're
going to type in calc and press the
Enter key and then we're going to wait
for the calculator a pop-up so once the
calculators popped up we can click the v
button so we want to copy our wait and
we want to click click out our
calculator and where we want to click
I'm going to click on this and go to our
target offset and we want to click the v
button and hit apply okay so now we're
clicking the v button and now we can
start writing out if so this is where we
choose whether we're going to add
subtract multiply or divide so we can
write if so if option so the option that
the user selected at the start is equal
to so you double double equal sign modes
open square brackets 0 close square
brackets so if the option they selected
was equal to the first mode and we can
see me call colons are so we're going to
call them to go down to the next line in
indent and if so then we're going to
click and copy our previous line going
to click and we're going to click on the
target offset of the plus symbol so
we're going to add apply ok so
if they chose to add then we're going to
add and then we can back out to the
first line and do LF so we're going to
be checking again with another if
statement if the first one was false so
they didn't choose add we're going to
check if the option is equal to modes
open square bracket 1 close square
bracket so the first mode was to subdue
all the step the second mode technically
was to subtract so you can post an out
click here and pick our target offset
instead of plus this time and subtract
apply ok and then you can do one more
else if L if option is equal to modes
open square bracket to close our kit
we're going to click and this time we're
going to be clicking the multiplier I
believe because we did add subtract
multiply and divide
so our target offset this time is for
the multiply button fly okay alright and
now because we've done that we need to
have one more which is going to be our
else this time so if every other option
is false then they must have chosen the
divide button so let's do else : and we
can paste now click again this time
we're going to set our target offset to
the divide simple why okay alright so
now we've got our if statements so based
on what the user selected the start
we're going to either add subtract
multiply or divide and once out if it is
finished running we're going to click
the 5 button again so outside of our if
so back on the first line the first
indent rather we're going to set our
target offset to the 5 again which I've
already got there because I copied the
previous previous 5 calculation of 5
click rather and then we're going to
click our equal sign so it's open this
up set our target offset
to the equal sign there we go apply okay
and we've got our 17 lines of code here
you can save this so save and this time
we'll call it calc 2 so this is our
second revision of calc save it and then
let's give it a shot so we're going to
set up our modes and we're going to ask
them which mode they'd like then we're
going to run the script so let's give it
a shot
click run what would you like to do add
subtract multiply or divide let's go
with multiplier and hit ok now it'll
take over
hope couldn't find the image to the
start button hmm why is that let's check
your matching preview can it find it I
just find it down now window hmm let's
just give it another shot
let's run we want to multiply okay
it seems to be struggling to find the
start button let's let's remove that out
we'll copy our start button from our VA
because we know that works paste it back
in here save it and give them the shot
if we want to multiply okay there we go
founds the start button type in
calculator open up the calculator 5
times 5 equals 25 cool
so our program worked correctly done
away it was struggling to match that
start button maybe it was too sensitive
and let's try running it again this time
we want to subtract hit OK runs open up
calculator
5 minus 5 equals if you get 0 yep
there we go 0 and let's give it one more
shot and we'll try out the divide so
this is on our else statement so hit OK
Ross that's running the card and it's up
5 /
five equals should be one yep we got one
cool our programs working correctly okay
that's it for this video we can now make
choices and interact with the user this
will become a necessity in the upcoming
videos the next thing we'll be looking
at is looping automation you have any
questions leave it in the comments and
I'll try to answer it as best as
possible don't forget to subscribe
