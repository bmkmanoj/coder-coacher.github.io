output every video will have all
slideshows encoded available in the
description in this video we'll be
looking at how we can interact with our
Python program on the command line
Python makes this very easy for us
providing us with simple easy to use
functions this is import raw input and
print this mate lets lets us make our
output look nice we've used the main
output function already print during
this video we'll look at our customer
customizing our output to the prompt to
make it look nicer and better to read
first let's have a quick look at making
our out output nicer in our interpreter
we can create a variable called name
let's set it to our name
now with our variable called name we can
print it out nicely so let's add two
strings together to make our output look
nicer so let's open up our type Python
interpreter and make name equal our name
now we can print out a hard-coded
strings
hello my name is space open quotes and
we use the plus symbol to add a variable
into that string so we're adding name
into our string hello my name is plus
our name so we print that out you'll
notice that it adds the value of our
variable to the end of our string now
this allows for much more dynamic code
this allows for our variable name to
change throughout our program rather
than having to write print every time we
need need to now let's have a look at
getting some input from the user there's
two main functions to get input in
Python import and raw input we're going
to look at using raw input first so
let's set our variable called name to
the user's input
name equals raw underscore input open
brackets and inside the brackets we can
put a prompt to ask the user so let's
make it please enter your name and we
close the brackets off now when we hit
enter on this it'll pop up with a prompt
asking us to enter our name let's enter
in our name let's do something like yeah
now if we print out our variable now
print name you'll notice that it's been
set to what we entered in earlier okay
now let's start looking at the input
function so python also has an input
function this unlike raw input which
always assumes you're entering a string
input the input function tries to turn
the users input into code thus this is
why we avoid using input unless for some
reason we require it so let's have a
quick look at what happens if we use
input instead of raw input so let's make
name equal input open brackets and we'll
use the same prompt please enter your
name and then we'll put in closing
brackets now if we enter something like
Fred it will crash our program because
Fred is not defined so this is mostly
why we don't use input because it tries
to turn everything into code which means
it can be used for malicious intent okay
so since we've been using the
interpreter for quite a while let's get
to the true power of coding with Python
let's create our first program file
now open up your favorite text editor
and we're creating a file called to 3pi
make sure you use the dot py extension
on your file otherwise Python will not
know that it's a Python file okay let's
add some instructions similar to the
ones we wrote before so I'm going to use
vim if you if you haven't installed this
then look up how to install it
okay so vim 2/3 PI and this will open up
vim and let's start writing some
instructions ok so we can write more
than one line now in our program and it
will execute line after line so let's
create a variable name and make it equal
to raw underscore input open brackets
please enter your name close brackets
now if we go down to the next line it
doesn't execute it to the 0 file and we
can put down our next statement that we
want to execute so let's then print out
print hello closed quotes and then we'll
add a plus name and then another plus
open up the courts comma thank you for
using my first program and then we'll
close quotes on that now let's save our
program and we're going to write and
we're going to run it sorry
that's right quit and now to run our
program we type Python and then the file
name so 2/3 PI now you'll notice it asks
me for my name and drew drops
hello drops thank you for using my first
program as you can see this is where the
strength is in Python writing the actual
script files so it allows for execution
of commands one after the other rather
than having to sit at the at the Python
interpreter and entering one command at
a time now while this is cool oh and one
other thing to note if you're running on
windows right click on your file in the
idle and hit open you can then open up
your file that you will it do Python
file and then hit run in the module ok
let's create something a little bit more
useful let's edit out shoot three so
let's write a multiplying program so
let's let's edit our to 3pi and we'll
get two numbers from the user and Times
them together and output the answer to
the console okay so vim to 3pi now what
we're going to need to do is we're going
to get a number one and number two so
let's let's first print out welcome so
print well come to multiply
okay so we're printing out a welcome
message for people who just run our
program and now let's get our first
number from the user so number 1 equals
bra input so because we want to get a
number we got to cast raw input from a
string into an integer because remember
raw input always gets a string from the
user so to cast that what we do is we
type int open brackets and that gets us
our integer so we just have to make sure
we close the brackets at the end so this
gets out a number 1 now this if we enter
a string into our integer it will now
break because we're expecting an integer
so in a later tutorial I'll show you how
to avoid this but for now we'll just
stick to the rules
okay now let's enter in our second
number num 2 equals int open brackets
raw underscore input open brackets
please enter your second number we also
have to add it our first string so
please enter your first number okay now
let's let's print out the answer ok to
print out the answer we can use our
types operator that we learned in the
last tutorial so it's do num1 times num2
and that's how program done now we can
save and we can run so let's back quick
and python to 3pi please enter your
first number okay let's do 5 please into
your second number let's do 6 the answer
is 30 cool so this is our first useful
program now we have a program like
do multiplication for us even though we
have a calculator on our computer this
is a great display of how useful input
can be this concludes our look at input
and output in Python
don't fear if you don't remember all of
this you can easily come back and
re-watch this video to consolidate all
the information if you have any
questions and you can't find the answer
on Google after a quick search feel free
to leave them in the comments next we'll
be covering selection thanks for
