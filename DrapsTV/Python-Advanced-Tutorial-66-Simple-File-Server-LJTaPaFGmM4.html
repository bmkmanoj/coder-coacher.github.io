server in this video we'll be extending
upon the topic of networking by building
a simple file server hopefully this will
aid in your understanding of how files
are transferred over a network every
video of all slideshows and code
available in the description some quick
preamble this video is an extension on
the Python advanced 6 networking video
if you've yet to watch it an annotation
will be on screen for a few seconds the
networking video covers how to set up
TCP and UDP connections ok on to the
file server program how does it work
well we have two programs the server
which handles the file requests and
sends the file and the client which will
request a certain file on the server and
download it into a file on the client
end this will be a TCP program as we
don't want the possibility of losing
some of our file while we're downloading
it the server will open up the file if
it exists and start sending the bytes
from the from the file over the socket
on the client end we'll open up a file
and start filling that file with all the
incoming bytes
we'll even put a percentage downloaded
printout to the screen so first we'll
make the server-side for the file server
let's name it file server dot PI the
server-side will wait for clients to
connect and then request a file and if
that file exists we start sending it to
the client otherwise we'll tell them the
file doesn't exist
ok so I'll come over to Ubuntu and we'll
start writing it so vim file server dot
pi ok now we're going to need to import
three different things we're going to
need the socket to import socket fees
we're working with networking and we're
gonna need threading so import threading
and this will be to handle the requests
from users so we can have multiple
people requesting files and import OS
and we'll use this to check if a file
exists in the size of a file ok so we'll
define our threading function now so
retrieve file
we'll take a name and the socket and
then inside our retrieve file function
we're going to get the file name from
user so file name equals sock receive
and we'll take a thousand 24 bytes
okay now if the OS path dot is file file
lame so if the file exists and it's a
file then we're going to continue so
sock dot sin I'm going to send back to
the client that it exists and we'll do
that all in capitals add a space onto
the end close the quotes and then we're
going to add plus the string of the OS
path dot get size and the filename so
we're gonna get the size of the file
okay so once we've sent that what we're
going to do is we're going to sit and
wait for the users response so user
lease bonds and that's going to equal
the sock dot receive and we're going to
receive 1,024 bytes now once we've got
gotten a message back from the user so
if user response and we're going to grab
the first two characters from the users
response and check if they're equal okay
in capitals if it does equal okay we're
going to assume they want to download
the file so with the file so open file
name in read binary so RB for read
binary as F so as the file as f we're
going to get the bytes to send
and they are going to equal F dot read
and will read a thousand and twenty four
bytes from the file that'll go well with
the amount we're sending over the
network okay and now we're going to send
them so Sox send eat bytes to send okay
now just in case our file that we're
trying to send is more than a thousand
twenty four bytes which is usually the
case with images and such
while the bytes to send does not equal
an empty string then we're going to get
more bytes to send so bytes to send
equals F dot read 1024 and then we're
going to send them so sock send bytes to
send okay now we can exit out of this
whale and on the first indentation we're
going to write an else so if the file
doesn't exist we're going to sock send
er for error okay
now also in the one indentation we're
going to do sock close so we'll close
off the connection after we've done
sending the file okay now tell threading
function written so now let's write our
main function
so def main and we're going to eat the
host so the host is this machine so
127.0.0.1 for local host and apron
equals in there okay and the port will
do 5,000 because that's an easy number
to remember okay let's create our socket
so s equals socket dot socket
so that'll automatically default to TCP
because we're not giving it any
parameters and we want to bind it to a
port so s dot bind to the terpil of the
host and the port okay and now we want
to tell us over to start listening for
connections so s dot listen and we'll
listen for five okay so print server
started so that'll print out to the
screen the server started so we know
that it's started and everything's gone
correctly so far
now while true so forever well well this
programs running we're going to get the
connection socket so see and the address
of the person connecting and that's
going to equal socket dot except now
we'll print out to the console sort of
print and we'll go clean connected the
IP and we'll do a little less than sign
there plus the string of the address
plus and we'll do a little greater than
symbol there to close it off make it
look nice okay
now let's create our thread so T equals
threading dot thread and we want the
target function to be the retrieve file
function and the args for that function
are going to be a terpil of the name so
three thread and we'll pass in the
connection see okay now we'll tell our
thread to start so t dot start and
that'll handle our incoming connections
now for some reason we get out of our
while which shouldn't happen we'll do s
close and stem all right out if I'm just
going to scored a name
is equal to Maine then we got to run
Maine so that's our that's our server
written okay
so I'll quickly just have a look through
here and make sure that I haven't missed
any spelling mistakes or anything like
that I think it all looks alright should
tell me if I get anything wrong
okay I'll save this and now we're going
to go on to writing our client side so
our client side will ask the user for a
file name to request and then we'll
inform the user whether the file exists
or not and then tell them the size of
the file and if they wish to download it
and ask them if they wish to download it
sure they and then we'll put the
Downloads file into the local directory
to the file client and add a new prefix
to the file okay
so I'll come back over to Ubuntu and
we'll write our file client so file
client dot PI and we only need to import
socket this time so import socket and
we'll define our main function so def
main and inside our main you'll get the
host of the server and the server is
hosted on the current machine so
127.0.0.1 and the port is equal to 5000
now you could easily grab the host in
the port from the command line so the
file server will take a server to
connect to but for now I'm just hard
coding it because it'll be quicker that
way okay so the socket create the socket
so s equals socket socket so they'll
create a TCP socket and then when tell
that socket to connect to purple of the
host and the port of the server and if
we connect successfully we're going to
get the file name from the user so file
name equals bra
underscore input and we'll ask them for
a filename I will put a little arrow
there to make it so that they know that
they can enter something in okay now if
the file name file name does not equal
not equal lowercase Q for quit then
we'll send to the server for s send the
file name to this client requested by
our name okay now now that we've sent
the file name to the server we've got to
wait for them to respond whether they
exist whether the file exists or not so
we'll get that and store it into a
variable hood data so data equals s
receive and will receive 1024 bytes now
if data and the first six characters of
the data is equal to exists then we're
going to continue because the file
exists and we'll get the file size and
if you remember we also put the file
size in the exists send so we'll get the
file size and that equals a long of the
data that we received from from the
sixth character onwards so after the six
character and onwards okay now we've got
file size what we're going to do is
we're going to ask the user if they want
to download this file so store the
result in message so message equals raw
underscore input and we're going to tell
them that the file exists and add the
string
of the file size in bytes and we'll ask
them if they want to down load question
mark and because this is quite long I
might put a backslash here so standard
multiple lines and the by its download
yes or no close brackets and we'll put a
little arrow tell them that they can
enter something in okay so now that
we've got the message from the user what
we'll do is if the message that they
enter is equal to a capital y then we
want to continue so our s dot send and
we'll send okay in capitals so that we
do want to download the file okay
now F equals open and the filename but
before the filename we want to add a new
underscore plus the file name so it will
put a new underscore before the filename
okay and we want to open it up in write
binary so WB for write binary okay now
we open up a file to write all of the
incoming data in we're going to start
receiving that data so data equals sock
or s dot receive and we're going to
receive 1,024 bytes now because we're
not 100% sure how much data we're going
to get out of the receive function we're
going to use a variable called turtle
oops total received and that's going to
equal the length of the data that we
grabbed okay and now we're going to
write that data out so f dot right and
then the data that we've got and now we
want to write our while so if there's
more than 1024 bytes of data we're going
to continue receiving so while the total
perceived is less than the file size the
rule told earlier we're going to
continue grabbing data from the stream
so data equals s receive and we'll grab
another thousand 24 bytes
okay now we'll add on to our total
received so total received plus equals
so we're going to add on to the end the
length of the data that we received okay
and then we'll write that data out to
the file so f dot right and we want to
write the data that we received okay and
because the the file is larger than 1024
bytes we're going to print out the
percentage that's currently downloaded
so we'll print and the format will be
zero point 2f so two two floating
decibels what decimal points and let's
get it we're going to form format that
for our percentage so format the total
received divided by a float of the file
size and times that by 100 and we'll
plus on to the end and now split the
line the piece percent done so that'll
tell us how much is done of the file so
far and then outside of our while so
once that whale is finished so once
everything is downloaded we're going to
print out that the download is complete
okay now back in two indentations we're
going to have an else so if the file
doesn't exist if we don't receive and
exists from the server then we're going
to print out that the file put file does
not exist okay
and on our first indentation so after
everything we're going to close the
socket so s close the connection and
that's our main function Rin so we'll
write out if it's going to go to name is
equal to let's go and scope main then
we'll run main and then to our client
side finished so I'll save this and
we'll give it a go okay so run the
server so python file server dot pi and
okay we got the server started and I've
got another window open over here and
I'll run Python file client dot pi and
as we can see a client is connected to
the server with this IP on this port and
it's requesting a file name on the
client side so I've got a folder over
here which is the file server which has
our file file client and file server in
it and it's got a text document and a
picture of a cat in the text document
we've got heyo my name is traps so just
a simple text document and we've got a
cat picture to show that we can also
send pictures and other type other type
of files so I come back across to a
client o ask for the test book test dot
txt file and it says yep the file exists
it's 23 bytes do you want to download so
I'll say yeah I want to download it and
it'll tell me that download is complete
so cool if I come back over to this file
you see I've got a new underscore text
document if I open that up it's 23 bytes
so hey yeah my name is drafts so we've
successfully transferred a text document
across the network let's try the cat
picture so I'll run the file client
again and it's asking for a file name
and as you can see this time I'm on the
next port up we'll go
cat dot jpg okay file exists and it's
five thousand and twenty six bytes do I
want to download yep and as you can see
40 percent done 61 percent done 81
percent done and 100 percent done
download complete
we'll come back to this home file i'll
see i've got a new cat picture and open
that up and i got a picture of a cat
okay cool so that concludes the code
inside of this there's many things we
could add to our file server to make it
more user friendly and more useful these
could be things like giving it a list of
files the server has available to the
client variable speeds is at the moment
we only use a buffer of 1,024 bytes
I'm offloading the client for
downloading more than one file we say
saves is having to open the program
every time you want to download a file
and there's many more things we can add
to it I encourage you to modify this
program to support one of these features
if it's like a video on one of these
features let me know in the comments I
hope this example helped your
understanding of how sockets communicate
as well as how files can be transferred
over a network thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
