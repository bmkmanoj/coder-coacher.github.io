setup this video is more of an
introduction to the beginner tutorials
so I'll keep it as short as possible
if you have learnt already learnt an
earlier version of Python watch the
Python 2 to Python 3 video to save
yourself from repeating things you
already understand every video of all
slideshows and code available in
description this series of tutorials is
all of the beginner topics in Python 3
the topics covered are things like
variables and data structures input and
output selection functions iteration
file input and output exception handling
and modules with these skills providing
you understand them you'll be able to
write loads of programs though I
strongly suggest learning more of Python
this series is the fundamentals Python
is an interpretive language this means
it is compiled at runtime this means you
do not need to compile your program to
distribute it however it means anyone
can open open an edit / read your code
so that's not really a big deal now
let's talk about getting set up and
ready to write some Python code if you
are running Linux or OSX Python 3 may or
may not already come installed but we
can get it up and running in one click
command if you are on Windows I'll cover
the installation next feel free to skip
to that part of the video
on Linux we can do a quick test to make
sure it's working working fine so on the
X we can jump over to our terminal and
if you don't know how to use the
terminal I suggest you learn how to get
get around and use basic commands so
over here on Linux now we're going to
type Python 3 - capital V so this will
get the version current version of
Python installed so we've got Python
three point two point three so there's
also a Python 3.4 out at the moment but
I have three point two point three
installed on my VM okay so we want this
to be three point X something which it
will be okay so if you don't get this
message and it says python 3 isn't
installed we can easily install it with
the command sudo for super user apt-get
so we want to get a package
and we want to install that package and
we want the package Python 3 now when
you run this it'll go off and we'll find
the package and install it and you'll be
ready to use Python 3 so now we can run
our Python 3 command again and get our
version and we'll see it's working so
let's test out our Python by writing
some commands so first we want to start
python 3 so python 3 and we'll get the
interpreter and you'll see three little
arrow signs now this triple arrows means
it's waiting for a command
so let's now start executing some code
on the fly so let's execute the command
print and we'll print out hello world to
the screen so we on type print open
brackets then we're gonna start some
quotes hello space world close quotes
and close brackets now when we enter
it'll print out to the screen hello
world success but python is working
correctly so if you're running on Linux
or OSX you can move on to the next video
okay now if you're running Windows then
we need to install the Python
interpreter so we can get the Python
interpreter binaries from the Python org
site a link to python.org is in the
description so we'll go to the download
page and we want python version 3.0
ex-something so go to python.org and we
go to the downloads page now we've got
two buttons python 2.7 and Python 3.4 we
want the Python 3 so we click on the
download Python 3
and it'll ask us to save and then we can
install it so once python 3 is installed
we can start using python so let's do it
windows test so we're going to navigate
to start python 3.3 python and the
python command line and then we get a
run Python and we'll get our Python
interpreter so if we come over to start
all programs python 3.3 and the what
python can
and this will get us a command line with
Python interpreter running and we'll
have three errors which means that
Python is waiting for a command so let's
give it a the command print and we'll
output hello world to the screen so
print open circle brackets then we're
going to open quotes and we're going to
type hello world closed quotes and
closed brackets so once we hit enter
here we'll get the output hello world to
the console success Python is working
correctly okay so from here we can
create a shortcut if we like or you can
just remember to go start all programs -
and if they used idle GUI for a text
editor or you can use the command line
okay now that we've have now that we
have Python 3 installed we can start
writing Python programs so next we're
going to look at variables and data
structures thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
