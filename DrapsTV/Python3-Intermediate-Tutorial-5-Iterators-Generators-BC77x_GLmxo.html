five iterators and generators every
video of all slideshows and code
available in the description we've used
iterators many times before as most
containers can be looped over with the
for loop for example for element in 1 2
3
Python implements this behavior with a
special method called guitar which
returns an iterator object from the
container that has a next method defined
the next method calculates the next item
in the container to return for the for
loop to use when there is no items left
the iterator stops the for loop by
raising the stop iteration exception
this exception tells Python to stop the
current for loop let's look at this
quick example of what the for loop does
on containers so if we have a container
defined with the characters a b and c we
then get the iterator of that container
with the it our method now we can step
through each one using the next method
on the iterator until we hit the end and
stop iteration is raised
let's try writing our own iterator on a
container for simplicity we'll use
pythons tutorials example which iterates
over in reverse order so we're going to
create a file called reverse type a and
we're going to reverse any data that we
give to that class
ok so let's come over to Ubuntu and
we're going to create our reverse pi now
we're going to create our class so into
class reverse and in our reverse class
we're going to define its initialization
so def one just got in the score init
underscore underscore and it's going to
take self and some data to reverse ok
now we're going to set self dot data so
we're going to create an attribute data
just going to equal the data that we
pass in and self dot index which is
going to help put index which is going
to hold the position that we are inside
that data so we're gonna set that to the
length
the data that we pass in okay now let's
define our cow eater method so def
underscore underscore hitter
underscore the school and that's going
to take self now we're over our
iterative method is just going to return
self so this object now we need to
define our next special method so def
underscore underscore next underscore
underscore and that's going to take self
and we're going to need to do some
calculations here to get the reverse
order so what we're going to do is we're
going to write a quick if statement so
if self dot index is equal to zero so if
we've reached the end of our data then
we're going to raise the stop iteration
exception but if we haven't reached the
end of our data we're going to set self
dot index to equal self dot index minus
one then we're going to return self dot
data data and we're going to return the
index of that data so self dot index
okay so that's our reverse class defined
let's create our main so def mean now
inside of our main we're going to create
our reverse object so we'll call it Rev
equals reverse and the data we're going
to give it is the string is a string so
we'll give it dropsical okay so now we
can use our our reverse object in a for
loop so we could do for char in Rev
we're going to print and we'll print out
the char okay now let's write out if so
if I'm just going to school name comes
gun school is equal to
I'm just goes up on the score of main
underscore underscore we're going to run
main okay so let's try this out so right
quit and saved now let's try running it
so we're going to type Python 3
reverse dot pi now what got an error
takes no parameters what must have
mucked up somewhere spell it right oh
whoops forgot an ayah in it so you need
out in it there we go all right quit and
try run it and there we go we get our
string printed out backwards so we get e
LC i SP ard cool so let's move on
generators are another way of creating
iterators but just in a function they
are quick because they generate all of
the background code required for the
next and airtime methods the course
statement of generators is the yield
statement this saves the state of the
iterator and sets the point to resume to
when the next method is called generator
expressions are unique feature that
Python uses that allows iteration to be
handled by Python in just a single line
expression in the next example we'll
look at making a generator and look at
doing the same task with a generator
expression their generator expressions
are uncommon ly used you may encounter
one in another person's code and wonder
what it's doing okay so let's recreate
our reverse iterator except this time
we'll use generators to do the same task
so we'll come back over to your bundle
and we're going to open up our reverse
step a and we're going to remove our
class so we can get rid of our whole
class and we're going to use the reverse
name for a generator function instead so
we're going to death
reverse and reverse is going to take out
the data so you want to reverse and
inside that function we're going to
create a for loop so for and we'll do
index keep it consistent in range so
we're going to use the range function
and then the length of the data so Len
data minus one so this is the place we
want to start inside the data now last
time we just got the length of the data
but you gotta remember inside of our
next method we decreased the index
before we returned any values so we want
to start at length minus one and then we
want to stop the iteration at minus one
and we want to take steps of minus one
okay so for that index we're going to
yield so we're going to yield OOP
yield and we're going to yield the data
with at the certain index okay
so we've created our reverse function
generator function so let's save this
and write quit and we can try running
our code and we get the exact same
output but it's such a much less code
cool so let's do it the same thing again
but this time let's use an expression so
I'll leave our reverse function net and
I'll just go down a line and what I'm
going to do is create a variable called
data and I'm going to make that equal to
the trap cycle again and let's say we
want to reverse over this data string we
can do a we'll print a list and inside
that list we're going to put our
generator expression so for data so our
data I so we haven't specified what I is
yet so data I so each index in that data
for
I in range and similar to our range
function in our generator function where
you're going to do length of data minus
one we're going to finish at minus one
and we're going to step down backwards
at minus one and we can close off our
our list and our print and we've just
created a generator expression inside
one line so we're printing out a list of
our data in reverse order
okay so let's save this and quit let's
try running it so you run it and we get
the ELC isp ard and then we get our list
out put it in reverse
e LC asp ard cool this concludes our
look at iterators and generators extra
code will be available in the code txt
and in the slides folder as well as a
challenge task
don't fear if you don't remember all of
this you can easily come back and
rewatch this video to consolidate all of
the information you have any questions
feel free to leave them in the comments
next we'll be covering modulating our
code thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
