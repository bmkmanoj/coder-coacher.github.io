a botnet every video have all slideshows
and code available in the description so
firstly what is a bot well a body is an
automated process or service on a device
this is usually a computer but could
also be a smartphone or even a network
device a bot can be used to look after a
program by restarting it up crash occurs
alternatively a bot could be used to
send spam emails or perform denial of
service attacks also known as a DOS
attack a botnet however is a collection
of devices connected via a network that
can be sent commands by a master
computer to perform tasks this could be
sending malicious emails to random email
addresses or even doing calculations to
solve a mathematics problem some botnets
are voluntary usually though is used for
cloud computing or managing of a program
or network other botnets can consist of
devices that have been infected with
malware and the user is unknowingly
participating in illegal activity using
a botnet consisting of multiple devices
to perform a denial of service attack
will make it a distributed denial of
service attack or better known as DDoS
attack people often mistake a
distributed DOS attack with that of a
normal dose attack
just remember one D for a single device
and two DS for two or more devices now
you might ask our botnets illegal well
not all of them using a botnet on your
own machines or hat or machines your
permission to use is not illegal
voluntary participation in a botnet
isn't illegal either providing it is
used for legal purposes only
for example managing an Internet Relay
Chat or IRC for short however botnets
using devices acquired without
permission such as malware is illegal
using that botnet to then participate in
illegal activities such as a DDoS attack
is highly illegal if caught you'll land
yourself a lengthy jail sentence similar
to that of a drug dealer let's talk a
little bit about luke load stands for
low orbit ion cannon and no that's not
an actual ion cannon as it's seen in a
lot of science fiction like is an open
source network stress testing tool that
uses
das attack there is a standalone version
that allows you to use a single-dose
attack against the server however there
is also the high of mind version this
version allows you to connect your liked
to an IRC server from which attacks can
be sent from these attacks will
automatically start for everyone
connected to that IRC server with Luke
running resulting in a DDoS attack
anonymous hacktivists are renowned for
using like having sent out download
links on Twitter and Facebook okay so
how does it work well the botnet is
usually a program that stores the
information and connections to a device
they then sit there an idle until a
command is issued the master which in
this case is us will send a command to
all of the bots on the botnet the bots
then execute the command this could be
for all of the bots to send email with a
malicious file to an unsuspecting victim
and then add them to the botnet making
the network bigger as you can see in the
image the master sends a command to all
the bots and the bots then send a
malicious email to the target server we
are going to build a basic botnet
program that sells connections to SSH
servers the SSH stands for secure shell
the SSH protocol is an encrypted remote
connection to the service command line
this kind of botnet could be useful for
managing a network that has a few
servers will build upon our botnet to
allow for brute forcing connections and
cracking weak SSH servers and then
adding them to our botnet I hope you now
have a better understanding of what a
botnet is don't fear if you don't
remember all this you can easily come
back and re-watch this video to
consolidate all the information you have
any questions leave it in the comments
and I'll try and answer it as best as
possible will next be writing a basic
botnet framework thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
