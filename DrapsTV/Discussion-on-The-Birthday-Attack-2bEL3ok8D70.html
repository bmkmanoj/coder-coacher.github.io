birthday attack I hope you find it as
interesting as I do the slide show will
be available in the description so what
is the birthday attack the birthday
attack is an attack on hashing
algorithms that takes advantage of the
fact that the hashing algorithm always
outputs a fixed number of bits
no matter the input length meaning that
it's possible for collisions to occur
collisions are where two different
inputs produce the same output you may
be wondering why it's called the
birthday attack this is because it's
based off the same mathematics as the
birthday paradox
what is the birthday paradox well the
birthday paradox is the incredibly high
probability that two people will have
the same birthday in a room of 50 people
just thinking about it 365 days in a
year 50 people that's about a 1 in 6 or
17% chance this is actually wrong in
reality it's about a 97% chance that two
people will share the same birthday so
how can this be possible well let's have
a look at the maths taking any one
birthday there is 49 possible matches to
be made but if we compare every birthday
to every other birthday the probability
greatly increases thankfully there's an
equation that is called the combination
without replacement equation n factorial
over n minus R factorial times R
factorial R in this case is 2 as the
repeated amount would be 2 as we're
looking for two birthdays and n would be
54 the number of people working this out
it comes to 1225 combinations now it
doesn't seem so out of the ordinary that
there's a 97% chance that two people
should have the same birthday ok so back
to hash collisions why is this important
using this equation we can calculate the
probability that a collision will occur
on a hashing algorithm so let's take an
example of md5 md5 will always return a
hash that is 128 bits long given that
there is 94 characters upper and lower
case letters 10 numbers and 32 symbols
that are accepted by md5 and a password
of at least 20 characters long there is
3.4 times 10 to the 38th possible hashes
and 2.9 times 10 to the 39 possible
passwords
however to generate every password hash
it would take roughly 1.4 times ten to
the twenty five years and worse we'd
have to store every hash we compute and
compare it to all other hashes this
would take trillions of petabyte hard
drives luckily this is where our
birthday paradox is of use plugging it
into our combination equation equation
the total number of hashes and
probability of the 90s at nine a 99%
chance and then solve for K we get five
point nine eight times ten to the
nineteen for a 99% chance of a collision
occurring this is less than one
trillionth of a percent of the original
key space though this is still a large
amount of computing still required it's
within the possible range of about eight
month or eight months on a powerful
high-end PC but remember this is for a
99% chance of a collision a collision
could occur after 30 minutes of running
or never finish in your lifetime that's
how probability works it's important to
realize that this is the chance of
finding two passwords with the same hash
not the same as trying to match a
password to a specific hash however once
you start finding hash collisions in an
algorithm you can use those collisions
to start to figure out how an algorithm
is creating hashes in 2006 blaster Mill
Kilmer produced his algorithm that could
generate a hash collision on average in
17 seconds on a 3.4 gigahertz Pentium 4
processor yet md5 is still one of the
most used hashing functions this brings
the video to an end I hope you learnt
something you or what a new perspective
on how hashing algorithms can be broken
you have any questions leave it in the
comments and I'll try my best to answer
them as best as possible thanks for
