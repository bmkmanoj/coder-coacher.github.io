every video will have all slideshows
incurred available in the description
file i/o in Python is incredibly easy so
this will be a rather short video files
are a great way to load information into
our program or save information for
later use let's jump straight into it we
open the file with the open function we
enter the file name to open and the mode
to open it in example read write or
append first let's create a text file so
let's create a text file so I'll create
a file with create a file called my file
dot txt so it's a txt file and then
let's put some words in here to read
from so let's put in cat and we'll
separate them by a line fat bat mat and
hat ok so once you've got five words in
there we'll save and then we've got a
text file ok so we need to write a
program to open up this file and read
all of the words into our into our
program so let's create a file a program
called tooth 7py
and we'll load the text file in and
we'll print each line to the command
line and we'll be loading the file with
the read mode which is the character R
that's highlighted here and we'll be
using some of these words ok
so let's come back in here and let's
create our Python file so to 7py and now
we want to define our main function
as we've been doing before so the DEF
main brackets colon never tab in
now what we need to do is we need to
open the file that we want to read from
so what we do is you make a variable for
the file so let's call that variable F
we make F equal open so we're opening a
file open brackets and then the file
name so we use my file dot txt and then
we put a comma and we need the the type
to open it up with so we'll use the foot
read because we only need to read stuff
out of it we don't need to save there so
we open it up and read and now we need
to read the information out of it
so inside our main store we need to
create a for loop so we use a for loop
because python knows how many lines
there are there's five so we use a for
loop for each line so for line in F so
for each line in the in the file F which
we opened earlier and then put our colon
and then inside our block of code for
our for we do print line and this will
print the line that it gets from the
file now after we've done using the file
we need to close it so we use F dot
close so they closed the file that we
opened that way if the operating system
needs to use that file it won't tell us
that there's already a program using it
and then we add out if underscore
underscore main name sorry name
underscore underscore is equal to seven
courts underscore underscore main
underscore underscore colon when we run
main and we've written our program to
open up and read all of the words from
our file let's save this and quit and
now let's run it so python
to seven dot py as you can see it's
written out the five words it was in our
file so cat fat bat mat and hat now you
notice that there's also spaces in
between this is because when it reads
the file it notices that there's a
newline and our prints function
automatically adds a newline so that's
two new lines so to avoid this we strip
so in stripping we will strip the new
lines from a file that we read otherwise
it will be on the end of our strings the
backslash n stands for the newline
character and we can strip these using
the strip function in Python so for a
second example we'll edit our our file
our Python program sorry
and we'll strip the new lines of our
current code so strip the new lines what
we need to do is an open our print line
what we'll do is we'll do line dot strip
open and we'll strip to the backslash
and character and we put this in single
quotes because it's a character other
than a string not that it should matter
okay so now that we've used this if we
run out with we save and run it again we
should notice that the new lines the
extra spaces have been removed so yes
that's what we can do to get rid of the
new lines that are automatically read in
by the file okay so now let's look at
output for output we use the write mode
so the W mode so let's edit our trip 7py
to output for user entered strings into
our file and we use the write function
to do this okay so what we're going to
do is we're going to add a add a for
loop that asks the user to
put a word and then we're gonna save
that word into the file using right okay
so let's come back over to Linux here
I'm a year of them 270 why okay so in
here we're gonna change our mains code
so let's change the my file dot txt
instead of the read mode we're going to
use the write mode so the W and for a f4
statement we're going to change that to
for I in range 4 so 4 we're gonna loop 4
times and then we're gonna write what
the user inputs so let's remove our
print line and let's do F dot right so
write this out open brackets and then
we're gonna directly from the user we're
going to get the raw input so input open
brackets and then let's do please enter
a word close quotes and then we can add
it add a new line ourselves so we do
plus open chords backslash n close
quotes and another bracket to end the
right so what we're doing is we're
entering a word from the user and then
we're automatically going to the next
line that way it's spaced out and all
the words aren't attached to each other
and now what we could do is we can save
this to save and now when we run it it
will ask us to enter a word so let's
enter some link like we'll do fun - fun
Python is fun and as you see it's taking
four words and our program is finished
executed now if we open up our text file
so my file
dot txt you'll notice that it's written
for new words in there and removed the
other words and separated them by any
line so that's how we do file i/o so
we've looked at reading and from an
urban file and we've looked at writing
to the file as well if if yeah if the
file doesn't exist yet and you want to
output to that file then we use the
write plus mode which is the w+ and the
characters symbol to create the file if
it does not exist also you must convert
all data types to strings for outputting
them so for example an integer that
equals 5 to output that you have to turn
it into a string using the STR command
our function rather and this concludes
our look at file i/o don't fear if you
don't remember all of this you can
easily come back and re-watch this video
to consolidate all the information if
you have any questions and you can't
find the answer after a quick Google
search feel free to leave it in the
comments next we'll be covering
