three general tasks in this video we'll
be continuing with the basics of the
command line while learning how to
perform some general tasks every video
have all slideshows and code available
in the description we have most of the
theory of how commands work in the
command line so this video and the next
is going to involve a lot of memorizing
commands so you know what tools you have
at your disposal while working on the
command line remember to keep in mind
that commands follow the same pattern
command options arguments some commands
especially a few recover in this video
take multiple arguments like a source
and destination path or filename okay
now that we understand how to move
around our folders let's learn how to
create folders creating folders is done
with the MK dur command which stands for
make directory the command follows the
pattern MK dur and then a folder name or
we can create a folder inside another
directory we are not currently in by
specifying the directory backslash the
folder name let's give this a shot and
create a directory called CMD and put it
in our c hard drive we will use this
folder for our practice from now on okay
so we'll open up our command prompt and
we're going to CD CD and we're in the C
hard drive now let's make a directory so
Mk space and we're going to call it CMD
alright we've created our directory
there's been no errors and it popped up
and now if we type doe we can have a
look and if we scroll up we'll see that
we have the CMD directory cool so let's
now try and move into that directory so
CD CMD so now we're in the CMB directory
cool with the power to create comes the
power to destroy so next we need to
learn how to remove directories that we
no longer want to remove a directory we
use the command RM de which stands for
remove directory the command follows an
identical pattern to the make to
recommand let's have a go and create a
folder in our CMD folder called temp and
then we'll remove it okay so come back
over and we're going to create a folder
so m'kay duh and we're going to call it
temp and we created it as no error
messages we can now type Durman see our
temp is currently now in here now let's
try removing it so we type RM duh for
remove directory and type temp the name
of the directory we want to remove we
hit enter
and no error messages we type there now
we can see that there's no longer the
temp directory cool now let's clear the
screen so you see LS and get it ready
for the next use all right commonly you
may want to remove the folder that has
files or folders inside it however
windows will not allow you to RM do a
folder that contains sub directories or
files so for us to be able to remove the
folder and everything and I mean
everything inside it you must use the /s
option we just follow our pattern to add
the option in RM der space /s space
folder name this will ask you are you
sure before it confirmed the removal if
you want to skip this you can add the /q
option next we may need to copy a file
or files to another location on our
computer or even in the same folder but
with a different name unfortunately the
trivial task of cut copy and paste who
sou used to is very intimidating for
loners to the command line admittedly
cut and paste isn't as bad as copy
so first we'll look at the move command
for cut and paste the move command is
pretty straightforward we use the move
command to pick up a file and place it
down somewhere else on the hard drive
the pattern takes two arguments the
source file to move and the destination
folder to place it in the move command
has one option which is the forward
slash capital y which forces
writing in the destination folder if
there's a file with the same name
this is dangerous to use unless you're
100% certain it's something you want to
do as the overwritten file we lost
forever
okay let's create a text file and move
it so we'll come over to our command
prompt and let's create a directory so
m'kay duh and we'll call it temp again
and now we want to create a file so
we're just going to create a text file
so you can either go and open up your
browser navigate to navigate to your CMD
folder temp folder and create a text
file this way new text file or
alternatively inside your command prompt
you can type notepad and then the file
name so let's do a text file dot txt and
this will open up a new file so it says
cannot find the text file dot txt file
do you want to create a new file say yes
and it'll create the file for you and
you can put something in here so let's
go hello this is a a test file you save
this control S or file save and we can
close that off now so now if we type dur
we should see in here we have a text
file txt cool so let's let's move our
text file so currently the text file is
in the CMD directory so we're currently
inside the CMD directory and we've
created our text file here now let's say
that was an accident we want to move it
back into the temp file we want to move
it into the temp folder so to do that we
type move text file oops
text file dot txt and then we space and
then temp we want to move it into the
temp folder so we press ENTER you can
see it says 1 files moved now if we type
dirt we'll see it's no longer in this
folder but if we change directory to
temp and type
we can see that it has been moved
successfully into the temp directory
cool so we'll just CD dot dot to go back
all right
and we'll clear the screen as well CLS
all right now under copying copying can
be confusing first of all there is three
commands copy X copy and robocopy which
one should be used
well secondly the differences between
them copy will only copy files plus it
will not retry if the copy is
interrupted or crashes X copy will copy
both files and folders however it will
not retry finally robocopy which stands
for robust copy which will copy both
files and folders and will also retry if
the copy is interrupted there's quite a
few more differences but for now we only
need to know these let's start giving
copy a go x copy is deprecated so let's
focus on copy and robocopy let's try
copying the text file we created earlier
and making a copy in the same directory
then we'll try our rubber copy and copy
the whole folder containing our text
files these commands work just like the
move but with more options available try
looking at the help to see some of the
cool things you can do all right so
let's go over to our command prompt and
we're going to move back into our temp
directory that's where our text file is
go type though we can see our text file
now let's make a copy so let's type copy
text file dot txt and space and the the
file we want to turn it into so we're
going to copy this file and we're going
to rename to txt file
- dot txt now we hit enter it has one
file copied now if we type we can see
we've got two text files of the same
size text file and text file - cool now
let's try copying the whole folder so CD
dot dot so we're going to go back to our
command folder and we're going to copy
the whole temp for
there and we'll call it temp - so this
time we need to use robocopy so our Bo
copy no space and then we do a space at
the end we're going to copy the temp
folder and we're going to copy it to
temp - I will hit enter it'll show us
the copy log shows the status it's done
a normal copy of all of the files inside
the folder and it's created these new
files and move them across to a new
folder cool so this is another good
thing about robocopy as it gives you a
whole output of what what it did okay
so let's now try dough and we can see
we've got a temp - folder let's try
moving into that so CD temp - and if we
have a look though we can see we've got
our text file a text file - which has
been successfully copied cool and we'll
just CD back out and we'll clear the
screen again awesome now that we know
how to copy and move files and folders
renaming will be easy to rename
something we use the rename command this
command works very similar to move and
copy it takes the source file to change
and the destination file name deleting
is quite easy to remember the command is
delete and it takes one argument which
is the filename all right sometimes we
may want to have a quick look at what's
inside a file there is an easy command
that will output the contents of a file
into our command line for us to read we
do this simply with the more command we
simply type more and then the file name
more is useful and makes quickly
inspecting files a breeze once we are
inside the more program we can go down
one line with the Enter key or we can go
down one page with the spacebar key if
you want to know more about the more
command have a look at the help let's
use the more command with one of our
text files that we have all right so
we'll come over to our command prompt
and we'll move into the temp directory
and we're going to use the MOR command
on our text
file.txt we enter you can see it says
hello this is a test file and we can't
really see the true power of more heat
because it's only a one line file but
we'll definitely see the more command
used again all right redirects are a
crucial and powerful tool at your
disposal in the command line there are
four main ones to remember first we have
piping which will place the output of
the left command into the input of the
right command second we have input which
allows us to input data into a command
on the left from a text file on the
right
third we have output which will allow us
to place the output of a command on the
left into the text file on the right and
finally we have the append which allows
us to append the output of the command
into the text file on the right the
dollar symbol has been added to show
where commands or file names go let's
give outputting a try outputting is
probably the most commonly used one of
the four input on the other hand is not
very commonly used these days but it's
important to know it's there let's save
the output of the dur command into a
file appending works exactly the same
however adding on to the end of the
existing file okay so let's come across
to the command prompt and let's type dur
output and we'll put it into folder dot
txt and this will create the file if it
doesn't already exist we enter we don't
see the door output the contents to the
command prompt instead it's been all put
into the file so let's type more and the
folder dot txt file as you can see we've
got all of the output the word normally
be in our command prompt has been put
into this file so that can be useful for
checking what's changed or just getting
an overall look at what's in the current
directory or even if you want to send
your current directory listing to a
friend okay
sorting and using the piping character
the command line has a nice sort command
ready to solve whatever you give it by
default salt will output the results of
the salt into the command line most of
the time it's useful to output the
results into a file this can be done
without output arrow or by using the
salt commands in both /oo option to
output to a file salt can be nicely used
with a pipe character that we learned
about the piping command is really
useful with custom programs but for
general use it's not often seen for the
example of piping we will use it to sort
the results of the dur command let's try
it out however this time let's go to our
C harddrive as they'll be more folders
to look at okay so we come back over to
our command prompt and we'll tie it CD
CD dot dot okay now we want to sort our
der command so if we type du space pipe
which is the key above your Enter key
while holding shift it kind of looks
like a big bar space and then the sort
command now when we hit enter we can see
that it's sorted our duct document by
the day in our day month year so that's
here first third fifth seventh ten
eleven fourteen fifteen sixteen you
satellite and sorted it that way cool
and we'll just clear the screens for the
CLS finally let's talk about wild cards
wild cards are really useful they are
allow us to select certain files based
on a pattern this is usually easier to
get an understanding of by looking at an
example so for example der space star
dot txt will list all of the files in
the current directory within file
extension dot txt we can also use it to
construct more complex file cards for
example der space star zero one star dot
star this
list all of the files that contain a01
in the file name it's called a wild card
because you don't know what characters
will be in that space if you should only
want a wild card as a single character
you can use the question mark instead of
the star okay let's give it a quick shot
also I should mention that wild cards
will work with most commands in the
command line okay so if we come over to
the command line and we can type der so
we're going to list everything in the
directory however we're going to give it
SDL star so I know that I've got some
folders that start with STL in this hard
drive so if I hit the space SDL star
it'll search for all of the things in
the directory that start with STL and
whatever comes after STL it doesn't
matter as long as it has STL starting
and we enter we can see that I've got a
folder called STL 2 and a pure folder
it's STL to image and also an STL 2
mixer so that's a quick way to cut down
your searches inside a directory ok so
let's give it another shot we're going
to do der and we'll do star dot txt this
time so this will list all of the txt
files in this current directory no
matter what name it has hit enter and
see that I've got a bunch of EULA ticks
T's in this folder 9 of them to be exact
ok I can also do if I don't know how to
properly spell say Program Files I could
type Ida Pro star and that'll almost
finish it off for me and I'll be able to
see ah that's how it's spelt it will
list my Program Files and my Program
Files x86
so you can use it to finish things for
you which is very very nice
yeah alternatively if you didn't know
how to spell Program Files you can
usually hit tab and tab will fix it to
the closest thing it can find first so
as you can see when I typed Pro to start
with for Program Files Pro and then
typed I hit the tab key had finished it
for Mia's Program Files
and added in the quotes because there's
a space in the folder name and if I hit
enter here it'll list everything inside
the Program Files folder cool we clear
the screen CLS okay that's the main
general skills and tasks that you'll
want to do on the command line if I was
to cover every command we would be here
for a very long time however I believe
that with the skills and commands you've
learned in this video the use of other
commands will be as simple as looking it
up on Google or reading its usage so for
now let's move on the next thing we'll
be looking at is using some of the
networking tools available if you have
any questions leave it in the comments
and I'll try to answer it as best as
possible don't forget to subscribe
