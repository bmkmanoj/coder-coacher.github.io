get at least one private message a week
from people asking what they should do
next so this video is for those of you
who might be wondering the same thing if
you're here and wondering where to begin
check out my intro to hacking where to
begin video ok so let's reflect in your
current progress you've learned a
programming language now I don't expect
you to be a master but if I asked you to
make a program that opened a text file
containing 1 million positive and
negative numbers and printout to screen
the average minimum and maximum you
would would be able to give it a go and
at least feel pretty confident you're at
least reading books e-books or tutorials
you have an understanding of how your
computer is talking to another computer
so IP addresses ports protocols etc and
you're comfortable enough with running
programs and building programs in the
command line and are comfortable enough
with Linux that you could use it as your
everyday machine
so there's many fields and subfields in
computer security all quite large in
scope let's have a look at a few and
remember the ones that sound interesting
to you
we have website and web application
hacking personally I believe this is one
of the most popular fields with more
businesses finding that they need to
have a website to stay in the game but
still want to stay safe there is more
jobs in website security than ever
before the web is abundant with budding
newbie website developers who forget the
security side of their core pages they
make usually leading to well-known it
exploits being left free to be exploited
by malicious people the topics you
should be well-versed in for web is HTML
CSS SQL JavaScript and PHP there's also
Ruby and Perl but they are not as
crucial topics to look into a cross-site
scripting SQL injection and remote file
inclusion there's the field of forensics
the talents and skills of finding or
recovering of digital information this
could be on phones networks and their
traffic databases or just computers
extraction of metadata from images
videos binaries messages
this could be things such as name
location device times etc topics you
should know in this field are kind of
scattered knowing how to write programs
to extract metadata is useful how to
read network traffic database logs
quickly and efficiently or writing
programs do that for you we also have a
reverse engineering so with reverse
engineering it's hard but rewarding
deconstructing how other programs are
made usually for things like the
creation of unapproved duplicates in the
form of cracked software but also for
things like bug fixing and old software
that may be abandoned by the original
developers competitor evaluation for
discovering how competitors product
compares to yours reverse engineering
can also be used for interfacing with
other programs for exploiting with your
own code knowing assembly is critical as
well as low-level programming and an
understanding of how programs execute
cryptography has two kinds of avenues to
go down one is the side of academics so
learning the ins and outs of how
algorithms work how it can be made more
secure breaking and contributing to
making a stronger security for the world
or you can go down the path of
understanding cryptography well and
fixing and implementing cryptography in
software and products that have
implemented it incorrectly or need to
implement it you want a strong
understanding of mathematics
specifically probability and
combinatorics the path of botnets and
viruses is a really highly sought after
field antivirus and security companies
love employees that understand how
viruses and botnets work and on the
Ducks other side there's a lot of money
in hiring out botnets for clients to use
for certain for a certain amount of time
not all botnets need to be illegal
viruses on the other hand can easily
fall into the illegal basket you want to
have a strip have strong skills in
low-level programming languages and
reverse engineering as well as keep up
to date on operating system exploits
social engineering is a very interesting
and so psychology have
field you can think of social
engineering as exploding humans the
skills our knowledge to get other humans
to give sensitive information either by
tricking them into believing you are
someone they know commonly used in email
spoofing or webpage phishing social
engineering can also be skills like
calling up a company pretending to be an
employee or actually visiting the
company dressed as an electrician or
maintenance man and acting like you're
meant to be there the kind of skills you
want for social engineering is
confidence the ability to lie and
learning exploits and human natural
behaviors so psychology there's also
freaking and freaking is a huge field
around hacking and modifying phones
technically today a lot of this can be
pulled into other areas as phones are
becoming more and more like computers
personally I don't know much about
freaking but the kind of skills you want
to focus on are programming
telecommunications and possibly wireless
technologies we have also have game
video game hacking normally I would
classify this under reverse engineering
however I believe it merits its own
field there's a lot of money in making
cheats and BOTS for video games I'm not
even talking about the illegal side of
making cheats and BOTS and selling them
to the public I'm talking about making
them and working with game companies to
make it harder for people to use cheats
in their games with the rise of eSports
more and more competitively and more and
more competitive video games are being
made some of these companies will pay
large amounts of money if you submit a
hack or bot for their game please but
please get permission first you want to
have reverse engineering skills strong
programming skills and understanding of
the fundamentals of how a computer runs
and program execution it's also required
that you do constant research on
anti-cheat systems reverse-engineer them
to finally we have hardware this is a
more hands-on field pulling apart
devices modifying them putting them back
together most of the skills come from
doing here you can read about how
certain products are put together but
you'll learn more by actually doing
skills in electronics will be very
helpful
knowing a low-level programming language
like C will be useful for programming
into integrated chips practice with
products such as Raspberry Pi or Adreno
okay now ask yourself a question what
area interests me the most and please
just don't say all of them if you do
have the goal up to master at them all
all the power to you but try to tackle
them one at a time at least until you're
satisfied in that area so hopefully pick
topic you're interested in now the best
thing to do is start researching that
topic go to google and type in some
generic topics for example common
website exploits or what is reverse
engineering then just follow the links
click on any akram acronyms you don't
know use the middle mouse button or hold
ctrl when you click to open the link in
a new tab after an hour or so you'll
already be aware of some of the skills
you're going to need so research them
and learn now I can't stress this enough
participate in learning if you are
watching or reading a tutorial or
lecture write out the code avoid
copy/paste when you are learning a topic
writing it out takes a little longer but
that extra time helps you remember and
grasp what you're learning modify the
code you learn play with it make it do
something more it could be as simple as
making it print out the screen with some
information
now everyone learns differently you may
be struggling to remember all of the
acronyms or how to use mode of that
module in program in our programming
language my only suggestion is to look
up a guide on learning preferably look
at a few guides or tips and where you
can where the tips seem to overlap work
with those this could be making your
flashcards setting a goal at the night
before to program when you wake up could
even be simple repetition of words to
yourself where you make copy or lunch
having a mentor or someone to look up to
to review your code or ideas is a great
way to learn and consolidate everything
that you learned while working on that
code or project and finally explore
there isn't guides or tutorials out
there for exploits or bugs that
we'll have yet to find sometimes all you
have is trial and error
okay join a community if you haven't yet
and you've been learning a programming
language you're missing out on a great
social and learning resource join a
community that you find interesting and
hopefully they have some people there
that have knowledge in the area you're
interested in help other help others who
may be not as experienced as you just
starting out maybe and learn from others
triumphs and mistakes it can be annoying
when someone beats you in a coding
challenge or is written from a faster
algorithm but ask them how they tackle
the problem most of the time they'll be
so happy with their success that they'll
share everything
also to reiterate helping others is one
of the strongest ways of learning and
consolidate called consolidating learned
skills some useful resources to check
out we have github and it's like a
social networking for open source
developers you'll learn huge amounts of
skills contributing to a project skills
that every employer would kill for
we have dream in code net a huge
programming community with programmers
with experience in almost any language
you could think of really friendly to we
have dvwa UK which stands for dam
vulnerable web application here you can
legally test your website pen testing
skills we have Metasploit unleashed this
is a course on using Metasploit it's
very in-depth and well put together
we have Vaughn have a set up of
vulnerable virtual machines that you can
legally test your skills on we have nvd
which is the national vulnerability
database which has large amounts of
known bugs and exploits and is
constantly being added to and open
security training info this site website
has a bunch of free classes on all sorts
of topics all the links to these sites
will be in the description
I really hope you got something out of
this video if you have any questions
leave it in the comment section and I'll
do my best to answer them all thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
