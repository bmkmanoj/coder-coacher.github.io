four additional looping in this video
we'll be looking at how to repeat tasks
and automate indefinitely extremely
useful for making BOTS for games or
repeating mundane tasks every video have
all slideshows anchored
available in the description let's start
with a couple of nice features that
skully X has to offer first we have
global hotkeys we can listen for a
certain hotkey press to change what our
script is doing or if our automation is
running indefinitely and we want it to
stop
so Coulee acts also provides us with a
large number of settings to modify the
behavior of school the X the main
settings you may want to use is move
mouse delay which is the time taken to
move from the current Mouse position to
the next mouse position by default this
is half a second or 0.5 observe scan
rate which is the amount of time between
each screen scan for functions like
weight
by default it checks about three times a
second and delay before Mouse down which
is the time before a mouse is clicked
after moving to a click location by
default it's half a second have you set
this value to zero it will only be
instant on the next click it will then
reset back to half a second if you want
to continue having a fast click you must
repeatedly set this to zero all right
the for loop the for loop is used to
repeat code a specific number of times
this could be a set number like 5 or all
the items in a list in these two
examples we first repeat some task 5
times and in the second example we click
each pattern in the list let's continue
with our calculator automation
environment and create a script that
adds one 5 times with a for loop we will
then modify this further in our next
example all right so let's come over to
su coolly all right so let's come over
to su coolly and we'll copy our original
calculator code we really only need to
copy these first these first three are 4
sorry
copy/paste all right so the first thing
we want to do is try setting our mouse
to later something different so we
your settings and I'll turn red with a
capital S dot move mouse delay with each
word starting with a capital we want to
make that equal to something different
so what we could do is we could set that
to zero and this means that all it'll
move instantly across the screen you
won't even see it move or you could make
it much slower so we could set it to
save one and then I'm going to take one
second to move between each place on the
screen
let's try one for our first shop
alright let's create our for loop this
time so we're going to do for step in
range open parenthesis 5 close
parenthesis : so our colon once again
indicates that we're going to go an
indent 1 so everything that's indented
is going to get repeated alright so what
we're going to do is we're going to
click plus + 1 so actually what we want
to do before this is going to click 1
before we do anything - so let's a copy
this out paste it down and change that
to click click and we want to set its
target offset to one apply ok and we can
copy this whole line here because we're
going to be using it a couple times and
paste it inside our for loop and we want
to change the target offset in this one
to the plus symbol apply ok and then on
our next line inside of our for loop
we're going to click the 1 button again
so we're going to click 1 then inside a
for loop we're going to go plus 1 plus 1
plus 1 plus 1 et cetera as many times in
our range alright so once we're done
with hitting all of those pluses we're
going to come outside of our for loop
and we're going to click the equal sign
to get up
I'll answer we'll go back to our target
offset and it's going to be equal sign
apply okay right so now we've got our
new program so we set our mountain move
mouse delay after we're about to start
our for loop so everything will move in
normal pace like before until we get to
our for loop and everything will slow
down so we can see it repeating over and
over again and actually what we can do
is we could we can move this and we'll
put at the start of our document
actually we'll leave one there and we'll
put another one at the top of our
document and we'll make it instant
actually no we'll leave it one there and
we'll make it instant once we're doing
our calculations so we'll be able to see
the mouse moving really slowly that's a
click start searches and then moves on
to the calculator to press one and then
it will move really fast going zero plus
zero
well sorry 1 plus 1 plus 1 and then
equals ok cool so let's save this this
time we'll call this one calc 3 and save
I think I just know it's about that
right all right cool so let's give it a
run so we hit run it'll move really
slowly
click start calc and I'll move really
slowly back over to the one put that and
they don't move really quickly and you
can see it's just jumping straight
between the two and it repeated 5 times
to get 6 so we press 1 the first time
then added 1 5 times and hit equals then
we got 6 cool so our four loops working
correctly
it repeated 5 times cool now let's look
at while loops the while loop is used
for repeating a block of code until a
boolean expression is false so while the
expression is true keep repeating the
code it's pretty simple commonly we use
this with the exists function as it
returns true or false
even image exists all right let's modify
our script to repeatedly add 1 for ever
and stop running the script when we
press a global hotkey all right so we'll
come back over and we'll edit our code
we've been writing
and we will remove our mouse move mouse
delay we'll just leave it as the default
of 0.5 and we need to set up our global
hotkey so to do this we're going to keep
everything we got here but we're going
to nudge it down a bit a top of our file
we're going to create a boolean variable
called running so it's called running
and it's going to equal true with a
capital T so yes our program is running
all right now we're going to define a
function so we're starting to get a
little bit more into the advanced
programming here but essentially it's we
use the DEF keyword to define a function
which is a block of code that we want to
run and we'll call it run hotkey and
inside there we're going to pass in the
event and this is what is passed in by
our how hot key binding so you can use
it if you wish but we're not going to be
using the event variable okay so inside
of our function we're going to grab our
global put global variable running and
we're going to set running to equal
false with a capital F so this is when
this code runs we're going to stop the
program and the reason we need this is
for our next line to outside of our
function we're going to use env for
environment which will turn red dot add
in lowercase
capital H for hot key open parenthesis
and the key we're going to listen for
which can be anything you like but I'm
going to use key f1 to the f1 key comma
and our key modifier is going to be the
control key so we're going to have to
hold ctrl and then press f1 so key
modifier OOP
modifier to turn red as well dot control
ctrl in capitals comma and then we're
going to run the function run hotkey and
we can close off our parentheses all
right
so whenever we press that that hotkey f1
control f1 it will do our run hotkey
function which will tell running to be
false all right now that we've set up
our hotkey we can come down to our loop
so we're going to leave everything else
as it is we're going to click start open
up the calculator and what we'll do is
let's remove this one originally so it
doesn't actually click one to start with
and instead of four what we're going to
do is going to have our while so we can
remove this 4 here and instead we're
going to have while in lower case exists
so we're going to use the exists
function and while exists and our
calculator so copy our calculator from
up here copy
oops I think I undid that while exists
our calculator and running so while our
calculator is on-screen so while our
calculator is on-screen and we're
currently running so our running is
still true we're going to keep adding
alright so that's really all we need to
change because our while loop is
repeating just like our for loop is by
adding one and referred our hotkey set
up to tell running to stop being true
which using the end keyword it will
cancel out because this still exists but
our running doesn't so they're both not
true and it will exit out our program
and add it all up for us ok so let's
save
and give it a shot so we can hit will
close our calculator because that might
cause some issues hit run start calc is
up one plus one plus one and it will
keep going indefinitely you sit here and
watch it as long as we like we'll keep
adding let's go on past five and it
keeps going on forever and then we can
hold our ctrl key press f1 and it
cancels our loop and it hits the equal
button and we get ten cool
so all work successfully okay just some
final notes to keep in mind and watch
out for make sure your loop has a way to
stop getting stuck in an infinite loop
with Saku lee can be painful as it has
control over your mouse and sometimes
your keyboard try to avoid it with
things like a hotkey like in our example
or using the exists function on a window
that can be all afford to be closed also
if there's lots of visuals changing
remember to use the weight or exists to
be certain the thing you want to click
is actually visible okay that's it for
this video we can now repeat tasks and
use global hotkeys in the next video
we'll be putting everything we've learnt
together to create a simple automation
script that will play the free clicker
game clicker heroes if you have any
questions leave it in the comments and
I'll try to answer it as best as
possible don't forget to subscribe
