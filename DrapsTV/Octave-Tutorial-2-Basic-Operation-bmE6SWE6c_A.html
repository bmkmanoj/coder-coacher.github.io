two basic operation in this video we'll
be looking at basic operations octave
has to offer every video of all slide
shows and code available in the
description octave implements all of the
standard arithmetic operators addition
subtraction multiplication division and
exponent and it also has element by
element equivalents which are all
preceded with a dot we will have a look
at this later but for now let's look at
the basic arithmetic okay so let's come
over to octave and remember we can set
our our prompt string 1 to equal a arrow
arrow space close quotes okay so now
that we've changed our prompt we can
start doing some basic arithmetic so
we've got 5 plus 5 and we get the answer
is 10 we can also do things like 10
minus 5 the answer is 5 and we can do
things like 1/2 so there's a forward
slash and then e equals 0 0.5 we can
also do things like 5 times 5 and we at
25 and we can also do things like 2 to
the power of 8 so that's the little up
caret so we get 256 and we can also use
named variables like pi of main named
constants so PI so 3.1416 okay cool so
jump back to the slide shape now we can
also use variables in octave and if
you're asking what is a variable a
variable just stores and holds the value
for later use if you've done programming
in any other language before this will
be very simple to grasp we choose a
variable name like a capital A and we
assign a value of 5 to it octave will
automatically decide what type of
variable to store the value as
on-the-fly let's look at setting some
variables and look at what values they
hold okay so come back to octave now in
octave we can set strings so let's
create a variable called text and make
it equal
strings are open quotes hello world that
will quote quotes and now we can see
that text is equal to the value of hello
world so if we type text again it'll
print out hello world okay now we can
also do things like the letter A is
equal to the value five and as you can
least now see a is set to five now we
can also do things like B is equal to
four and we can put a semicolon on the
end and what that does is it executes
the command in the background so we
don't have to see the output so if it
enter you can see that it doesn't print
out B equals four but it still did set
it in the background okay now we can
also do things like C equals a times B
so we're timesing our over the value in
our a variable times the value in our B
variable and as we can see we get 20
because 5 times 4 is 20 okay so let's
come back to the slide show octave also
handles vectors natively a vector is a
list of values these can be arranged in
row or column we can create a row vector
by using the square brackets and
specifying the values we want in it with
spaces in between you can also separate
them with commas if you like it's
optional we can also create column
vectors by using the square brackets
again but this time we separate each
value with a semicolon
this is easier to visualize in octave so
let's give it a try so let's create a
row vector so R equals and then we open
up our square brackets and then we can
do 1 space 2 space 3 space 4 and then we
hit the close square brackets and as you
can see R equals 1 2 3 4 now of course
our screen is kind of gotten full let's
use the clear command
so that's CLC so command line clear and
it clears our screen
so we can see that we're still working
with our we'll just type our again and
print it out so we can see R equals 1 2
3 4 now let's create a column
so see four column equals open square
brackets again but we do one semicolon
space two semicolon space three
semicolon space for but we don't need a
semicolon on the very end and then we
close it with a square bracket now when
you hit Enter we'll see it's arranged in
a column rather than a row okay so we
can also create matrices just as simply
as we created vectors we just simply
combine our rows and columns to achieve
a matrix you can think of the semicolon
as the end of a row or to go down to the
next row let's look at making some of
met some matrices we'll have a look at
the element by element operators now as
well okay so if we come back across to
octave let's create our first matrix so
we'll call it m so your M for matrix
equals and then we'll do open square
brackets 1 space 2 so our first row is
going to be 1 and 2 semicolon so down to
the next row and we'll do 3 and 4 close
square brackets so now we have a matrix
which is 1 2 and then 3 4 in the next
row now we can do element by element
operate it operations so let's do m dot
times M now we'll get out 1 4 9 and 16
now this is because it's 1 times 1 so
the first element in the first row is 1
so 1 times 1 is 1 then we go across to
the next element which is 2 and then 2
times itself is 2 and then we go across
to the I will go down to the next row
which is 3 and then we do 3 times 3 is 9
and then across to the 4 and then 4
times 4 is 16 so you can see during it
element by element so we can also do
this for every other type of arithmetic
so m dot plus M equals to 4 6 and 8 as
you can see it's just doubling pretty
much all the values
and we can also do minus m and we get
zero because it's my nursing from itself
m dot divided by M and we get one
problem because obviously the number
divided by itself is one and then you
can do m dot to the power of M and as
you can see it goes through and does
each of the powers ok so that's all of
the element by element arithmetic so
we'll do our clear screen is it gets
there our clear screen so CLL see and
we'll come back to the slide show
okay so octave also has some special
special match matrix may matrices okay
so these inbuilt functions are used to
generate a useful or common matrices so
we have the ones function which takes n
and M so it generates a matrix n times n
of ones and we have zeros which does
same thing as ones except it's with
zeros we have I so we have I N or I n M
which generates an identity matrix so
that's a matrix with a diagonal of ones
and we have R and and M which generates
an N times M matrix of uniformly random
matrix power elements and we have R and
n which is generates an N times M matrix
of normally distributed random and
random elements with a standard
deviation of one okay so let's have a
look at each of these in octave so we
can get a better understanding what they
look like so come across the octave now
we can do the ones function so once and
we'll do a three by three of the ones so
three by three and as you can see it
generates a three by three matrix of all
ones and we can do the same thing for
zero so zero is three by three
and we get a three-by-three of all
zeroes and now we can also do the eye
function for identity matrix and we will
do a 4x4 so you only have to put in a 4
for this you can do 4 by 4 if you like
but it's just easy enough to just do one
argument of 4 and we get a diagonal
matrix which is all the ones on a
diagonal from the first element to the
last element we can also use the random
function so ran Rand and then inside
here we can do say we want to have one
row and 5 columns and as we can see we
get 5 random values between 0 1 0 and 1
and we can also use the round n function
so we'll do round and between 1 and 10
and as you can see we get the values
that are all pretty close to the 0 mark
ok so we'll jump back to these slides
now I dedicated a slide to the colon
operator because it's very useful we can
use the colon operator to find a set of
values firstly we can create a set range
with the number to start at and the
number to finish at so 1 colon 5 will
give us a vector of 1 to 5 we can also
specify the increment amount between the
range so for example 2 colon 2 colon 10
will increment from 2 by 2 every step
until we reach 10 which is included so
we would have a vector of 2 4 6 8 and 10
so let's give it a try we'll come over
octave now we'll do our clear screen so
we can do say a variable s make that
equal to 1 colon 5 and as you can see we
get a vector of 1 2 5
and Ricky let's chain
get up and we'll make it do the
increment example so s equals 2 : 2 :
again and then 10 so this will go from 2
to 10 incrementing by 2 so we get 2 4 6
8 and 10 ok so that that's how we can
create ordered lists of values if we
know the end and start ok now we get
there now that we know how to create
vectors and matrices how do we access
the elements we can use common circle
brackets imagine we have a matrix 1 2 3
4 we can access the first element by
specifying its location in the matrix a
in X&amp;amp;Y coordinates so s 1 1 will get us
the first element in the first row it's
worth mentioning that vectors in octave
start at 1 and go up rather than
starting at 0 we could also access the
first whole row as a vector by
specifying s 1 comma open square
brackets 1 2 close square brackets
closed circle brackets so we want Row 1
and we want the columns 1 and 2 this
will return a vector 1 2 there are
several ways we can access the first row
the colon operator again comes into play
as we can use it to substitute for all
so let's jump in and have a look at how
to access the data in our matrices and
vectors so over an octave let's just set
our s that variable so s equals open
square brackets 1 space 2 colon 3 space
for close square brackets so we got an S
variable within matrix 1 2 3 4 ok so we
can access the first element in the
matrix so s open circle bracket 1 comma
1 and that will get us the answer 1
because that's what's in the first the
first element in the first row
okay so let's grab the whole first row
just yet the whole first row this time
so simulator before but we're going to
have our open square brackets 1 comma 2
close square brackets and this will
return us the 1 2 which is the first row
of our matrix s now we can also use s
open circle brackets 1 again and we can
use 1 : 2 and that'll be the same thing
as what we just did so it will get us
the first row or alternatively what we
can do is we can do s open brackets 1
comma just the colon operator and
that'll get us the 1 2 as well because
the colon operator can be substituted
for representing everything in that
column or row okay okay some extra
things to take note of is that there are
a lot of inbuilt functions octave even
comes with string formatting function S
print F so for example printing out PI
to 8 decimal places
a lot of standard functions you find in
other libraries are most likely
implemented here in octave such as
ceiling that rounds up to the nearest
whole number
floor rounds down to the nearest whole
number
round which rounds to the nearest whole
number
and max which is the highest value in a
vector or min which is the lowest value
in a vector okay one last thing before I
won this video up is the help command
this command will display the help nodes
for any function that octave contains
all you need to do is type in help then
the function name and it will let you
know what it does and how to use it for
any other information the octave Docs
and wiki are well maintained and very
detailed
I'll have this link for you in the for
the docs in the description this
concludes that this concludes our look
at the basic operations of octave feel
free to leave any questions in the
comments and I'll do my best to answer
them next we're going to look at loading
and using data in octave
