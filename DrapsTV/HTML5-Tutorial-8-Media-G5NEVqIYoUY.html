this video we'll be looking how to put
different kinds of media into our
website and start bringing the webpages
to life every video all slideshows
anchored available in the description
html5 supports many forms of media and
external content we have video we can
also use audio for sound effects and
music we can also embed objects like
flash players Java applets or PDF
viewers as well as the more convenient
support for embedding YouTube videos
into our pages will see the placing
media in our webpages is super easy in
html5 the video tag the video tag comes
with two parts first we have the actual
video tag we can set the width and
height that we want the video to appear
as on our web page and we also have some
attributes that we can set unlike some
of our other tags the attributes for
media only need to be present they do
not need to be set to a value the second
part of our video tag is the source tag
the source tag must be between the
opening and closing video tags with the
source tag we can set the whereabouts
the video is located and what format is
it is in the good thing is is we can
have multiple source tags if the HTML
cannot find the first source it was on
or it was unable to load the next source
tag will be tried and so on so forth we
can also put text between our video tags
to show up when the web browser does not
support the video tag in the example we
have a video tag that has controls and
order play turned on this means the
video will start playing after the page
loads and when you move the mouse over
the video play pause and volume controls
will become visible just like with
images the browser does not know the
size of the video so it's good to set
the width and height attributes just to
avoid flickering onload it's important
to understand that only a few video
formats are supported by the html5 video
tag this is because they are stream
friendly and relatively small file sizes
the most common video format and one
that I recommend is the mp4 format it's
becoming very popular and is the format
used by YouTube next we have OGG or OGG
there's a format that isn't used much
for video but is used a fair amount for
audio files next we have the final
supported via
format which is the web M format which
is developed by a combined effort of
Mozilla opera Adobe and Google the WebM
format is gaining popularity and may
even take over mp4 format at some point
okay so now that we've looked at the
video tag and the supported formats
let's have a go at putting a video into
our first web web page so let's add a
media section and place the video in it
if we don't have a video to use that's
mp4 or WebM then there'll be a four
megabyte mp4 file in the slides and
Kurds folder in the description all
right so let's go over to our website
folder and I've got this media folder
that I've created which inside I have an
mp3 and a mp4 video which are called
video mp4 so let's open up in the index
and edit with notepad plus plus now
we'll scroll down to the bottom after
our frames and we'll create another
section for media so the h2 and we'll do
media we'll close off our h2 and then
we'll do a paragraph and we'll do video
so this is gonna be our little video
section okay underneath a paragraph
we're gonna use the video tag and we'll
set the width to equal 600 and we'll set
the height to equal three three eight so
338 and we'll give the attribute
controls so we can control the video
let's close off the opening tag now
we'll do our closing tag so slash video
and we've got our video tag now inside
we're going to do our source tag so the
source and we'll do SOC for the source
attribute and the source we're going to
have is gonna be in the media folder
/and so the vid dot mp4 video closed
words now we got to specify what format
it is so we use the type attribute and
it's in
video /m P for close chords and we can
do our self closing tag on the end of
this sauce now we can also write a
little message here to say your browser
does not support video tags and this
will show up if your browser does not
support video tags all right so we've
created our video let's have a look at
what it looks like so come over and
we'll open up our index and I'll load up
our first page and we scroll down we get
our media so it's embedded it's got a
big play button and we can see we've got
volume controls and we can make it
fullscreen etc and we hit play it'll
start playing so I'll just go killed
what killed was to video here it's just
been shortened and yeah so we've got a
video that works and cool we've got our
video paragraph as well too let's come
back to our slide show next we have the
audio tag and truth be told the audio
tag is almost identical to the video tag
however we don't have to set a width and
height the main difference we will face
is when setting up the source tag inside
the audio tags when we set the type of
source we must make it an audio format
in the example we have an audio clip
called chyme dot mp3 which is which is
of the MPEG format it has play pause and
volume controls enabled once again if
the browser does not support the audio
tag that will get the message we have
written between the audio tags okay just
like the video tag we can only use a few
audio formats in the audio tag so we can
use the mp3 audio files as it's the most
popular format for music players and
music on the web it would be very silly
if we couldn't use it on webpages we can
also use the web format which is a very
old raw audio format and we can also use
the OGG OGG audio files all right so
let's add an audio file to our media
section of our first page if you don't
have an mp3 file a
we'll be available in the slides
encouraged folder in the description all
right so let's jump back over to our
code so just underneath our video we're
going to add another we'll do a line
break actually so we'll do yeah stuff
close and then we'll do another
paragraph and we'll specify this is the
audio audio section alright so let's do
the audio tag and because we don't need
to set up any width and height we can
just put a space and we can type
controls and we can close off the
opening tag now we'll do the matching
closing audio tag and inside about audio
tags we're going to do the source so we
do source and then we do SRC equals and
then the location of the file so it's in
the media media folder forward slash and
it's the chyme dot mp3 that we looked at
before all right and now we're gonna set
the type so the type is a audio format
this time forward slash mpeg-4 the mp3
format alright now we can do our forward
slash and do a self closing tag right so
that's our audio embedded let's have a
look at what it looks like so I'll come
back over to our first page and we'll
give it a refresh and you can see we
have the audio player now which looks
very similar to the video player however
it's just for audio so it doesn't
require a video and we can press play
and that'll play the sound so it's a
quick chime I don't think I put audio
coming through in the videos from my
computer
it's just peeling my voice all right so
we'll come back to the slideshow so now
we have the object and embed tags
they're almost identical in function
however they allow us to embed plugins
and other self
contain objects into our webpages the
object tag uses data uses a data
attribute and has more types and subtags
whereas the embed tag is a standalone
self closes and uses a source attribute
and just like most media and websites
it's good to specify the height and
width the kind of things that we use the
object and embed tags for is Java
applets PDF readers flash players HTML
files image files as well as YouTube
videos
alright let's quickly look at some
examples and we'll move on to using the
embed tags to put YouTube videos into
our web page ok so here in our first
example we have a flash file this will
load the flash file into a 100 by 70 box
and we use the file my Flash SWF in the
second example we have an object of HTML
code that we want to embed into the web
page which will load the HTML code into
that part of the web page and run it
alright finally we have the example of
the way you meant to put a Java applet
into a web page in html5 we tell the
browser that the object is a Java applet
and we want to specify the height and
width we then set the parameter tags up
for the card and we set the value to a
Java class in the folder and we can
finally tell the user that they don't
have Java installed if it fails to load
ok now on to the easy and fun part let's
embed YouTube videos into our website to
embed a YouTube video you can either
copy and the embed code straight from
the YouTube underneath the video you
want to share B to embed a YouTube video
you can either copy the embed code
straight from under a YouTube video
under the share and embed tab which
would look very similar to the top
example here or we can write the embed
ourselves in the second example we use
the embed tags we set the width and
height and the source for the video the
YouTube URL is modified to be an embed
URL which is denoted by the youtube.com
4 /v /i d you can get this by hand by
replacing parts of the URL shown in red
here with forward slashes
alright let's put a YouTube video into
our first page I'm going to use the HTML
number one video alright so we're going
to come over to our code and we'll
create another section so we'll do
another line break and P and we'll call
it I'll call it YouTube alright close
off our P tag and now we're going to use
the embed tag so embed and we'll set the
width to equal 600 and we'll do the
height can equal three three eight and
we'll set the source attribute to equal
the YouTube URL so I've got copied here
but you'll probably have to copy your
own link in here so as you can see it's
the huge YouTube URL and we've got the
embed setup which is the /v forward
slash and then the video ID and then I'm
gonna self close this tag as M / embed
tags don't need a second closing tag
alright cool so I'll just go down online
and we'll save this and let's jump over
and see what it looks like
so we'll come back to our first page
we'll give it a refresh and we'll go to
the YouTube section and as you can see
we've got the html5 number one and it's
got the YouTube player so when you click
on it we've got the YouTube player
familiar YouTube player and we can full
screen we can actually go to youtube to
watch it or we can play pause etc cool
this concludes our tutorial on media as
well as the main part of the html5
tutorial any extra videos in this series
will be looking at html5 specifics or
implementations we have any questions
leave it in the comments and I'll try to
answer it as best as possible in the
next video we're looking at putting it
all together to build a basic website
