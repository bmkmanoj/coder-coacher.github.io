date and math objects in this video
we'll be learning about using and
manipulating dates with JavaScript as
well as looking at summer Java scripts
more complex math functions a large man
of this video will be looking at
specific functions and what they do
every video of all slideshows and code
available in the description JavaScript
has some objects that can be used
anywhere called persistent objects they
provide useful functions and tools that
are commonly used in programming for
example the math object can be accessed
at any time and holds common math
functions and math constants here we
grab the value of pi up to 15 decimal
points so you don't have to remember it
the first three useful functions were
going to look at are for rounding
decimal numbers the co function will
round the number upwards towards the
ceiling while the floor function will
round the number down towards the floor
the actual round function will round to
the nearest whole if the value is
exactly half it will be rounded up next
we have the trigonometry functions you
may never need to use them but it's nice
to know they're there they are pretty
self-explanatory with what they do just
keep in mind that when you're dealing
with them that the values are all in
radians random can be a super useful
function when you need it returning a
random value between 0 and 1 which you
can then multiply to increase the range
of the number another two useful
functions to keep in mind are the square
root function and the power function
finally if you're doing any serious math
in your code it's likely that you'll use
one of these constants pi if you're
doing anything with circles e also known
as Euler's number used as a base for
logarithmic functions then we have the
square root of 1/2 this is a pre
calculated value of zero point seven or
seven 106 seven as it's quite slow for
the square root function to calculate it
so the constant is there for easy use
okay let's build a simple game to test a
few of the maths functions we'll build a
guess the number game and have the
computer pick a random number between 1
and 100 and then we'll have to guess it
let's call it guess HTML all right so
I'm just going to open up the
add file that we made previously and
we're going to modify that so I'll save
that as and we'll call it guest HTML all
right so I'm going to strip everything
out of it outside of our function get
rid of our people variable to start
there and we're going to have our input
as our guests and the ID we'll call it
yes and then our button on click it's
going to try and we don't need this name
section just remove that out all right
so I'm going to first create my function
so my function is going to be call it
check guest check guess and I'll copy
and put that inside my on click alright
so just before my function on the line
before I'm going to create a variable
we're just gonna hold the hidden number
so call it hidden num and it's gonna
equal math dot floor so we're going to
round down the result of math book math
dot random that will return a value
between 0 &amp;amp; 1 in decimal and I'm going
to multiply that by a hundred so that
way it's between 0 and 99 and that's
gonna be flawed down so it's 0 to 99 and
then I'm going to add 1 to it so it's
between 1 to 100 all right so now that
I've got a hidden number what I'm gonna
need to do is gonna check whether that
is what my guess is equal to so let's
get the guest serve our guess is equal
to document dot get element by ID and
we're going to get the value of the
guests element dot value all right so
gotten the guests now I'm going to
create a variable for out you're just
going to be will be output back to the
user when they try guessing all right so
now I need to check whether the guests
equal to I had number so if
guess is equal to the hidden num and
we're going to count equals correct
exclamation mark else if so if it's not
equal to s is greater than hidden num
then we're going to set out to equal to
hi page
- hi else so if it's not too high and
it's not equal to then it's going to be
too low so out equals too low all right
so now that we've gotten what our output
is going to be we can give it back to
our user so document dot get element by
ID and we want to get the output
variable or the output ID which is our
paragraph we're going to set the inner
HTML to equal out all right so that's
our function written and we'll just add
a paragraph tag above our guests handle
to try to guess the number between 1 and
100 and then we'll close up our
paragraph tag all right cool
so let's save that and we'll give that a
shot so I'll drag that into our web
browser and we get try to guess the
number between 1 and 100 so logically
I'll start with 50 try it's too low
let's try 75 that's still too low let's
try 90 it's too high all right so let's
go hey tea still fillers try 85 too high
maybe 83
- hi still 8080 - correct awesome got
the right number however I wanted to
give it another shot I can just repress
the page and will regenerate any number
we try we see it's no longer 82 try 50
anyway we'll move on from here awesome
I highly recommend that you try adding
on to this game maybe keep track of how
many times the player guesses or perhaps
build a tool to guess it for you in the
most efficient way possible
alright now on to the super useful date
persistent object websites often have to
deal with or manage dates when a post
was made when a user last logged in how
long until event starts etc
understanding that the date object
exists will add when you inevitably have
to deal with dates there is tools for
handling time zones or manipulating or
comparing dates in the example here we
have how to get the current date and
time and how to get the date and time
object of a certain day generally we
want to create an object to hold a date
at a certain time here we have three
different ways of creating a new date
object milliseconds a date string or
with specific values once we have a date
object we can start interacting with it
now that we have a separate date object
we can get any of the values out that we
need from that specific time well all of
these have get before them there is also
a set version if you want to tweak the
date more if you wanted to get the
elapsed time between one date and now
you could - the dates from each other
and you'll be left with the difference
between the dates which could be then
used to calculon something took how long
ago a post was made etc there are many
more functions available so I'll leave a
link in the description alright let's
try using the date object now let's
build a small script that lets us time
how long our JavaScript function takes
this is quite useful if you notice that
one of your functions is running slow
because that computers are quite fast
we'll purposely make a slow function
just so we can see our timer working
let's call it time at HTML all right so
I'm going to grab patter possibly our
some movies out of the template file
save as we're gonna call it time it time
it put HTML all right so I'm gonna
remove everything outside of this
function or inside this function rather
and move that down a bit and why don't
you do is I'm gonna move our paragraph
up above because I want to run this all
in one script so that way it does exist
before I try and put values into it
right so now when I remove these the
rest of our HTML alright so inside of
our script the first thing I want to do
is make sure I set up my function so I'm
gonna call it run loops and I'll pass in
value n so that's gonna be how many
times the loop runs and then inside I'm
going to do for VAR i equals 0 I is less
than 10 and an i plus plus alright
and then inside my for I'm just going to
console dot log because I know that this
function will take a little while to run
and then I'm going to do i dot to string
to string and that'll turn that into a
string and output it alright so I know
that run loops function is going to take
a little bit to resolve now I'm going to
do a var start time and that's going to
equal date dot now so the exact moment
that this function runs what is the
current date and time and then I'm going
to run loops so I'm going to run the
function and I just run a 140 141 loops
just go now I know that should take
roughly 80 milliseconds maybe longer
while I'm recording and let's do var end
time and that's going to equal date dot
now
again except this time it will be when
this date function runs so theoretically
it should be a couple of hundred
milliseconds after the original one
alright so now that we have both of the
different times when you create a file
output and this is going to equal and
we'll do the time taken plus a string of
end time minus the start time so I'll
get the difference between the two plus
and then space milliseconds alright and
now we're going to document dot get
element by ID and we're going to grab
output and we're going to set the inner
HTML to equal output all right so now
that we've written out a little time it
so it'll run 141 loops and output each
one of those to the console and then
we'll get the two different times and
it'll pop up on screen so I've saved
that let's drag time it into our browser
and time trip was eight milliseconds
that was super quick so if I up inspect
element I go to our console here got all
of the numbers output and if we were to
run it again with our console open you
notice that it took it took actually
quite much more time because our web
browser had to update it inside of our
console yeah we've got all of our
numbers output awesome so we've just
timed it and we've got different times
we run it again do we get a different
time at 48 milliseconds so we can see
that on average now our function is
taking around about 49 milliseconds to
complete with the console type and if we
close it we'll get a different result
nine milliseconds 10 milliseconds so
around
awesome this concludes our look at date
and math in JavaScript the tutorials
will be getting a bit more advanced from
here on next we'll be looking at storing
data between pages and sessions using
cookies and local storage if you have
any questions leave it in the comments
and I'll try to answer it as best as
possible don't forget to subscribe
