every video have all slideshows encode
available in the description what are
modules well modules are collections of
code written by other people this is
what makes Python so great there are
thousands of modules out there and you
can download them and use them - also
comes with a standard library of modules
which can be found at this link here
they contain the most popular sets of
tools things for interaction with an
operating system interaction with the
network math and many more in this
tutorial we'll be looking at importing
the math module and using some of its
functions to import a module we use
syntax import space and in the module
name we'll be using the math module so
we use import math make sure that you
import everything you need at the top of
your code file so let's create a file
called root 9 pi our program is going to
use the function f abs from the math
library this function will turn
negatives into positives by dropping the
negative sign okay so let's start coding
let's create a file so let's open these
- 9 dot P and now let's import math so
import math and we'll define our main
function
def main tap in will create a try
because we only get getting some user
input tap in twice and we'll create a
variable called number and make it equal
to a flirt of raw underscore input
please enter a number and now we're
going to use number so number equal to
mass dot fabs open bracket number so
we're gonna pass number into
and that's gonna get rid of any negative
signs if they're there and now let's
print out number print number now let's
write our accept so we'll go back one
indentation accept colon print the
quotes you did not enter a number and
now let's write out if so if underscore
underscore name underscore underscore is
equal to open quotes underscore
underscore main underscore underscore
close quotes : run man okay so now we've
got our program let's save it and now
let's run it so python 29.5 please enter
a number so let's into something like 5
notice we get 5 is the output that works
correctly let's try running again what's
putting in something like negative 4 and
we get positive 4 out so as you see it's
dropped the negative sign and giving us
positive 4 and if we run it one more
time and we put in something like an F
it's not a number we'll get you did not
enter a number dot so out our try
captures our try except has caught that
ok so this is good for things that can
result in negatives however if you want
a positive then we use it for example
the difference between two values may
have something like what's the
difference between 7 &amp;amp; 5 so minus 7 from
5 and get negative 2 with absolute it
will always be positive so the output
would be 2 rather than negative 2 now
let's use math dot pie a pie is a
mathematical constant and that means it
can't be changed the math dot pie
constant holds a pie to a certain
precision precision so let's make a
program that calculates the area of
to get the area of the circle we use the
formula pi times radius squared so let's
edit our program to calculate the area
of a circle given a radius entered by
the user so we use the formula area
equals pi times radius squared and this
formula in Python is math dot pi times
radius x times 2 and x times means ^ ok
so let's edit our program into PI and pi
was my mistake so 2 9 pi now let's edit
this and we'll change number to radius
our variable number two radius and we'll
change the prompt bra input to please
enter a radius now let's change our
second variable nut oil other use of
number and make it area and we're going
to be using the pop icon's and so we use
math dot pi times radius times times 2
and then we print out our area and we
can save and run this so we save and now
let's run this and it says please enter
of radius so let's enter a radius of 5
and we get seventy eight point five
three nine now let's check if that's
right
open up calculator here and we get pi
times open bracket five squared close
bracket and we get seventy eight point
five three nine so yep how programs
running correctly so we've just created
a program that can calculate the area of
a circle when we give it a radius you
can find all of the functions in the
math module at this link here as they
will be in the
scription this this concludes our look
at modules and our beginner series in
python don't fear you don't remember all
of this you can easily come back and
re-watch any of the videos to
consolidate all the information remember
practice makes perfect if you feel that
you understand most of the coding that
has been done in these tutorials then
you should be able to follow along and
learn in my other tutorials if you have
any questions and you can't find the
answer after a quick Google search feel
free to leave them in the comments
thanks for watching and I hope you
enjoyed this beginner series subscribe
