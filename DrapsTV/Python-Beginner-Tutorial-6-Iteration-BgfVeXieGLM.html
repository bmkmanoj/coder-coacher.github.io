every video will have all slideshows and
code available in the description
iteration is part of the third concept
of programming which is repetition
repetition is the process of repeating
it blocks of code this could be a
defined amount or until a certain
condition is met Python has two main
ways of repeating code the for loop and
the while loop the for loop is used to
iterate over a known number of times
which in python is a list so if we want
to iterate over a specified number of
times
eg 10 we use the range function and we
enter enter the number and that will
create a list of range numbers so let's
look at how the for loop can be used
first let us create a for loop to print
out hello five times let's create a new
route 6 stop I file
okay so m26 --by okay now let's define
our main function which we learnt in the
last tutorial to keep our code nice and
neat
so deaths may brackets : let me tap in
now to create a for loop we use some
syntax so we use the keyword for then a
value to indicate how far through the
loop we also - so far so an index the
color I in and then we can either put a
list here or we can use the range
function so the range function we use
range open bracket 5 will generate a
list and then we use a colon to specify
that this for loop is continuing and
then we indent twice so we indented once
from the for loop and then we print
hello now exit out of a point
our main function and we start the
program so we do if I'm just go
underscore name underscore underscore
it's equal to open quotes underscore
underscore main underscore underscore
close quotes : we execute main so we
call our main function
so this is rather simple and elegant
let's save it and now let's check it out
so if we run this pull ups and the wrong
thing if we run sheet 6 hi we get hello
five times so already you can see this
is quite useful and saves us some time
writing the same thing over and over so
let's edit our file and we'll create a
list of words and we'll print that that
lists using a for loop okay so what
we'll do is we'll add this to our
current program so we open up and edit
our program
so in our main let's jump down to the
one indentation from the four so we're
indented once from the very left and
we'll create a list so let's call it
words words is equal to a list so here
we open with square brackets and we
enter in our strings so let's do a cat
that and we separate each item in the
list with a colon hats
rat and sat and we closed our list with
a square bracket and now to use our
words this let's do in tenth one again
and then let's for for word in words so
for each word in the words list we colon
to continue and then we indent twice
let's print out word
so let's print out the word now we can
save and quit and now let's run that
program and as you see we get the hello
five times and then we get our list of
words that we made print it out using
just the one print function because it
repeats that print function five times
and there's a different word in the list
further five different indices
easy-peasy now let's look at the while
loop the while loop repeats a block of
code until a boolean expression is false
so let's create a while loop that asks
the user to input a value greater than
zero if they don't let's ask them again
editing our existing program let's add
our while so once a positive integer is
input we'll exit okay so let's edit our
program and we'll add our whale to the
end of our previous functions so in main
one indent in we will create our whale
so let's create a num and we'll make it
equal to zero to start with now let's do
a wild open brackets
you don't require the oven brackets but
they it's easier if you put them there
num is less than or equal to zero
num is less than equal to zero :
tab in twice num equals int open
brackets raw underscore input open
brackets please and a positive positive
integer now now let's try running our
program so save and quit quit quit and
then run it and then it will ask us to
enter a positive integer so into
something like negative 5 it'll ask us
again if we enter something like zero
it'll ask us again 6 it will all allow
it and we'll continue so yeah so a while
is useful here because we don't know how
many times the user will input the wrong
thing if we want we can make a while
loop go forever until it's interrupted
by the keyboard with with a shortcut
ctrl C so let's make one for fun this is
called an infinite loop so it never ends
until the program is interrupted so
because a while loop runs until it's
false if we make it while true meaning
it can never ever be false it will keep
going on forever let's edit our root 6
and we'll make the while print out hello
in an infinite amount of times okay so
we edit our file what we'll do is we'll
get rid of
inside here I really all and we're
scared out a while so he is while true
capital T on the true well true print
open quotes hello
close quotes now let's run this and
we'll see what we get but yeah let's run
it as you can see I got my console here
spamming hello so I try and scroll up
just there we go much of it spamming
down there
so to interrupt this we use control-c
and it will inform us that we have
interrupted my keyboard interrupt and
that's an infinite loop you want to try
and avoid these because obviously people
aren't all gonna know how to interrupt a
program and yeah so this concludes our
look at iteration in Python don't fear
if you don't remember all of this you
can easily come back and re-watch this
video to consolidate all the information
if you have any questions and you can't
find the answer after a quick Google
search feel free to leave it in the
comments next we'll be covering file i/o
