one introduction and setup in this video
we look at what octave is why we use and
how to get it installed and working
every video will have all slideshows and
code available in the description this
series of tutorials is aimed to get you
up and running and comfortable with
octave the topics covered are basic
operation loading saving and using data
plotting data control operations
functions and code files after finishing
this series you should feel confident in
implementing algorithms in octave okay
what is octave octave is a high level
interpretive language but with numerical
computations in mind octave also comes
with its own set of functions for
plotting data with a graphical
representation
octave is used as a prototyping tool to
find solutions for implementing them
into another programming language now
why should we use octave octave makes it
incredibly fast to implement ideas from
many fields of math and big data
analysis octave is free compared to its
opposition MATLAB which is great because
MATLAB is very similar however very
expensive octave also comes with inbuilt
functions ready to plot graphs right out
of the box let's get on to installing
octave I like to use octave on my
Windows machine however there is an IO
there is an OSX and Linux versions
available you have to go to the octave
website shown here I'll put a link in
the description or you can google octave
and it should be the first result when
installing on Windows I like to use the
mingw 32 version as I find it's nice and
easy to install the download page will
take you right to a wiki and you can
click the link under the windows section
in this wiki you'll need to look for the
octave 3.2 point X for Windows mingw 32
here we can just download the Installer
and it will set up everything we require
there's also instructions if you get
stuck if you add if you have Visual
Studio you may want to follow the
instructions to install the visual
studio version for OSX it's rather
simple and there is a step-by-step
instructions for the binary installer as
well as other package managers like home
on Linux a simple apt-get for most
distributions but some you may need to
compile from source okay let's test out
octave just to check that it's working
we'll start it up and we'll set a custom
prompt okay so I'll come over to octave
and as you can see we've got all of our
information on octave its current
version and it's just just just like a
command line now we can set a custom
prompt because at the moment it just has
octave - three point two point four
point Exe and then the line number but
we can set ourself a custom prompt by
using ps1 so prompt string one and then
this just takes a string of the prompt
we want so open quotes and we'll just
use a double arrow and a space and then
we'll close the our codes and then close
our brackets off and when we hit enter
it'll change our prompt to a double
arrow and now we can see it we have a
prompt which is double arrows so octave
is work up and running and working and
we can enter in commands and it works
okay so come back to the slide show now
now that we have octave installed we can
start earning how to use it feel free to
leave any questions in the comments and
I'll do my best to answer them next
we're going to look at the basic
operation of octave thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
