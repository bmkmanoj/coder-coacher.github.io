setup this figure is more of an
introduction to the beginner tutorials
I'll keep it as short as possible every
video and we'll have all slideshows and
code available in the description this
series of tutorials is that all the
beginner topics in Python topics that
will be covered is variables and data
structures input and output selection
functions iteration file i/o exception
handling and modules with these skills
providing you understand them you'll be
able to write loads of programs so I
strongly suggest learning more of Python
these are the fundamentals Python is an
interpretive language this means it's
compiled at runtime this means you don't
need to compile your program to
distribute it however it means anyone
can open and edit and read your code
it's not really a big deal though now
let's talk about getting set up if
you're on Linux or OSX it's no problem
it already comes installed there's no
tedious downloaded downloading required
if you're on Windows however I'll cover
the installation next feel free to skip
to that part of the video on Linux we
can call OS X we can test whether what
version we have installed to do this we
open up the terminal type Python space
dash B and that will show us the version
we want the version 2.1 of the video
this is two point seven point five it
doesn't have to be this version so long
as it's a two point something most
modules should work okay so let's test
it I've got a Linux box set up here with
a fresh install of Ubuntu to test we
want to open up our terminal so I have
it here in recent applications but you
may not have it there so we type in
terminal and it will pop up with
terminal we can open it up and it'll
provide us with the terminal window and
then we type Python
- be and that will give us the version
so currently you can see that on this
fresh install I don't have the latest
version of to point acts however it
doesn't really matter okay we can also
test that pythons working by starting
the interpreter if we want to start the
interpreter we type just Python and now
you'll see that we've got the triple
arrows indicating that we're now in the
top interpreter
let's test by typing print open quotes
hello world and it should the
interpreter should output hello world
success python is working correctly if
you're running on Linux OSX and this is
all worked fine you can move on to the
next video now if you're on Windows we
must download Python from Python org the
link will be in the description ok when
we go to the site it should look
something like this we want to go to the
download page and we want the 2.7
version or the two point X or whatever
whatever is after the top first dot as
long as it's two point something we want
to point something because most of the
modules that you'll use in Python aren't
compatible with 3.0 and above so let's
download this first one called
Python 2.7 point 5 windows installer if
we click on this it'll download I've
already got it installed so I don't need
it once it's downloaded and installed we
can check whether it's working so now
you can either navigate to start python
idle and the Python GUI and run it and
that will open up an interpreter looks
like this
in here we can test by typing print open
quotes hello world and we get the
interpreter to spit out hallo world
success Python is working correctly you
can create a shortcut to this on your
desktop if you'd like otherwise you can
just remember where to get to it every
time in the next video we'll cover
variables feel free to leave any
questions or in the comments and thanks
