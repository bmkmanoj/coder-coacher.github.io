eight objects in this video we'll be
learning about how we can store
functions and multiple values in one
type variable called an object every
video of all slideshows and code
available in the description what is an
object objects are just like variables
however they can store multiple values
you might be saying but drafts
isn't that what arrays do yes however
these multiple values are named and we
can do much more than just storing
values in an object in fact almost
everything in JavaScript is some type of
object they act as a container to hold
related data objects can hold whole
functions which are referred to as
methods and usually objects are used to
represent tangible objects like a person
car pet etc similar to how we would
create an array we can create an object
using curly braces because objects have
named values we need to specify a name
for each value separated by a colon in
the first example here we create a new
object called person which has a name
that is set to Fred an age which is set
to 25 and a sex which is set to M for
male alternatively you can create a new
empty object and set each of its named
values like normal variables here we use
the new keyword which indicates we want
to create a new fresh object to use once
we have our object created we can either
access the value by using its name in
dot notation or by using our objects
like an array except this time we use
the name as the index so you may be
wondering why should you ever use an
object instead of an array
well objects make it easier to keep
related data together even of different
types sometimes making it easier for us
developers to solve the problem thinking
of tangible objects like an item that
has a price ID and weight which then
goes into a cart which has items
quantity and cost which then turns into
an order which has a price ID date and
shipping information then it's stored
into an account as transaction history
trying to store all of these things in
separate arrays already makes my head
hurt so my general rule is use an object
when array doesn't make conceptual sense
all right let's get into some coding and
create a simple script that creates two
person objects they'll both have a name
page and sex
let's call it people dot HTML right so
we'll come over and we'll use our hello
template open it up in our text editor
and remove everything out of our script
tags and we can even remove our output
section you need our script tags and
then let's create how two objects so far
and we'll call it person one and they
equal open curly braces and we're gonna
have their name colon and in quotes
we'll call first one Fred comma the
second field we're going to call H and
then it's gonna have a value of say 25
in it and then let's have our final
field being a sex colon and we can set
that to say m for Fred so he's a male
and then we put a semicolon on the end
and now let's create our person to serve
our person to equals open curly braces
name colon and this one that's called
Lucy and age is age is it's a 27 and
these sex let's say is female there we
have our semicolon on the end
okay we've created two new objects one
called person one person two with a name
age in a sex let's alert them out so
that we can see them so alert and then
inside about outlet we're going to do in
courts two person one and put a cone on
the end they're just separate it then
will add on to the end the person one
dot name
plus open quotes and we'll put in a
comma space and the page
close quote we'll put a colon basically
squads and then we're going to add on to
that the person 1 dot H alright so let's
our person being output let's start
another alert for our second person and
this is going to be our person 2 : plus
the person 2 dot name + and the page
comma in their page : close quotes +
person 2 dot page and that will pull the
age out of person - alright so now we've
created our two alerts and we've got our
two objects let's say this and give it a
shot I will say that and then we'll drag
it you just save it as our people's save
as the people dot HTML and we'll drag it
in to our web browser and we get two
pop-ups one person one Fred age 25 and
we get our person - Lucy age 27 cool so
we successfully successfully created two
objects Fred and Lucy and we're able to
output it and use it like a storage
container objects can also hold
functions inside them these are called
methods generally these are used to
modify or perform an action on the data
inside the current object in the example
here we create a property called my
method then we set it to a function
using fairly similar syntax to the
function code we learned a couple of
videos ago I mentioned that methods tend
to modify or perform an action on the
data inside the current object however
when we are writing the function we
don't know what object it's
going to belong to so we can use a
special keyword called this meaning the
value with this name connected to this
current object that I'm attached to so
in the example here we create an object
called an obj which has a property
called name it also has a method
attached to it called my method inside
my method we can use that this name to
access the value Fred or anything that
name might be holding in the future
let's modify our people script to have a
display method which alerts out each of
the values inside the person's object
alright so we'll come back over here and
this time instead of having our separate
alert here we're going to more
differently create our person object so
we'll tab this in and separate it over
line so it's a bit easier to see and on
the final line here we're going to
instead of having a variable we're going
to use a function so we're gonna call it
display colon and then after our colon
instead of putting our variable value
we're going to put a function so
function and our circle parenthesis and
open up our curly braces and then inside
of our curly braces so we'll tap down
those lines they're going to alert the
name colon space plus this dot name so
that this is getting this objects dot
name so our name is Fred for this object
plus comma age colon space close quotes
plus this dot age so that'll grab the
age from this object and then we put a
semicolon on the end and that's the end
of our function there and we don't
require a semicolon after the I function
so that's our person one created so what
we can do is we just copy this function
and add it straight into our person two
so
tap that down and there we are we've got
our new object so bring this back down
and we need to have our closing curly
brace on this person one before I forget
it
there we go so now we've got our two
person objects instead of a loading out
what we can do is you just do our person
one person to listen one dot display and
our person 2 dot display cool now let's
give that a shot
so just move some the spaceship then we
can refresh our page and we get our
output so our named Fred age 25 and our
Lucy age 27
currently our methods are pretty simple
yet having to type out the object each
time is already tiring luckily there's a
better way constructors are functions
which create new objects they allow you
to specify how you want the objects to
look like then you can call it as many
times as you like with the values you
want here we have our person object
turned into a constructor function we
set this object's name property to the
name passed into the function same for
the age and sex properties then we
create a new person object by using the
new keyword and then calling the
function name all right let's modify our
people script one more time and this
time we'll create a person constructor
and create our people with it all right
so we'll come back over to our script
here and this time we're going to remove
our person 1 and our bar person 2 and
we're going to create a function so
function and we'll call that person and
then it's going to take a name parameter
an age parameter and a sex parameter
and inside of our function we're going
to have a this name so we're going to
add a name field to this object and
that's going to equal the name that we
pass in so the name that we pass in
doesn't have it this before it and we're
gonna have this dot H which is going to
equal the age that we pass in so we're
going to assign an age to this object
and then we're going to set this dot sex
to equal the sex that's passed in and
then finally we're going to create our
display function so this dot display and
that's going to equal a function this
time and just like before we're going to
have our parentheses on the end and
they're going to be empty and then we're
gonna open up some curly braces and
inside there we're going to create our
alert so Lert the name colon Plus this
dot name so we're gonna grab the name of
this object plus age : plus this dot age
so they grab the age out of this object
and we put a semicolon on the end to end
that and now we've got a constructor so
this constructor is gonna create person
objects for us so let's give it a shot
so currently we've got a person one in a
person object which don't exist yet so
to create them we're going to do our VAR
person 1 equals new person so using the
new keyword and now function our
constructor function we can create how
objects so we're going to create a
thread who is 25 and is male semicolon
on the end and our VAR person 2 equals a
new person
and that is going to be Lucy is 25 and
is female alright so we've got a person
1 and a person 2 and then we call their
display function we've set up inside the
constructor so now we've only got to
create that one person function and we
can create as many people as we like
cool so let's save that and give it a
shot
you can come back when we refresh our
page and we get our thread age 25 and
our Lucy age 25 so there's not much
difference but the code is is much more
friendly for us to work with before we
finish up this video let's quickly talk
about comparing objects to one another
two separate objects are never equal
when comparing even when all the
properties inside the object are the
same the comparison equals two will only
return true if one of the objects is a
reference to the other a reference is
when you create a new variable and set
it to a copy of another object this is
because JavaScript does not actually
create a copy but in fact just links it
to the original that means when you
modify one it is also changed on the
other this concludes our look at objects
in JavaScript next we'll be looking at
DOM and how to use it within our
JavaScript code if you have any
questions leave it in the comments and
I'll try to answer as best as possible
