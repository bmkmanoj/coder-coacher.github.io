eight objects in this video we'll be
learning about how we can store
functions and multiple values in one
type variable called an object every
video of all slideshows and code
available in the description what is an
object objects are just like variables
however they can store multiple values
you might be saying but drafts isn't
that what a raise do yes however these
multiple values are named and we can do
much more than just storing values in an
object in fact almost everything in
javascript is some type of object the
act as a container to hold related data
objects can hold whole functions which
are referred to as methods and usually
objects are used to represent tangible
objects like a person car pet etc
similar to how we would create an array
we can create an object using curly
braces because objects have named values
we need to specify a name for each value
separated by a colon in the first
example here we create a new object
called person which has a name that is
set to Fred an age which is set to 25
and a sex which is set to M for male
alternatively we can create a new empty
object and set each of its named values
like normal variables here we use the
new keyword which indicates we want to
create a new fresh object to use once we
have our object created we can either
access the value by using its name in
dot notation or by using our objects
like an array except this time we use
the name as the index so you may be
wondering why should you ever use an
object instead of an array but objects
make it easier to keep related data
together even of different types
sometimes making it easier for us
developers to solve the problem thinking
of tangible objects like an item that
has a price ID and weight which then
goes into a cart which has items
quantity and cost which then turns into
an order which has a price ID date and
shipping information then it's stored
into an account as transaction history
trying to store all of these things in
separate arrays already makes my head
hurt so my general rule is using object
when array doesn't make conceptual sense
all right let's get into some coding and
create a simple script that creates two
person objects they'll both have a name
age and sex let's call it people dot
HTML right so we'll come over and we'll
use our hello template open up in our
text editor and remove everything out of
our script tags and we can even remove
our output section you're going to need
our script tags and then let's create
our two objects so how far and we'll
call it person 1 and they equal open
curly braces and we're gonna have the
name colon and in quotes will call first
one Fred comma the second field we're
going to call age and then it's going to
have a value of C 25 in it and then
let's have our final field being a sex
colon and we can set that to say m for
Fred so he's a male and then we put a
semicolon on the end and now let's
create our person too so bar bar person
2 equals open curly braces name colon
and this one let's call her Lucy and age
is what page is it's a 27 and these sex
let's say he is female now we have our
semicolon on the end okay we've created
two new objects one called person one
person to with a name age in a sex now
let's alert them out so that we can see
them so alert and then inside about a
lot we're going to do in courts to
person one and put a colon on the end
edge to separate it then we'll add on to
the end the person one dot name
Plus open quotes and we'll put in a
comma space and the page close quote
we'll put a Collins basically squads and
then we're going to add on to that the
person one dot H alright so let's our
person being output so start another
alert for our second person and this is
going to be our person to colon plus the
person to name plus and the page over
comma in their age colon close quotes
plus person to dot age and that will
pull the age out of person too alright
so now we've created our two alerts and
we've got our two objects let's say this
and give it a shot we'll say that and
then we'll drag it up you just save it
as our peoples save as people dot HTML
and we'll drag it in to our web browser
and we get two pop-ups one person one
Fred age 25 and we get our person to
Lucy age 27 cool so he successfully
successfully created two objects Fred
and Lucy and we're able to output it and
use it like a storage container objects
can also hold functions inside them
these are called methods generally these
are used to modify or perform an action
on the data inside the current object in
the example here we create a property
called my method then we set it to a
function using fairly similar syntax to
the function code we learn a couple of
videos ago I mentioned that methods tend
to modify or perform an action on the
data inside the current object however
when we are writing the function we
don't know what object its
going to belong to so we can use a
special keyword called this meaning the
value with this name connected to this
current object that I'm attached to so
in the example here we create an object
called an obj which has a property
called name it also has a method
attached to it called my method inside
my method we can use that this name to
access the value Fred or anything that
name might be holding in the future
let's modify our people script to have a
display method which alerts out each of
the values inside the person's object
all right so we'll come back over here
and this time instead of having our
separate alert here we're going to more
differently create our person object so
we'll tab this in and separate it over
line so it's a bit easier to see and on
the final line here we're going to
instead of having a variable we're going
to use a function so we're going to call
it display colon and then after our
colon instead of putting our variable
value we're going to put a function so
function and our circle parentheses and
open up our curly braces and then inside
of our curly braces so we'll tap down
those lines are going to alert the name
colon space plus this dot name so that
this is getting this objects name so our
name is Fred for this object plus comma
age colon space close chords Plus this
dot age so that will grab the age from
this object and then we put a semicolon
on the end it that's the end of our
function there and we don't require a
semicolon after the our function so
that's our person one created so what we
can do is we just copy this function and
add it straight into our person too so
tap that down there we are we've got our
new object so bring this back down and
we need to have our closing curly brace
on this person one before I forget it
there we go so now we've got our two
person objects instead of a loading out
what we can do is you just do our person
one person to person 1 dot display and
our person to dot display cool now let's
give that a shot so move some the
spaceship then we can refresh our page
and we get our output so our named Fred
age 25 and our Lucy age 27 currently our
methods are pretty simple yet having to
type out the object each time is already
tiring luckily there's a better way
constructors are functions which create
new objects they allow you to specify
how you want the objects to look like
then you can call it as many times as
you like with the values you want here
we have our person object turned into a
constructor function we set this
object's name property to the name
passed into the function same for the
age and sex properties then we create a
new person object by using the new
keyword and then calling the function
name alright let's modify our people
script one more time and this time we'll
create a person constructor and create
our people with it alright so we'll come
back over to our script here and this
time we're going to remove our bar
person one and our bar person too and
we're going to create a function so
function and we'll call that person and
then it's going to take a name parameter
an age parameter and a sex parameter
and inside of our function we're going
to have a this name so we're going to
add a name field to this object and
that's going to equal the name that we
pass in so the name that we pass and
doesn't have it this before it and we're
going to have this dot H which is going
to equal the age that we pass in so
we're going to assign an age to this
object and then we're going to set this
dot sex to equal the sex that's passed
in and then finally we're going to
create our display function so this dot
display and that's going to equal a
function this time and just like before
we're going to have our parentheses on
the end and they're going to be empty
then we're going to open up some curly
braces and inside there we're going to
create our alert so Lert the name colon
Plus this dot name so we're going to
grab the name of this object plus age
colon Plus this dot age so that I
grabbed the age out of this object we
put a semicolon on the end to end up and
now we've got a constructor so this
constructor is going to create personal
objects for us so let's give it a shot
so currently we've got person one in a
person object which don't exist yet so
to create them we're going to do our bar
person 1 equals new person book so using
the new keyword and now function our
constructor function we can create how
objects so we're going to create a Fred
who is 25 and is male semicolon on the
end and our bar person 2 equals a new
person
and that is going to be Lucy is 25 and
is female all right so we've got a
person one and a person too and then we
call their display function we've set up
inside the constructor so now we've only
got to create that one person function
and we can create as many people as we
like cool so let's say that and give it
a shot and come back when we refresh our
page and we get our Fred age 25 and our
Lucy age 25 so there's not much
difference but the code is is much more
friendly for us to work with before we
finish up this video let's quickly talk
about comparing objects to one another
to separate objects are never equal when
comparing even when all the properties
inside the object are the same the
comparison equals two will only return
true if one of the objects is a
reference to the other a reference is
when you create a new variable and set
it to a copy of another object this is
because JavaScript does not actually
create a copy but in fact just links it
to the original that means when you
modify one it is also changed on the
other this concludes our look at objects
in JavaScript next we'll be looking at
DOM and how to use it within our
javascript code if you have any
questions leave it in the comments and
I'll try to answer as best as possible
