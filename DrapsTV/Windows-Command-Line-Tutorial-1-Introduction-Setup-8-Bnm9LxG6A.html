one Windows command line tutorial
introduction and setup in this series
we'll be learning how to use the Windows
command line I am to give you the
confidence to be able to use the command
line when you might need it every video
of all slide shows anchored available in
the description so what is CMD well CMD
or CMD - XE is the Windows command line
sometimes also referred to as a DOS
prompt or a command prompt the command
prompt allows you raw access to your
windows tools that you're probably
already familiar with things like
exploring files creating files and
directories copying files etc someone
may tell you things like you get much
more power of your computer using the
command line this is most definitely
true however it's not the kind of power
a casual user would need it's more the
kind of power system admin for a school
or business would need so why should I
learn CMD then well command line
experience is always great especially if
you get into programming or any IT job
writing tools for interaction on the
command line is usually much quicker
than any graphical user interface
equivalent it's important to keep in
mind that windows CMD is slowly being
phased out with Windows PowerShell
starting to take over all the
responsibilities PowerShell has the
added benefit of standard command names
like you would see in Mac or Linux the
topics we'll be looking at in this
series are the basics general tasks
Network tools and finally batch scripts
there are no prerequisites for this
tutorial we'll cover the basics very
thoroughly the command line of computer
should never be scary now for the setup
assume you're on a Windows operating
system we can run CMD by going to start
and typing in CMD in the search bar it
will pop up with the results and we can
click it or you can just press the Enter
key alternatively you can hold shift and
right click on the desktop or inside any
folder in your computer and click open
command window here let's give it a shot
so I'll come over to start so our start
button down here and we can type in our
little search bar here CMD and
programs seemed leader XE and we can
click it and that will start up a
command line okay
alternatively we can go into any folder
or the desktop hold down the shift key
right click and go open command window
here and it will open up our command
prompt cool that's all there is to it
the next thing we'll be looking at is

comments and I'll try to answer it as
best as possible don't forget to
