four control flow ifs and switches in
this video we'll be learning how to make
decisions inside our code every video up
all slideshows and code available in the
description for we can use if to make
decisions we need to know how to compare
things using special JavaScript
operators we can compare two things
which will result in either true if the
overall expression is logically true or
will result in false if the expression
is logically false for example 4 is less
than 5 well logically that's true 7 is
greater than 40 well that's incorrect so
logically that's false 2 equal signs
together means is equal to so 5 is equal
to 5 is true there are several special
operators we can use to compare with
which will result in either true or
false
equal to is the left side the same as
the right side not equal to is the left
side different from the right side less
than is the left side less than the
right side less than or equal to is the
left side less or equal to the right
side greater than so is the left side
greater than the right side or greater
than or equal to is the left side
greater than or equal to the right side
now we can make use of these comparisons
in if statements on the Left we can see
the basic structure of an if statement
we start the line of code with an
if-then in brackets we make a comparison
if it's true javascript will run the
code inside the curly braces on the
right we create a variable X and set it
to 5 this could easily be a number we
get from the user then we check if X is
less than 10 then if it is we're going
to add 5 to its current value if the
comparison is false the code inside the
curly braces is skipped all right let's
try writing a simple if statement to
check if a variable is less than 10 and
check if the variable is greater than 10
let's call it check 10 dot HTML
okay so we'll come over here and we'll
open up our inner HTML in our editor and
we'll just save it as a new copy called
checked em so we can say about template
check ten all right now let's start
writing our if statement so inside of
our script we will create a variable to
bar and we'll call it X make it equal to
5 semicolon and now let's write our if
statement so if and in brackets we'll do
X is less than 10 so X is less than 10
we're gonna open up our curly braces and
we'll copy this document yeah element
put our output in and we'll tab it in a
space so it's a little bit easier to
read
then that's output X is less than 10
cool now let's copy this whole if
statement and we'll paste it again and
this time we'll do if X is greater than
10 and we'll type in here X is greater
than 10 cool now we can say this and we
can give it a shot so we'll drag our
check 10 into a web browser we get X is
less than 10 cool so that said that yes
X is less than 10 and then outputted our
result and notice it didn't run the
second if because X wasn't greater than
10 but if we change our X to say 11 we
save it and we run it again come back
home refresh we get X is greater than 10
awesome
so we're successfully checking where the
X is less than 10 or X is greater than
10 cool there is often times when you
want to make other checks when the first
if check fails we can do this by using
else if to make another check if the
first if is false alternatively if
there's only two possible results we can
use the else Clause to perform a block
of code when the if is false here is an
example of combining each of these
together if X is less than 10 we output
X is less than 10
otherwise if X is
greater than 10 we output X is larger
than 10 else if all else fails we output
X is 10 because there's no other number
it could be you might notice that the
braces start on the end of the if
statement lines this is perfectly fine
and his personal preference which one
you use there are many arguments on line
over which is better let's modify our
previous example to take a number from
the user and use an if-else if-else to
check its value all right so we're
coming back across and we're going to
this time we're going to get a value
from the user so our bar X is going to
be a pass pass int the capital I and
then by going to prompt and ask the user
to enter a number : close quotes and
close off our two brackets all right so
we're good grabbing X from the user now
let's change our if statement so that
it's all joined together so we'll do an
else--if here so if X is less than 10
we're going to output X is less than 10
else if X is greater than 10 we're going
to output X is greater than 10 and let's
add one more else Clause onto the end
else open our braces we're going to
output about document output X is 10
cool so let's say this and let's give it
a shot so we refresh we'll get asked for
a number so let's put in let's say 7 hit
ok yet X is less than 10 refresh again
let's try putting in 100 ok X is greater
than 10 cool we refresh and let's try it
actually 10 and we hit the else clause
and we get else X is 10 cool so we're
successfully going through and testing
out each case so X is successfully being
less than 10 greater than 10 and is 10
when we are comparing values we can also
make multiple
comparisons in one expression we do this
with logical operators - and symbols
together represents logical and if both
comparisons are true two vertical bars
represents all if one or more is true
exclamation mark stands for naught which
changes the expected result to the
opposite in the example here we check if
X is greater than zero and X is less
than 10 so if both halves of the if are
true then run the code inside the if
next let's look at the switch statement
a switch statement is like multiple if
statements squashed together into a
slightly smaller syntax while this does
save space in your code I feel it's less
verbose in the example here we can see
the switch keyword at the top which
takes a variable or value then that
value is compared against each of the
cases case 1 check Z of X is equal to 1
case 2 is checking if X is equal to 2
etc these cases can be any value you
want to check against the default is run
if no matches were found
we are also introduced to a new keyword
called break break we'll cancel the
current control flow statement in this
example
it would leave the cases and start
executing anything up to the bottom of
our curly brace if we don't put breaks
into a switch statement each case will
flow into the next like normal code
execution would let's modify our add
script from last video and use a switch
statement to decide if we add subtract
multiply or divide let's call it
calculator HTML
all right so we'll edit our add HTML and
we'll save it as call it calculator save
right now let's change how we're going
to get our input in because we want to
be able to say we want to plus minus
multiply or divide so let's use a drop
down menu so instead of our plus symbol
here let's add in a select and we'll
call it ID equals mode close off that
select now inside let's set our up
and value equal plus and then inside of
the tags we're going to put plus at the
plus character and we'll close off that
option let's copy our options into the
next line four options and then let's
set them to four minus star four times
and slash four divide cope so we've
added in each of our options we need to
close off our select now so select all
right so now we can get our value mode
from our input so we're gonna need a
couple new variables so we're going to
go VAR mode it's going to equal our
document dot get element by ID and then
we're going to get the mode and we want
to get the value out of that mode cool
and we can put a semicolon in the end
there and now we want to get we want to
store our result serve our result it's
going to equal zero to start with and we
want to switch our result so we're going
to create our switch statement now so
switch and we're going to take the mode
then we're going to open up our curly
braces and we start our cases so we
indent with the tab and we type case and
our first case is going to be the string
so open up quotes plus a plus symbol
then we put a colon on the end and then
now we're inside this case so we'll tab
in and we'll do our result equals num1
plus num2 we'll put a semicolon on the
end then on our next line we're going to
break
because we don't want to subtract
multiply and divide straight after we've
added now we can copy this case we'll go
down to the next line paste our new case
the next line and paste it so we've got
four and we'll just change it over so
it's got a minus minus and we want eight
times and eight times and a divided and
a divide awesome so now our switch
statement will get whatever mode is in
the drop down compare it
so if mode is equal to plus then we're
going to add the two numbers if the mode
is equal to minus we're going to - City
numbers if the mode is equal to x then
we have x or numbers and similarly for
divide if the mode is equal to divide
we're going to divide the two numbers
once we've got our result we can
document get element by ID output and
set the results result now if we say
this and we give it a shot so come over
and we'll drag our calculator into the
web browser we get our number so we'll
put it in say 15 and we can hit our
drop-down lets x 15 by to hit equal and
we get 30 cool and we can say we want a
-2 from 1513 add should get 17 divided
and we should get 7.5 awesome we just
made our in calculator this concludes
our look at ifs and switches in
JavaScript next we'll be looking at how
to repeat sections of code using loops
if you have any questions leave it in
the comments and I'll try to answer it
