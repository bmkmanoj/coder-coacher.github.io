a very large issue recently, especially for
users of the website Facebook.
So what are self cross-site scripting attacks?
and how can you protect yourself from them?
Well self cross-site scripting or self XSS
for short is a social engineering attack which
tricks a victim
into running a malicious script on themself.
In laymans terms a &quot;Scam&quot;.
Usually the scam is in the form of &quot;Follow
these 3 easy steps to hack any Facebook account!&quot;
Step 1. Go to the victims profile
Step 2. Right click and click on &quot;Inspect
Element&quot; and then click the console tab.
Step 3. Paste the code into the box at the
bottom and press enter. You can find the code
at this website.
Wait 5 seconds! and Done! Good Luck!
Now self XSS isn't a new threat, I haven't
been able to find reputable statistics,
however in the last 12 months Facebook and
Google+ have been trying very hard to combat
this social engineering attack.
Most commonly this attack is targeting facebook
accounts.
This attack has become so common that web
browsers
like firefox and chrome now display warnings
about self-xss attacks.
Facebook also has a warning that is visible
when the user opens the developer console.
The issue with this attack is that the victims
are so desperate for this supposed hack to
work
that they ignore warnings and still fall victim
to the attacks.
Because this is becoming such a major issue,
education of the attack is very important,
especially if your business uses facebook
as a method of marketing.
Having your business facebook account comprimised
will not look good.
Facebook has some very useful articles on
what a self-xss attack may look like.
As well as what self-xss is. I will leave
links to these pages in the description.
Make sure to share this video with friends
and family you know that may fall victim to
this attack.
On the other side of the fence. This would
actually be a good attack vector for compramising
a facebook account.
Many people are desperate to hack their enemies,
friends, girlfriend, ex-girlfriend, etc
that tricking someone into attacking themselves
is one of the easiest attack strategies currently
available for facebook.
If you have followed my cross site scripting
tutorial at all then you will know that obtaining
someones cookies can be very useful.
Keep in mind that Facebook is not the only
website that self-xss would be a good strategy
for
Almost any site that uses cookies for session
validation would be vulnerable to a self-xss
attack.
Your only challenge to overcome is creating
a simple to follow, yet elaborate trick that
victims believe that
this is actually going to work. Obfuscation
of your script is also a great way to make
users believe it's a really
complex quote, unquote HACK.
I hope you found this interesting! Just a
reminder that attempting to access someones
facebook that you don't have permission to
access is a crime.
