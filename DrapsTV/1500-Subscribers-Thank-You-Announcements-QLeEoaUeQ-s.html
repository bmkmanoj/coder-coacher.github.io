you for your support Japs TV is past
fifteen hundred subscribers and that
just blows my mind that's like seven or
eight lecture halls just wow now I'd
like to talk about some of the content I
really want to get out to you I really
want to find more time to make content
that other commitments always come up
going full time YouTube just isn't
feasible at the moment I don't want to
ask for donations i'm a bit sick at the
moment so i won't be recording any
tutorials until i'm back to full health
but i'll try and spend as much of that
time writing the scripts and content for
upcoming videos some of the things i'd
like to post is stuff like a
cryptography course algorithmic
programming course machine learning
parallel programming video game hacking
101 and some e forensics though i don't
know too much about eat forensics so i'm
going to focus on learning about it for
the next few months before i consider
making a series on it it also loved to
make tutorials for other programming
languages however there is already so
many throws out there already for almost
every language maybe Scala perhaps
anyway I made a Twitter account so for
those of you who are on Twitter you can
contact me there so follow at drop
Stevie our post won't videos go live and
any other information that is happening
with the channel once again a big thank
you to everyone who has watched liked or
commented i hope this maze silva was
entertaining or mesmerizing while you
listened thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
