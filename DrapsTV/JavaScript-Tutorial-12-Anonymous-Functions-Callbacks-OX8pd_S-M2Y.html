anonymous functions and callbacks in
this video we'll be learning about how
we can create functions on the fly that
had no name as well as how we can use
callbacks for more advanced utility
functions like arrays sort every video
of all slide shows anchored available in
the description anonymous functions are
functions that do not have a name they
can also be referred to sometimes as
function expressions usually they are
stored inside a variable as a function
object or alternatively passed into a
function as a parameter under the hood a
parameter is a variable so it's not
really breaking any rules here we have
an anonymous function to add two values
together and we store it inside the
variable F we then log out the result of
F with 5 and 5 passed in by calling the
variable like a function self in working
or self calling functions are a touchy
subject for a lot of JavaScript learners
as it appears pointless but it's
critical you know about them as they are
used everywhere on the web and in a lot
of source code examples you can create
functions that will automatically run
after they have finished being defined
perhaps you may be asking why wouldn't
we just call the function online after
defining it then most of the arguments I
see around are for scoping or minimizing
code personally I think it's a bit of
both if you're writing a library for
another developer last thing you want is
your important variables being
overwritten or interfering with the
developers code so you can scope off all
the private variables and only expose
what needs to be exposed second if you
have hundreds of thousands of users
visiting your website each part of that
JavaScript matters in lowering the
overhead from the server serving those
files though I highly recommend leaving
the minimizing until after everything is
debugged and working there is even tools
out there to help you with compiling
your JavaScript into smaller files all
right let's jump into a hands-on example
of both anonymous functions and self
invoking functions in a script there are
places birth to get element by ID and
get elements by class name functions in
the document where the shorter easier to
use underscore EU function I hope this
doesn't end up too confusing all right
let's call it shorthand HTML all right
so I'm going to grab the local app and
open that up and I want to use it as a
template so I'll say that as short and
let's say that all right so in my head
section I'm gonna just remove all of
that script that we currently have there
right so what I'm going to do is I want
to create a self-executing function so
do that I need to wrap everything inside
of parentheses so once I've got my
parentheses we're going to create an
anonymous function so function space and
we don't want to put a name there now we
open up our brackets for our parameters
and inside there I'm going to pass in
the window so the window is always
available and is how we use something
like the document to reference things
all right so after we've done that I'm
going to put in our braces for the
function and notice that it's still
inside our original parenthesis that we
set up and now we can write our
self-executing function so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to grab the
window that we pass in so win then I'm
going to set dot underscore e so I'm
just going to be a new function that
we're going to use which is going to be
our function shorthand for using
document get element by ID or document
get elements by class name and I'm going
to make this equal a anonymous function
so function and it's going to take an
arc so that's going to be the argument
that we pass in so that's going to be
the ID that we want to get or the class
name that we want to get now I'll put
our curly braces in for this function
all right so what I want to do in here
is I'm going to check what type of
argument is so if the hog thought
substring actually I want to get it
starts with because I'm going to make it
so that if there's a la a leading full
stop that I
look for a class and that's just a sort
of a standard for CSS classes so if it
starts with I need a capital W there so
it starts with and I want to check for
the full stop so if it starts with a
full stop
then I want to have an if statement and
I want to return the document dot get
elements by class name and I'm going to
pass in the args out of the hog rather
dot substring so I want to pass in the
substring from the position 1 onwards so
I want to leave the full stop off all
right so we're going to return that back
so that means we wanted to find a class
else if it's not a class that we're
looking for
then we're going to return document dot
get element by ID so just our normal get
element by ID and then we're gonna pass
in Arg and we're gonna return that back
so that's a shorthand there I'm going to
end our anonymous function here and I'm
gonna end it and then down on our bottom
line after our final self invoke a
function which is these these
parentheses here to actually make it
invoke we need to put another two
parentheses on the end like we would
call a normal function and because we
were expecting one parameter which is
our window so I'm gonna pass in the
window object and then I'm gonna put my
rent my semicolon there to run the self
executing function alright so now we've
got this little knit self executing
function here and what that's going to
do is we're going to pass in the window
we're going to set up a new function
called underscore e as part of the
window that takes in an argument which
is either a class or a ID for an
and then it's going to return the
elements are it's going to look through
the document for that class or that
element and return back either a list or
an element all right so now I want to
create a another anonymous function and
we're just doing this for the sake of
learning anonymous functions gonna stare
it store it in a variable called run and
I'm going to create my anonymous
function so function open brackets and
it's not going to take anything it's
just gonna be a void function alright so
inside of our anonymous function here
we're going to use our new underscore a
function and we're going to grab out so
that's our usual down here our paragraph
tags here and what we're going to do is
out is we're going to set its inner HTML
to equal hello in quotes space I'll
close that off plus and we need some
sort of input so let's grab the name
from the user so we'll grab a name and
we'll call this ID name just keep it
easy
we only want a name and we'll have a
button which is going to run run
function that we're currently creating
so it's run and parentheses there and
we'll change this button to just run all
right and what we might do is so that we
can test out the class part is working
will create a h1 with the class equal to
a class and then we'll close that off we
won't put anything in it just yet and
we'll also create a h2 with the class P
class
alright so we've got two classes because
we're going to be able to grab a list
back and we've also got an ID with out
alright so we're going to grab whatever
is in underscore e name so inside of our
element name and we want to grab its dot
value all right now because we're
grabbing a class and it's going to be a
list of classes because there's multiple
things with that class we're going to do
four open upper brackets and we're going
to have a variable which is going to be
the current element that we're looking
at at the moment of and this off key
word is special and it says grab an
element of this list because I know that
the underscore e of a dot a class he's
going to return back a list of elements
because a class can be assigned to
multiple elements whereas an ID can only
be on one element alright so we've
gotten back a list of a class and we're
going to go through each of them as ally
alright so in my curly braces here I'm
going to do le dot innerhtml
equals hello and plus how underscore he
named dot value so now we don't have to
write out the whole document get element
by ID every time we can just do
underscore E and the name so underscore
he representing element and then the
name alright so that's it for our run
function we'll just put a semicolon on
the end of this function here this
anonymous function because we're saving
it inside of a variable so we're using
it like an expression alright so now
we've got it all put together let's give
it a shot
so we'll save that then we'll try it
dragging it in so I called it's
shorthand let's drag it in put a name
and run so I'll put in our drops
we run a zoom in here in here and we can
see it's gone through and it's found
each of the elements and replaced them
with the name we put in so it's much
simpler so we've got this one set of
code here that we can reuse multiple
times we can just have it in one script
that we import every time or we can just
put at the top of every script that we
write and it turns our functions into
very much smaller lines and we can
easily just go element and then the ID
or the class awesome so hopefully that
wasn't too confusing and you can see how
we can use anonymous functions without
names to save them inside variables or
have a self running function that will
just run itself automatically after it's
been defined callbacks are a function
that you create that another function
will call an invoke back to after it's
done or multiple times to modify the
behavior of the original function
callbacks work great with anonymous
functions and you'll see them used
regularly in the wild several built-in
utility functions in JavaScript require
or make use of callbacks so it's
important we are aware of how to use
them while callbacks can be incredibly
useful on your own functions here are a
few array utility functions that make
use of call backs the first one here is
the sort function using it normally it
will sort in alphabetical order which
isn't very helpful if we want to sort
numbers or our own custom objects so
they can create a custom compare
callback function that depending on
whether or not we return a negative
number positive or zero number
determines how the array is sorted the
second one here is the sum array utility
function which checks if there is at
least one value in the array that is a
truth a value a truth value is any
expression that results in either true
or false
here we specify a callback that checks
for a true p value the third function
here is the map function which is a
super useful function for creating a new
array with values that match a callback
street each x alright let's jump into an
example of call backs and learn how we
can create our own compare function
callbacks let's call it sorting dot HTML
all right so I'm going to open up our
shorthand at HTML again and we're going
to save this as and I'm going to save
this as L sorting dot HTML and then I'm
going to keep our little self executing
function that we wrote that makes it
shorter for us to find elements and I'm
going to remove out the run section all
right so now that we've got this spare
space here I'm just going to just leave
it there so our script runs at the top
and inside of our body
what I'm going to do is gonna have two
outputs so I'm just gonna have I think I
might just have two paragraphs this time
so we have a paragraph for say out
numbers so we're gonna sort some numbers
and I'll have a paragraph for some out
items so items is going to be a custom
object that has an item in it with a
name and a price so we can see sorting
on objects and sorting on numbers all
right so now we've created these two
here I'm going to just go below it and
open up some new script tags so script
and closed script and I'll zoom now I'll
move down a bit here alright so inside a
script tags what we're going to do is
we're going to create a array of numbers
so numbers we'll just call it numbers
and make it equal to let's say 8 2 4 6 5
and I will put in a 12 there so we can
see it mark up when it tries to do it
normally and we'll put a 1 in there as
well all right so we've got 8 2 4 6 5 12
1 what we want to do is we want to sort
this list alright so before we sort it
what I'm going to do is output what
it was currently looks like so on a
school II and I'll grab out capital n
dot you know HTML and that's going to
equal numbers dot two string all right
so that'll be eight two four six five
twelve one just being output straight
into our end and I'm going to copy this
list this line answer and put it down on
the next one and I'm going to output it
as a normal sort so numbers dot sort
parentheses to string so that will
return a sorted list as sorted array
sorry and it will turn it to string and
put it out so I'm going to plus equals
that on the end I might actually just
add a line break in there as well all
right so we've got a line break and
we're adding on the numbers that have
been sorted all right
now we want to create our own proper
sort so if we were to save this and give
it a run I'll drag it over for sorting
we get our two lists so two arrays we've
got the one that we created so eight two
four six five twelve and one and then
we've got our second one which has been
sought by the default sort which is by
alphabetical order and by alphabetical
order with numbers is one always comes
first so we've got one and then we've
got twelve so that isn't logically
correct for numbers but it is for
Strings so one is the same as 1 2 4 5 6
8 so it does an alright job going from 1
to 9 providing that there's no double
digits all right so let's fix that
so let's come back and to do this we
need to create our own sort function
sort all right so let's do numbers dot
sort and we're going to pass in a
function so function and we're going to
have
some parentheses here so our anonymous
function is going to take two values an
A and a B so this is comparing item
array number one with array number two
array number two the Ray number three
etc and passes in each one and compares
the two alright so after I've sort of
defined our function here we want to
create the logic inside of it so we'll
add our curly braces in and we'll close
off our curly braces and just so we
don't forget we'll put a semicolon after
the parenthesis at the end here alright
so inside of our sort function it's
actually going to be super simple so if
something is less than the current
number if we minus a a minus B it'll
become a negative number so it means yes
it is less than if they're equal a minus
B will return zero because they're both
equal so say two minus two is zero so
that means that equal not Wiltern equal
back to the sort function and if they're
positive so say 4 minus 2 then it will
return a positive number and say that
this is higher and move it up higher if
needed all right so let's just return a
minus B and I will spread that out so
it's a bit easier to see so a minus B so
if we wanted it to be in descending
order so instead of going 1 2 4 6 1 2 4
5 6 etc we could have it going in
descending order from 12 8 6 cetera by
swapping surround 2 and doing B minus a
alright so now that we've created our
sorting and our sort so we just passed
our anonymous function straight into our
sort if we give it a shot now so if we
copy our a rigid our second statement
here and we just removed this sort part
so we're going to do numbers to string
again we'll get our sort of list so if
we save that and we refresh and have a
look at what that looks like we've got
our 8 2 4 6 5 12 1 and then we've got
our incorrect one on the second line
here but then we've got our fixed one
with our custom can
power function on the third line here
awesome alright so now let's try
comparing items in a list or our own
custom objects in a list so let's do var
items equals and I'll open up square
brackets here and I'm going to knock
that down a couple of lines and put a
semicolon on the end so I don't forget
and now I'm gonna add in each of my sort
of my items so in curly braces I'm going
to have a name for my object and let's
have that as like Cola as an item and
then let's have a price for it so price
is let's say it's it's $3 and we'll
close that off then we put a comma on to
the next line name we can actually just
copy and paste this first one here and
do it as many times as we want so I'll
paste this a couple of times let's let's
go with four items we don't need a
really more than four so we've got a
cola and it's do red is super simple
let's say Brady's taught two dollars 50
it's probably a bit too much as well
depends where you live coffee
jar so like a jar of coffee let's say
that price is like $8 and finally let's
say something like pasta and pasta will
say a bag passes like four dollars all
right so we've got a list of items that
are custom objects they have a name and
a price and to sort these normally it
just wouldn't work because they're
custom objects so what we need to do is
create our own hour and sort of function
so first we'll just go through each of
them
so for VAR IC m for item of items so
we're going to go through each of the
items and we're going to do underscore e
open able to count high for our out
items in HTML
that's going to let's do plus equals and
we want to do the ITM dot name so we
want to grab the name of the item so
it's first one is Cola second bread et
cetera plus then open up some courts the
space semicolon
today's close quarts and we'll add on
the price so the ITM dot price dot two
string and then on the end we'll just
add a line break so BR alright so that
will go through each of our items and
print out their name and their price now
let's give it a give it a shot at
sorting them so I'll just grab e how to
get not add another line break before we
do this so I don't know line break there
all right so now let's try sorting it so
what I want to do is we're going
items dot sort and then we're going to
pass in an anonymous function function
and it's going to once again take an A
and a B and we'll open up our tele
braces to knock it down a couple of
lines add a parenthesis and a semicolon
so we don't forget all right so what we
want to do in here is we're going to be
sort of hand handcrafting the returning
either a negative number a positive
number or an equal zero
all right so if the a dot price is
greater than the b dot price then we
want to return one we want to return a
positive number if a is bigger than B
all right and then we can go down to the
next line and we can go if a dot price
is less than B dot price then we want to
return -1 return minus one so it's a
negative number so it knows to sort it
downwards or move it down the array all
right if it's not less than and it's not
greater than that we just want to return
zero because they must be equal so we
can put a little comment in there they
must be equal all right so that's our
sort done so let's give that a shot
but so we can see that it actually
worked lets regrab our for state for
loop up ahead up for and let's reput it
down here and so we can see it the
spread out we'll save that come over to
our page and refresh it and we get our
original cola three bread two point five
coffee jar a pastor for and then after
it gets sorted we get out bread two
dollars fifty call three pastor for
coffee 2.8 etc awesome
so we successfully created our own store
function for our own custom object this
concludes our look at anonymous
functions and callbacks in JavaScript
next we'll be looking at our final topic
of es6 and javascript libraries if you
have any questions leave it in the
comments and I'll try to answer it as
best as possible don't forget to
