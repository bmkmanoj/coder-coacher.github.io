Twitter's TweetDeck XSS June 2014 in
this video we'll be talking about the
cross-site scripting attack that hit
Twitter in June of 2014
every video have all slideshows and code
available in the description so what
happened the morning of June 11 Twitter
applied a revamp to the user interface
of its web application TweetDeck tree
deck is a tool that allows you to easily
manage Twitter accounts giving several
layer and customization of multiple
streams a few hours after the release of
the update a self retweeting tweet was
posted retweeting itself by anyone using
tweet deck that saw it booming it up to
81 Carried tweets in just a few hours
having over millions of people see it
now how did this happen it's suspected
that after rebuilding the user interface
the developers of the tweet layout
forgot to HTML encode the tweets coming
from the database this means the script
was being left to execute on tweet deck
for anyone who saw it however luckily it
did not affect regular users of the
Twitter website only TweetDeck users
let's have a look at all of the code yep
that's it Twitter has 140 character
limit to posts so to keep the character
countdown it was written with the aid of
jQuery jQuery is a JavaScript library
that adds some new syntax for finding
and interacting with tag elements all
right let's step through how the code
works first the all familiar script tag
however this time when it's opened its
given the class name XSS this will come
in handy in the next line of code then
we have the closing script tag if you
left this off it would probably mess up
the whole page for anyone who would view
it which would get you in big trouble
there was even enough leftover room to
place a Unicode heart at the end of the
tweet all right here's the first line of
the script first using the jQuery dollar
sign to select any element on the page
with the class XSS you remember this
script was given the class named XSS
then get a list of all of the parent
tags that encase this class so this will
be things such as the text area of the
tweet the whole tweet box the tweet
frame then the tweet stream etc then we
retrieve the second parent tag remember
that arrays and lists start from zero
so one is the second element then find a
list of all of the a tags inside the
parent tag or as you can remember links
which will be the reply button the
retweet button favorite button and more
button we want to then retrieve the
second link which again counting from
zero is the retweet button then we click
it now let's move on to the second line
of the script this one is much shorter
first using jQuery again you select any
element on the page this time with an
attribute data
- action equals retweet this happens to
be the pop-up box asking if you're sure
you want to retweet then we click it
done retweet it the final line of the
script is as I'm sure you are familiar
with by now the alert XSS and TweetDeck
making a pop-up dialog box saying XSS in
TweetDeck all right that's it for this
cross-site scripting tutorial I hope you
enjoyed it let me know in the comments
I'll also leave a link to the self
retweeting tweet in the description
don't worry it's harmless now you have
any questions leave it in the comments
and I'll try to answer it as best as
possible don't forget to subscribe
