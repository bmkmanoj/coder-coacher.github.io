security with the identified bosch bug
the bug has been appropriately given the
name shell-shocked with a threat level
of very high the news hit last week when
red hat security blog posted about
discovering the bug in the born again
shell or bash the article talked about
how the bug was exploited and that red
hat had fixed the bug in their latest
patch many people were upset that this
was publicly announced because almost
all UNIX based systems are vulnerable to
the attack this includes OS X however
for hours after the release of the Red
Hat news and patch someone had already
broken through red hats fixed and
exploited the bug once again the attack
is conducted by exploiting environment
variables in bash arbitrary code can be
executed from a function that is placed
inside an environment variable this bug
affects anything that uses bash so
things like CGI scripts ssh telnet dhcp
and many more so how do you know if
you're vulnerable well there's a simple
test we can do in bash to check if we
are vulnerable to the exploit in the
terminal we create an environment
variable with our function and code so
environment and will call the variable
VAR then in quotes we're going to have
parentheses then some curly braces and
we're going to ignore colon and close
curly braces colon and then echo out our
code that we want to execute so we'll do
echo and then we're just echo out the
word exploit it and close quotes and
then we can run any bash command so
we'll just do bin bash and we'll create
a new instance if your system is
vulnerable you'll get the output
exploited to your console but don't fear
there is a patch out for most systems
now that stops code from executing
inside environment variables but I would
write this one down because not all UNIX
based systems can be updated think about
the poor routers modems and hardware
that are still exploitable now that we
can tell that we are vulnerable what can
we do with this bug well the
possibilities are almost endless as this
bug basically allows you to execute any
bash command on the remote machine many
people have already written short
scripts to modify web pages on a server
this could be to output the contents of
a system file on the server or insert
malicious
frames in two pages there are also
scripts out there for initializing
reverse shelves and creating backdoors
people have been detected scanning
through IP ranges adding all of the
vulnerable IPS to a botnet it can be
assumed that this will this botnet will
be used for datastax sending the command
to W get or ping to all the machines
that you know a vulnerable could prove
to be some serious firepower there is
even some rumors that someone has
written a worm that is that once
penetrating one machine on a network it
attacks every other machine from there I
hope you found this interesting I will
provide useful links in the description
if you are interested in playing around
with this bug remember to get your
servers patched thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
