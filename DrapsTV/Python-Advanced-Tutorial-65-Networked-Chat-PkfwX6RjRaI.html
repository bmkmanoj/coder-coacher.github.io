network chat in this video we'll be
extending upon the topic of networking
by building a simple command line chat
program to try and get a more deep
understanding of networking every video
overall slideshows and code available in
the description some quick preamble this
video is an extension of Python advanced
six networking video if you get to watch
it an annotation will be on screen for a
few seconds the networking videos covers
covers how to set up TCP and UDP
connections on to the chat program how
does it work well we have two programs
the server which will everyone will send
their messages to and a client which
will send messages to the server and
receive messages from the server because
I want this to run on both Windows and
UNIX I'm going to go the system where
the chat only updates when you send a
message or send nothing the event-driven
command-line is handled differently on
Windows to Unix so feel free to change
the program yourself ok first we'll make
the server for the chat let's name it
chat server PI so I'll come across to
run to them chat server dot PI ok now
we're going to need to import socket
because we're going to be using
networking and we'll import time so we
can put out time stamps for when
messages come in ok so we'll set a host
name so the host is going to be
ourselves to 127.0.0.1 which is the
loopback address and a port and we'll
make the port something easy to remember
like 5,000 ok now let's create a list
for all the clients
so click clients and we'll make that an
empty list now we've got a bind
where we create our socket object so s
equals socket socket and we're going to
use UDP so we need to set the socket
type to sock diagram so we'll set up the
family first so stock
af underscore I know and then we want
socket dot sock underscore D gram the
data gram
okay now we're going to bind to this
computer so bind to the host and the
port okay now we're going to set our
socket to non-blocking so set blocking
zero and this means that whenever it
tries to receive from it will not block
it will just try and grab data from the
stream if there's nothing there then it
will throw an error okay we'll set up a
quick variable called quitting oops
quitting make that equal false to start
with and we'll print out the server is
started so server started well started
okay let's set up our while so while not
quitting we're going to try and we use
the try because I received from will
throw an error there's no no data to
receive and then we're going to try and
grab the data and the address of data
that's coming in so the socket dot
receive from and we're going to grab a
buffer of 1,024 okay now if the there's
a quit with a capital Q in string data
so the if one of the user sends quit
with the capital Q it will quit the
server so we'll set quitting
the quitting to equal true okay
now we'll set up another if so if the
address that we're currently receiving a
message from not in clients then we're
going to add it to the list of clients
so clients dot append address okay now
that we've added their client to a list
we're going to print out a timestamp so
time dot C time and little put timed
time in them plus the string of the
address so we know who the message is
coming from plus add a bit of spacing in
some colons plus the string of the data
that was sent across by that user okay
now for all the clients so for client in
clients clients we're going to send the
message to them all so s dot send to and
we're going to send the data to the
current client in the for-loop client
okay so that will go through the list of
clients that are currently talking in
the chat and we'll send them the message
sent to the server and we'll set our
accept up so if there's nothing left in
the stream to grab out with the receive
from method then we're going to just
pass and try again now if we've quit we
want to close the socket so s close and
we'll close the socket and that's our
server done so let's save this right
click and we'll try running it so python
chat server dot PI and so started no
errors and it successfully running and
waiting for messages to come in I'll
jump out of that
now it's let's create our chat client so
come across yeah our client program will
ask the user for a username and a
separate head thread will handle all the
incoming messages from the server and
because the event-driven command-line
tricks are different for each OS we'll
just press ENTER to refresh okay so our
chat client doc PI okay
so for our client what we want to do is
we want to import the socket module
again so import socket because we're
going to be using networking and we'll
import threading because we're going to
use a thread and we'll import time as
well so you can put a short delay after
sending messages okay so we'll create a
lock for our thread so T lock and this
will just stop our program from trying
to get output to the screen at the same
time so threading lock is what worth
creating and we'll create a variable
called shutdown which will tell the
thread to shut down when the program
exits okay now let's define our thread
function so def receiving and receiving
will take a name for the thread and the
socket object okay
so while not shutdown so while the
program is still running we're going to
try and then we're going to acquire the
lock so T lock key locked
. choir and then file true so we're
going to keep going looping forever
we're going to try and grab the data and
the address from the socket type receive
from buffer and it's going to take the
buffer 1,024 okay now we're going to
print out the string of the data that
came in okay now we're going to write
our accept accept
lootus pass and then now finally is
going to release the thread lock so you
might be thinking that that whale won't
end but that whale will end when the
error is caused from the sock receive
from when there's nothing left to grab
out of the receiving buffer it will
throw an error which will then jump out
of that whale true so our T lock will
release and that's our thread done okay
so let's set up the host so the host is
equal to our self dot 0 dot 0 dot 1 so
the loop back address and we're going to
set the port to equal 0 this time and a
port number of 0 it means it will pick
any free port that's currently on the
computer ok so we'll set the server
details up so the server is equal to 1
to 7 dot 0 dot 0 1 which is the loop
back address so this machine and the
server is on port 5,000 put these put
this whole thing in brackets it's a
total okay
now let's set up our socket so s equals
socket
don't suck it and using UDP so setup
socket family socket dot AF underscore
eye net and the socket type so suck it
dot sock underscore D gram okay now
we'll bind to this bind to a port so
bind and we want to bind to this host
and port and we'll set non blocking so
set blocking to zero and now we can
create our receiving thread so RT for
receiving thread equals threading dot
thread and target function is receiving
and the arguments the name so we'll call
it receive thread and we'll pass it the
socket okay
let's tell our receiving thread to start
and this will start trying to receive
messages from the sub ok now on to our
sending messages so we'll set up an
alias for the user so they have a
nickname so alias equals raw underscore
input and we'll just ask for their name
ok now let's get the messages at word
that they want to send to everybody on
the chat service message equals raw
underscore input and we'll put the alias
plus a little arrow oops
yeah a little arrow say you can type to
start typing after this okay now
while so while the message that the user
is sending does not equal Q lowercase Q
which we're going to use to quit the
program so while they're not trying to
quit the program we're going to start
trying to send so if the message does
not equal empty so nothing in it then
we're going to try and send it so we're
going to s dot send to and we're going
to send the alias plus put like colon in
there and space plus the message and
we're gonna send that to this server
okay now we want to require the lock so
T lock dot quail and we'll try and get a
new message send if they want to they
want to send a new message message
equals raw underscore input and alias
plus the arrow okay
now we can release the the lock to lock
release and we'll time dot sleep 4.2
over second okay so that's our sending
done so we can now send messages to the
server and we can also receive messages
as our thread will handle that now if
the player if the client chooses to quit
and we're going to shutdown equals true
so that'll tell the thread to shut down
and then we'll wait for the threat so RT
join wait for that to shut down and then
we will close the socket so s start
closed
and that's our client ridden so let's
save this so right quit and we'll run
our server over here now we've got our
server running I'll come over to another
window over here and I'll run the Python
chat client dot PI up up misspelled it
chat client there you go so it's asking
for a name pop it in traps and now it's
asking me to send a message so I'll send
hello and as you can see over here on
the server we receive a message from
alias traps and it's hello and it's
coming in from port 39,000 236 so that
must have been free free slot on this
video okay so not much point just
chatting to yourself so I'll open up
another window here and I'll run the
Python chat client dot PI up did it
again
tap client okay so call it Fred and
we'll say hello it spread and as you can
see Fred is popped up and chatting in
our server and is coming in from port 59
thousand five hundred and thirty three
now over here on wraps if we refresh
we'll see that we get the hell out that
I sent earlier as well as the Fred
saying hello I can keep messaging just
say hello Fred and I'll come through
that I've said hello Fred and then we'll
see that Fred says hello and then I say
hello Fred and how I
and then refresh and says how are you
can see good bread and there we go so we
got our chat program happening and we
got these two clients chatting to each
other okay so that's our chat program
done and you can add as many clients as
you want in and they can all chat on the
one server cool well I hope this example
helped your understanding of how sockets
communicate as well as showed you how we
can use the non non blocking on sockets
