four Network tools in this video we'll
be moving on two kinds of tools you
might be using in a network admin role
thankfully a much shorter video this
time every video also lectures and code
available in the description an
important topic that I left out of the
general tasks is the keyboard shortcuts
at your disposal I briefly talked about
the tab key shortcut which will
autocomplete the folder or file that
you're currently writing you can run
into issues when there is more than one
thing with a similar name another
incredibly useful tool is scrolling
through the history of your commands
you've used this session the up key will
scroll upwards through your history and
the down will scroll back down to the
more recent commands the final crucial
key shortcut is the abort current
command process to abort a command
that's taking too long or in an infinite
loop we can force the program to close
by holding ctrl and pressing the C key
these last two commands are fun to mess
around with but honestly I can't tell
you a time where I've used either of
them often when having to do any network
setup or when diagnosing network
problems you need to check the IP
settings on the computer to check it's
configured correctly IP config allows us
to check all kinds of config settings
for all our network cards or interfaces
IP config also lets us check and refresh
the computer's DNS cache and DHCP
allocations IP config follows our
pattern command then option there are
several options we can use keep in mind
that flushing your DNS cache will have a
resulting effect to be safe try to only
use the flush option when CMD is not
running as administrator let's try a few
of these commands out and see what kind
of results we get okay so come over to
CMD and try I P config by itself and we
can see we get all of our adapters and
some information about them just the
summary so we can see what our ipv6
address is what our ipv4 address is our
subnet mask default gateway etc and if
we use IP config for - oh we get a bit
more of a detailed output so as you can
see we got lease obtained lease expires
etc whether we're using d
hcp enabled yes or no auto-configuration
is enabled our DNS servers and whether
our NetBIOS over tcp/ip etc and you can
also get a description of the adapter on
your computer cool let's clear the
screen come back a very useful command
that many people forget about is
nslookup with nslookup we can search any
domain name and our default DNS server
will look up that IP address that is
associated with the domain name this can
be quite useful if you're experiencing
DNS issues let's give it a try as that
should give you a very good idea of what
to expect from this command ok so we'll
come back over CMD and let's try NS look
up google.com and we run that and we see
we get the server is Google - public -
DNS - a Google so I'm using Google as my
default DNS and the answer that we get
back from my Google DNS is all the IP
addresses that it knows google.com from
so this is an IP address for a Google
server this is an IP address for a
Google server that the DNS server wants
me to know about
cool next we have a very useful tool
called netstat nets that lists all of
your computer's active network
connections the command shows us the
protocol and use the local and remote IP
addresses and ports as well as the
connection status we can get even more
information out of this command by using
the - a option to list all currently
listening or running connections or
sockets also we can change this option
to the - ayo option which will also show
the process ID of the program using that
connection which is very useful for
finding any suspicious or unnecessary
open ports on your computer let's give
the command a shot and list all of our
currently active network connections ok
so come over to CMD have the screen clip
alright and we'll type netstat
Hey now it'll start looking at our
computer and seeing what sockets and
ports we have open all right and we can
scroll up and we can see there's some
some unconnected UDP sockets and we've
got some TCP sockets that are listening
on certain addresses so we've got a
bunch of local addresses that are just
trying to talk to the computer itself
and then we've got some more remote
stuff going on so my address is trying
to communicate with some outside foreign
addresses and we've got a couple
established but most of them are closed
and I've stopped that connection cool so
if we do the same command but put an
arrow on the end we get the process ID
that's using those ports now ctrl C to
cancel this cool will clear the screen
and we'll jump back over the slideshow I
should mention that I use this command
quite often all right now for an
easy-to-remember command that you'll
probably use many times ping ping allows
us to check a connection with a computer
or server slash website the ping command
sends a message to a destination address
and a response comes back you can think
of a submarine making a ping noise and
when it hits something it comes back and
lets the submarine know there's
something there I know in the past when
I was testing what cable is mine on the
networks which I ran an infinite ping
with the dash T option and when the ping
started timing out and you had found my
cable
let's give ping a quick shot so we'll
come back over to our command prompt I
will type ping and we'll do google.com I
will say pinging and we get our replies
back so we're sending 32 bytes of data
and it's taking 17 milliseconds with the
time-to-live of 59 and nine milliseconds
nine milliseconds 38 milliseconds and it
gives you an average the maximum the
minimum etc cool next we have the
command that works very similar to ping
called trace RT or pathping trace RT
stands for trace route trace route sends
a ping to a server or destination just
like ping however it tells everything
that it passes through to send a ping
back to us with how long it took to get
there this is really great for testing
issues with your connection to a server
or for how many routers you pass through
to get to a website or friend the
structure for this command is just like
ping trace RT then a web address or IP
address I'll let you test this one on
your own
alternatively to trace RT you can use
the path ping which is a relatively new
addition to Windows that works very
similar to trace RT however it takes
longer and gives you many more stats to
look at finally let's look at the ARP
command the up command allows us to view
the tables our computer holds of the
address resolution protocol or ARP
tables for short the ARP tables store
all the network and physical addresses
of other devices on the local network
that your computer knows about we can
view the ARP tables using the command up
space - a so let's give it a shot so
come over to our CMD I'll type up space
- eh all right and when we run that we
see we get our interfaces so here's my
my main interface and it's got my list
of all of the devices on the network
that I know about so I've got some
static ones that it knows about so the
broadcast addresses and a couple of
other stuff that's used for VN BMS we've
also got some other hosts on the network
with their IP addresses and their
physical addresses as well as all of
your other interfaces if you have any
cool you should never need to manually
add an ARP entry as all modern network
cards have ARP protocol chips that
handle the protocol functionality but if
you need to you can add manual entries
with the - s option seen here alright
great work you may never use some of
these commands in your line of work but
you know they're there now the next
thing we'll be looking at is using our
new skills to create batch scripts to
automate simple tasks if you have any
questions leave it in the comments and
I'll try to answer it as best as
possible don't forget to subscribe
