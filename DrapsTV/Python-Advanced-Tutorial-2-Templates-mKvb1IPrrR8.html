in this video we'll be looking at
templating what it is how to use it and
why to use it every video up all
slideshows and code available in the
description okay so what is a template
well the template is just like it sounds
it's a formatted layout that you fill in
with important things a Python template
module is part of the string module as
it uses a string to define the template
templates key feature is that it allows
data to change without having to edit
the application every time okay so how
does it work well template cast class
takes a string as a template within the
string we use placeholder variable names
with a preceding dollar sign to deter to
depict that it's a placeholder we can
then substitute values into the template
with the substitute method using the
using a dictionary where the keys in the
dictionary match the placeholder
variable names the return string is the
template with all the values rather than
the placeholders should also be noted
that a placeholder variable name should
follow the same naming conventions as
Python okay so let's make something now
we will make a simple output program
that will output info about the users
card we will use a template to format
the output and fill it in with our cards
info so let's create a file called title
PA so dim car whoops car py okay so
we're going to need the template module
so from string import template okay now
we'll create our main function so that's
me and we'll create our cart list so
that will hold all the information about
a cart now this information could come
from a database or from a file or
anything like that but for now we'll
just talk about it so that we can do
this quickly
okay so cut append
and we're going to put a dictionary in
it so dick and we use the keyword item
just to the to depict the name of the
item so go coke is one of the item names
and we'll use the key price for the
total price for that item in the card
so we'll do $8 and we use quantity for
the quant quantity of the item so the
quantity of two is you know four dollars
a throw a bottle of coke two of them
eight dollars
okay card dot append dict open that and
our item let's make it cake and the
price of one cake make it twelve dollars
and the quantity make a one and we'll
add one last item so cut end and
dictionary item make it equal fish okay
so fish will make total price the fish
32 and the quantity is four okay so now
that we've got our card where you just
have to work on our output so we'll
create a template so objects t equals a
template and our template will be dollar
sign TTY quantity and 2x and the item
name
and put item and then we'll make that
equal the price so dollar price okay so
our templates done so those values will
be replaced by our values in our cup and
we'll create a temporary variable called
total so keep total of all of the prices
and to make it nice we'll print cut so
that we know it's cut look that is to be
a low key speed okay so for the data in
our cart we are going to print T lot
subs substitute to and we're going to
substitute the data values into our
template and then print it out and we'll
add to our total total plus equals our
data open square brackets and our price
keyword so open quotes price and that
will add the price on to our total okay
now let's print out our total after
we've put it for total plus string of
turtle so we know that the total cost is
going to be okay so that's our main
written we'll just write out if name so
if name equal to main
then we are going to run me okay
so let's save this hopefully it works
python cart py and we get our cut is two
times Kirk which equals eight one times
cake is 12 4 times fish is 32 and a
total is 52 okay so that worked cool
now if we come back to our slide show
okay so errors are possible in templates
but mostly they occur while you're
programming them so for debugging
purposes here are a few common ones the
no placeholder match which will give a
key error this is usually because there
was no key and the value in the
dictionary to match just match the
placeholder and there's also the bad
placeholder error which will give a
value error this is usually the
placeholder starting with an invalid
character or it's not being existent so
it's usually there's a number at the
start of your placeholder variable okay
so we can have the template handle these
problems by using the safe substitute
method of the template class this will
return a string no matter what however
any result unresolved keys and braces
will result in a that will be in the
resulting string as we can see in this
example template dollar name had dollar
money is only given the value for the
name so we get the output
Jim had dollar money rather than the
proper than a proper output so though it
handles these errors it should only be
used where the error may occur out of
your control otherwise it's considered
sloppy coding and may leave unused and
dangling keys in your template which may
cause errors later down the track okay
it's also possible for us to create a
custom delimiter by using a subclass and
overriding the default in the template
class this is great when the user may be
at creating
template from the demand line so let's
edit our current program do use the hash
symbol rather than the dollar sign okay
so come back open up our program again
and this time we're going to be
overriding the template class so we'll
create a sub class class and we'll call
it my template and that'll take a
template as the base class and we're
going to override the delimiter
variables so delimiter equals and it's
the char the hash symbol okay so now now
that we've changed the delimiter we're
going to need a change our template so
we're going to use my template instead
of template and instead of using dollar
signs but use our hash symbol that we
set up okay so we've got hash quantity X
hash item equals hash price and this
will substitute our values in but we're
using the hash delimiter this time okay
so let's save this and run it we should
get the same output if everything worked
correctly and there we go
so you don't have to use the dollar sign
but you know it's the default so if
you're going to be using something that
the user may be creating a template hash
tags are pretty common these days or
even using the percent sign is pretty
common okay so now that we looked at how
would to use a template let's cover why
should we use one the main reason for me
is that it saves time and reduce the
size of my code files but it's also good
for allowing the user to create
templates for example a program that
renames all of the image files in a
directory with the rename style that
they construct as seen here we would
rename all of the photos with the name
my photo underscore the file number plus
the images format
templates are also extremely useful for
webpages because usually a web page will
look the same but contain different data
this works great with the CGI
programming in Python but more on that
in a later tutorial some things to note
about templates is that you can escape
the delimiter if needed by using two
consecutive delimiters for example
template you owe me
dollar dollar zero we'll use the dollar
sign as the character rather than a
placeholder we can also use custom
regular expressions on templates when we
create a subclass and override the ID
pattern variable by default it's set to
accept underscores and alphanumeric
characters we can also use curly braces
to I don't identify which part of the
delimiter is the placeholder variable
name in this example I have the template
the place yard is far away where the
yard is appended to the result of the
placeholder so if we use the value ship
the output would be the shipyard is far
away but this could be replaced with
farm or a number of other places I hope
you now have a better understanding of
what templates are and how they work and
when to use them of course there won't
always be practical but sometimes they
can be a lifesaver
next we're going to cover opt Pass
