seven arrays in this video we're
learning how we can store multiple
values in one variable every video of
all slideshows and code available in the
description so what is an array arrays
are a special type of variable that can
hold multiple values under the same name
this has many benefits but the biggest
is the ability to loop over each of the
values inside an array originally if we
wanted to store three numbers like 4 8
and 16 we needed to create three
separate variables using an array
however we can store all three inside
the one variable we can then access each
of the values inside the array we
created by using square brackets on the
end of our variable with the index
inside the index is a whole number
starting from 0 so if we wanted to alert
out the first value inside of our array
we will type my array open square
brackets 0 close square brackets and
that would grab the first value that was
stored inside the array if you wanted
the second value would place a 1 inside
the square brackets we briefly saw how
to create an array on the first slide
there are a few ways of creating arrays
in JavaScript
but we're going to focus on the two main
ways the safest and most straightforward
way of creating an array is to assign a
variable with each of the values between
square brackets each separated by a
comma in the example here we create a
new array called my array with two
values value 1 and value 2 from the
second line we create an empty array and
override the values inside my array the
second way is to use javascript new
keyword to create a new object of array
will look more objects in the next video
I suggest trying to only use the first
method in your code as it is more clear
and concise the one reading code written
by others you may see the new keyword
used with an array so I want you to be
aware that it does the same thing okay
now for the powerful part arrays go
hand-in-hand with for loops for loops
are designed to look for a specific
number of times and they even hold a
value while looping this makes
brilliant for looping through each index
of an array in the example here we have
a for loop that counts from 0 to the
length of the array called my array the
length is a special value also called a
property of every array which keeps the
total number of values inside the array
each time the loop is run the element I
in the array will be added on to the end
of the text string all right enough
talking let's give it a shot let's make
a script that creates an array of
numbers then we'll loop through and
calculate the average
let's call array dot HTML all right so
let's come over and let's use our hello
dot HTML as a template and first thing
we want to do is create our array so
inside of a script tag we're gonna go a
far and we'll call it be consistent my
array and it's gonna equal open square
brackets and let's have these set of
numbers still powers of 2 so 2 4 8 16 32
64 128 and 256 all right then put a
semicolon on the end now we've got our
array defined and it has its eight
elements now let's create another
variable which is going to be our sum
which we're going to be we're gonna use
to get the average so sum 0 and now
we're going to perform a for loop so
therefore open up our parentheses do I
for our index 0 I is less than my array
so we're gonna grab our array and we're
gonna get the dot length now this is the
lowercase L and it is case-sensitive so
we need to make sure it's a lowercase L
for length : pi plus plus so we're going
to iterate all the way from 0 up to my
array length and we don't want to
actually reach the turtle number because
we're starting from 0 not 1 so we're
just going
until we hit the length all right so
close off our parentheses and we'll hook
up curly braces inside therefore what
we're going to do is our sum plus equals
my array ripping square brackets and
we're going to put in our eye which will
start off at zero and then it'll go up
to one two three four etc and pull out
each of the numbers inside of our array
and put a semicolon on the end of that
so now that we've got a our sum after
that for loop completes what we're going
to do is you know in our HTML of our
output as usual output we'll get rid of
this line here and we're going to make
that equal to the sum divided by my
array dot length and once again
lowercase L so that will divide the
total sum of all of the numbers and will
provide us with the average number all
right cool so we'll see all this and say
that oh sure to rename that say that as
I call it a radar HTML all right so
let's give it a shot come over and we'll
drag our radar HTML into our web browser
and we get six three point seven five if
we look at is rounded out of here and we
got much larger numbers up here to the
smaller numbers here so the average does
sit around about a hit oh cool now that
we can create a raise it is useful to be
able to add new data into an array there
are several ways we can do this simply
we can just specify the next element in
the array and set a value to it for
example here I have an array that
currently has four elements and I want
to add a fifth one on to the end so
inside the square brackets I put a four
because we start counting from zero and
set a new value in this case it's the
string new element another way of adding
a single value onto the end is with the
push method a function that belongs to
every array variable so we can type my
array dot push and
in the brackets and new element which
will push a new element onto the end of
the array finally we can join another
whole array onto the end of our array
using the concat method concat stands
for concatenation and adds another array
onto the end of the current array we
just saw two useful methods that belong
to every array it turns out there is a
bunch of useful methods that perform
certain tasks on your array a really
useful one is dot sort this will sort
the array in alphabetical order this
doesn't quite work for numbers because
by default the sort function will turn
everything into strings to sort it in a
later video on callbacks we'll look at
how we can sort numbers in JavaScript
another useful method is dot splice this
can be confusing but is very useful if
you want to remove insert or insert and
remove into the middle of an array the
parameters it takes is the index to
start splicing from the number of items
you wish to delete from that point which
can be 0 and then new items to add in
there are quite a few methods that we
can use with arrays I'll put a link in
the description ok let's make a script
that takes names from the user and adds
them to an array sorts them
alphabetically and then outputs a list
to the screen the perfect tool for
organizing your party lists so on that
note let's call it party list HTML will
use the add dot HTML template once again
to save time so we'll open up our add
HTML with our text editor and inside my
function we're gonna actually rename our
my function this time and call it
something different so it's called a
update list because instead of reloading
the page every time we want to use this
we're going to update the current page
over and over again and because we want
to keep our list of people over the over
the JavaScript being loaded we're going
to create our variable as a global so
var people and that's just gonna equal
an empty array to start with so we're
not gonna have anything inside the
square brackets it's just a plain
brand-new
ray with nothing in it and called people
alright so inside of our update list
we're going to have our first var which
we're going to call it our name which is
we're going to get from our document and
down the bottom here in our actual HTML
we can get rid of one of our input
fields we're going to need one and we're
going to call it name it's going to be
the name of the person we're entering
it's type text and let's call the ID
full name that's the full name of the
person so copy that and paste that into
the element we're getting by ID and
we're grabbing the value out so the name
we want to enter here we can remove this
second line because we don't need a
second number or anything like that
and now we're going to add that person
to our list so people which is our array
so now what we're going to do is we're
going to add that name to our people
array so people dot push and we're going
to push on the name that is entered and
then we're going to sort our array so
we're going to people dot sort and
that'll sort it alphabetically and we'll
actually grab our document get element
by ID here and we'll set that to an
empty set of strings because we want to
clear out any previous output that has
been made and then for our I equals 0 I
is less than how people people dot
length we're going to increment I and
inside of our for loop we're going to
output our names so our copy our
document get element by ID output and
we're going to instead of just equals
we're going to plus equals so we're
going to add on to the end of what's
currently been outputted
going to add on people dot book people
sorry open square brackets i+ open
quotes and we're going to do a line
break with a self closing slash so that
it will place each of the names in
alphabetical order as we go through the
list and put them each on a new separate
line cool so that's our update list
function done now we need to come down
to our button on click and currently
we've got an unclick and this is my
function we want to change that to our
update list and we'll call instead of
equals we'll call it insert and for some
little flourish above our output will do
h3 of names and close off our h3 and
then we'll add a horizontal rule so HR
and self closing tag
all right let's say that as our party
list so save as party list don't HTML
let's drag it into our web browser and
we get our names list so we can start
adding in some names so let's do Fred
Flynt insert we got our Fred Flint
now we can come along and we can add
something like Ted Ted waters inside
that and it's been alphabetized already
because the F becomes 40 yeah it's
something like Alex
William insert that and comes up the top
and we started to build out this list of
names which is pretty useful awesome so
successfully used a array to store a
bunch of names and added to it from the
one document without having to refresh
the page
who this concludes our look at arrays in
JavaScript next we'll be looking at
using objects to store data together
with other related data if you have any
questions leave it in the comments and
I'll try to answer as best as possible
