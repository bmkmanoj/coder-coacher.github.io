modulating our code every video have all
slideshows anchor it available in the
description modulating our code in
Python is the process of splitting up
our program into multiple files Python
keeps this as easy as possible while
also allowing for complex packages to be
made splitting up our code to make for
more manageable code as well as the
ability to Matney to make each file have
a specific purpose making packages is a
great way to compile tools for other
developers because they can just import
the stuff they need designing your
program with modules in mind is a strong
skill to learn when programming though
this is something you usually figure out
how to do it yourself some tips would be
to keep classes that will or could be
used in multiple files as their own
separate file and making sure every file
has a specific purpose to use the code
from another file we have two possible
ways one is to just import the module
and then we have to declare the module
before using each class or function or
to use the from keyword and import a
class or function for direct use so
let's have a look at splitting up our
code into two files we'll have a vector
2d module and a mod module the mod file
will have our main function and we'll
import the vector 2d module for use
we'll also look at the two ways of
importing so let let's create a vector
2d dot pi if you still have the code
from our class tutorial you can just
import that and we'll also create a mod
dot pi file so create my vector 2d dot
pi and I'm just going to make a simple
vector 2d class so class vector 2d and
it will have an initialization oops I
needed to death that
so it's gonna take itself x and a y and
self-thought x equals x and self dot y
equals y and that's the vector D basic
skeleton done
so I'll save that now I'm going to
create one more file which is going to
be the Maud pie file and in here we're
going to import our vector to the module
so we're gonna go import vector to D and
now that that's imported we can start
writing our main function
so we're deaf main and inside i main
we're going to create two vectors so
create back one just gonna be equal to
vector 2d so the module name dot and
then the class so vector 2d and the
class has capital B and capital D and
we'll set the x - 5 and the Y - 6 and
we'll create another vector so back to
equals vector 2d module with the vector
2d class oh let's bug it up somewhere Oh
in the first line mr. C okay and we'll
just set this to 1 1 and now we'll print
them out to see that it's working so
print back 1 X print back to dot y print
back go back wonder why sorry back to
dot X and print back to dot y
oh right out if sir if I'm let's go into
a name that's good
underscore equal to main then we want to
run main okay so now we can save this
and we can check out how our import
worked so we only have to run one file
so we run out from mod file the one that
contains our main so python mod py and
we get the output of 5 6 &amp;amp; 1 1 so our
first vector was 5 6 and our second
vector was 1 1 so that all worked
correctly now we'll look at the other
way of importing so rather than using
the import command or keyword we can use
the from keyword so from vector 2d the
module we want to import the class so
vector 2d and that will import a class
for direct use so what we can do is we
can remove the module reference at the
start and just call the class name and
we don't have to worry about specifying
what module that class came from and now
if we save this and we run it we should
get the same output yep so our vector
worked correctly we eat from our other
file and used it you know main file okay
lastly we have packages packages are
more complex structured used for come
compiling large amounts of modules this
could be things like physics engines
networking tools or even graphical
packages that allow you to make windows
for the user to interact with packages
spend multiple folders you have the base
package which is then split into sub
packages if needed Python also uses
special file names to do certain tasks
in a package for an example of a package
there will be a zip file in the slides
for
which will have Curtis files but we will
have a comment in each file detailing
how to access that module or what the
file does if you're interested in
packages I suggest looking in the inert
PI file this concludes our look at
modulating and also the intermediate
series code will be available in the
code txt and slide in the slides' folder
as well as a challenge task
don't fear if you don't remember all of
this you can easily come back and
re-watch this video to consolidate all
the information if you have any
questions feel free to leave them in the
comments thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
