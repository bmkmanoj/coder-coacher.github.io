nine DOM and events in this video we'll
be learning about Dom will mostly focus
on how to use the event system to make
our pages more reactive this will be a
shorter video as well it is an important
topic it can be boring and is small
compared to other topics every video
have all slideshows and code available
in the description so what is Dom Dom
stands for domain object model and is
the system your web browser uses to
represent the HTML web page as objects
we have actually been using it already
for modifying elements in our web page
with our usual document element in HTML
we are accessing the inner HTML property
of the object representing the element
with the ID just like normal objects we
access properties with dot notation
w3schools provides a nice image that
helps you get your head around how the
DOM is structured each web page starts
with a document object from there we
have the HTML tag as the root node in
the document from here the nodes build
out in a structure and belong to either
the root node or to another tag we can
see here in the body object that it has
a link and a heading node the heading
has a child text node this text node is
very important and acts as the container
to hold the text generally you won't
have to worry about this unless you're
building a pretty complex page
manipulation system okay so what can we
do with Dom Dom gives us the power to
add move or even delete HTML elements we
can also modify styles that are
affecting elements so if we wanted to we
could build the whole webpage with
JavaScript there are several reasons why
we wouldn't dynamically create the whole
page time being a big factor and also
support for search engines Dom also
allows us to trigger code when events
happen we've actually already used the
on click event to run code in earlier
videos to access properties of a HTML
element we use the dot notation because
under the hood these elements are
objects like we learned in the last
video so to modify the style of an
element we access the style property
that belongs to a HTML element and then
the CSS property name I'll put a link in
the description to all the CSS
properties you can modify
to dynamically create a new element it
takes a little more work the document
object has some utility functions that
allow us to create new elements and
nodes in the document first we need to
create the element in the first line of
this example we create a P element for
the paragraph but we are not done yet we
can't put text in it yet next we need to
create a text node to hold the text
inside the element again we use a
utility function from the document
object now that we have created the text
node we can add it onto our paragraph by
using the appendchild function every
element has an append child function so
you can think of it as placing an
element between the start and end tags
over the element okay before we get it
into our example let's cover Dom events
events trigger when certain criteria are
met we have used this for mouse clicks
but there are other events such as
onload mouse over key presses etc you
can set these events to run a function
that you've created so in the example
here we have a button which we have set
its own click event to run the function
my function this should look familiar
here are a few commonly used events you
have most likely encountered most of
these online on change an on submit are
quite useful for checking forms before
they're submitted to see if somebody has
accidentally missed a field I'll put a
link in the description to a list of all
possible events okay finally let's jump
into an example we'll create a custom
button that can change how it looks
based on certain event triggers such as
a mouse over or a mouse click let's call
it button events dot HTML all right so
I'm going to just grab some and use it
as a template and file save as and I'm
going to set it to the button events all
right so I'm going to be creating a
function so I'm just going to get rid of
the body section of that function and
also the body of the HTML document and
I'm going to rename my function to set
color and I'm going to reuse this
function so I'm gonna pass in an element
so this is going to be the element that
I want to set the color of
and I'm also going to pass in their
color so the color that I want to set
that element alright so I'm going to
access the Dom properties of this
element so element dot style so I'm
gonna access the style and then the
style property that I want to access is
background color with a capital C and
I'm gonna set that to equal the color
that I pass in all right so that's our
function written that's that we're going
to use for all of our events so now I'm
going to create a div that has no
special styling or anything on it yet
and this div is going to be a new button
so on mouse-over it's going to equal
open quotes and we're going to set color
so we're going to call our set color
function and we're going to pass in this
so this div element we're going to pass
in comma and then a color to set it so I
might just do a hash d-10 or 1 1 that's
a simple enough color and then we'll
close off our brackets and we'll close
off our chords alright let's add another
event so I'm going to go down to the
next line so it's nice and easy for you
to see and I'm gonna call this one on
click so it's going to be on click event
so when somebody clicks the div we're
going to set color again and we're going
to pass in this comma and what color
shall I set it let's set it to a I don't
know a very bright color so I'll do f
f/a BB v all right so I'll close that
off and close off that event all right
and I'll add another one so on to this
one as on Mouse leave so on Mouse leave
alright so when the mouse leaves the
divs area going to set color again I'm
gonna pass in this and what color should
we set this time let's do let's do
another very like you
truecolor soldiers to hash a3 b3 and
it's the f3 this let's make a blue
iconic color alright so close up at
quotes on that one
so that's each of our event set now
let's set the style of the button so
that we can actually see it and it's not
invisible
so style equals and we'll set the
background color style so in CSS the
background color is the background color
of this element so let's set this to say
a very gray color so F 0 F 0 F 0 alright
and semicolon and we're going to set a
width the width is gonna be say 80
pixels and we'll do a height and we'll
make that say 20 pixels and semicolon
and then we'll have some padding so
padding and I'll so that's 20 pixels as
well so the button should be easy enough
to see then I'll close off these cords
and close off the div alright so inside
the div I'm going to just have the words
a button exclamation mark and then I'm
going to close off my div alright so
we've created a div that has three
events so on the mouse over it'll set
the color on mouse click it'll set the
color and on Mouse leave it'll set the
color each time calling this set color
and passing in itself as the element all
right so let's save this and let's give
it a shot so I'll drag it into my web
browser and we get this button so it
might be a little hard to see oh there's
a zoom in and as we move in it sets the
color to red to move out goes to a blue
you can of color and if we click it goes
to a pinky kind of color awesome and if
you wanted to run code if something
clicked on it you could also add that
into our own click awesome just like you
can with other element properties you
can set the events function by directly
assigning it to the objects event in the
example here we set the buttons on click
to our
do something function this concludes our
look at DOM and events in JavaScript
next we'll be looking at using built-in
tools for working with dates math and
formatting things you have any questions
leave it in the comments and I'll try to
answer as best as possible don't forget
