every video have all slideshows and code
available in description so what is a
method I slightly touched on this last
tutorial but basically it's a function
that belongs to a class however there
are different types of methods that a
class can have in Python we have basic
methods and then we have special methods
special methods can be split up into
basic descriptors container and numeric
an important feature of Python ORP is
that all methods require a self
parameter to be able to interact with
the class's data this self is used to
reference a current instance you get to
see this in action in this tutorial in
this tutorial we'll look at learning to
use the basic methods as well as the
basic special methods and numeric
methods descriptors and containers can
be hard to understand so I'll leave them
for a more advanced tutorial while we
look at this topic we'll build a two
dimensional vector class basic methods
worked as a normal function that can do
almost anything to a class or with the
classes data they can have parameters
and they can also return things if
needed if you had a look at the extra
code in the previous tutorial you'll
have seen a basic method that I called
add so let's start writing our back to
class and while we build it will add to
it as we go so let's create a file
called vector 2 D 2 pi ok so vector 2 D
PI ok so we're creating a class so type
class and it's gonna be a vector 2 D so
a capital B and a capital D on the end
and we're gonna have two variables we're
gonna have an x and a y position so X is
going to equal zero point zero zero and
Y it's gonna equal zero point zero zero
and we're gonna have a we're gonna need
a basic method to be able to set these
values and change them so def
and we're gonna call it set and we're
gonna pass in itself so you can change
the variables x and y and an x and a y
to pass in to set the new values so to
access these we type self dot x and then
we're going to make that equal to the X
that we passed into our set function and
we're gonna have self dot Y which is
going to equal the Y that we pass into
our function and that's our basic class
that holds an x and y position and we
can set them okay so that's the vote to
find our main so death main and in here
we'll create an instead object of our
vector 2d class call it back equals
vector 2d and then we're gonna set some
values for it so back dot set and we'll
set X to 5 and we'll set y to 6
okay now we're going to print it out so
print open up our courts X colon and
we're gonna add string of vector X and
we're gonna add a comma and a Y colon
and then add our string of vector pi so
we can see what we said and now what
we'll call that mean so if underscore is
good name I'm just gonna score it's
equal to it's gonna score main I'm just
going to go
and we're gonna call main you know let's
let's try running this and check it all
works I do okay and we get five x equals
five in y equals six so we're
successfully stored two values you know
one vector class okay so now this is
great and you can do almost everything
with this understanding of methods
however we can make our classes much
easier to work with and make interaction
with the class much more friendlier
special methods are recognized methods
that Python uses for a lot of its
inbuilt features these can let us
initialize our objects on create all the
way to allowing us to print our class so
initialization initialization is an
important part of object-oriented
programming it allows us to set the
values or even create the attributes of
a class only when an object of that
class is created for example in our last
piece of code we set the X and y
attributes with the set method instead
of this we can pass in the values when
we create the object removing the need
to set its values after we create the
object so let's modify our code to
implement the special method called init
okay so we'll come back and we'll edit
our code now we can remove our x and y
attributes because we'll create them in
our initialization and instead of
removing set we'll just rename it to
underscore underscore init underscore
underscore now this is a special method
it stands for initial initialization so
when we create the object of this class
it will call this method and pass in any
parameters so we still want to pass in
our self and our x and y to set and we
can leave
values as they were before because we
want to set them now in I mean we can
change this and we can remove our set
line and instead inside our brackets for
our vector 2d we can put our X so five
and our Y six removing an extra line
from our code however we say this and we
run it and we get the same result so as
you can see this code is already a lot
smaller than it was previously
yet it still completes the task of
holding two values now what this is
great we need to add some more
functionality to our vector some useful
things needed for vectors is the ability
to add them subtract multiply and divide
also the ability to get a normalized
vector get the angle and also get the
magnitude or length so to do this we can
use numeric numeric methods numeric
methods are methods that over--oh at
what python does when you try to use the
plus minus multiply and divide symbols
on a class these are kind of hard to
explain more than I just did so I'll
just add them to our back to class and
see how it looks from there okay
so let's add some numerix I come back to
my counter here and we'll open up our
file now we're gonna be mainly working
in that class here so come down a couple
lines and we're gonna define a special
function so def underscore underscore
and it's called add and we're gonna pass
in a self and other now Python uses this
function when you use the plus symbol on
a class so when adding it'll call this
function if if it's defined like if
we've made one so anything that's on the
right hand side of the plus symbol will
be passed into the other
okay so the ad what we need to do is we
need to return what the added vector is
so we return and we're returning a
vector to D so an object of this class
and it's going to have our self dot X
plus the other X as its values and the
self dot y plus the other dot Y and that
will return an added vector okay now in
addition to being an ad function there's
also an eye add function so death I'm
just gonna go I had underscore
underscore and it takes self and other
as well and what this function does is
it's the shorthand addition so the plus
equals symbol rather than just a plus so
with the plus equals symbol we're adding
to the left hand side with what's on the
right hand side so to do this we can
just do self dot X plus equals other dot
X and do self dot y plus equals other
dot y and then we're going to return our
self so return so okay so now we've done
our audition functions so now let's do
subtraction and multiplication and
division so no death I'm just going to
score sub underscore underscore and
that's gonna take our self as well as
well as another and we're going to
return a vector 2d
which is going to be self dot X - other
dot X and self dot y - other dot Y and I
think you can catch the drift with
what's going on here so you can
copy/paste the add function and the I
add function if you want and just change
the symbols and we go deaf I'm just
gonna score high sub I'm just going to
school so another and in here I'm going
to do sell foot X and we're gonna -
equals other dot X and I'm gonna do our
self dot Y minus equals other don't buy
and we're gonna return our self again
okay now multiplication and division are
pretty much the same
so I'll just create one for each rather
than having to do both so I'll define
and understand let's go I'm oh so mul
sends for multiplication and that will
take yourself and and self dot X x
equals other dot X and self dot y x
equals other dot y and we return so
and our division holder just a normal
division so def underscore underscore
div division just underscore oh I didn't
do the second underscore my
multiplication whoops miss Venus with
area it's fixed and we're gonna do
passing ourself and another and with the
division we have to do float division
because we want accurate dividing so
we're gonna still return a vector to D
and we're gonna do self dot X whoops
so X but this time we're gonna divide by
float open bracket other dot X and self
dot y / flirt other way this is because
we want float division so they have to
tell PI that we want to do that okay so
now that we've got our functions to deal
with plus minus times and divide symbols
we'll add a couple couple of specific
functions to vectors so these are just
basic functions to define a get length
function that's going to take self now
what get length is gonna do is it's
going to get the length of the vector so
this is the square root of the x and the
y squared okay so you know return and
we're gonna return a value so we're
going to return math dot square root so
that's s QR t for square root and that's
going to square root self dot X to the
power of two
Plus self dot y ^ - now because we're
using the math library we need to go all
the way back up to the top of our file
and before our class we need to import
math so import math will come back down
and now we've written our get length
function we can write our normalized
function
so definitely normalized last it's gonna
take yourself as well I'm gonna be
editing stuff inside the class and we're
gonna set length which is just going to
be a temporary bear variable that's
gonna equal self dot get length now you
notice that we're using a function that
we just made inside the class and this
is fine you're able to use functions
that you've already made that are part
of the class so we're gonna get the
length and if the length just not equal
zero then we're gonna return our self /
vector 2d and it's gonna be size length
length now you notice that I'm dividing
myself vector by another vector and
that's because I defined the divide
function to stop above okay now if it
does equal zero then we're gonna return
in fact today of our self because we
must equal zero okay now we're gonna
define whoops we're gonna define a
function for getting the angle of our
vector so get angle and that's gonna
take our self again and this time we're
gonna return math dot degrees so we're
gonna return the answer in degrees it's
math dot atan2 and that's gonna take
self dot Y and self dot X and a 10-2
stands for arc tan - okay and now what
we'll do
this would define a special function
code STR so def underscore underscore
STR on the screen let's go and what this
function does is it overrides the string
function so if somebody tries to use STR
I can bracket your class closed racket
will use this function instead so in
here we can customize what the output is
and the print function also uses this as
well so we can return how X plus string
self dot X plus comma y : plus string
self stop Y and this will save us a lot
of time when we're printing out our
class and that's our class done so if we
come back down to our main we'll start
adding some stuff so that you test this
so we can remove this print function
because we don't need it anymore and we
can do vector equals vector 2d and we'll
make this one equal to two three now
we're going to print out our back and we
also print out our back to so notice we
don't have to write out that long string
anymore because we made our string
command so we can just print it out
normally and now that we've created our
three different vectors we'll start
adding to the first vector so our first
vector which is back
we'll make that equal to back plus in
fact two so we're going to add the two
vectors together and store the result
inside our vector and now we'll print
out what Rack is equal to so we can see
that the adding worked now we'll try our
shorthand addition so I'll do plus
equals vector so we can add back to the
back one well go back and we'll print
out and see if that works
bring back and we'll do some
multiplication so we'll do back x equals
and we'll do a hard-coded vector factor
2d and we'll do two - so all times the
out vector by it - and then we'll print
that out so print back and right there
we we created a vector 2d object on the
fly which will then be destroyed after
it's used okay now what we'll do is
we'll get the normalized vector and
we'll also get the angle and because
these return just a value that we can
print out or it returns a vector 2d then
we can just use that print function so
print
that got normalized and we can do print
back get angle and now we run this we
should have a successfully working back
to class and there we go so we have our
first back which is back which equals
five and six and we have about vector
which is two and three and then we add
back to the back one making our X 7 so 5
+ 2 7 + y 9
so 6 + 3 and then we add to it again
with adding back to it to it again
making it 9 and then 12 and then we
times it by 2 with our timing vector
which makes it 18 and 24 and then we get
the normalized vector which is 0.6 X and
0.8 Y and then we get the angle which is
53 degrees roughly okay so now we have a
basic two-dimensional vector class
there's much more that we could do to
this to make it better and more useful
code but for now it's fine and there's
one last topic to cover but don't worry
it's a short one lastly we have method
objects method objects give us the
ability to store a function in a
variable
this is many uses but none that will be
immediately obvious to it or useful to
an intermediate learner
once again this will be easier to see
what's happening while we're programming
but the gist is storing a link to a
method in a variable so let's modify our
program one last time
this time in our main we'll store a
method and use it later
so come back over edit our code again
come down to our main
and we're gonna store a method so after
we've done our initialization we've set
our two vectors up two vector objects
we'll save the get angle from the back
object so the temp method so we're going
to temporary hold hold a method and
we're gonna do we're gonna get them back
get angle method now we don't put
brackets on it because we want to save
the actual method not actually call the
method because we call the method it
will just store the angle inside 10
method but instead of that we want to
install the methods their store the
method so we don't put brackets on it
now if we come down to the bottom of our
main after we print out that get angle
or what we'll do is we'll print out our
temp method so what we stored before and
this time we do put brackets on it
because we want to actually execute the
method okay so now if we save this and
we run it you'll notice that we get
another print out after hour after hour
get angle is printed out but you'll
notice something pretty interesting
happens because we saved the method the
result is already calculated because we
have done a bunch of addition to the
vector we changed it changed its angle
so when we first created our vector the
angle was 50 degrees and then after
adding in timesing how the angle was 53
degrees so yeah that's just an
interesting thing that happens okay so
this concludes our look at methods a
link to all the possibilities with
special methods will be in the
description extra code will be available
in the current ext in the slides folder
as well as a challenge task don't fear
of you don't remember all this you can
either easily come back and re-watch
this video to consolidate all the
information if you have any questions
feel free to leave them in the car
I know this topic can be quite confusing
next we'll be covering inheritance
