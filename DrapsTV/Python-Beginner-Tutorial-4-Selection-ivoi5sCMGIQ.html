every video will have all slideshows and
code available in description selection
is the second main concept that makes up
a program we have already learned the
first which is sequence sequence
represents the programming executing
line after line selection is the concept
of choices allowing the program decide
to decide based on a boolean expression
whether to execute a certain block of
code or to not in Python this is through
the use of the if statement if you've
learned any other languages you have
also have heard of the switch or case
statement Python does not have this so
to better help help us understand the
concept of selection let's write our
first if statement now like the last
tutorial let's create a Python file
let's call this route for py and open it
in your favorite text editor so this
program we will enter a number into a
variable and then compare that number to
zero if the number we input was 0 then
our program will output the number 0
then we'll print out the out the number
the users entered so now you know a file
let's create it - for dot P Y now we
want to get a number from the user so
into a variable look into a variable num
we want to get an integer and we want to
use raw underscore input open brackets
and the prompt please and number
and close brackets now let's write out
if statement so we write if open
brackets numb so the number that the
user is inputted is equal to which we
use two equal signs so represent is
equal to zero and we use a colon to
continue the if statement and we indent
the next line so we press tab once
indent once now on the indentation we
write what we wanted to want want the
program to do if the number is equals
equals to zero so let's print it out the
number is zero
now let's exit out if statement so we
get back to the first the very left hand
side of our document and we write print
num so we can at least see what the
person inputted afterwards if they
didn't to zero
okay now let's save our program and run
it so - shoot for py now if we put input
0 which will be which will make the if
statement true because num is equal to 0
we get the number 0 if we run the
program again but this time we put in
anything but 0 so say we put in 5 the
program weren't output number is 0 but
we'll still get the output 5 which we
did on the last line okay so the common
comparison operators that you'll use for
boolean expression is is equal to which
is double eagle sign not equal to which
is an exclamation mark at an equal sign
and there's another not equal to which
does a yak exact same thing which is the
less than and there greater than sign
and then just by itself the greater than
sign so if the left number is greater
than the right then it's true and we
have the less than sign so
the left hand side is less than the
right hand side then it's true and then
we have greater than or equal to and we
have less than or equal to now let's
write another another program will edit
our script file and we'll enter a number
into a variable like we did in the last
program and we'll compare that number to
zero if the number we input was not zero
then our program where I put the number
is not zero so we're just changing out
if statement so that's opening up our
how program then we'll edit it so we
want to change our if statement so
rather than num equals equals zero we
want exclamation mark equals four not
equals and then we want to change our
print statement to the number is not
zero and then we can save and now we can
test that program so if we render zero
we'll notice we get no output we just
get the zero so if we run it again but
this time we put in the five we get the
number is not zero so we can put any
value in here we can try putting in 1000
and the number is still not zero okay so
let's also try doing using the greater
than operator so for this we'll edit our
script file again the number is inputted
by the user and we compare it compared
to zero if the number we input is
greater than zero then we'll output the
number is greater than zero so let's
open up and edit our file again and we
want to change our if statement once
more and this time we're just replacing
the exclamation mark equals with a great
greater than sign so if the left-hand
side is greater than the right hand side
output the number is greater than zero
so we change our print to greater
then zero and we can save that program
and now we can print out our program so
now if we render something like zero we
still get nothing but if we enter
anything above zero 355 we get numbers
greater than zero we've run it again and
we put in a negative this time so
negative fifty we get just negative
fifty it doesn't output that it's
greater than zero now well this is good
there's also the else statement or the
else Clause which allows us to execute
another block of code if the if results
in false sorry if this expression is
false do this instead rather than do
what we originally wanted so let's edit
our current code and we'll enter a
number into a variable then compare that
number to zero if the number we input is
greater than zero in an output
our program will output the number is
greater than zero otherwise
where else else the program will output
the number is zero or less this is
because if it's not greater than zero
then it must be zero or less so let's
change our program we open it up to edit
and at the end of our print line we go
down to the next line on the very left
hand side the same level is that if we
do else and we do a colon and we go down
to the next line and we tab in once to
indicate a new block of code and we
print the number is zero or less
now we can save our program again and we
run it so now if we put in five the
number is greater than zero if we put in
zero or anything below zero zero the
number is zero or less let's try it
again with negative number negative
fifty the number is zero or less so now
you can see that it's if the number is
greater than zero it'll output the
numbers greater than zero
else it will output the number zero or
less now we can also combine the else
statement with the if statement creating
the LF statement so the else if
statement the syntax is if this
expression is true do something else if
this expression is true do this else do
this instead so the first two else if
and else if fails it'll do the else
statement so let's edit our program and
this time we'll make it so that program
will check if the number is greater than
0 or less than zero or if the number is
zero so let's open up our file our
program again and we want to in between
our if and our else we want to add an L
if so the first two letters of else and
then if open brackets num is less than 0
closed brackets and we do our colon just
like an if statement tab in one
indentation point print the number is
less than 0
close quote and then we'll edit our
print statement in our in our program
and we'll make the print say the number
is 0 because
if the number is is not greater than
zero and the number is not less than
zero then it must be zero so let's save
this and let's try running it so I put
in a positive number above zero you get
the numbers greater than zero we run it
again and this time we put in zero yeah
the number is zero and we've run it one
more time and we put it negative five we
get the numbers less than zero now let's
do something a little bit more
interesting let's edit a script for our
one last time and what we'll do is we'll
enter a number into one variable and
then enter another number into an
another variable for the first number is
greater than the second number the
output number is greater than the second
we also output the difference so how
many how many numbers are there between
two numbers entered here the first
number we input is less than the second
number so we output the number is less
than a second then if then we wait
otherwise we output they are equal so
how else or otherwise we output they're
equal because if it's not less because
similar to our last else if if it's not
less than it's not greater than then it
must be equal so let's edit our program
and we need to input a second number so
let's change our first number our first
variable to num1 and then rule you can
copy and paste this first line or you
can rewrite it out okay we'll come to
equals int raw underscore input quotes
please enter a second number
and then we'll close the brackets off
and then we change our if statement so
if num needs to be num 1 is greater than
num - the number is greater than the
second number change our print statement
to make it so the number is greater than
the second number and we change our LF
to num 1 is less than num - and we
change that print statement to the
number is less than the second number
and then for our else we need to change
the change the print statement - they
are equal and we can remove our print
num at the end because we're always
going to get an output now I also
mentioned that we're going to a pour the
difference so the difference is 1 number
minus the other so generally you have
the larger number minus the smaller
number that way you get a positive
answer so what we're gonna do is print
the difference the difference is space
close quotes then we're going to add on
to the end the answer so plus and we use
STR to indicate returning a number into
a string I open up brackets num1 - num2
closed brackets so what this is doing is
because we know that num1 is greater
than the second weave - num2 from this
from num1 you get the result so that way
we have a positive answer and we can
change our else--if to print
the difference is hi squirts plus str to
turn our number into a string num2 - num
1 and the reason is reversed this time
is because number 1 is less than num -
because we want a positive out a yeah a
positive output we swap them around so
that we don't have to use any other
functions okay so now let's save our
program and run it ok so please enter a
number
let's put 8 please enter a second number
let's put 4 the number is greater than
the second number the difference is 4
cool so it's work that first if
statement is working let's test the
second else if so let's enter 4 and the
second number will go with 6 this time
the number is less than the second
number yep that's correct and the
difference is 2 yep that's correct as
well awesome now let's check what
happens if they're equal so waiting 5
and we'll put 5 again they are equal
cool so if you want you can edit this
program to state that the difference is
zero or you can just leave leave it how
it is so this concludes our look at
selection in Python don't fear you don't
remember all of this you can easily come
back and re-watch this video to
consolidate all the information if you
have any questions and you can't find
the answer after a quick Google search
feel free to leave them in the comments
next we'll be covering functions thanks
