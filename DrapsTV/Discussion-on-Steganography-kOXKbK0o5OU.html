steganography I'm no expert in the field
of steganography but has been an
interesting topic for me for many years
I hope you find it interesting and leave
a comment with your ideas the slideshow
will be available in the description so
what is steganography the word itself is
made up of two Greek words stegun us and
graphy meaning concealed writing so
really it's the art of hiding data in
plain sight
steganography has been around for a long
time being very popular and useful
during times of war there are many
examples of steganography in physical as
well as digital mediums so let's have a
look at fuel to be a few of each one of
the most commonly known forms of hidden
messages is invisible ink citrus is used
as ink for writing on paper generally
one would write the invisible message on
a letter already containing a non
relevant message while the citrus dries
it eats away at the paper's impurities
leaving the paper thinner where the
citruses upon delivering the letter the
paper would be heated over a candle or
under a hot light causing the now
thinner parts of the paper to turn brown
you can even try this at home most
school science classes still do this
experiment another example of physical
steganography is Morse code Morse code
stitched or knitted into clothing
clothing yeah this was believed to be
used quite regularly in World War two
the patterns would be things like
missing stitches or changes in colors
these were sewn into tapestries as well
as shirts sleeves or collars similarly
similarly Morse code patterns were also
painted into paintings that may have
been given as gifts lastly a common
example from the days of slaves was
tattoos slaves would have their heads
shaved and the tattoo would then be
placed on the top or side of the head
once their hair had grown back the
message was hidden and the slave would
be sent on an errand to the receiver the
receiver would then shave the slaves
head and read the message though the
downside to this method was that it took
a long time for the hair to grow and as
well as the obvious tatters a permanent
a digital example of steganography is
that that is commonly used is things
like hiding messages or data in images
data is usually stored in the color
information most commonly the lowest bit
of the color information is encoded with
data though the color is different and
the difference in color is really hard
for the human eye to detect for example
the color f6 a zero zero represents a
zero bit and the and the color FF 6 a
zero one represents a one bit the binary
stored inside could be decoded into a
message another image or even a whole
program however if you only store one
bit per pixel it would take 8 pixels per
byte of data that's one character and
ASCII though keep in mind there is some
tricks you can do to improve this such
as storing info in all three colour
channels another digital example is
hiding messages or data in audio by
altering the frequencies of each audio
frame data can be stored while the human
ear is great for detecting slight
changes in sound the air can the ear
still struggles to differentiate 700
Hertz and 701 Hertz each frame of audio
contains not just the frequency but also
other audio information for this heavily
depends on the audio codec being used
using additional information in an audio
codec can allow us to store more than
one bit per frame a less common but
still used example is opcodes
generally patterns would be made with
the NOC code the NOC code is a void
instruction and it does nothing so
generally that's why it's used however
another style is by using add and sub
the outcome of the ad then sub would be
nothing so for example add one sub one
third these patterns have no effect on
the program at runtime when
deconstructed these patterns food not
instructions could mean something
likewise different add and sub numbers
could mean different things as well as
an example the number 1 could mean
letter C and the number 5 could mean the
letter A
no add one sub one add five sub five
okay so some of the key concepts of
steganography that we've established is
security through observation observation
is the concept of making something hard
to decipher secondly we have established
that we require something to hide within
some sort of medium like an image sound
file or piece of paper
additionally we require some sort of
legend or rules to cipher and decipher
the hidden message and finally it must
be undetectable by people who don't know
it's there now on the other side of
hiding data is finding hidden data the
whole point is that hidden things are
meant to be hard to be fun there are
meant to be hard to find if you don't
know it's there one way of finding
hidden data is by looking patterns in
mediums such as pixel color information
being 0 or 1 in its lower bits learning
algorithms can be useful for helping
find patterns or Mitch map mismatches
another great tool is statistical
analysis and now analyzing an image and
noticing that parts don't match the
neighboring cells can be a useful
technique steganography has its use in
the digital world but it's rarely spoken
about what kind of applications can you
think of that steganography could be
used with I'd love to hear any ideas or
concepts you come up with one idea could
possibly be a funny image hosting site
that actually contains torrent data in
the images themselves only upon some
sort of invite system which know it's
there and how to decode it this brings
the video to an end I hope you learn
something new or have a new perspective
on how data can be hidden I have a
tutorial slash example of how to make a
hide such retrieve program in Python
that allows us to hide text inside an
image there'll be an annotation on
screen for that now if you have any
questions leave it in the comments and
I'll try a best to answer it thanks for
