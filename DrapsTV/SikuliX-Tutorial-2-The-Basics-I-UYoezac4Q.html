the basics in this video we'll get a
feel for the user interface of the
Sakura X IDE and create our first basic
automation script every video of all
slide shows and code available in the
description so cool e^x comes with its
own integrated development environment
or IDE for short which is incredibly
powerful with buttons you can click to
write the code for you it's not
everything school e^x has to offer but
it's very nice for beginners and novice
programmers to start learning and have
fun while doing it so cool e^x has
several different types of things that
can try and match or look for when it's
trying to use its functions for short we
refer to them as PS m RL standing for
pattern string match region and location
this is fairly straightforward but the
main one we're going to focus on is the
pattern object patterns will be the main
way that we tell circle the X what to
interact with the pattern object
contains several pieces of information
that we'll use in our circle the X
programs these are an image the size of
the image a similarity value and a
target offset for now you only have to
remember that it stores an image alright
let's get on to creating something let's
create a simple automation script that
opens up the calculator app and adds 1+1
together this should get us comfortable
with the bare basics of Sakuni X all
right so let's come over to our circle
the X IDE so this is what our IDE looks
like and you get this from running the
run school Exe MD inside just Cooley X
folder after its installed and we've got
a few options here but the main zone
made ones we need to focus on is over on
here over here on the Left we've got our
find find all weight weight vanish
exists and click double click right
click hover and drag drop there's also
these keyboard actions that you can drop
the hit the drop down for which is type
and the text you want to type so this
will start typing keys on your keyboard
type this selects an imager then tries
to type text into it and paste text so
paste things into a different enough
into a field all right so let's get on
to what we want to do so first we need
to go through the steps that we would go
through to open up our calculator so I
would go
down to the start icon it start then
under the search program of the files I
would type calc for calculator calc for
calculator and then hit enter and that
would run the calculator and then inside
the calculator if I wanted to do one
plus one and type one plus one equals
and we get the answer so that's what
asked the Cooley script is going to do
so there might seem a bit advanced to
start with but let's go back give it a
go anyway and you'll find it as not as
hard as it looks right so the first
thing we want to do is we want to click
this start button so to do that what
we're going to do is win a set we want
to click we're going to the little
camera icon next to click and that will
ask us to select an image on screen so
we're going to click the start icon so
let's drag a box over it and it'll pop
up click the start icon cool so that's
our first instruction we want to click
the start button now an interesting
thing is there's a delay here for the
pop-up animation when you click so we
want to make sure it waits for this
search field so to do this what we're
going to do is we're going to use the
weight command and we're going to click
the little camera again but this time
when we click it we've got to make sure
we quickly click the start icon so quit
start icon and then we get this section
here and what we're gonna do is we're
going to look for this search bar so to
do this we're going to drag a box over
the whole thing with this little icon in
it so it can be recognized we're going
to wait for this to come up on screen
once it has appeared so once it's
appeared we're going to type some text
so we are type and we're going to type
calc close quotes plus key with a
capital K dot enter with capital enter
so that will type out calculator then it
will press the key enter cool so once
that's typed in we want to wait for the
calculator to appear on screen so let's
open up and get our calculator open
so we've got a calculator image here
we're going to come over to the IDE
and we're going to wait I'm going to
wait for this calculator to appear on
screen so let's just wait for this
number pad to come up so there we go
it's going to wait until it sees that
number pad on screen and then once the
number pad is there we want to start
clicking buttons so let's click click
the little camera and we want to click
the one button or drag over the one and
then we want to click the plus button so
we'll drag over the plus and then we
want to click the one button again so
we'll drag over the one and then we want
to click on the equal sign so we'll drag
over the equal sign all right so this is
our instructions to run so we're going
to click the start button wait until the
search pops up type in calculator or
calc and press Enter
then we're going to wait until the
calculator appears then click one plus
one equals and yeah it should that
should run I'm actually going to redo
this equal sign that looks like me my
mouse was hovering over the top so we
can just delete things by backspacing
and we want to click again and wait for
the image to pop up and then I'm going
to drag over the top of this equal sign
just make sure it look correct there we
go awesome so let's give it a shot
so we're going to save this because we
need to save it before we can run it so
if I can look at our folder I'm going to
put it in my circle the X folder and
might even create a subfolder called
scripts alright so inside the scripts
folder we're going to save it so let's
call it let's call it our calc
file so that's going to save it and
we'll rename it up here and it'll show
you where it's stored and then we can
hit run so I'm going to close the
calculator because otherwise it will
cause issues and let's hit run so when
you hit run it'll take over and we'll
start automating as you can see and we
get to so our script has ended and it's
run all successfully we have a look at
our calculator and it's giving us the
answer to awesome it worked
now it's interesting to see how school
the X is storing the information that we
give it let's have a look at how you
might start to figure out how the Cooley
ax works
plus it might highlight an issue with
our efficiency all right so if we come
back over to our folder where we're
storing our files so we created a
scripts folder and we called it calc so
it's inside here we noticed that it's
got an image for each one of those
screenshots that we took which is a
little inefficient especially when these
two are identical images all right so we
can also see that there's a calc DML
file and a calc by file so we can open
these up so I could just open this up
and pitched this HTML file up in my
editor and you can see it's just a bunch
of HTML code with the names of our code
and our pictures and this is what
securely uses to make this images in the
editor here so this is all HTML here
however the code that actually gets run
we can close this and get back to our
folder is the PI file so if we open this
back open this up in notepad plus plus
we can see some code here so inside this
code we've just got some click and then
an image to click and all these
functions hook into the coulee cool so
as you can see we do have some
inefficiencies with these duplicates and
I think it could be made much more
efficient okay so now that we have an
idea about how to securely access
storing the images and separate files
let's
talk about the last two features of our
patterns similarity and target offset
currently we haven't taken advantage of
these two features as we've just used
the basic image image selection
similarity is a decimal value between 0
&amp;amp; 1 but it's actually a percentage for
example 0.5 is 50% similarity you can
think about it as sensitivity at 50% if
something looks about 50% the same as
what you're looking for click that if
our similarity is 0.1 or 10% if we find
anything that looks about 10% the same
as what we're looking for click it then
we have target offset simply this is the
point to click on the image this is a
dy/dx offset from the center of our
image this will be immediately obvious
once we have a look at it all right
let's modify ask the coulee script to
use less than half the images we use
before by using offsets we'll also have
a fiddle with similarity all right so
let's come back over to our card here so
we don't need to change our first thing
we definitely want to click the start
button and we definitely want to search
calc but we can start to change this
weight section here so what we can do is
let's remove these images so we're going
to get rid of that get rid of that get
rid of that we're going to get rid of
all of this and we're going to reset up
our calculator so let's open it back up
and then inside our calculator we
noticed that the plus the 1 the plus and
the Eagles buttons are all in this one
section of the area so what we can do is
we can go wait for this section to
appear on screen so this section has all
of the things that we need in it then
what we can do is we can grab the image
here copy it we can type click open
brackets paste in our image and close
brackets then we can click on this image
here and we can tell it we can have a
look at our matching preview so this is
our Simar
already so inside the similarity you can
see that the more I start to make it
similar the more objects appear on
screen and starts to get pretty
ridiculous so we're going to keep that
at a relatively high sensitivity rate so
around 75% then we want to look at
target offset so inside our target
offset we can tell it where we want it
to click so what we can do is we can say
hey click the 1 button so you just click
inside of our image and we'll set the
target up set down the bottom to that
place on the image let me get apply and
ok and you can see it has our similarity
up in the top corner and a little red
marker pointing to where it's going to
click on the image now we can rinse and
repeat this so we can type click or we
can hit the click button you just put in
a dodgy image and then remove it and
then paste in our new image click on
that and then we want to go to our
target offset and next we want to hit
plus so we click on the little plus
section of that image hit apply ok we
can type that click again paste our
image close off the bracket then we want
to play press 1 again we could have
really copied that other that other code
from up there but we'll just redo it and
then we can type click one more time
paste in our image close it off click on
it and set I target offset to the equals
button this time hit apply and okay
alright so now we're using the same
image for time zero so we're actually
cutting our total program in half so if
we save this go back to a folder here
you'll notice that we've only got three
images now we've got the start button
the search button and the calculator
area and if we run it close the
calculator first now if we run it hit
run a no go press Start type in calc
open up our calculator well got an error
region cannot be found
struggling to find the image let's give
it one more shot right on it
start calc opens up did find it press
one plus one equals so I don't know what
that error there was maybe it took too
long to open up but we found that it
worked and we're used to half the amount
of images making our file much much
smaller cool ok that's it for this video
I'm sure you can already feel the power
at your fingertips the next thing we'll
be looking at is conditional automation
if you have any questions leave it in
the comments and I'll try to answer it
