classes every video will have all
slideshows and code available in
description understanding the concept of
classes is the most important thing in
object-oriented programming how to
implement classes becomes easier as you
use them and discover how best to design
your program so I can't emphasize this
enough practice makes perfect in
programming so what is a class a class
is referred to as a data structure or
type a class can hold data and can also
hold behaviors the data in a class is
called attributes and the behaviors are
called methods once a class is defined
we get a singular object of that
structure that object can then be copied
or instantiated wherever we want to use
it let's use an example of a class that
we've used before the string class this
class is inbuilt into the Python
language and is created when you try and
assign a string of characters to a
variable in this case the data is the
characters stored in the string the
behaviors or methods are the things like
the strip function or the split lower or
upper functions a full list of all the
string methods will be available in the
description so how do we create a class
well our Python makes it easy to make
classes adding as little new syntax as
possible for now we only have to look at
one new keyword which is class to define
a class we use the syntax class then the
class name so in this example we have
class and then my class this will create
a class called my class okay so
attributes attributes are variables that
belong to a class these can be any data
type they can even be other classes in
Python all attributes are public meaning
they can be accessed from outside their
classes however though this can't be
avoided it is recommended to follow a
convention used by most Python
programmers of denoting private
variables with two leading underscores
private variables should be treated as
only accessible as part of the class
more on this in later tutorials
methods functions that belong to a class
that either do things to the class
is data or do things with the classes
data it will look more at this in the
next tutorial objects after we've
defined the class in Python we can
create objects of that class an object
is much like a variable however that
variable holds all the data and methods
for the class it was made with with
objects we can use the data in our
classes to store information into our
object much like we would do with the
string object / class
okay so let's create a simple class
we'll call our class my class and inside
it will store a favorite number and a
name so let's create a file called my
class hi okay so I come across deep
under here one two and okay now I'm
going to create a file called my class
dot pi and the first thing we're going
to do is define our class because we're
going to be using it lower down in our
file
okay so class and then we're going to
call it my class and then for : at the
end there and we indent one okay so now
everything we get we put inside this
class will be a part of this class okay
so we're going to have a number number
and we'll set that to a default value of
zero so this is going to be the favorite
number for the class and then we're
going to create a name attribute so it's
just a name variable and we're gonna set
to the default value of no name and then
that's our class done it's only a very
simple class is done but we'll make more
complex ones in the future okay now
we'll write our main function
so def mean
and now we're going to create an object
of my class and we're going to call that
object my me me equals my class
we put brackets in the end and that will
create a variable me and make it into an
object and I'll be an object of the
class my class and now we can set the
value the attributes of the my class
object so me dot name and then we can
set the name to say traps and we can do
me dot number and set my favorite number
two one three three seven and let's
create a another object of class my
class and we'll call it friend it'll
make it equal to my class so we're
creating another object of my class and
this friend dot name equals let's make
it Steve and friend dot number equals to
three okay so now we've got two objects
one's called me and ones called friend
and they're both both of class my class
and let's print them out so it will just
print and we'll open up some strings and
we'll type name and then my because
we're going to output the name close
that put a plus and then will do me name
another plus open up some quotes comma
favorite number
and close quotes ad then we have to turn
our number into a string so string me
number and that'll add my favorite
number to the end now you can copy and
paste that line and just change the Me's
to friends but I'm going to rewrite it
out so print name plus friend dot name
plus quotes come on our favorite number
and then you know add string of friend
dot number and there we go now write my
if so if I'm just going to school name
let's go on the skull is equal to this
one so main then run main ok that's our
program written so we've created a class
called my class holds a number and a
name and then we created objects of my
class called me and friend and we set
their values and then we're printing
them out so save that and now let's try
running it so python my class pi and we
get the output of the names of each of
the objects and the favorite numbers of
each of the objects which we set set by
hand cool so that works this concludes
our look at classes there'll be a link
to the classes section of the Python
documentation in the description extra
code will be available in the code text
in the slides folder as well as a
challenge task
don't fear if you don't remember a list
you can usually come back and read watch
the video to consolidate all the
information if you have any questions
feel free to leave them in the comments
next we'll be covering methods and
method objects thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
