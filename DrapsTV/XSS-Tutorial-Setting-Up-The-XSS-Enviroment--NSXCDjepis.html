xs/s tutorial series in this video we're
going to download and install the
program
xampp a free and cross-platform web
server pre setup with PHP and databases
as well as cover how to get the web
server up and running and create the
database for the tutorials we'll also
look at how to add the code provided in
the description of each video to the web
server
how to view it this video will be
focused around the installation and
setup on windows 7 a link to the xampp
website will be in the description okay
so first we need to download and install
exam so the accept website the index
will have a download section where you
can pick what operating system you are
on so we're downloading for Windows so
we're gonna click on the windows button
that'll take us to SourceForge and we'll
start downloading the Installer now I've
already got it downloaded so I don't
need download again and as we can see
here we've got the Installer so with the
Installer just double-click it'll ask
are you sure you want to run this
executable file hit OK once the
Installer has popped up you can click
the next button then it'll ask what
components you want to have inside your
exam I just generally leave them all
ticked next it'll ask you where you want
to install it to now make sure you
install this to somewhere you will
remember as you need to access this
folder quite regularly I currently have
mine set up in a web server folder on my
drops TV folder on my D harddrive so
once you pick where you want to install
it just hit the next button and it will
start the installation process at the
instant end of the installation will ask
if you want to run it just uncheck the
box and finish once you have xampp
installed navigate to the folder where
you saved it now inside the xampp folder
you'll notice that there's a lot of
files in here for the XM web server
we're going to scroll down to the bottom
and we want the xampp control
XE and run this it'll open up the xampp
control panel now from here we have the
modules apache
maestro
Zillah mercury and Tomcat we only need
to worry about the top two so first we
want to start the Apache so this is our
web server which will service all the
page to anybody requesting them then we
need to set up our MySQL which we did
start and that'll start it up and
that'll handle all of our database
communications okay now we can minimize
this control panel and let's have a look
at our web server running so to access
our web server we can type 127.0.0.1 or
alternatively we can type local host now
once you type in localhost or 127.0.0.1
it'll ask you what language you want to
use it in I've selected English and
it'll bring you to this control board
here now from this control board what we
want to do is on the tools side on the
very left we want PHP myadmin
and when we click on this it'll take us
to where we can set up our databases now
we need to set up one database for our
server so we can use it in our tutorials
so to do this we're going to come to the
databases section which we click on the
databases tab at the top and I'll have
up the very top to create database now
we can create a database by typing in
its name so let's call the database X SS
3 and it'll ask us what collation we
want it to be so we want to scroll all
the way down to the bottom and we want
utf-8 mb4 underscore unicode underscore
CI and then we can hit create and I'll
say the database has been created and we
can see it has appeared at the bottom of
this list now we can click on the XS s3
database and Alaska that there's no
tables found and we need to create one
so we need one table that we're going to
use in the tutorials which we're going
to call comments and the number of
columns that comments is going to have
is 2 we need an ID and the comment and
we could go now to come up with our
structure of our table
so we need to name the fields so our
first field is going to be the ID in
lower case and that's type int it has no
length or value and we need to set the
index section to primary as it's going
to be the primary key of the table and
we also need to set the order increment
which is this a underscore I if you hold
your mouse over it should pop up with
Auto increment okay now for the second
field the second field is going to be a
varchar
and it's going to be the comment now
we need to set a length in value for the
Bachar so let's set it to something like
400 as there's a nice amount of
characters okay that's all we need to do
and we can hit save now once it's saved
you'll see that we have a table called
comments and that's our database set up
and ready for the tutorials all right so
now how about we get some code in there
so next we have to look at the look for
the htdocs folder inside the xampp
folder the htdocs folder is where the
web server dishes out all of the files
for the web server so in here you'll
have a folder called dashboard forbidden
image restricted xampp and that'll be it
I've got two custom folders in here
called one core XSS and one court
exploitable web survey the XSS folder
you'll need to create so you can right
click new folder and create a folder and
call it XSS now inside this XSS folder
i've created several subfolders one for
each tutorial that is required so for
the first one we have the second
tutorial so inside here I have an index
dot PHP this is where you'll put all of
your downloaded code I will leave your
downloaded PHP files so when you
download a corresponding PHP file you
put it in a folder for the number of the
tutorial that it is so for tutorial 2
you have the index dot PHP
be in here now to access it we come back
up to our web browser and instead of
being on PHP myadmin
we're going to local a Hearst /x SS
forward slash the number tutorial it is
so - and then forward slash and you can
type in index dot PHP if you like but
it's not necessary now when you do that
it'll pop up with the output of that
webpage and then you're ready to go cool
alright now that we have our environment
set up we can get on to learning
cross-site scripting you have yet to
watch the first tutorial check out the
video on the left if you've come here
from the second tutorial you can return
by clicking on the video on the right
