computer worm was released on a very
large international dec net Network the
computer worm was a DCL script file that
would copy itself to another device and
run the computer worm was programmed to
send an electronic message to the users
of the machines running the worm the
computer worm was aptly named the father
Christmas worm as the message was a
Christmas greeting and has signed father
Christmas the father Christmas worm was
designed to spread fast the worm was
released onto the dec net internet from
a computer at a university in
Switzerland within ten minutes of its
release on the network the worm was
detected on space physics analysis
Network also known as span which is
NASA's largest space and earth science
Network the worm was estimated to have
been copied to around 6000 machines of
the around
12600 that were connected to the dec net
internet but less than 2% of the copies
actually executed after its detection a
counter script was created to clean the
worm from infected spam machines and
stop the spread of the worm the worm was
stopped on the span dec net on December
23rd less than eight hours of detection
on the network however the worm
continued to run on the Swiss local
network until later December 23rd if
you're wondering how it worked the worm
was a program called Hakam the file was
written in the de-seed command language
or decl
the scripting language provides access
to operating and network level system
functions on the local or remote host
the first thing the script of around 150
simple lines of code would do was copy
the high dot-com file to the target
machine it would then try to start the
high comm on that machine using the task
object 0 or by logging in with the
username password combination Dec net
Dec net it was unable to start it would
delete it from the target machine if the
target nerd does run the script it
floated into the machines memory and
disguised itself under the process name
mail underscore 1 7 8 DC then it moves
the high dot-com file to a hidden
location the process checks the system
clock and if the time is greater than
the start of Christmas day it sends a
Christmas greeting to all of the users
on the machine I'll put the message in
the description of Peter Reid after it
sends the message
all copies off the machine and stops the
execution of the script the
investigation afterward never found the
person responsible for releasing the
computer worm onto the Dec net as logs
from the user logins were all valid the
connection was done through an unknown
terminal connection from somewhere
within the Switzerland University I hope
you learned something interesting the
message that the worm would send will be
in the description as well as the
reports on the father Christmas worm
I'll even put a link to the source code
I want to wish you all a Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year
