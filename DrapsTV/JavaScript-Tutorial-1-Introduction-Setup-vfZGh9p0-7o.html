&amp;amp; Setup
In this series I will be covering Javascript
from a beginner to an intermediate level.
Javascript has become a very popular language
for web development and runs on almost all
websites.
Every video will have all slideshows and code
avialable in the description.
-
Quickly a few pre-requisites before you invest
to much time.
An understanding of HTML is required
if you wish to follow along with this series.
Also having a basic understanding of CSS will
be benificial
but not required.
If you want to brush up on your html check
out my HTML5 series.
-
This series of tutorials will try to cover
as much of Javascript as possible.
The kind of things we will be looking at are:
-Basics &amp;amp; Variables
-Input &amp;amp; Output
-Control Flow (If, Switch, Loops)
-Functions &amp;amp; Parameters
-Arrays
-Objects
-DOM &amp;amp; Events
-Cookies
-External Libraries
Though this is not every single topic Javascript
has to offer, It should serve as
a very in depth starting point.
-
Javascript is a client side web language.
This means that the code you write is sent
to the
person viewing your webpage and is run by
there web browser.
Javascript allows you to dynamically change
how a website behaves on the clients computer.
For example it could hide information until
a button is clicked or change how something
looks
when something changes.
There is libraries that exist to communitcate
between the browser and the server, However
this
is a more complex topic and should be left
until you have a firm understanding of Javascript,
as well as how client server communication
functions.
-
Thankfully the set up is incredibly easy,
just like HTML or CSS we can use any program
that edits text.
I suggest Notepad++ on Windows.
If you are on MAC or Linux, Sublime Text is
a great editor and is free to
evaluate forever.
-
Alright, First we be looking at The Basics
and what Variables are and how to use them.
If you have any questions, leave it in the
comments and i'll try to answer it as best
as possible!
