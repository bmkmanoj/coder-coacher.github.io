four plotting data in this video we'll
be looking at getting data into a
visualized form with the use of octaves
inbuilt graphing functions just a
warning this is probably going to be a
really long video every video have all
slideshows and code available in the
description octave provides functions
for drawing many different types of
graphs the examples we'll be looking at
are the standard XY plot which you may
remember from maths in high school
scatter plots which just display points
in the data set
histograms which are basically a bar
chart representing the distribution of
data contour graphs which show a
two-dimensional plane through a 3d data
set polar graphs which can be used to
graph data in polar coordinates your
standard pie charts and 3d meshes to
represent three-dimensional functions
first off let let's look at the XY XY
plots which will probably which you will
probably find is the most useful for
general purpose use XY is a plot of Y in
relation to X for this we can use the
plot function this comes in many forms
the first only takes a vector Y and the
index for each element is used as X
secondly we can use we can also specify
a vector X and plot a vector Y against
back to X finally we can use the
optional parameters to include a format
using this we can specify it lines
points and many other ways for the graph
to be drawn how what color they are and
more the default is a dash which is for
a solid line you can also use the
optional property and value parameters
to change other attributes of the graph
but more on that later let's have a look
at plotting XY graphs ok so if we come
across to octave and set my my prompt up
so let's just create a very simple XY
plot so we'll create a vector Y so y
equals 0 to xx and we'll put a semicolon
here so we don't have to see it print
out
and also will now change each value in
the vector way to be a ^ 2 so y equals y
dot to the power so we can do each
element to the power of 2 and we'll do a
a bracket on this as well so we don't
have to see the numbers now let's use
the plot function so plot and we open up
now circle brackets and we put in Y and
we we can put a semicolon it doesn't
really matter on plots but if we press
semicolon it'll calculate our plot and
if it doesn't pop up immediately like it
hasn't done here you can use the hold on
command and as you see it pop up with
how graph and we go from 0 and it goes
up to 20 and it's squaring as it goes up
so to the power of 2 all the way up okay
so we can also if we come back to octave
so we minimize it open it again we can
type closed and that will close our
graph so it doesn't hold dolls screen
okay now let's look at the scatter the
scatter is much like an XY plot however
only the points will be drawn there will
be no connecting lines for scatters you
must provide an x and a y vector the
function scatter XY will plot the vector
Y in relation to vector X we can also
also add the optional arguments which is
for the size of each marker the default
is 8 points there is also another
optional argument filled to add to the
end which you can fill the markers with
so let's put our previous graph but this
time we use the scatter function and
we'll also have to create a vector X so
if we come across to octave we have to
create a vector X so x equals 0
two-twenty okay so now we've got an X
which is the same length as Y we can use
this scatter function so scatter X in
relation to Y okay so once again it
hasn't popped up so we just hold on and
as you can see we get a similar graph to
before except this time we don't have
the lines we just have the data plotted
okay
so I'll come back over to octave and
close it down so it's not hogging up the
screen next we have histograms
histograms are a graph that shows the
distribution of data in a vector or
matrix the data is usually separated
into bins we can easily create
histograms with the hist function you
can also use the optional argument to
specify the number of bins let's do a
standard example of a normal random
distribution histogram so if we come
back over octave now let's create a
variable a and that will make that equal
to R and and so a normal random
distribution of let's say a thousand by
one so that will calculate a thousand
random different values for us in a
vector and let's use the hist function
on a so hist a and once again it has the
pop ups there hold on and here we get
our normal distribution histogram so by
default it has 10 mins and it's not very
exciting at the moment with 10 bins even
though there's a thousand it's an
aggregate over the thousand so let's
come back over to octave and this time
close and
what we get what we need to do is
specify the number of Bin's we want so
let's do hist
hist a and we're going to have 50 bins
this time and that will calculate and
now the holes on and here it's a bit
more detailed so we can see that the
majority of the numbers are around the
positive zero side so around zero to
zero point one kind of thing and then we
have it's pretty much even on both sides
we've got a spike over here this seems
to be a lot around the minus one area
okay so come back to octave close and
let's come back to our slide show so oh
okay octave window just bugged out for a
second there yup there we go okay so
open up our slide show now cut the
contour graph I don't use contour as
much but they are useful when you're
working with three-dimensional data
you'll have seen contour lines on maps
before they show the height and steps of
mountains above sea level the contour
function can take a matrix of Z
coordinates or it can be used with XY
and Z matrices so let's make a quick
contour graph so we can see what they
look like
so come over to octave and we'll just
clear the screen now let's create our X
now our X vector so X equals open
bracket 1 2 3 4 o we'll do 1 2 3 2 1 now
make it a bit more interesting okay so
we create our X now let's create our Y
we'll just make y equal to X so they
equal the same thing at the moment and
now we'll make Z equal to hi
X transpose so two transpose of a vector
we use the car ' symbol to transpose
times y okay so this will give us a
matrix Z so I type Z will you see we get
a matrix here so we get 1 2 3 2 1 and 1
2 3 2 2 1 on the both sides and then as
it goes through and time system together
okay so now that we've got our 3d matrix
Z we're going to set our axes up for our
plot so we use the axes function now in
here it just takes a vector with four
different color numbers which is for
each the domain of each axis so we have
our x axis first so 1 2 5 is what we
want and we all got our y axes so 1 2 5
through our Y as well and we close
square brackets closed circle brackets
and that will set up our axes so here
we've got our plot and our axes have
been set up 1 to 5 1 to 5 we come back
to octave now let's draw our contour so
contour and we're just going to give it
the Z matrix which is our 3d coordinates
for this the z axis so really draw a
contour of this it hasn't drawn looking
like it hasn't so come back and we'll
type hold on now it's going to pop up no
no it's not going to pop up let's not
respond me this happens sometimes let's
just close it off again close and we'll
set up our axes and we'll draw our
contour and then we'll hold on and here
we go we get our contour contour graph
drawn so as you can see the numbers are
highest around the middle of the
matrix so that's where we have our Reds
our dark Reds in our Reds there and then
as it gets further apart and the numbers
are a lot lower and similar they get to
a bluey
Blacky color okay
so we'll close that graph off that's our
contour graph we also have our polar
plot now this function allows us to plot
data in the polar coordinate system the
function takes a vector of theta angles
and a vector of Rho of the data vector
to be plotted polar plots can be found
can be fun for making spirals and
circles so let's have a look at drawing
a circle with the polar function so
we'll jump over to octave and we'll
create alright I'll change our variable
X to equal say zero colon zero point one
so we're going to increment by zero
point one two two times pi because we
want a full circle so if you know your
radians two times pi is a full circle
and so we get our our variable x set up
okay so we can check what the size of
how X is now so size of X is 63 so it's
got 63 values in it so we also need to
set up our our Y values so we've set up
our X which is going to be our angles
now we need to set up our our Y so our
data to be plotted and cuz we you just
want to draw a perfect circle we need to
have a vector of the same length of our
angles but they only increment at the
same so the same rate so zero point one
so to do that we're going to use the
linspace function so y equals Lin space
so what this does is it just populates a
vector with a certain value to a certain
value similar to our colon but we can
also use it to create all of one value
so zero point one
20.1 and we want 63 of them
okay so we've set out why now let's try
drawing our polar graph so polar and
then we want our X and our Y does that
draw for us it's loading calculating
think it's calculating hold on there we
go okay so it appears that my look my
octave has gone all weird there we go
okay so we got octave back Sooey yep
there we go okay so we've got our circle
drawn so as you can see it gives 0.1 0.1
and it just goes around in a full circle
now it's stretched because of the aspect
ratio currently of the frame so if I
could resize it which you can in other
means but I haven't set it up at the
moment so it's just stretched a bit but
as you can see the values are all
accurate it goes around in a perfect
circle okay so we'll close that off and
we'll move on to the next thing okay so
next the all-important pie chart pie
charts are famous for being easy to
understand object makes pie charts
really easy to create the pie function
takes a vector X of which each element
is shown as a percentage of the vectors
turtle sum there is also the optional
parameter to explode pieces out of the
of the chart this is done with a vector
of the same size as X and any nonzero
values explode out the corresponding
index in the vector X so let's make a
simple pie chart of the values one two
three four five and six
okay so let's come back over to octave
and we'll make out a equal one carbon
six so from one to six now we can just
type PI a and you get a pie chart we
have to hold on and we get our pie chart
so as you can see the blue is for the
one and
the very dark red is for the six because
the total sum of the the whole array is
one plus two plus three plus four plus
five plus six and six is the largest
value so that's takes up the largest
percentage of the total sum and
correspondingly they go down or go up
whichever way you read the pie chart
okay so that's our pie chart but let's
have a look at exploiting the pie chart
because everybody loves a bit of
exploded pie chart so we close now this
time we want to have a explode vector so
let's name it
e for explode so e equals and we'll open
up square brackets and manually do it so
we want to explode the first chunk we
don't want to explode the second chunk
we want to explode the third chunk we
don't want to explode the fourth chunk
we want to explode the fifth chunk but
not six junk okay so we've got a vector
of the same length as a and now we can
type our pie command again and give it a
and we want to explode it with E so this
it'll explode every every odd value or
even value whichever way you're counting
and as we can see we get the first
popped out the second one not popped up
a third popped out fourth not popped out
the fifth popped out and the six not
popped out okay so that's how we do pie
charts in octave so we'll close that
down okay so lastly let's look at making
three-dimensional meshes a mesh function
allows us to draw a graph in
three-dimensional space there are
several functions that take the same x
y&amp;amp;z matrices but draw different
representations of the mesh first is the
mesh power function which is a simple
wireframe mesh then there is the mesh C
which draws a contour graph underneath
the 3d mesh we then have mesh the Z
which has a curtain on the edges of the
Z plane and finally the surf function
which draws a graph with shaded surfaces
so that you cannot see
through the graph so let's make another
standard example of a 3d Bowl mesh so
come over to octave and we'll clear the
screen now let's make X equal to
negative 10 to 10 and we'll make y equal
to the same thing so y equals x now
let's use the mesh grid function so what
this does is it pretty much just copies
the row all the way down a certain
number of columns and copies the columns
across the sample set number of rows so
we want to store them in x and y so this
returns two values from our function so
equals mesh grid and mesh grid is going
to return an X and a Y and it will place
it into our x and y and we want to give
it our X and our Y vectors okay so if we
enter on that how X will now be a grid
as you can see it's all of the same row
copied down in columns okay so now that
we've created that we want to create our
Z matrix so Z equals x and we want to do
^ 2 to each value in X plus y to the
power of 2 in each of the values in the
way matrix so if we hit enter on this
we'll have our Zed matrix created so we
can have a quick look and as you can see
it's really large on the outsides and it
gets smaller as gets into the middle so
we'll quit out of this now let's try
using our mesh function so mesh and
we'll do our X ly and LZ okay so we can
enter on this and we get our mesh drawn
so we didn't have to use hold onto this
one because it's just wanted to work
today okay so we got this bowl kind of a
mesh going and it's in wireframe mode
you can see the wireframe so it looks
like a bowl we can zoom around it and
have a look at it in 3d space come back
over to octave and we'll close that down
now let's try using the mesh C function
so mesh C and then we pass it same x y
and z-coordinates
okay and that will calculate and we'll
create it and as you can see it's the
same graph as before except it's got a
contour graph at the very bottom so at
negative 400 it's placed this contour
graph showing exactly where the large
values are to the not so large values
and it shows how fast the steps kind of
grow up so you can see the distance
between these two quite large and then
it starts to get really tied up here is
the value stuff too steeply jump okay so
to close that off now let's try using
the measure Z function so mash Z X Y and
Zed and as you can see it fills down
fills the sides in with a straight line
so you can't see through to see the
bottom of the bowl so it just fills all
the way from the edges down to the zero
zero on the edges here close that off
and now we'll finally use the surf
function and we'll give that XY and Z
again and this time we get a object and
it's got all of the edges filled in now
it gets a bit laggy when you're moving
it around cuz it tries to it
recalculates everything and all of the
colors every time you move it but as you
can see it gives us it gives a bit more
of a visual representation of how steep
each of the numbers are okay cool
close that off
now now that we know how to make our car
make our graphs let's look at how we can
save those graphs to a file you can even
send it straight to the printer though I
don't recommend doing that to save the
graph as an image we use the print
function we then specify the format type
this will we'll start with a dash D and
then after that we have F that we have
the type of format so this could be a
PNG or a jpg or even PDF so here's an
example that shows print - DP and G to
print a PNG and save it to a specified
file so let's save our surface mesh from
earlier so if we come over to octave and
we create our surf mesh so surf X Y Z
and it pops up so when we've got this
figure open we can say we can save it so
we come back over to the octave we can
type print - d PNG and then the file
name so I could do my mesh dot PNG
go down slightly taps and my message up
in G so does implicit can conversion but
it's just working around in the
background and it prints it out to here
PNG so I'll quickly just open this up so
I believe I've got it my ox data file so
yep we've got this my mesh top PNG so I
can open that up and as you can see we
have an image of our graph and this is
in its proper aspect ratio so it's not
stretched like it is before and it looks
more of a bowl this than it does inside
octave but anyway
all right so now we've printed that or
close it and we'll come back over to the
slides I spoke a little bit a little bit
about this earlier with the plot
function but most graphs have the
ability to be formatted the format
parameter can be put together with three
characters of the following format
options the line styles are solid lion
dashed line dotted line and dash dash
line the marker Styles our crosshair
circle star point cross Square and
diamond as well as the colors black red
green blue magenta cyan and white there
are also attributes and value parameters
for changing aspects like line width and
marker size there isn't many extras to
talk about here the octave Docs has
information on every topic every type of
graphing function and even has some
examples for most I'll put the link in
the description for the documents keep
in mind that if your graph doesn't load
use the hold on command to update the G
charge your new plot window also while
using hold on you can stack graphs on
top of each other this concludes our
look at plotting data in octave feel
free to leave any questions in the
comments and I'll do my best to answer
them next we're going to look at flow
control statements in octave thanks for
