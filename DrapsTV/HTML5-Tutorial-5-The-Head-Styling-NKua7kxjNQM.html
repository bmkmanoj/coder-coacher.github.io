and basic styling in this video we'll be
looking at adding a head to our web page
to give information to the web browser
about our web page and how to do some
basic styling to change the website's
look every video up all slideshows and
code available in the description the
head is part of the base structure of
our HTML documents the heads main role
is to hold all of the information about
the web page itself the kind of
information your finds is things like
metadata the page title styles links to
styles as well as links to scripts and
many other items none of the information
in the head section will appear as
visible to the user though html5 does
not require you to put all of this
information inside the head tag it must
come before the start of the body tag
I'm telling you this
so when you read HTML code that has been
written by somebody else you understand
it's part of the head ok so let's look
at an important part of our web page the
title the title is the text that appears
on the top bar of our web browser window
or tab the title lets the user know what
is on that page and for identifying what
web page is open in what tab of their
web browser it's also used by search
engines as the big text link that people
click on ok so let's add a title to our
index HTML document from last tutorial
what we'll call the page title our first
page ok so first we'll have a look at
the page in the browser
so if we open up our index.html we see
that the tab name is the file location
which we don't really want we want it to
have a page title so we'll come over and
edit our file so we're going to open it
up in notepad plus plus and before our
body is our head so we're going to add
our title in so title and then in
between the tags of starting and closing
tag we're going to put our title so
there our first page exclamation mark
and then we'll close off our title tag
and we can save that and we can run it
so we come back up here and we refresh
we'll see our tab is now called our
first page and if we have a look down
here we've got our first page is open in
Mozilla cool there are several more tags
that can go into the head of our
document one is the meta tag this tag
allows us to add metadata to the page
for search engines and also for the page
information the kind of information we
would usually add is keywords author
details page descriptions and the pages
character set there is even an attribute
that allows us to tell the page to
refresh itself after a certain amount of
time okay here are some examples of some
metadata first we have some keywords for
the page that are comma separated we
also have a description of the page the
author of the page then we have the most
special meta attributes http-equiv gives
the header information to the web
browser here we have told the page to
refresh every 60 seconds finally we have
an example of telling the browser the
character set that the page uses okay so
let's add some of these meta tags to our
index.html so we'll come across to our
code and we'll do it after our title so
we're going to do the meta tag space and
then we're going to give it the
attribute name and that name attribute
will have the special name keywords so
we're going to add the keywords to our
web page and the content attribute holds
all the content for that for that
metadata name so we're going to have our
first page and we'll also have HTML as
they type as a keyword and we'll also do
tests as a keyword and we'll close off
our quotes for the content and then we
can close up our tag now meta doesn't
require a closing tag so if you wish you
can do a self closing tag or you can
just leave it unattended
okay so meta name - name equals sorry
and instead of keywords this time we're
gonna do a description and our content
for our description
we'll make it equal to our first test
page and we can close off the quotes for
that and close off the meta tag now
we'll do one last meta tag and we'll do
this one can be our HTTP - equiv to
refresh the screen so we'll do HTTP - II
quit
equal to refresh and the content for the
refresh we'll set it to you 10 so it's
nice and quick and we can see it refresh
and we'll close up that tag cool we'll
save this and we'll go have a look at it
so come over open up our webpage and if
we keep an eye on the top tab we'll see
that it will refresh itself it'll happen
really quickly because there's not much
content on our web page there we go just
happen really quickly and we can't see
our meta tags because they're not
designed to be seen by the user but if
you want to check them out and make sure
that they're all working we can right
click and go view page info and when we
do this it'll open up the page info and
we can see that it's got three meta tags
it's got the keywords for the web page
the description and also refresh and
it's refreshing every 10 seconds cool
okay now that we've got a little of the
dirty work out of the way let's look at
some basic styling styling on the web is
done through the language called CSS
which stands for cascading style sheets
these styles are used to tell the
browser how certain tags slash sections
should be presented to the user there
was some basic styling in older versions
of HTML however the responsibility has
been left to CSS in html5 html5 to still
support basic alignment of objects but
once again it's suggested to use CSS
can be added to a web page in three
different ways first we have the style
tag that can be placed in the head
section of our html5 document secondly
we can put a link to a separate style
sheet file in our head section and
finally we can add styles to individual
items by using the style attribute this
is called inline styling okay so let's
add some very basic styling to our
index.html we'll set the background
color of the page to gray and we'll set
all of the paragraphs to have blue text
we'll also use the align attribute to
align our formatting paragraph to the
center I'm keeping this basic css3 will
be a whole separate tutorial okay we're
going to come across to our code and
inside of our head we're going to create
a style tag and we'll close off our
style tag okay so inside of our style
tag we're going to style the P tag so
for paragraph and then inside curly
braces so open curly braces we're going
to do the color : blue and then we'll do
a semicolon to end that line and then
we'll use our curly braces to close off
the the style for that tag okay we'll go
down to the next line and we're going to
edit a body tag now now in our body tag
and open up our curly braces and we're
going to set the back ground - color :
I'm going to set it to grey and we'll
close that off with a semicolon and
closed curly braces and that's our style
written so we'll save that for the
moment and we'll go in align our
formatting section so h2 we're going to
align equals and in quotes we're going
to do Center
and we'll do it also for the paragraph
underneath so a line equals urban quartz
center close quotes I will save this and
we'll come over to our web browser to
our first page and we'll have a look at
it so if we refresh you'll see we've set
the background to gray all our
paragraphs have blue text and our
formatting has been aligned to the
center rather than being over on the
left hand side so cool this concludes
our tutorial on the head and basic
styling I know the head can be a little
confusing so if you have any questions
leave it in the comments and I'll try to
answer it as best as possible
the next topic we'll be looking at is
creating tables and lists don't forget
