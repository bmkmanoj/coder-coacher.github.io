they throttle but I'm going to go ahead
and showcase some things that I'm
working that we've done as far as the
certificate are concerned first I'm
going to open up the wiki our trusty
wiki and show what these certifications
look like and what the requirements are
to obtain these rarefied certifications
so if you don't know freako camp has a
whole lot of free verified certificates
that you can get we have the front-end
development certificate and we have the
whole stack development certificate and
we have over the past few months thought
about exactly what needs to be completed
in order to earn these respective
certificates and after considerable
discussion we decided we wanted to err
on the side of rigor and making them
challenging to obtain even the front-end
development certificate so in many ways
you can view the front-end development
certificate is kind of a halfway point
through the curriculum so let me show
you on localhost real quick what our map
looks like now
so um this is what our new map will look
like once we release all the new
challenges and once we have pushed the
remainder of the code that we're
currently working very quickly on to try
to get live it'll go on to beta this
weekend and it will probably all go on
to Rico camp com early next week so
first of all you can see that we brought
back the getting started section and
we've broken these down into a new style
of challenge that's still gift driven
and image driven but basically it allows
you to advance through them like this
and click through links and it's got
gifts that will show what you're working
on and Berkeley Martinez worked very
hard on that but you'll see that you'll
work through that the waypoints we have
a lot of different way points that are
the same as they've been we're gradually
expanding them but it's important to
note in case anybody has any ambiguity
about this the waypoints are not
necessary for obtaining the certificate
we only care about the results we don't
care about how you get to finishing the
necessary challenges and the necessary
challenges that you must finish are the
basic algorithm scripting challenges the
bonfires the basic front-end development
projects the zip lines and then the
intermediate bonfires and the
intermediate zip lines so this works out
to be about a 25 26 bonfires and 10 zip
lines in order to obtain the certificate
and then we have you can click claim
your front-end certificate and it will
even take you into a challenge where you
sign our academic honesty policy and you
are awarded the certificate so the
certificates the way these look
currently are they we
we render them dynamically so we can
award them immediately after you've
completed that challenge they'll just be
attached to your profile and so again
for the front-end development
certificate you have to complete all the
basic and intermediate bonfires for the
and and you also have to complete the
basic and intermediate zip lines this is
a little bit of a change from what we
had initially we had it like slightly
less than you had to do but we decided
that we wanted to err on the side of
rigor because we want this to be a
challenging certificate to pertain and
we want it to mean something when you
obtain it for the false tax certificate
you just have to complete all the BASE
jumps zip lines and bonfires and once
you complete all those you'll
automatically be eligible to obtain the
certificate
so we on that certificate Quinn save one
quick question from the chat will that
display the Dare username or their
actual like would it say brianna marie
or Briana sure i can use to that
question i would actually dental it i'm
just afraid of a little break because
berkeley and i were working on it still
late last night but basically the
certificate will show your actual
personal name like it everything is
based off of your free code camp account
which is now tied directly to your
github account so you should be using
your real legal name on github and you
should be then we pull that in on free
code camp and and that's the name that
will display there if you don't have
your legal name currently you can go to
github and you can just update it and
then you can click the button on our
profile page to pull the new information
from LinkedIn and then it'll update the
name and it'll update on the certificate
too so even if you accidentally like
don't have all your your name and
everything correct when you submit it'll
dynamically be updated because every
time it dynamically renders the
certificate the other thing that the
certificate important thing about these
certificates as they are verified and
each certificate has a unique URL that
an employer can go to and view that
certificate to confirm that that's a
real certificate that it makes it
basically makes it impossible to forge
the certificate unless you had access to
our production databases there's no way
that you can forge these certificates
and another thing I wanted to talk very
briefly about is the fact that we have
on a Creative Commons academic honesty
policy which we looked around we were
going to see if there was a good one but
there wasn't one so we just created our
own it's a little bit um specific to
free code camp but we think it's it's a
good starting point for any organization
that wants to have a academic honesty
policy and a knack an academic honesty
pledge which we take very seriously I'll
talk just very briefly about why we
decided instead of having code review
instead of having you know you go
through a bunch of Hoops in order to get
the certificate well why we decided to
go ahead and automate it the reason is
we believe that ninety-five percent of
people are just going to do the right
thing naturally maybe ninety nine
percent of people are just going to do
the right thing naturally and we wanted
to instead of making it a pain for
everybody we wanted it to be pretty
frictionless so what we'll do is if we
do if we suspect that somebody has a
plagiarized or is just flat-out like
defrauding us somehow the certificate by
just copying and pasting solutions in
there real quick or using some sort of
programmatic method we'll just suspend
their certificate until we can verify it
because we've got this verified
certificate URL even if somebody
hypothetically did get a certificate we
would just go and shut down that URL and
then no longer can people verify the
certificate so we don't also we don't
have to worry about people forging the
certificate manually by like changing in
Photoshop or something like that so um
because of our general belief in just
general honesty and goodness of our
campers we decided to just have this
academic policy that you except instead
of trying to have a rigorous peer review
system and all these other things that
would
taking up a whole lot of everyone's time
and energy so that's all I have to say
about certificates perhaps we could demo
the new portfolio pages Berkeley are you
ready to Joseph you did um sure right
quickly would you like me to make you
presenter he yes all right you should be
good to go
so as soon as berkeley shares the screen
it should be visible all right how does
that look great can you see the screen
yeah we can see it so we've consolidated
the portfolio page and the account page
so everything is one of you now we are
also eliminating duplicates from your
computer bonfires array so now you can
see that we have a very concise view of
all your solutions here you may notice
that we're not actually showing the
solutions on this page anymore that's
because we will take you directly to
your solution using a link let's see if
this load's there you go so now you
might notice that there's all this
funkiness in the URL and that's because
we are actually storing to your solution
in the URL as well as in localhost so
whenever you make a change of San make
this true you're here i'll update well
let's let's do something more obvious so
here you can see it says palindrome
let's make this into for me OOP sewed
updates the URL why would we do this
because you can then grab this URL and
share it with someone it'll take them
directly to the challenge with your
solution already loaded so then they can
verify that either solution works or
help you debug it or I don't know the
other thing they can do
and and so Berkeley every time you run
the code it also updates the solution
like it updates the URL with the new yes
solution yes so you can see here in the
URL the name of the function is football
if i change the URL if i change the
function name pelham drone will see the
change here palindrome awesome so just
just to prove that this works berkeley
why don't you why don't you message that
to me and I could just show what that
looks like on my end you don't have to
make me presenter because I'm on the
actual one screaming I'll just open it
up real quick if you throw that in chat
again alright so I'm just going to click
this and it opens up a new window and
here's Berkeley's code I'm not you know
I'm not signed in or anything this is
just the code that came directly from
Berkeley and I can run it and see that
everything but one of the test is
passive for example so that's the power
of this new new way of displaying these
that Berkeley's go off with so brooke
Lee please carry on show some more about
the profile ah sure we're also adding
the HTML challenges and the jQuery
challenges to solutions are to your
profile page she didn't actually show
before and I think these also work in
the same fashion so you click on the
link and I'll your solution here
and yep sitting that's it well Berkeley
why don't you sign in real quick and
show them the the ability to like make
all your challenges private in public
right
sorry guys my internets just really slow
sick in a while for me to sign in there
you go let's go back to my page alright
so here's what the view looks like when
you're signed in we have the update
section here so let's say you want to
change your name you change it on github
and then you click this link it will we
pull the information from github of
course you can link your other social
media accounts you can have multiple
ways to sign in to your to your single
account and then you see the basic view
here and then if I click hide all my
solutions down here when you manage my
account section alright so now all my
public solutions now all my solutions
are hidden from the public so if i still
sign out
now you can see bottom still signed in
you can just open a link on you know tab
with that URL you see the cockiness have
no did you just share a specific tab
instead of sharing your entire screen
when you share it on yes okay well now
you're you're logged up so just go back
to the / Berkeley true and it should
show your profile without any of the
solutions wait there you go so now if
you don't want your if you don't want
the public to see your solutions
whatever reason you can hide them here
so now they're hidden awesome so this
was by the way this was a very popular
request from our campers we did this big
survey of like I think four or five
hundred campers responded we just hit it
with people who had listed free coke
camp as their school on linkedin and
that was definitely one thing people
didn't want like duplicate versions of
the same bonfire they've completed they
just want the latest version of the
bonfire we still keep the original date
that you first completed it so that's
not overwritten when you get a new but
when you complete the bonfire again it
just updates to solution itself and
because it's only showing the last
version we assume that's the best
solution you've done for the bonfire and
then the other thing is that that you
can hide your data if you want to for
some reason but because now we have such
so much data that you can view if you're
a teacher and you've assigned free code
camp to your students then suddenly you
have the ability to go in and look at a
very nuanced level and exactly what your
students are doing and as long as
they've kept their profile public then
you should be able to just go in and
literally see as much about what they've
been doing is they themselves can see
the other cool thing about the side this
would be Cyril file mode is that it
gives employers like a very easy way to
like peer in and see you know what your
actual work looks like and really just
we prioritize it tore your your projects
your your zip lines and BASE jumps are
at the top and then your bonfires and
then your white points are at the bottom
because we think those are less
important but still it's it's good to be
able to see them so we err on the side
of showing everything and if you have a
certificate as part of our academic
honesty thing if you have a certificate
your certificate will only show up if
you have the if you're showing all your
solutions because we believe in
transparency and github is all about
transparency open source is all about
transparency we don't want there to be a
shadow of a doubt that that you somehow
got that certificate without having
actually work through everything and if
the employers can literally just go in
and look at your code then that saves
them a whole lot of guesswork and
generally that's something that you
should be proud to showcase your code
because you have worked really hard on
it and you've been learning it and it's
definitely better to show stuff than to
not show stuff in my experience as a as
a manager so before we move on I wanted
to show everyone real quick a quick
recap about our coffee and code we have
this great blog post that Michael
Johnson wrote I can make you presenter
Quincy if you bike sure I'm going to go
ahead and throw this into the twist shet
and while he's doing that I just want to
say that the profile changes are a
direct result of your feedback to all of
you who are watching now and who are
maybe watching later on youtube if you
were one of the ones who responded to me
and LinkedIn and took the time to fill
out that survey thank you so much we did
have
nearly 500 respondents and I spent quite
a bit of time reaching out to everyone
but it's so important that we understand
and we have our finger on the pulse so
to speak of what the community likes and
doesn't like so that we can make these
changes so anytime you're given the
opportunity your voice will be heard so
please take the time to do it and we
will you know make actionable insights
out of out of all of your answers so
thanks again for participating in that
awesome uh so very quickly if you
haven't already taken a look at this
blog post I just want to highlight some
of the great things that many of our
campers are doing in their communities
some this is just some of the camp sites
that are very active the Philippines has
very active groups in surigao and in
Manila we have a lot of Canadian camp
sites that are active as well and then
of course here in the US we've got a lot
of camp sites that are quite active
Tampa Tampa Bay Area New York City I
mean there's so many I don't I can't
give an inclusive list we have more than
400 campsites right now if you go to the
wiki you can see real quick campsites
and I want to say something very briefly
about the campsites just because I want
to make sure that everybody knows this
in advance and it doesn't come as some
sort of unwelcome surprise previously we
were using git er rooms for all the
campsites and I was a part of every
single one of those giddy rooms and our
observation of the use of those good
rooms was generally they weren't high
enough activity I think people are just
really busy and they don't have a lot of
time to come in and regularly chat and I
get her chat for their city but people
are regularly posting on their boat
their Facebook pages so what we decided
to do is de-emphasize
get ur chat rooms by listing them we
didn't delete them they're still up if
you want to use them you're welcome to
but we delisted them from the actual
list of campsites here and we definitely
recommend you use Facebook to the extent
possible for organizing events because
Facebook has built like in the group's
they have built in eventing and pulling
and all these additional capabilities
that we think will make it easier for
you to have quick and easy coffee and
code sessions so I wanted to point that
out we are still fully committed to our
campsites obviously like we're doing
everything we can to create better
documentation better guides for our
campsite local leaders if you haven't
already joined it and you're interested
let me just show you real quick what our
local leaders facebook group looks like
I'm going to go ahead and paste the link
in here if you don't like Facebook
that's fine feel free to create a
facebook account just for interacting
with these camp sites because it's a
really huge opportunity and you can see
here that we've got about six hundred
forty two people in the local leaders
group and it's it's quite active people
sharing interesting things people
sharing insights things from their local
group that they thought were cool
they'll share it in this group so this
is kind of like the the nexus for the
more active admins from the different
campsites so if you haven't joined this
campsite and you're active in your
campsite and you're interested in
scheduling more coffee and codes and
things like that I strongly recommend
you do I think you'll improve it please
view the wiki article is about starting
it there was a question by a World Strad
I want to start a coffee in code locally
what do I do definitely read that blog
post definitely consult the wiki there's
a whole section on campsites and we're
trying to do everything we can
make it easier for you to get together
but the easy answer the short answer is
show up somewhere uh ready to code and
let other people know you'll be there
simple as that and see who shows up
thank you Michael so I think with that
we can move on we've covered a camp
sites we've covered our our new academic
honesty policy our certificates which
will be available within the next few
days we're just finalizing the code for
those and we demoed our new
comprehensive portfolio pages so um I'll
go next yeah go ahead Michael alright
let me make myself presenter and see if
I can't share my screen as you may have
noticed we uh sure miss cream milk roach
okay it looks like its recited it don't
like share it it's just taking a moment
yeah it's it's actually being exchanged
well my mom that I just want to thank
everybody for bearing with us earlier
like there whenever you're trying to
coordinate a whole bunch of people doing
a live stream from a whole bunch of
different cities it's always challenging
so we started a little bit late thanks
for your patience yeah and I'm sharing
my screen now for some reason it didn't
want to make me presenter um even though
I'm the organizer so as you may have
noticed we've been running a community
design a vote vote for our first t-shirt
design and I am happy to announce the
winner which is the function call logo
there were over 4,000 votes on this in
the week we had it up and your voice was
heard and and this is our first edition
free code camp t-shirt and I am happy to
announce that I just bought my wife one
because it's available on T spring now
so and i will buy one for myself but i
will paste the link into twitch and if
you feel a like supporting free code
camp please do let me just you know say
a little bit about teespring teespring
is basically kickstarter for t-shirts we
chose the highest quality shirt they had
the American Apparel crew and women's
teeth that are made in the United States
and we just want you to know don't feel
compelled to spend money you don't have
to buy it but whatever proceeds above
the cost of the shirts we receive will
go to making free code camp a better
place so I'm going to paste that into
the twitch and you know it over the past
year so many people have tried to donate
try to give us money free code camp will
always be free but you know if you feel
like walking down this street and in
showing your support for free cocaine
this is the way they do it so I'm happy
about this first design it was designed
by Ryan mom who's watching now who did
all of the artworks the banners
everything you see in free coach camp
goes back to Ryan so Ryan's come up with
this bonfire logo design and I'm I like
I said I just bought my wife one but i
will buy another one now in fact i'm
gonna buy it now is michael is there's
only two more needed to print did you
set the the number that's the reserve so
you need at least three for them to even
run it the the number we need is about
300 shirts ok so I'm while I'm doing
that maybe we can keep moving curtain
and i'll just stick i'll just say a
little bit more about teespring
basically as Michael said it's like
Kickstarter for shirts as long as we
sell at least 300 of these t-shirts then
they'll actually get printed and and
mail that is is that correct Michael yes
I believe so ok so we just said it like
it a conservative figure of 300 and
you can I think they have international
shipping and everything and like I said
these are like Michael said these are
really high quality shirts it's like
basically the best kind of t-shirt you
can get its american apparel which is
famous for being like an ethical
retailer or ethical textile company and
they actually manufacture these i think
in los angeles so um check out the
t-shirts yeah all right um Quinn psycho
satlink yeah I will shortly yeah I'm
gonna buy a bunch on for already asked
apart I don't think they have baby sizes
yet but ok Quincy I just what I don't
want to do is show all of my paypal
details on Scrubs I've Miller here's a
temporary so so Michael um the next
thing we wanted to talk about is commit
Oh what I thought I could do is is demo
that on my side because I've already got
it open and I yep by all means i can i
can continue to show your face while you
talk about it great um well i'm going to
share the link to the tee spring
campaign in the gotomeeting chat I'm not
logged in to twitch so it won't let me
so if one of you wouldn't mind sending
that to twitch that would be great so
while Quincy is getting that setup and
unfortunately Quincy I oh now I can see
your screen you can see I just want to
talk them yeah yeah so I'm sorry and a
little scattered but commit so uh you
know one of the big things about free
code camp being free and always being
free is that sometimes you need
motivation and you know if you commit to
nothing you'll be distracted by
everything I heard that somewhere and I
strongly believe it so what we'd like to
do is offer you an offer
tunity to not only set a goal for
yourself commit to yourself but also to
help nonprofits before you actually
begin coding for them and the way we're
doing that is with free code camp commit
commit is based on the idea that you
would set a goal either earning the
front end development certificate or the
full stack development certificate and
commit to making a monthly donation to a
non-profit until you achieve that goal
so you're incentivized to finish as
early as you can in the meantime you
know that rather than giving your money
to some code school you're supporting a
non-profit so we think this is a pretty
killer idea we're going to keep a
running tally of the donations that have
been pledged to nonprofits and as a
community we will be able to say free
code camp this open-source community has
donated X amount of dollars and amount
of dollars to nonprofits so it's not
quite ready to deploy but we were so
excited we couldn't wait to announce it
this is something we've been brewing up
for some months now so Quincy maybe you
could walk them through how it will look
injure and sure than the beta sure so
this is this is a as I said it's a
little bit rough like literally
assembled by me and Berkeley at midnight
last night but the general idea is as
Michael said most online course
providers like Udacity charges two
hundred dollars a month a big treehouse
charges like fifty dollars a month and
and I think those are you know those
worth it um part of the value that you
get from paying for a service like that
is the actual paying for it is like oh
man every month I'm going to get this
check credit card charge and it's like
ah I really should have used that
service more because i just paid two
hundred dollars to use it something like
that so we wanted to kind of capture the
the sense of like having skin in the
game / oh really feeling like oh man
feeling that sense of urgency but we
didn't want to actually obligate anybody
to do that if they did
want to but we wanted to make it also
kind of feel good like even if you
didn't get a whole lot done this month
at least you're at least that you know
ten dollars or fifty dollars went to a
really good cause that that's getting
good done in the world so it's really
win-win you're getting motivation I'll
just read michael johnson's copy
verbatim are you looking for a burst of
motivation do you want to help
nonprofits before you're ready to code
for them you can do both by pledging a
monthly donation to a non-profit until
you've earned either your front end or
full-stack development certificate so
the interface is really simple you just
choose which certificate you want to do
we have a couple nonprofits that we've
already chosen just to simplify things
we've already meted these nonprofits and
believed in their missions and their
related to helping people learn to code
girl develop it is a great nonprofit
that has in-person classes for women to
learn to code that's in tech is a
nonprofit that helps us veterans
returning from overseas to get the
skills they need to get coding and tech
related jobs and then just very simply
you can choose if you have a lot of
money why not 50 bucks and then you can
click commit and then basically that
commitment will show up on your personal
profile page it'll say you know Briana
supports girl develop it with a ten
dollar a month donation or something
like that and basically it'll be a way
for you to be publicly committed to
working through your certificate while
also publicly supporting these profit
organizations that are doing so much
world so much good in the world and
really helping the crisis in lack of
developers which please don't let
anybody convince you it's anything other
than that there's a reason why
developers get paid 150 thousand two
hundred thousand dollars and it's not
because development is so much harder
than all the other fields that pay 60 80
it's it's because of demand
so I won't go too far into that but i
will say that that these nonprofits are
doing great work and we plan to have a
lot of other nonprofits cycle through
here as well so we're definitely keen to
get recommendations if your nonprofit is
is doing good in the world we'd love to
hear from you and we can consider adding
you as well we just wanted to keep this
forum simple as possible so there's not
a lot of wavering and so you can just
quickly move through what we didn't want
to do is give somebody an excuse to say
oh I've got to think about this for a
long time and then not come back and do
it because if they if they want to
commit we want to make it easy for them
to come in but again there's absolutely
no pressure to do this it's optional is
completely optional and we are only
implementing it because we think it can
be of use to you like everything we're
doing a free code camp everything's
routed around us wanting to make freako
camp more effective make it more
effective at helping you learn code in a
more practical way how do you think it's
an effective way to have skin in the
game so to speak so like in a chat a lot
of good feedback people really like the
idea but there seems to be a lot of
people wanting a five-dollar option so I
don't have that be possible but chat we
hear you looking for more options of how
much to donate that's totally possible
we will add more options of how much to
donate you got it absolutely we just
didn't went on for too many options
because then people would feel like
paralysis like oh so many decisions we
didn't want to have people choose their
own amount because they could just put
like one cent or whatever I'm million l
or a million dollars or something
impractical that would throw off our
numbers and we just wanted to keep it
reasonable so yeah we we can definitely
consider dropping a five-dollar option
in there thanks for the feedback
everyone so um next I would like to hand
things over to Brianna Brianna has been
working very hard on some things and I
wanted to give Brianna an opportunity to
talk about them as you all know Brianna
Swift is a long time camper and she has
started actually actively contributing
to free code camp itself and a little
bit about Briana she is a k-12 teacher
in champaign-urbana and Illinois take it
away Brianna can we make Briana present
so that she can I'm trying to do that
now I have made her the presenter
perfect we can see great times it takes
to come through yeah we can see your
screen awesome so basically what i have
been working on are a bunch of short
videos called hikes if you go to the
YouTube channel the free code camp
youtube channel the hikes are already up
there there in the playlist called
computer science and software
engineering theory with Briana and
there's 45 videos up right now which is
kind of hard to believe um they are
short like seriously if you look at the
time it's like between a minute and
maybe the longest ones like four or five
minutes so the goal being you can wash
these on your phone if you're commuting
you can watch them on your computer
whatever is most convenient for you the
audience for these high five is kind of
a mix usual it's people who are either
commuting and would like to keep up
their learning when they can't actually
code so much on their mobile device and
also users with no previous computer
science experience so like myself I went
to college for music education I didn't
have to take any computer courses and I
think these videos the purpose is to
have an intro to a lot of the topics
that are going to be relevant to web
development um yes as you get further
along and you do things like ziplines
and BASE jumps that way those topics
you'll already have kind of a background
and you'll be familiar with the terms
and concepts if you have any ideas for
more videos the ones that are up there
or not like you know this is all we're
going to ever have no more videos I
would love to make as many as you guys
won't watch I mean I am loving learning
more about computer science in the
process of making these and trying to
really good now and just tell you what
you really need to know in one or two
minutes the way to do that there is a
chat room on free code camp called
height and also if you put an issue on
github and just put a tag for hikes I'll
look at that and start writing some
scripts than getting those recorded um
thank you very much freon adjust to
answer some of the questions actually
we're getting ready to say some who go
ender Hugo enter said it would be great
if these were embedded in free code camp
somehow well I have great news actually
our original intention and installed our
intention is to get these on to Franco
camp calm especially on to a frico camp
in a way that it detects that you're on
mobile device and shows these at the top
basically as additional challenges
called hikes and Berkeley is working on
the infrastructure for those but
basically it'll be like swipe kind of
like a tinder like interface where you
can you can answer questions through
false questions just by swiping and that
should be live very soon it's just
taking a long time we've had a lot of
higher priorities just like I don't know
if you noticed like two weeks ago we
just ran out of space on MongoDB because
we're growing so quickly we had to go
and do the emergency maintenance on
MongoDB we also had some other emergency
issues with the planet which you can
read about on our blog we try to be very
transparent about all of our mistakes
because we don't want you to make them
yourselves and weird unabashedly an open
source community of people that are not
formally trained in computer science
even Berkeley he's a mechanical engineer
by training he learned to code on his
own I learned to code on my own as you
may already know if you read my blog
posts um and basically we do make
mistakes obviously when we make mistakes
we want to tell people how to avoid
those mistakes so so those are just some
of the reasons why it's taken so long to
get Briana's hikes up but she's going to
continue making these wonderful short
videos that are really designed to be
compact and like everything on freako
camp as respectful of your time as
possible the best information like the
most you know she could go into it like
insane detail about things but she tries
to keep it nice and high level and these
videos are nice and quiet metallized so
these will be on free code camp soon to
answer your question absolutely another
thing that I'm seeing in the chat
somebody is a couple are wondering about
other concepts that could be in videos
like for BASE jumps or things that
they're confused with they're absolutely
if you have a specific idea of something
that you'd like to see in videos like
these in a short format put them into
issues in github and I will absolutely
look into that thank you very much for
you on it Oh another person who's on the
call whose face is invisible because he
doesn't have a webcam is like Johnson
like are you here I'm gonna make Blake
presenter great yep how do you everybody
in chat how do I present my Quincy you
may want to share actually I don't have
this thing installed to share like no
problem so what I'll do is I'll uh I'll
just open up a new window here um I've
made you presenter Quincy cool okay let
me I'll paste the link in here into the
chat
alright so I'm watching the chat for the
link it's in the single repeating job
okay there is great so um like I can say
just a little bit about like he's a
family man uh he is a longtime employee
of a ratings agency where he worked as
kind of a data scientist role and now
he's working Mars like a managerial role
he is a longtime camper and he has been
hard at work on his boiler plate
Clementine jas the elegant and
lightweight boilerplate for full stack
JavaScript and we are in love with this
and I'm going to let like go ahead and
tell us a little bit about it yep thanks
Quincy appreciate that as Quincy
mentioned yeah i work for for nielsen
i'll go and throw the name out there and
i've been there for 10 years as far as a
little development background about
myself i went to college for journalism
so nothing related to to development
whatsoever and I've just taught myself
I've only been learning since about
november of last year I joined free code
camp last December so what happened was
I went through all of the content with
on free code camp at that time and I
finished sometime around the end of
january and i got to the point at the
end there which i think that was like
the beta version of the site and i still
didn't understand quite a few pieces of
how how the mean sack at the time fit
together so what does it mean to really
build a full stack application with
javascript and so I started looking
around at some of the boiler plates out
there and there are a lot of popular
ones like mean Jas mean I Oh angular
full stack html5 boilerplate etc and
what I found was that a lot of them are
really complicated and especially
complex for beginners people they
contain features that you don't really
need up front
and navigating them and untangling sort
of the the spaghetti is really difficult
so then about mar end of march beginning
of april i set up out to make my own
version of that that is much simpler and
easier to understand for beginners and
really for Clementine there's there's
two different parts to Clementine you've
got the the actual boilerplate and
there's multiple versions of that
there's a free code camp version that's
especially for the free code camp
curriculum and that includes a that
includes authentication and in it which
isn't in the base version and you've got
an angular version for the people that
like angular but in addition to just
like the boilerplate we also have
tutorials and what I've tried to do with
these tutorials and I know I was a
journalism major but I probably written
about code more than I've ever written
about anything in my life other than
emails probably but it's probably
hundreds of pages of content on
tutorials of how to build basically the
Clementine boilerplate from scratch on
your own and I try and really dive into
the details of why am I doing this this
way and try and help it make sense from
a beginners perspective because I was
just there not too long ago so I feel
like I have a unique perspective in that
regard and so there's a there's a
tutorial for just creating a full stack
JavaScript application which is going to
be the beginner tutorial there's one to
take that application and then integrate
angular and then there's another version
another tutorial that's going to
essentially explain how to then take
passport and integrate the
authentication piece into that
application and and all of that like I
mentioned a step by step with really
detailed explanations of why we're doing
certain things and how the pieces fit
together
okay excellent so just FYI stop sharing
my screen with the other people on the
on the chat just because it was
completely killing my machine for some
reason gotomeeting must have a memory
leak or something I or my machine must
really be stressing so let's talk a
little bit about you've talked a little
bit about how you have these different
tutorials one interesting thing about
them is that you've got you've got the
framework you have the actual the actual
code that you can clone and you also
have these tutorials and you actually
have three different versions because
you talk a little bit about the three
different versions yeah so there's just
the original I guess based version if
you if you want to call it that and what
that's going to give you is you're gonna
it's basically front-end framework
agnostic we're going to build a
application with MongoDB node and
Express and on the front end we're just
going to use javascript ajax to
reference the api and so it's very very
simple very easy to understand
application it's basically just an app
that's going to show you how to build
something that where you click a button
and you're incrementing a value in the
database and it gets saved in the
database then we've got the the angular
version which the only difference
between the the base version and angular
version is instead of using just
JavaScript Ajax calls we're going to
integrate an angular controller into the
application it's kind of like an intro
to angular if you're not familiar with
it it's a very very easy tutorial and
very very simple i would say tutorial
and then lastly we have the the free
code camp version which it's got it's
the same as the base version but then we
take passport and we integrate github
authentication just like is used on the
frico Kent website and that is required
to do a lot of the base jumps so you
need that authentication piece and and
that routing with the different
parameters to do a lot of the the base
jumps and so that's going to
you should be able to use Clementine to
do to do all of those great and I'm
thrilled to announce that we have heard
everyone's concerns about young angular
full-stack being a little bit too
complicated for a beginner way too
complicated I mean it's complicated for
me we decided that we're going to go
ahead and switch over to Clementine jas
as our boiler plate before the base
jumps so just yesterday Blake and I were
working through and figuring out all the
details of getting a Clementine Jas free
code camp version running on cloud nine
for example where we still recommend you
build it if you don't already have like
a very solid understanding of how to
markings on your local dev environment
it's just really convenient don't have
to worry about missing see libraries and
all kinds of weird environmental
variables and path issues and things
like that so this is uh this is
definitely the future of full stack
development with free code camp because
I can tell you just very anecdotally
this is as basic as you can get like it
would be very challenging to make a node
express MongoDB Mongoose passport stack
that is simpler than this I mean the
demonstration the app is actually
literally clicking a button and having
it count the number of times you clicked
that's how fundamental it is but it does
have github off which you'll need for
practically every base jumping as well
so the actual installation and getting
this all set up assuming you want to
just jump right in is uh maybe 10
minutes long on the it only takes like
10 or 15 minutes to get it set up but
that's if you want to get preco camps
clementine ejs version running on cloud
nine but if you actually want you can
literally build it
black perhaps you can talk a little bit
about how these tutorials literally help
you build Clementine jes yeah yeah sure
so the first tutorial the beginner
tutorial is going to build the base
version of the app and it's I mean it's
literally going to step you through
step-by-step create the you know create
the server-side controller create the
server file create the the routing file
and it try to go in an order that makes
that makes sense and and I don't just
throw the file at you and then explain
the file we're going to build the file
together we're going to build out the
functionality together in a way that
makes sense so so really kind of
building the the app and the knowledge
as you progress through the through the
tutorial and then what you would do from
there if you want to build a free code
camp version as you after you finish the
beginner app then you would jump to the
passport integration tutorial and by the
time you finish that second tutorial
you'll have basically created the the
free code camp version of Clementine for
yourself you'll you know you will
understand how it works from top to
bottom because you'll have done it all
on you either your own machine or on you
can do it on cloud nine or another
remote code editor our IDE but really
like I mentioned earlier they're just
meant to be really comprehensive
overviews of how to create a full stack
JavaScript application and then each
tutorial after the beginner tutorial is
going to just add a little bit more
knowledge to to the to that base app
Quincy one thing that I'm seeing in in
chat is that people are asking about
angular not being in the base version
did you want to talk about angular and
maybe free code camp I know we had this
discussion really well like the elephant
in the room is are we going to continue
to use angular on free code camp or are
we going to switch to something else
that's something else being reacted
and flux and the answer is we're almost
certainly going to switch to react in
flux which is I mean Berkeley perhaps
you could talk about some of the reasons
why you think express it or why do you
think react in flux or a better fit than
angular right now like what the the
strengths of of these are over angularjs
so in particular with react and angular
the react a P is much smaller compared
to angular angular is just overly
complex I posted a blog a link to a blog
recently where it just played a bunch of
flaws with angular that aren't really
being fixed it's just kind of ingrained
and what angular is whereas react it's
very simple API it doesn't take very
long to learn and once you learn it
realize you're not learning react you're
learning how to write JavaScript so
you're really learning how to use the
language instead of learning a specific
API I think that's one of the greatest
strengths of react is you'll become a
better developer overall now angular is
still extremely popular um if you look
like employers are still definitely
clamoring for people who have angular
skills we're not saying don't definite
weather uh but flux and react together
are essentially like a replacement for
angular I mean you can argue that they
can be used in tandem but it's in
practice I think it's pretty rare that
people use both angular and flux react
now we've been based at there are in
your Excuse cases but yes it's pretty
rare that you would want to eat a little
so coming back to that react is simpler
and it's more like coding regular
JavaScript rather than coding in a
framework because it's really just a
library and we think because it's easier
to learn and because it's incredibly hot
it's growing really fast and it's not a
trend I mean it I'm confident that react
is here to stay at least for in
JavaScript timelines for how long your
JavaScript library less the other the
other major concern about angular is
it's getting ready to basically get
completely rewritten and it's going to
be I mean like I finger 1 and angular 2
will essentially be completely different
frameworks of the chair I name am I
correct yeah Berkeley yeah so um the in
terms of learning angular there are
still some great resources the code
school of course on angular we're going
to keep that up until we have a
replacement react course but we do
intend to build a react series of
waypoints that teach you react is and
Ben McMahon who is building right now
our Ajax and JSON API challenges which
will be very helpful for doing the later
zip lines he's also going to help build
the react class the react challenges of
Berkeley may be able to contribute to
them as well because Berkeley's a huge
fan of reactor we've already we've
already started moving free coke camps
code base over to react and we will
build a react a series of react
waypoints so that's one reason why I
talked with bike and asked that we just
go ahead and take a angular out another
reason is like fundamentally I believe
that you can do most of the things that
you can do with a higher level like tool
like angular or react you can do a lot
of that just with jquery and we see this
all the time like a lot of our zipline
through virtually all of them are just
built using jquery which is extremely
robust extremely popular extremely
useful and simple and well-documented i
mean i can't say enough good things
about jQuery if you read my core of
posts i rave about jQuery because I
think it's just a really good tool and
I'm not saying that it's the tool I do
think that obviously we should be using
react as well and that there's a lot of
room for like tools like angular as well
but in terms of what you as a camper
need to be developing jquery should
suffice for most things and then we plan
to teach flux and react for doing
full-stack challenges later so the zip
line it's more like more playing 92s
interesting question should we be using
angular on the intermediate front-end
projects feel free to do that a lot of
people one of the things that I want to
really drive home about free code camp
is we are we are processed agnostic we
do not really care about how you get to
the results the result is what matters
it's just like if you work at a
contemporary company if you go get a job
at Netflix they don't care how many
vacation days you take a year they just
care about they don't care how many
hours you work you know you can just
show up at like noon you don't even show
up just work from home if you get the
work done you get the work done and
that's really how I think the workforce
is moving it's moving from measuring
process which is easier to measure to
measuring results which is more
important in so really we're very
technology agnostic we don't want you
using PHP or rails or something to build
these tools because the whole point is
you're using javascript put full sack
JavaScript I mean it's a it's the
biggest ecosystem it's the biggest
software ecosystem that has ever existed
on the planet the JavaScript ecosystem
it's incredible how many libraries how
much activity it's it's number one on
github by like it's twice as popular as
any other language um yeah and it's
growing very red this is Michael
converging on JavaScript so it's only
going to accelerate so we don't want to
since my cousin so its specific details
of implementation the answer is you can
you can use whatever you want as long as
it's JavaScript so we are just a hair
over an hour and we still need to take
questions from well you know which we've
done a little bit from the team brianna
would you like to host the Q&amp;amp;A session
with the community and we can stick
around and answer questions and before
before we jump to Brianna I just want to
say brianna is going to be
live-streaming completing bonfires after
this session so don't please don't go
anywhere we've got like a lot of
exciting content coming throughout the
the next few hours
Lee so Briana please hello and before we
go to Briana I'm sorry I keep
interrupting people um Blake is going to
stick around if you want to ask
questions as well Blake thank you very
much for creating Clementine Jas I just
want to give you a round of applause
because this is doing so much for
beginning JavaScript developers and this
this is the tutorial everybody there are
all these tutorials they're always paid
tutorials things like that like before
you do those check out Clementine jas
because I think you're going to learn a
ton this is essentially like the rails
tutorial if you're familiar with that
the famous rails tutorial this is the
rails tutorial for javascript as far as
I'm concerned like this is this is the
canonical tutorial that you should be
working through so with that I'll hand
it over to Brianna the tech questions
all right awesome so I've been trying to
keep my eye on the chat I've written
down a couple questions the most of them
event answers kind of as we go along one
that happened earlier on by some of the
people that join us a little bit later
is when we changes that we're making
that we talked about today go live and I
think from what i remember right if if
I've got it right they'll go to the beta
site which is beta free code camp
sometime in the next few days and then
maybe in a week or so week or two is
when we can expect them to go live on
free come camp com is that correct
Quincy that's correct absolutely
berkeley maybe you can give us a
timeline of when the features like a lot
of this development by the way berkeley
is just doing a ton of it we have a huge
open source community contributing but
berkeley is leading the charge I mean
basic all the features he touches pretty
much everything so Berkeley the key
features we talked about when do you
think they're realistically going to
make it into the code base like making
them so the sheriff Hall Cheryl
challenges should be up pretty soon um
certificates should be up in a couple
days and in the poor fellow changes
should be up with those as well and
commit should be up let's say by Tuesday
all right it's pretty quick
alright awesome I'm not seeing any other
big questions in the chat really there's
just a lot of good feedback people can
be really excited about all the changes
yeah I mean unless you guys unless I'm
missing something are you guys seeing
anything in the chat question yeah let
me take a look what we can what what uh
editors is everyone using for their code
since like Sablan some fine so I use it
dance what you like yeah use what you
like don't like yeah we use our own
things we use what we feel comfortable
with I've used them for a long time I
think it's wonderful a lot of people you
sublime I know Quincy uses ruby mine um
some people like to use adam atoms are
really good so sublime yeah there's a
lot of options it just takes some time
you see one and then it's hard to switch
after so if you pick one just know
that's probably gonna be for a long time
yeah that's exactly right I think
whenever I was first trying to pick an
IDE there's I mean everybody has what
works for them and they're pretty
passionate about it because that's what
they know i'm using webstorm i got a
student version of that that I'm
learning and I'm not really going to try
anything else until I get my head
wrapped around webstorm so like Berkeley
said whatever you try just kind of
commit to learning that before you start
just trying out everything and using
yourself another question from Jeff in
the chat are there going to be any more
zip line at it or the ones that we have
now where we're at excellent question so
i will tell you i don't like you know
this is we're much more of like a google
type company where we just flat out say
things that we're working on that an
apple type company where we like try to
make things perfect before we announce
them you can probably tell from the
roughness of this live stream we plan to
eventually have a d3 section so d3.js is
of course Michael ball stock one of the
most prolific JavaScript developers of
our time works at the New York
so these incredible visualization
library this incredible visualization
library d3.js if you haven't checked it
out you should absolutely check it out
actually I have a core answer about I
think it's some of the best written
JavaScript I've read I guess I can't
easily but I was going to say like what
we plan to do is oh yeah where can I
read some beautiful JavaScript code I'll
just place this into the chat because I
talked about the merits of d3.js and how
it's like really modular and everything
basically d3.js allows you to create all
kinds of crazy data visualization and so
we we kind of capped our zip lines at
the at the intermediate we didn't ever
create like an advances of the line
section because we're kind of hoping
that we are advanced appliance can all
be data visualization centric and I
don't know whether those is probably
won't be part of the front-end
development certificate just because uh
we don't want to keep adding things to
it we may add it but let me let me say
right now if you get a certificate
you're basically grandfathered in like
even if we change things or improve and
increase the number of requirements
later you still have that certificate I
want to say that right now because a lot
of people very legitimately are
concerned that we're changing our
curriculum a lot and stuff so we don't
care about completion of waypoints we
won't ever track that that's just for
your own benefit but basically we would
have a series of d3 related waypoints
and after you complete those waypoints
then you do d three related zip lines
where you build data visualizations from
scratch probably on coq10 like
everything else and and that would be
those would be the new zip lines
essentially and by the way if you're not
familiar with like the field of data
visualization it's like white hot I mean
there's just
there are so many jobs in there if you
know d 3gs jeaious you can go get a
pretty awesome job like a lot of
companies and you can parlay that into
knowledge of a more specific tool like
tableau for example which I've got a
friend who works at Facebook that does
have low that's literally all he does is
tableau data visualizations so this is
definitely a cool skill to have and one
of our campers Suzanne Atkinson who
created our coding boot camp cost
calculator which is a d3 app let me just
pull that up real quick is it it's
coding boot camp cost calculator I'm
just going to show this very quickly
because it's a great example of what you
can do with a little d3 so that would be
what the advanced zip lines would be and
we do have a roadmap that includes
creating express courses and creating d
three courses it's just a matter of how
soon we get them done and we would love
help from the community then one of our
very prolific campers has built a lot of
our JavaScript challenges and we'd love
to help other people learn those skills
so they can Ollie they can also
contribute directly building waypoints
thanks for that was a long answer Briana
did you do you see any other questions
that pop up in the inner yes a couple of
them did I've got it for right now agree
on one we hold of idiots how will the
videos be integrated I think they missed
that part earlier on the stream the
video that are on YouTube will be
integrated eventually I'd it's my
understanding that they won't be in the
regular map of challenges they'll be
additional challenges that are meant for
mobile curriculum with like a couple
quick questions to basically check that
you were paying attention during the
video another question that's come up a
couple users are worried about
international shipping and they're
wondering if they there could be a tee
spring campaign in Europe great question
I don't know the logistics is doing that
Michael let me say this uh as long as we
can do the payouts to a us-based account
I'm halfway through creating that I saw
that comment in chat so I'm going to
investigate it a little further and if
it's it's possible we'll have a EU
fulfillment center campaign as well and
both of those links by the way will be
at the top of the map where the voting
for the design was so if you don't catch
it now you'll have a chance again soon
thank you awesome I'm speaking of data
visualization there's been a couple of
users who are asking about if we could
actually see a map of where all of the
users of free code camp are I know it's
kind of like a privacy concern you don't
want to be too specific about where they
are but that way they could get an idea
of how many users around them are on
free code camp is that something that we
could think about implementing in the
future absolutely Brianna whoever asked
that question great question we we plan
to make all the frico camps data once
this anonymize we're going to pull the
names and emails up addresses out we're
going to anonymize it to where you
wouldn't personally be identifiable we
plan to take all 110 115,000 campers
data and make it publicly accessible as
part of the open data movement and once
we've taken that huge block of data and
it'll be like regularly updatable we're
going to create a path basically where
you can go to this and you'll just it'll
download a huge CSV to your computer
that will basically tell you everything
we know about our campers other than
their names and emails and from that you
could take like a library of like city
names and potentially create a map there
might be a tool for doing that we use
github for today shin again we try to
collect as little information from you
personal information from you as
possible github is very respectful it
only asks for your name location and
your username I think and that's all we
get we get a little bit more from
facebook and linkedin and stuff but
we're not going to release any of that
basically all we're going to release is
the and and I think it's just like the
default like we get your public profile
stuff so there's nothing like weird
arcane it's just all been all this stuff
but we we just want to focus on where
campers are and what their activity
looks like within freako camp and once
we release that we've already got a lot
of people working on stuff like this
there's a gator chat room I think it's a
gator I am / free code camp / data
science I'm pretty sure that's it and
there are campers in there that are
talking about how to use all our data to
to figure out like patterns what
challenges are particularly frustrating
what is going on in the chatroom like
somebody did a like a cross section of a
day's worth of traffic in the help
channel figure out like who was
answering the most questions actually
all I'll say on that given day d ting is
one of our campers he's actually he's
he's pointed I think he's finished the
entire curriculum and st. Peter were the
most prolific helpers they would thank
the most on that day that they studied
so big round of applause to them for uh
for helping out other campers
need and so we do plan to make those
data available it's not a matter of like
any sort of it's just a matter of
prioritizing technical development
really we have finite resources in terms
of berkeley's time my time our campers
we have a lot of contributors that are
that are also working on this but
virtually everybody has a day job so
it's just a trickle of development work
absolutely a couple more questions I
only see two that have gone unanswered
so far someone asked that in the
ziplines the functionality they
understand they can get that but they're
designed just they don't feel looks as
nice as the examples how important is
that design you know there a way they
could go learning that or does it is a
really a priority well we believe very
much in function over form um as
developers like we're not estheticians a
designer could make things look much
better obviously but we just basically
like if you look at freako camp it's not
ugly but it's not like we didn't go in
and pixel perfect tweak it I mean sure
you can find a lot of hip pages that
look a lot cooler than ours well but one
thing you'll notice about freako camp is
we place a lot of value on user
experience we just used stock bootstrap
that we've modified a little bit there's
nothing fancy under the hood on
bootstrap you can confirm that by
looking at our you know our CSS files on
our open source repository if you just
use bootstrap and make it look decent
great if you want to make it look
amazing there are a ton of resources um
you know Smashing Magazine a list apart
a whole bunch of great blogs that you
can follow that will show you cold CSS
tricks there's a CSS what is it CSS tips
and tricks is a good website / drinks
yeah um thanks thanks for transcribing
these into the chat by the way everyone
um but yeah you can you can absolutely
make it look as nice as you want but
when I retweet something
uh from the frico camp Twitter account
that I see like somebody did just a
bang-up job on a on a zip line usually
I'm retweeting it because it's a novel
implementation like the content that
they use is cool or they did something
cool is not just because it's like
aesthetically beautiful because me I'm
personally I will always value function
over form so if you want to go into the
details please do there are tons of
resources for learning that it's kind of
beyond the scope of free code camp but
we're happy to post those links on
camper news that's a great place to post
on where they'll be searchable later and
people cannot vote Oh awesome that's a
great answer someone asked they've
completed the challenges earlier before
curriculum changes and I think this is
something that everyone's going to face
at some point because the curriculum is
constantly changing as a rule of thumb
how frequently should people go back and
redo new curriculum that you place
something they've already done I would
say that you don't ever need to do that
it's totally up to you if you want to go
review it um if it's something that you
really need you're probably like I said
all the way points are totally optional
I know a lot of people have this
completionist mindset you know the guy
Pokemon gotta catch them all um kind of
mindset and that's totally cool i even
like that too believe me i don't like
seeing things that don't have green
check marks next to them but i will just
say for your own sanity as things change
behind you just keep moving forward and
just go back and review if you have a
specific question that you see a
waypoint covers for example um it's the
same thing I tell the campers don't
worry too much about trying to remember
everything you can always go back and
look like Google is your friend you can
always just Google things as you need to
then the main thing is you want to make
sure you complete all the for the
certificates which we've made it very
explicit you want to make sure you
complete all the base jumps and zip
and bonfires that a given certificate
requires and we will gradually add more
bonfires and we may add more zip lines
and maybe even more BASE jumps but we'll
probably try to give heads up that we're
adding them because unlike the way
points which are completely optional
those will be actually required for the
certificate so we'll say like hey we've
got this block of new bonfires we're
going to release them in a month and
that way you'll have time if you need to
to finish getting your certificate
before and and once you have the
certificate regardless of what happens
you'll always have that certificate so
regarding the curriculum changes again
thank you as our curriculum evolves all
the changes we feel or for the better
but thank you for bearing with us as it
changes and it will continue to change
but much less dramatically than in the
past I don't think we'll ever have a
dramatic change in the curriculum like
we had two months ago where we
completely immobilized almost all
external resources that's that's not
going to happen again it will just
continue to build on and expand like
basically um it to elaborate a little
more the javascript challenges that
we've built me and been built those as
kind of like imagine that they're like
really broad and we're planning to go in
and fill them in with more like micro
topics with in between them things like
that okay I think from what I'm seeing
in the chat that's something that people
are relieved to hear because I think a
lot of people spent a lot of time going
back and filling in the blanks would
that be something we could add on the
wiki or someplace pretty visible when
there are changes it's okay to focus on
moving forward I think that's been a
confusion with a lot of campers yeah
awesome a lot of questions that have
come up are things that I think are
covered on other places on the site
whether it's in a wiki or in other
videos questions like how long will the
front and take me after challenges what
do I do can I get a job from this and
I'm going to quick answer those real
quick and you guys correct me if I say
something that's encouraged and you get
a job after the frico camp curriculum
yeah
if you complete everything that is in
the free code camp curriculum including
the nonprofit you will have an awesome
portfolio and all the skills necessary
to begin applying for entry level or
junior JavaScript developer positions
after the challenges after you get
through the waypoints and the bonfires
and the zip line after you finish the
map and the non-profit project which
there are 3 nonprofit projects that we
like you to complete and participate in
at that point you've graduated but as a
sin and some other blog posts and
articles people rarely actually graduate
and complete the curriculum because if
they're trying and putting in the work
they usually get jobs before they reach
that point so really what you get out of
it is up to you if you continue the
learning I think you'll find your path
pretty naturally and if you want that to
be a job I think you'll find yourself
there um checking to see if I got
everything that I've written down here
yeah is that all correct with you guys
sounds great and just a quick note to
everybody I saw a couple of people
saying like this isn't working that
isn't working um please send an email if
it is not a bug if it's something
specific to your account send an email
to team at Franco camp calm and me
Michael and Berkeley regularly checked
that and it'll take maybe a couple days
for me to get back to you but I will get
back to you and sort out whatever issue
you have because there are a lot of
one-off issues that are just weird
things because we changed things so many
times sometimes people's accounts
getting weird States and stuff that we
can fix manually um the other thing is
please do use that bug button that you
see if you see something report it we
significantly expanded the bug
functionality where it'll tell what
it'll automatically detect what type of
browser you're using and all that stuff
and it gives us a link and it just makes
it really easy for you to like fill in a
couple details so that we're aware of
the issue in leaking we can address it
we practice camper driven development
so what campers tell us needs to be
fixed that's the priority that's what we
go and do and you have an announcement
Michael one more that I oh I have posted
about me yes i have created a European
Union t-shirt campaign so I i went into
our current campaign and yes the
shipping was steep for international so
this should be a lot better for you now
and yeah so I pasted the link into
twitch again it will be on the top of
the map for the next month or so unless
we have another big announcement so
there you go ask and you shall receive
thanks Michael one more question I
believe this is about the base jumps and
the zip lines does the functionality
have to exactly match that of the
example one of the user stories the
example they gave is for a leaderboard
application instead of a voting app so
long as they both have a lot of features
with that fit the qualifications or so
listen cleaning that base job so I would
say that you can do about fulfilling the
user stories in any way you want but you
should be fulfilling the specific user
stories if you want to build a
leaderboard app instead of holding up
for example that's another common app I
think that's like the default app for
meteor for example that's their default
demo app um if you want to do that I
feel free to do that but please do that
after you I mean take your app after you
built the voting app and then repurpose
it to be a leader board app for example
but please do try to fulfill those
please please do fulfill those user
stories because those are what's
required to complete the challenge all
right
it I'm looking in the chat I think I've
taught everything chat if I've missed
something they'd send it again and we'll
address it but other than that I need to
take my dog out and then I'll be back
and I'll be able to stream some bonfire
I'll be right back you guys wrap it up
oh yeah we'll wrap it up enjoy your dog
will see you in a minute Brianna yeah
okay so Brianna again to reiterate
brianna is going to be doing some
bonfires live um she's going to be
streaming immediately after we end so
don't go anywhere but but Michael did
you have some things you wanted to say
in closing uh just closing thoughts this
has been a great summit I apologize that
we got started a little bit late I hope
you you are all as excited as we are
about the developments taking place
behind the scenes a lot of experienced
developers come to free code camp and
they say hey can I skip the curriculum
and just go straight to helping
nonprofits and really be the best thing
you can do is help us by contributing to
the code base so feel free to reach out
to Berkeley who is at Berkeley true in
Gator or Quincy Larson he was at Quincy
Larson and yeah so Berkeley's Berkeley
true all over the internets but um yeah
we're just so thrilled to have you
almost 300 people were watching by the
time I actually opened up to which which
is awesome and thank you again for
taking time out of your Saturday to be
with us this open source community is
changing the world and you're all a part
of it and you're here very early so we
turn one year on october 15 and we'll
have to do something to celebrate but
I'm just so glad to be a part of this
community with you all thank you Michael
um and thank you I just want to thank
Michael again for all this hard work
michael has been instrumental we started
a bunch of new nonprofit projects this
month know that Michael has been
spearheading along with our first
volunteer project manager
it's fun and we are we were tackling
some bigger projects than previously
because we now require that all campers
have completed all like everything
basically including the BASE jumps
campers are even more prepared now when
they're coming in so things are getting
done much more rapidly and there's a lot
less ambiguity people are already
familiar with full stack development so
things have been moving really smoothly
with the new nonprofit projects and
we're we're eager to ramp up a lot more
we have a ton of nonprofits waiting but
if you happen to know anybody who runs a
non-profit who's interested in having
some development work done please feel
free to send them to our forum uh I'll
type that in great basically our goal
with free code camp is to become the
best place on earth to learn web
development and we think we can do so
while also helping a lot of nonprofits
and we've already I think done more than
100 more than four hundred thousand
dollars worth of work for nonprofits and
we're hoping to get that up to 4 million
you know in the next year I mean we've
got really ambitious plans we want free
code camp to become the next Khan
Academy we think we can get there we
want it to become like a Wikipedia like
resource with the quality of our wiki
and and if you look at some of the
articles that are being written on our
wiki they're definitely solid let me
just show you very quickly this article
that was written on how get rebase works
so I mean this is this is a pretty
comprehensive article about how get
rebase works and how we use it within
free code camp so it's all about taking
our workflow our knowledge that me
Berkeley Michael and so many of our
other core contributors have and sharing
with you so that you can incorporate
this in New York flow so that you can
base
we already know all the best practices
right out of the gate when you start
your job also a lot of returning
developers we have a lot of campers
who've been doing Java development or
PHP development for the last five or ten
years who are learning how to do
JavaScript development and learning you
know full stack JavaScript and a lot of
them you know get and a lot of these
technologies didn't asur exist right
back around then but if you do know a
lot about these you know different
aspects of the technology we encourage
you to contribute to our wiki right now
our wiki is four hundred articles um we
think that this can become just a huge
resource for general information
regarding using full stack JavaScript
and doing web development and just a
more general purpose stuff we're
planning to take the Mozilla developer
network is a great resource that's also
Creative Commons like our wiki we plan
to take it and further digest it down to
make it even simpler that's one of our
initiatives that we'd like to do right
now we're linking out to the Mozilla
developer network we'd love to have our
own camper kind of edited version of
those resources that is on our wiki that
we can also reference so there are just
so many opportunities for you to
contribute if you're interested in
contributing getting some open source
contributions under your belt and
getting some cool stuff you can talk to
employers about when you go in to apply
for jobs and the other thing we're
really trying to do of course is just
spread the word about preco camp we do
not have an advertising budget we do not
um do you know PR you're not going to
read you know press releases publish
verbatim in some newspaper basically the
only way people hear about free code
camp is if you tell them about it all of
our press from wire to Time magazine all
these other periodicals that are written
about us those have been campers writing
about us there's been campers that use
free code camp and enjoyed it and
decided that they wanted to write about
it it's not us going out to do it so
please what we
built some new Facebook sharing
functionality whenever you complete a
series of challenges it'll pop up this
button and you can click it and it'll
share a link to your personal profile
and that way you can show you know for
example how active you've been you know
if we pull up somebody on free code camp
right now st. Peter so I mean we can see
how ridiculously active st. Peter is 49
days streak oh my god I had no idea and
and you know of course this I think this
is going to be our new portfolios so
it'll have everything literally the
kitchen sink everything you've worked on
so basically when you complete a section
you'll be able to click Share and what
we're finding is twitter is really
powerful for communicating to campers
that already know about freako camp but
in terms of people discovering freako
camp facebook is definitely stoking
stickers I saw somebody shout stickers
yeah we can do some stickers I'm not
sure how we're going to go out
distributing them what I'd like to do is
buy a bunch of stickers and send them
out to some of our more active campsites
so if we have some money from the the
t-shirt campaign which I mean just like
anecdotally like basically free code
camp is fueled from our savings so we
don't have any source of income so the
t-shirt campaign will give us a modest
amount of money to like pay for servers
and potentially things like stickers
that we can send out to camp sites oh we
really see our campsites as being like a
major aspect of free code camp but we
want to support them as much as possible
we want to get as much give them as much
know how as much agency as possible
another thing is if you have a school if
or if you're a student and you're trying
to teach other people how to code help
other people learn how to code please
feel free to use our curriculum please
feel free to use freako camps chat rooms
in terms of like people can go there and
ask questions about our curriculum we
are totally cool with being kind of a
resource that people that are getting
ready to go
coding boot camps use the coding boot
camps themselves a lot of coding boot
camps use free code camp as kind of
their curriculum and then they do like
the job you know they help people with
the job interview skills and help
introduce some of the employers and
stuff like that on top of working
through our curriculum for example a lot
of k12 programs are using free code camp
we're trying to make free code camp easy
to use in these situations as well our
objective is to continue improving
freako camp and continue to grow our
community if you look at like
communities that are really flourishing
many of them are in the millions of
people and we think the more people we
get within our community the more the
more campers we have in our community
the more popular our campsites are going
to be the more likely you're going to go
to a campsite and meet a whole bunch of
people some of whom can potentially hire
you or at the very least recommend you
to their company where they currently
work um the more people we have a free
code camp the faster you're going to get
help when you ask for help in the help
chat room the more campers we have uh
basically the more content that will be
contributed to the wiki the faster
tickets will be closed on our open
source repository there are so many
reasons why having a big free code camp
is beneficial we're not going to
sacrifice person ability we're not going
to sacrifice the intimate experience
that you have from connecting with other
campers even when we get really big well
we'll make an effort to preserve all
that but please do tell your friends
about free code camp anybody that you
think would benefit from learning to
code that is the most immediate way that
you can help all of us we will fulfill
our kind of sort of reference making
free code camp as good as it can be and
we'll keep it free for everybody but we
would love it if you could help go out
and and tell your friends about free
coke can
to to interject really quick teespring
will soon be selling stickers so we'll
be able to do that as well it's not
fully available yet but they're testing
it out and they have like three by five
and five by seven options that's great
and we were trying to keep it limited at
first but I also saw somebody who said
they wanted a hoodie I mean just the
thing about teespring is you need a
certain number you make a goal so will
scale the demand but really the best
thing you can do is pick up a tee shirts
who doesn't like a t-shirt right and we
plan to we plan to have other campaigns
in the future and what we're hoping to
do at this point is keep the designs
unique so that like if you buy this
t-shirt like it will forever be like a
unique limited run and going forward you
know like you'll basically be able to
visibly show your friends when you go to
free code camp coughing codes when
you're out of hackathons that you are
the first generation camper if you will
like you're one of the first early
adopters of our community somebody asked
if you can make donations we are we're
not interested in donations directly
what we would prefer is if you just buy
a t-shirt and tell your friends about
free coke camp I mean again I've said it
like 20 * tell your friends tell your
friends tell your friends but really
that's like the most important thing
that you can do for the reasons that i
just mentioned and i'll probably write a
blog post about this saying more in
detail why i believe that having a big
freako camp is better for everyone but
but basically we've got we've uncovered
so many diamonds in the rough so many
people like a Ben McMahon so many people
like Rick Schrader here so many people
that uh have just kind of wandered
across free code camp and suddenly
started contributing so much to our
community and we think they're dozen
more of these people out there and you
might be one of these people that will
just become this huge
net giver to our community and and we
want to definitely make sure those
people know about free code camp because
there are too many times that people
people email me like why haven't I heard
about this place before and it's just
because we're choosing to non advertiser
do anything just grow organically so all
right um you guys thank you very much
for listening to me talk very well I
just wanted to make sure that Briana had
plenty of time to take her dog for a
walk so we had a seamless to hand over
yep I'm back and ready to go awesome
well I will go ahead and stop this
stream and Briana will immediately start
er stream and she's going to go into
working through bonfires so please stick
around thank you everyone who's already
bought a t-shirt thank you everyone who
has contributed within the last month
we're going to continue doing these once
a month and we'll try to figure out
something to do for our big birthday
bash maybe we'll do another live stream
then but thank you Michael Johnson for
joining us Thank You Berkeley Martinez
for joining us thank you blake johnson
for joining us and thank you all for
joining us as well thanks everyone
awesome happy coding have a beautiful
