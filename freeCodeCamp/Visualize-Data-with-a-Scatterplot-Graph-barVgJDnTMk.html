visualize data using a scatterplot graph
with d3 let's take a look at what we're
going to build this is a scatterplot
graph visualizing doping in professional
bicycle racing as we can see there are
many plots and they're organized along
these two axes the y-axis is the ranking
from first place to 35th place the
x-axis is how many minutes behind the
first place that individual racer was on
that race so we can see that first place
was this Marco Pantani
and he was also in second and third
place and then Lance Armstrong was in
fourth place in terms of time and he was
approximately 50 seconds behind Marco's
best time and we can also see that those
writers have doping allegations the
first place writer who doesn't have a
doping allegation was carlos sastre so
once we tool tip over we can even see
some additional details about the doping
allegations and let's go ahead and take
a look at the rules rule number one
don't look at the example projects code
figure it out for yourself
rule number two fulfill the below user
stories using whichever libraries and
api's you need you can give this your
own personal style and be sure to use
d3.js that's the point of these projects
is to give you more experience using
d3.js to do data visualizations so user
stories are I can see performance time
visualized in a scatterplot graph I can
mouse over a plot to see a tooltip with
additional details here's the data set
that we use to build this and you can
see I'm using the JSON format or plugin
for Chrome which you can get in the
chrome store I strongly recommend it and
that makes my JSON nice and easy to read
you do not have to use this data set you
can use any data set you want but it
will need to of course be renderable
with the with the scatterplot graph
within d3 so again we recommend using
this data just because it's a little bit
easier than having to go out and find
your own data and structure it in a
specific way and that's kind of beyond
the scope of what we're trying to do but
if you feel the desire to do so please
we'd love to see the interesting data
sets you bring to the table remember if
you get stuck to used research ask and
when you're done be sure to share your
project in our code review chatroom and
also on twitter and on your city's
campsite on Facebook have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
