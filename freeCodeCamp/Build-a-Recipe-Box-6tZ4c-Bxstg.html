going to use sass and react to build a
recipe box let's take a look at what the
finished product might look like you can
see there are recipes here which we can
read we can edit and delete them and we
can add our own recipes as well so first
let's go over the ground rules don't
look at the example projects code figure
it out for yourself
fulfill the below user stories using
whichever libraries and api's you need
but give it your own personal style also
you have to use sass and react on this
project the user stories are I can
create recipes that have names and
ingredients I can see an index view
where the names of all the recipes are
visible
I can click into any of those recipes
and view them I can edit the recipes and
I can delete the recipes and finally and
most importantly all the recipes I add
are saved in my browser's local storage
if i refresh the page these recipes will
still be there because they're saved in
my browser let's take a look here so we
can see that can expand we can edit it
let's just add one more thing more
noodles and you can see it's right there
and I can also delete this completely
and now let's just refresh we'll see
that only onion pie is left because
that's being stored in my local storage
in fact I can show you right here and
resources sources I think resources here
we go local storage and you can see in
here that I have my recipe book and it's
a JSON object
it has all the current recipes so let's
just add a recipe real quick we're gonna
call this roast duck and I'll just say
duck glaze sauce and then you'll see
it's right here
we can edit it we can delete it and if I
open this up over here see if I can
stretch it out a little bit we can see
roast duck is right here it's visible so
it's in local storage and if i refresh
it's still there as with the other
projects be sure to use read search ask
if you get stuck don't despair read then
search the nest and when you are
finished be sure to share this project
with your fellow campers and you can do
that in our code review chat room you
can do that on Twitter and on your
city's campsite on Facebook enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
