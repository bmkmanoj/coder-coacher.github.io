off you know we've upgraded to a to a
for flame after after going through
feedback and looking at looking at the
stuff we got and in Google Analytics for
it all right my assertion is that this
is not that hard of a not that hard of a
ah of a a challenge all right so with
cementery differences this one is
relatively easy but if we start adding
more on it starts getting a little
harder but not really like so really the
algorithm for this is get unique values
get unique I use in an array symmetric
two arrays more than to compare
symmetric or compare results of
symmetric gifts from first comparison to
new array and result in new array right
so that's really what symmetric
differencing is like that's the
algorithm right or in plain English
right so so we could totally do
something like this so first of all I'm
going to fund my own function called
unique right and it's going to take an
array okay yeah and in the array I'm
just going to hey I'm going to say or
inside this function put uniques equals
and I'm going to make it just an empty
array right and um what i can do is
I can say array are ya so I can call
reduce all right and reduce takes a left
and a right all right so we're going to
call the left the accumulator and the
right side we should we call it will
occur yeah current current so good way
because it is the current one we're
looking at right and we're going to pass
our uniques into it right so every
single time right so and then we're
going to say very thin to the right yeah
it's empty right now so bare index
equals equals accumulator index of kur
right and if index it does not equal
negative one or well actually equals
negative 1 right then we're just going
to kimya later push current all right
okay so see what doesn't like here Oh
index of kur right what did i do here
okay didn't want that okay and what is
not liking about this even extra bracket
now where I way you just remove one of
the functions please never really bright
oh there goes perfect all right so
there's our there's our unique function
right so that should give us unique
values so we can actually test this in
our console okay so
I think we can anyway
it looks like element about that doesn't
yeah i'm not sure why it doesn't like is
it locked is that what's going on come
on firefox oh okay there we go now you
got it Shh web browser Scott no no power
over me all right and right back over
there so we have uniques right so if we
go um oh you know what i should actually
probably do that and then in here I
should probably return uniques yeah I
probably be good so if so first of all
in here we need to return the
accumulator inside of that and then
under here when you do return uniques
alright so let's copy this all again
because that's better function or that's
a correct function so let's just say
unique and we'll say 11 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3
2 alright so should just return 1 2 3
but right holy that's going anywhere
though because you're using ARR or way
how's it getting in there though be mean
well in in here i'm going to call it i'm
going to call my unique function i'm
just i don't see how uniques is getting
populated though unless I'm missing
something
um because I'm passing it in here oh
gosh yeah okay yeah you're here okay
I'll follow you now all right and the
reason why it works is because it's just
an object so it's passed by reference
yeah right it's not copied into the
function it's actually passed by
reference you write them how that's the
what we do who the being called on okay
no worries um all right so i have my
unique function right which by the way i
can reuse this function anywhere it's if
i extracted this out into a library it
would be available for use anywhere I
wanted right um so there's some of the
power right in functional programming
right is I made a function and I can use
it whenever I want okay so then we're
going to come over into you this and
we're pretty much going to do the same
thing right so we'll just call this
symmetric equals all right we'll go like
this and then return array dot prototype
that sliced call arguments
Hey quezon deebs thanks for following
all right so notice I have the return
here I'm actually saying I can totally
totally do or I'm going to return here
so everything is going to be chained off
this right so um so yep and then I'm
going to map okay okay um okay and I'm
gonna return unique Alan okay and then
I'm going to reduce all right and I have
my accumulator in the current here okay
so um and then i'm going to say current
for each function alum all right um and
really it looks a lot like unique notice
oh yeah um since you're moving against
Ted ever really unique values in a 10
where or run around like a talk 1 array
you can remove it from the other
array-like check them its unique I'm
both right yeah yep that's exactly what
I'm gonna do um so um because and here
you'll see right so if index is equal to
negative 1 which means it wasn't found
right then I'm going to push the element
all right otherwise
I'm going to remove the element because
it's not it was founded both of them
right I don't want it anymore ok
ok so I'm returning the humanoid array
or I'm returning the huemul ater inside
which is just a reference to symmetric
here right yeah ok so I'm gonna go ahead
and rent it and it works Wow first try
so um but there wasn't a lot of notice
there's no arraigned extra SAT all right
hi I'm I don't have to worry about where
I'm at in the array I don't have to
worry about any of that overhead like
 to be honest that this inside
like a lot of imperative programming um
you know and if I had abstracted this
out right so let's say I used a library
function called the unique which by the
way we have because I've made ram de
available right so notice how I mean we
don't have that right so but if we go
ahead and leave it in right so our
solution not counting not counting
having to implement unique right our
solution was 18 lines long right and you
might wonder why I put the dot here
instead of here um I just use it for
alignment purposes cool so but so I mean
quickly going over this while reading
the functions talk to me how this works
so for here you're just making an empty
array to declare if later and then the
let's return will return everything
you're going to be doing here rate a
prototype does sliced a call it's going
to flatten and offline
just so you can use them as arguments
right it's going to convert the
arguments object to a proper array and
and some people get freaked out by this
so like well why does this work and
again i'll point i'll point out exactly
why all right so let's think about what
an array looks like a memory right so
it's probably get a length all right so
we'll call is will call it well you know
one for now right and then it's probably
got a key of zero and will call of five
alright so this array if we were to type
it we would you say array equals right
five right that would be that data array
in memory would look like this okay I
mean there's other syntactic shooter
right so let's look at what arguments
might look like right so if we did args
all right and we said they were those
two arrays so literally it's coming in
like this you know and then it's 5 to 14
right so that's probably what it looks
like and there's some other stuff here
but if we look at it in memory right
ours so 0 is probably one two three
right and one is probably five to 14 now
I don't know if this is actually the way
arguments looks like in memory i would i
would have to go into the source code
wish I hadn't but this is the way I
conceptualize it so when I call a raise
prototype slice over it I could see how
a raise the prototype says okay we'll
give me key 0 okay now give me a key one
now give me a key to until there's no
more keys right and it's so in then it
returns me the arguments in an array
because slice without any odd sliced
without arguments is a copy of the array
and this is not an argument to slice
this is an argument to call so
yeah thought I got real array okay
anyway sorry go ahead I didn't mean to
go off on a unattended there then once
you get the actual array from that
you're gonna map over that and for each
element you're going to return the
result of this here you just making
another here is another empty array
you're gonna reduce over the past Iraq
all right the past array here you're
checking each element if it's already in
the array I mean if it's not in the
array if it's not then you're going to
push it into the final array and then
once you're all done you return that
array and then return there uniques
which place is this so once you get all
the uniques of one you're going to
reduce over that well this is going to
happen over all of them before it moves
on so so it like in this case it really
would pass in there it would return one
two three that's the first element and
then 5 to 14 it's the second element and
then I'm reducing over an array of
arrays still here oh cool okay then if
is not in the array you're going to add
it back to the array it is already in
the array you're going to remove it from
the array that's about it usually take
for your final answer so I i'm in a
paraphrase which said but so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to convert
arguments to an array and then I'm going
to Matt book for arguments and for each
item in arguments I'm going to return a
unique set of each element right and
then over the arguments I'm going to
reduce
all right and for each array in
arguments I'm going to for each over
them I'm going to get the index if the
if it if it didn't exist in an empty
array which I passed in here then I'm
going to push it all right if it did
exist I'm going to remove it I'm going
to remove it end of the the array and
then I'm going to return that and so so
really I mean does it start making sense
why functional programming is kind of
kind of cool because I'm saying what I
want it to do I'm not telling it how to
do it really i mean i guess i'm telling
you how to do it because I mean in order
to I think in order to really probably
get get a functional programming need to
understand what's going on and meet the
hood but conceptually at a high level
I'm saying hey listen I want to convert
arguments into an array and then I want
a unique set of each sub array and then
for all those sub arrays I'm just going
to start pushing them into an array and
if they exist I want to pull them out of
the array if they don't exist I want
them in the array until there's no one
more elements left and then I'm going to
return that when i'm all said and done
so it is a I think it's a really cool
way to think about programming yeah it
definitely takes a while to get used to
it I think just the mindset of it yeah
so but so you did this one you did this
challenge right already yeah of course
he did all right so do you I mean you're
not going to hurt my feelings but which
solution do you like better and and what
did your solution consists of yours
definitely like but I might have a ton
of for loops and I used hashing a lot to
see if it was already in there
which I think I i think i even used the
key as the ID and then the value as how
many times I saw it and then I only
pulled out each one that I saw once i
think was pretty much how i did it right
ok definitely was an elegant at all so
so yeah and how many lines your
solution now viewers that a shorter
solution does not mean a better solution
necessarily but how many lines was
here's what you say oh good question let
me see if I still actually have it and
then I can put it in there and I
accidentally deleted I term okay on fire
ok I think I still have it here
I do okay I'll just replace the code
with yours here it's really not a whole
lot of difference in length but it's way
more unreadable yeah so and I mean look
at look at the overhead I I would say
look at the overhead that you had to
keep in keeping track of where you were
yeah right whereas I really didn't give
a where I was I I the function will
take care of that you know so oh good
sale yeah well I worked at one point
maybe I had changed okay oh don't make
 with a loop I think I had this was
different oh yes it was been updated
these are he's pacing the entire thing
here I don't know I worked when I did it
I guess yeah don't worries so but oh
yeah this is in a different order for
whatever reason now oh right because
expected three or four 5d deeply equal
354 because the challenge never says
anything about sorting them in order
yeah I probably need to go back and redo
this one yep so yeah and in fact I added
that to you I added that test because
their order doesn't matter when it comes
to symmetric differences yes so so
there's there's no reason to sort stuff
and a lot of people were sorted now you
could actually get the keys with reduced
on the object you know that right yeah
okay because yeah you would just pass an
object instead of an array and then you
would you know just do do some simple
like
00 x is equal to 0 X you know died when
I did all the bonfires I I always knew
functional JavaScript existed but is one
of those things I just kind of ignored
so I didn't use any of it but I'm slowly
starting to come around to it it
definitely has its uses for sure right
oh yeah it has a lot of useless I mean
you can actually I mean you can take it
further and you can set up entire
applications in functional program that
just wait for data to come in and then
the Machine kicks off and you just know
it's going to work because you had the
function change set up yeah so it makes
it super easy to reason about it so
anyway I think that cover says 1030 you
have an interview so you should probably
do stuff you got a lot of angular stuff
to cover yeah and in fact you know what
I will uh I will copy this over close
firefox bonfires symmetric differences
expect us not to find that's not a good
sign there we go huh weird it just
happens sometimes perfect I got some
points how does that work now do I get
points for that not if you've already
solved it okay so and I'm bad d see I
haven't bothered going through and
solving all of the bonfires on
production oh yeah then I kind of feel
that I'm my Java scripts okay it's
passable so um I think your job gets a
little bit better than mine I gotta
compete on the zip lines though um what
you do I'm well hey remember some of
your zip lines interface with my AP is
that I wrote very true Larry do so and
they're they're beautiful api so you
have to admit that ya know I've had my
share of very bad ones and this is quite
the opposite of that yeah well you know
I figure I'm writing it to interact with
it myself I'm going to write it so that
it's really really easy to get exactly
what I want so um but Yemen so anyway
hope you guys all kind of dug the the
functional programming stuff so i'm
going to i'll go ahead and link this in
chat yep and if i can get any of them
done anybody um so the links to chat
highly recommend you guys you guys check
it out also so JavaScript launch is all
about functional programming and it
actually gives you like recipes that you
can use so it's patterns programming is
all about patterns follow patterns so
give this book read it's actually very
quick read
it's not that hard to like you know croc
um and just keep it bookmark you know
glance through it figure out what it's
talking about you know be like huh well
that's pretty goddamn neat and you know
take a look at the patterns you don't
have to memorize them because is never
referred there than a bookmark away
perfect so anyway guys thanks for
watching and have a good night yep
thanks everyone all right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
