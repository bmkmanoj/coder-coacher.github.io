D I need to share my screen with you and
da dude has he done that I hope that
would life be classified oh man how you
done this big fat spider-man is then
sing a check because he is I'm trying
that that must be an emoji there's no
way to be typed yes I just am having
trouble scrolling on twitch chat so no I
guess I can't see it oh it is so has the
has the mom let's see here I'm wondering
whether oh I think we're we're actually
live okay okay so sorry for the
unscheduled interruption there i'd like
to blame my cat who was playing with
them playing with the power cord and
took out my computer and both monitors
I'm like what would everything go no it
was a catastrophe Oh go if you not save
your progress on the word strokes in
paragraph 1 the last sentence okay thank
you thank you have a little class from
the chaff from my end my cat joke take
my cue yeah can you guys still see my
cat OOP that's something that I have two
billion to collage am am a brad storage
interface well normally I'm normally I'm
pretty good about doing so there is a
ctrl s now which is very handy oh I
think I skipped one I skipped stand in
line I'll have to go back and do that
one but this is golf code okay Oh s T it
is fixed isn't it it is it's fixed but
this is not the display is not fixed oh
no here it is
here it is oh did maybe I had two errors
and I only fixed one of them anyway give
that person some brownie points is this
it is John looking from Johns Lucas
what's your username on get er / getting
up I think it is Junsu coming down for
person hopefully that's a real person
okay okay so I'm gonna continue solving
this even though it's like really
scintillating streaming here i'll just
type quickly oh and don't like your if a
statement oh you're really down on my me
yeah like I have no opinion works it
works well remember that yet you have to
learn it the wrong way in order to learn
it we're in the right way no i'm uber
pragmatic I'm so like if you want to
push the button from that orders like
whatever works I'd be a cherry pie
manager everybody different ok c plus 1
222222 GTG Oh Carolyn Hannon just did it
using switch ah yeah did you do well I
guess we'll have to try it um actually
if she can cut and paste her code then i
will try it after i tried this one ooh
oh except i can't for some reason the
twitch chat has not come up for me yet
it's okay making fun of you for using
double and single quotes oh my sis tile
everybody are you the same thing yeah
any reason to do it just I stuck to what
I'm saying yeah ok so special both of
stuff so I actually don't have to hard
code the if on this um Ukraine and well
and in fact I'm not even going to drop
an else on I'm just going to say
go home because really if you are
getting six strokes then okay so let me
run it and see if I got it right Oh
interesting so for one should return
hole-in-one know ! ah pair coding right
there pair programming all right okay so
as Carol posted her solution yet unless
I think we should make that a very smack
up some because I can just see the
onslaught of github issues of challenges
and work I'm UNT flicked oh no no it's
the ! don't forget us you think I should
remove the ! nope just make like a reg
ex that makes it like an optional know
if it's done if should already be done
with the reg ex but just make the
estimation uh it's not a regex though
it's a it's a strict equals but I could
do it I could turn into a test I leave
it then it's too hot even hey sometimes
you have to check for what's different
and sometimes the thing that's different
is an exclamation point it's pretty
clear about what it's supposed to equal
okay well if Carol if Carol does come
back come through with her code then i
will paste it in here and see if it
passed the test because i'm interested
to find out if it does i did get me
apparently if you get a warning do not
panic I'll fix that and just replaced it
in after that I don't know what to turn
on a move on definitely does not like
links actually Genoa I'll just do that
secretly hope you like I mean might save
Sam issue let me make well moderator and
no use a regular stink under move us you
should add to get up from threadless and
just have found six to a good thing girl
says there's the same test twice and
she's right again everybody go give her
brownie points I think we should take oh
ok now the question is the quick yeah
okay how do you feel about how is your
employment situation okay let me look at
and see if the problem may be that I
just didn't update the display yeah okay
so it's actually testing 52 I just
forgot to update the output but give
that woman some brownie points if you
haven't already
we have another m golf score 42 she
returned eagle which is true still in
the park it is doesn't it for 2 is equal
yeah Eagle um hey that's right that's
right equal three more then why is 52
also eagle and it's a very good point oh
that's an albatross that isn't it oh oh
the reason it is the reason is because I
think technically you could have like a
double eagle or something double eagle
right hunter but I didn't want to
writing I didn't want to make everybody
have to write every possible solution
and so in fact like there's double and
triple a quadruple bogeys and so on I
think the buggy and then it goes close
an albatross I don't think it's possible
I called existence hide an amateur yeah
I mean so like getting a like getting
two on a par 5 I think would be a double
eagle but the but the main thing is that
three under car then I just didn't want
I didn't want to have the table be so
huge that it was going to take forever I
mean you saw how long it took for me to
type all this baloney in home to find
somewhere to trimming it trim the fat
yeah I think doble click split em
specifically is a witty where it's a for
everything now chairman terminal it's a
double-double too well wait others so
there's how it is in reality and then
there is how I've written the code so
you need to conform to what I've written
in this table or you will not pass the
test oh that's what it comes down to so
did we did we ever get Carroll's code I
think she's putting it in again ever I
college they're actually for me today so
she's gonna put it in the name don't
bother trying to follow matter anything
just lift reach up in there people give
a sháá sore thumb it was kind of us
for ya I'm not I'm not seeing it well
anyway I'm gonna I'm gonna move
to the not actually technically the next
one but the previous one which is what
i'm calling stand in line um so anyway
yeah okay Leah Ali hello oh hi Leah
Alicia I can read that name oh here we
go carol has got her solution right here
having cut and paste that in there oh
very nice so I don't know oh let's see
but she does have semicolons that she
doesn't need but we can change that last
Kate through the fall actually yeah and
actually well I'm gonna I'm gonna run
hers oh except it's not console.log its
return it's just thrilled that he gets
to fix something for Carol instead of
the other way is it oh and then we and
if we do return that we don't need the
break so I'm just gonna ignore those
like I'm just pointing out it's doable
you guys oh you're right always right
okay you uncle you don't have to defend
yourself and it passes so once again she
has my she's the queen she is the queen
she's the day on me we mm-hmm be queen
see only 17 okay so somewhere in here
okay bonfire shopping list I did I
skipped a bunch of these okay it is uh
so we've got so we talked about all of
the array access stuff and I've added a
new thing about multi-dimensional race
so the shopping list is t2 fio is super
super simple what we have them have you
doing is just generating up entries here
so um canta meeting and we're waiting it
dramedy a my actual shopping list we can
put on it okay and uh soda we're going
to be
really that now and we're getting a six
pack and then we're gonna do Oh soda pop
you Americans in a jam here sodypop and
then bread because a man's got to eat
and we're getting too old hello hmm
hello cuz the ladies got to eat yeah
wait but the ladies eat bonbons right I
little fun we can do what we want to
it's my birthday dude I eat cake cake
got well oh yeah happy birthday cake
thank you that's gonna make happy
birthday my chest I want to see how are
they were wait laughs wait okay so so
the idea here is just to get them used
to the idea of building string literals
with a multi-dimensional array and we've
got a bunch of test cases on it that go
through and and test everything so we
were validating that each sub string is
a string of the first instance is a
string and that the second is a number
and so like if any of these were not a
number and I run then it fails right so
that's not a number so it fails alright
and if I put anything that's not a
string here then this other one fails
and you have to have at least five items
so if i get rid of that one audio then
it also fails is that what your cage how
do you vote yes ! yeah open boat and
then what you want i put cake I don't Oh
coke oh I put real cake because I want
em use my birthday man it's it's putting
then coconut cake it's not that kind of
birthday I don't know uh any form of
sort of Pumped you'd like have coke pop
or soda
what I ok I guess it's not working so ok
back to the map uh let's see here oh i
didn't i didn't actually submit my coat
invalid vote i love that nice ok so we
have word blanks we have shopping list
we have stand in line ok so this is
another array manipulation one and so we
describe a queue i'm hoping this is is
an abstract data structure where items
are kept in order new items can be added
to the back of the queue and old items
are take it off the front of the queue
write a function Q which retakes an
array and an item as arguments oh I
guess this should be let's say move the
item to the end of the array and then
then remove and return the item of the
from the queue so what we're going to
say here is we're going to say our push
we're pushing item on the end and we're
returning our shift I think yeah and
just like really be ma invasive it's not
just flako nothing moved to the footer
at this point or it's not hard to focus
being hand right there let's so this um
this is actually being um it actually
kept i have a function that captures the
console log and spiders and I knew but
it was more item before the court has an
influence come here has a it's just
putting it in well or you're not using
the foot at all when you make insurances
no i'm using the header in the footer
okay but what I'm doing is I've I'm
enabling the capture of the console log
and storing it in a stirring the reason
that I did this way it is because I want
to be able to show the before and after
to allow them to enter an arbitrary
value right this allows them to add
their own value to the end
or to change this if they wanted to
right so I've modified this Lana just
maybe it's more than is actually needed
mm-hmm okay I don't know but it should
because see how it gives this really
pretty output on the left here I wanted
that to be available and there is
literally no other way to do it without
some that work we put in the footer now
gives you that well I could make it to
that but I but they wouldn't be able to
modify their code they wouldn't say yeah
right anyway so we we just have some
basic tests here that it validates that
it pushes things on the end of the queue
and so on oh ok so that passes and let's
go back to the map have you been teasing
the pull request or not all right yet
there they're all on a got on my on a
branch on a branch on my my instance of
it we cannot pull request to Jess
correct not yet no I'm I need to talk to
I want to get this on the live beta site
you're just as a forewarning I'll put
win7 right now at travis's fam to build
everything seems just hey I'm going on
from this the greenkeeper thing updated
dependency and Travis doesn't like me
dependency I think it actually said and
overpriced and quick you've made this
will break because you happen to miss
compiling be paint and then somebody
emerged as I know it's there and but if
you look at sawgrass everything since
equitation sale and because it's an IT
get get man he was dreaming earlier and
I was watching them do stuff actually
his poll request failed in the straps
failed news on the one that was but
actually all progressive sale yeah no
you know what for golf golf code
actually occurs before I introduce else
statements what change that yeah that's
got to get fixed big time yeah didn't
work well then where the heck am I gonna
put it behind the bell seasons
um I think it needs to happen after the
if-else statements that's what I that's
what I said in my brain but not with my
mouth yes okay oh ok what's one thing no
he's doing cool request right now oh i'm
sorry i just want to show you look at
that thing in their house n 10 players
oh I'm confused I don't know is to limit
Ian Garrett like this and creditors
blows my mind they've helped wait
groaning run at the end of us to open
the web stone okay I'm just kids will
you know what we're almost at the top of
the hour here I'm just gonna make a note
here to move it hi Jeff these are things
that blow my mind good evening well
narrative to be smashed I'm sorry okay
I'm not kidding now ok so there's golf
code and then there is counting cards so
everybody would get to learn how to
cheat a blackjack that's technically not
illegal and this is one where we can
definitely use switch statements so the
way to counting cards works is that
you've maintained a register I think
they call it or a count and so low
number cards are valuable to you because
it causes the the dealer to to go bust
more frequently whereas high value cards
are ones that you want because they
allow you to get a blackjack more
frequently so what we've got is
basically just this table that you need
to check the card value and you need to
add or subtract a value for it and I
just I think the easiest way to do this
is just with a switch statement and
combining multiple things so we do a
switch on card what I just like
everybody to pre she ate those photos of
and forty forty percent so a 40-percent
coke twenty percent invalid low in
ballast more like how many people said
something invalid Oh carolien handed for
the way and receive is spelled
incorrectly
oh man she's no Kara it's not my kid ok
and that's one of that's one of my
that's one that I always misspell to
yeah me too but it doesn't make it right
I before I turn on TV except for this
word oh we're sounding as an a as a
neighboring way when you go then brownie
points to Carol Ann Hannon okay weird
where is that word where is the word it
won't see okay so it's sir so what is it
it's I don't know receive or it would
recite so table has to be there's little
I yeah I ve e no no erase that yeah
right behind been going over yeah okay
re SI è i ve sure i don't know i don't
really know yeah that's it let's just
keep going we're what you call experts
okay so riding a bunch of case
statements here you can hear the air
quotes are in the wood experts I think
that should be the hashtag for this link
with the end quote okay case okay and we
don't have to return or wait we can just
have a default value of zero oh no we're
supposed to return something funky
actually um store back how do i receive
a code card will you spelled it right so
that's a good start well anyone's a
weird letter
oh no count is the electrical hangeth
compression that makes it you can go all
stripey okay JP so count is a global and
so we're going to increment count for
that and then four cases of ten Jack
Queen King do this thing's your name DWD
not entertained with Jeff's trolling
wait don't you mean minus minus oh yes I
do pairing Perry Perry Perry oh and then
I need to break bears okay and I don't
need a break on that okay so what we
need to return we need an if statement
here BK so we need to read the rest of
the thing here so what we're supposed to
do is if count is let's see let's see
okay ba ba ba pretty high resonation
pair so if count is positive we return
bet so if count is greater than zero
then we return bet now we return the
value count + space bet you she's right
jeff says why not use an object and then
Caroline says Global's don't always work
well with the other bonfires so this
might be a bad habit uh and and normally
they would not but I've explicitly made
this one work I couldn't think of any
other way to do it and also exercise the
stuff so professional but it's two
friends the default came here inside the
switch case so there isn't really a
default case because the only times that
we want to change count is when the card
is equal to these we
default console on Aaron you spanner
you're meant to put in one of the card
fighters right but that would mean that
we're writing good code and we're not
allowed to do that here when I'm at
seven eight nine one is that stupid
question well there's zero so for seven
eight and nine we are not modifying the
value of count you didn't say it wasn't
a stupid question oh so you don't want
to do anything for seven eight nine so
yeah so you don't do anything you're not
modifying anything okay so let me see if
I actually wrote my own thing correctly
yeah I did yeah so did not make more
sense pass everything in an array of
cars yes but they don't do I know how to
do for loops at this point the friggin
see that's the middle I don't know how
to do yeah that's the thing that's
killed me about each of these mini
bonfires is I have I can't do it the
right way because they don't know how to
do it yet sure yeah anyway so by the way
are we still good on time because I dug
Breanna you wanna I'm gonna go cuz it's
my birthday I'm gonna go do birthday
okay well you know what if people want
to hang around I'm gonna I'll continue
going to i think i've got one or two
more many bonfires and Bentz here so he
can give me a hard time as a
professional animal Carolyn has a lot of
work to do because yourself does she
sound like 10 spelling errors and other
we should get Caroline on here well call
Carolyn ok Caroline can you can you uh
do you have a headset and stuff hey let
me let me message her on I'm Betty I'm
gonna go eat some cake and undo other
birthday things have fun while I for the
background Yeah right much fear let's
see I'm looking her up on a date I guess
she's on cleaner with the same username
yeah the problem is that i need to
figure out how to spell her name ooh
FEMEN card spelling equals equals equals
heart
okay true I have to find the Hangout she
hasn't said whether she's willing to do
it or not not the news no I got her no
Bob did not use what what's not in use I
don't know I think that in response oh
she's not fond of speaking okay we then
we will not try to drag you in okay so
we have two more mini bonfires to go
through okay so I like anything from the
chat so comfortable okay we probably
don't even need that little thing
anymore but anyway okay so so record
collection so so let me actually talk a
little bit more about the content that
comes before here so we have more
information about how to create objects
just as data storage so we talked about
the dot operator the bracket operator
using variables in the bracket operator
updating object properties and then we
also talked about JSON data so we
actually have some examples of JSON data
like just sort of multiple nested arrays
and n objects so the idea here is that
we actually have have you modifying JSON
data so we've got our record collection
here and so this is kind of a this is
kind of a tricky one here so what I've
done is I've pre entered a whole bunch
of sort of items with with fake IDs so
let me read through this so you're given
a JSON object representing a small part
of your record collection each album is
identified by a unique ID number because
it felt wrong for reals when I think you
just need a Caroline with you at all
times supervise the making stuff I'm
that wherever I written because I'm rift
wait for like the 10-second latency and
then for whatever five minutes for
typing I'm it now you would into a lot
oh I get that
and in the previous one okay someone
probably that oh that Jason what was I
doing that if I could be just rambled on
bedside could be at the same point as d
and production slice I don't know if
it's been deployed and the last Ohio
well so these need to go up on a
separate database I'll Caroline if you
just want to if you want to message me
in Gator the the thing I'll get it fixed
because like I said I don't want to go I
don't want to go all day I don't know
people are dropping off the chat or not
okay donut machine okay so line record
collection here we are okay each album
is identified by a unique ID number
which has several properties not all
albums have complete information write a
function that takes an ID a property
which we're calling prop and a value for
the given ID in the collection we have
three rules here this is a smell bro go
out okay so the idea here is that we
have to write like an if statement that
that takes into account these things
that we have introduced the has owned
properties you know what Jeff maybe
thats Sarah maybe we should deal with
that LA Times New Roman get on okay so
can you do me a favor and not give Jeff
a hard time while I'm trying to type
code here okay so if the collection so
it should have the ID so collection ID
dot has now we're not even testing it
the first thing we're testing is whether
value is non blank is not equal to a
blank string so if it's not a blank
string then there's two things that
could happen but if it is a blank string
that we're going to delete it
okay so we're going to delete collection
ID prop I better check for that it would
only be type of value it would accept
that we haven't we haven't we haven't
introduced type of I'm and I'm
explicitly stating that it's going to be
blank like all of the tests assume that
it's blank so then we have a nested if
statement here we say if let's see if
the prop is equal to tracks then we're
going to push on we're going to say
collection ID prop push our value and
then otherwise for everything else we
just do collection ID prop is equal to
value and so this is definitely a little
bit more complex than then the prior
challenges and I deliberately did that
because my expectation is that by the
time they've gotten here they should be
able to do this they should be able to
understand this I'm hoping I guess we'll
find out how many zillions of questions
we get okay so if i run this uh all of
my tests should should work and all of
the tests are similarly standalone where
I'm I'm like I'm resetting values or
they're actually they are stateful so as
they go or they're not in independent
anyway so I don't do a whole lot of
tests on here but i'm pretty sure that
they're that they have pretty decent
coverage so that is when we're going to
find out yeah yeah and the other thing
that I do is I actually have it out
putting the entirety of the collection
in a nice formatted way in the output so
you can do changes to it here and see
them reflected there so I hope that
that's meaningful to people are we are
people going oh that stinks or date
doesn't seem much reaction to it I'd be
curious to see how many people come up
with installation now it is kind of like
something that cuz when i was doing
challenges its kind of outing of your
locked it you get become locked in i was
not the price so it's greatly because
the way people work to become locked in
and you build a tester in your solution
and then if people ever go this doesn't
make sense it's hard to see where I come
on because you're stupid resolution your
hand necessarily sometimes I so rude but
I think I think the biggest problem at
the moment is people losing their minds
of the fat guy from line 29 up they
don't touch I'm from 944 damn they don't
touch well I can touch money for them to
make much difference and but to be a bit
like if you take that function on line
to anything and you just isolate that
it's quite sucked out that in terms of
understanding it it's dead people stuck
on a little bit sort of stuff like well
just hello host so normally what I've
done is I've put a set up on top and
actually let me go and modify this
challenge seed so it has that let's see
record collection because of people
don't realize that that some kind of you
get you a jacket or something what's
going on Save button I just you had
something there in there that's because
it's to Daryl yeah I'll make that
overflow so it's like a squirrel work
well yeah like that or make like a
smaller menu well this other this needs
so much love it's a the font times new
roman on i'll be a very heading you want
okay so i've updated I've updated the
challenge seed so at least that'll be
there so hopefully that'll make sense
okay one thing I haven't shown is
that any time we've got example code in
fact let me let me show you that one of
those array like a huge complaint was
like the push and pop so whenever I've
got code in line now i explicitly label
it as an example so i've tried to use
comments to delineate what's going on
mm-hmm i also reduce the complexity of
the push and pop ones and i may want to
reduce them further so rather than being
multi-dimensional arrays their single
dimensional arrays because we get more
questions on pushing on pop than pretty
much any other this is one of those so I
don't know use because acts like nothing
else an offense that when you pop
something off an array translated it
pops but actually modifies the array I
think people expect that because
everything else is immutable yeah so it
is it is a bit of a weird it's always
going to be a hard thing to teach in a
sense that every is going to go okay
I'll make sense I'm happy with
everything yeah well so we'll see I'm
where I've tried to make these more
clear everything will change ocean
Kiki's life it ends up happening yeah
yeah so we'll see we'll start to see
with the help what help birds get new
questions and so on all right here's
another example of you know again we've
got like the code is clearly labeled
example and then we have the set up and
then we have your code goes here and
I've kept this pattern throughout all of
the challenges okay so going to what I
believe is the last mini bonfire which
is Caesar cipher and this one ends up
being a really it ends up being a little
bit ugly unless you solve it
mathematically yeah I can imagine atomic
some weird dictionary which has the see
the value in the original value right
funny my well and so what I'm going to
do is I'm just going to go and cut and
paste my solution because it takes a
long time to type in but I think that
it's worth doing because it's worth
getting people to think about it and if
they want to solve it a different way
they're more power to them okay so here
is my solution here so what I did is I
built a big lookup object now you can do
it mathematically right you can do it
with subtracting 13 from the ASCII value
and doing stuff like that but what I'm
doing is just doing a lookup I checked
for has owned property and I do have a
waypoint on has owned property so you
can check to see whether the letter
exists because we want them to skip
anything that is not a letter so if it
doesn't appear on our look up then it
just gets passed through and this is by
far the most challenging of the mini
bonfires I don't know if it's to
challenge you get honestly it may it may
be yeah I feel like going to be easy
actually to do with with char x 0 and a
little up under that kind of stuff as
opposed to doing like a room a match
reverse lookup because that if you want
to build a property the cipher which
will normally allow you to set the ER
staff and it makes that direction
impossible to use or else you have to
write a look up to each possible it's
like your style um I actually genuinely
think that may other again if you don't
know mr. if you do cherish because the
way askew works hey is 97 which people
and ago what happened to dwell month too
and it's actually 65 because its capital
a so I do a searcher yeah I do
explicitly say that all the ladders
letters will be a capital I believe even
still I think charge is going to be an
easier one it will be an easy decision
to make well we did have to understand
her chair I worked but so the but at the
point of this particular exercise is to
is to do for loops and I wanted to tie
it into the stuff that they previously
learned about using objects and look
wish if i use my honestly yeah i know
which is what i wrote it because i was
lazy as I shouldn't probably write a
proper way but or with the with the for
loop well and oh yeah oh yeah so if
I could just I mean I could write it
real quick here right 40 eyes less than
code are down link i plus plus and then
again this is maybe not a letters you
know what I'll just set it equal to two
code are I just so I don't have to
change all the rest of my code okay
let's see if that passes and it does so
we have free code camp free pizza free
love and the quick the quick brown dog
jumped over the lazy where it is a
question mark because the idea is that
they need to be able to skip over the
spaces and punctuation and then we just
have we exercise all all 26 letters with
the quick quick brown dog jumped over
the lazy fox oh it's a that's awkward
that's backwards isn't it's the quick
brown fox jumped over the lazy dog I'm
gonna leave it like that just because
that's how I roll it's got character
it's our dog a happy camper from the
previous previous waypoint I like won't
put that I don't know without the all
challenges when we Quincy knew that
actually is it way is happy camper from
yellow challenges yeah I think that's uh
yeah and it's still in here one ok so I
think that those are all of the mini
bonfires um I didn't write anything for
the random numbers and I tried to clean
these up a little bit but I pretty much
have not touched them the JavaScript
slot machine are still not included the
only reason they're showing is because
we're on beta but those are ugly and I
hate them so which one's the the
JavaScript slot machines I know yeah
baby could be pretty oh they need to be
the only really worked if you put in the
multi era which I've also this is a
funny pull request of them all together
the men made last night and half an hour
and I like to see most jerry-rigged T P
 ever seen he like but actually it
would work nice if you had that set up
we don't sell kind of like and gas stuff
and also the editors wide enough so I
think it's broken on a new line
transaction it's awful yeah the
challenges work which looks awful anyway
moving along okay oh i didn't i didn't
actually complete record collection or
did I I did I needed to save it I needed
submitted okay so I think that's
everything that I wanted to cover I
don't know if there's any if anybody
wants to see any more of these like I
said I'm gonna try and get these up on
the beta site and the next uh by
hopefully later today assuming I can get
ahold of Berkeley and that he can get
everything set up in it I like that in
the next later today yes so so we'll
just see if we can get that to go and
then everybody can go and find the
remainder of my spelling errors I am
still offering a bounty if you file an
issue on uh on the free code camp repo
pointing out my my typos and my spelling
errors then i will get those fixed and i
will and i'll try and give you some
brownie points millions of brandies
we're gonna just set up camera BOTS like
distribution actual that's a good idea
having a baby's is a successful PR will
give you like 20 brains I was thinking
about that but I don't we don't want a
funny like think we don't want to drive
bad behavior no like I like to point
this peel it like I'm single doing or
checking your typo so I think you I
think there's a lot to like in here
there's a lot of things like we talked
about global and local scope although
I'm not know convinced that these are
our fully functional yet um okay then I
think I think that's going to be it i'm
just going to finish up the stream right
now so thanks everybody gonna do
questions and answers oh do we yeah sure
yeah if anybody's any questions we can
we can we get take this right now we'll
just get the elevator music for good or
anything thanks be to think of yeah wait
for the delay and where is react that's
a good way react is not here
this is this is just basic JavaScript
the reactants has done free shipping
that is all coming it should it should
be released at the same time and it's
primarily just going to be zip lines so
the real stuff of that is dependent on
infrastructural stuff which has still be
done and also the multi file add editor
good god I can talk the multi file
editor will take some work after that
and once those are all done and
development forward to think we'll
actually be worthwhile and calm
Glossop's we changed slightly to
accommodate tree seeds and two and three
feet and maybe three solutions off the
tankers made the same framework has done
a really handy dandy way they might just
work with the way solutions are in a
permit or quit wasting time because they
strengthen our race and what if what
Elsa yesterday that it does just the
crooks of like the real on-site reactors
the ring on sites and stuff that is
telling James Bond fires again make any
more jazz bonfires everything I know I
have not done any new james bond fire so
I haven't decided yet what my next thing
is going to be I may be doing
intermediate JavaScript or I may be
going back and hitting the HTML because
I think it needs some love too I just I
honestly don't know i think you know at
least for the immediate future i'm going
to play lots of video games because i've
been spending all my video game time on
writing bonfires I should like I'm
wasting time to understand stone oh so
the bonfire to come after this are the
same normal uh just the regular bonfires
right the meat bonfire reverses string
factorial is a number and so on I kink
the bonfire edited stage ijs it's quite
masses at this point and the a strike
base Jerry intermediate might be nice
like what
do you cover and interview this because
it to me this would be kind of like well
what I would see what we're calling
object oriented and functional
programming I think that this needs to
be probably 50 to 60 waypoints and we
need to go into much greater detail
about using functions and all of the
functional programming stuff uh this is
true and your function up stores weight
as well because it's kind of like
concepts well its duration them away but
i guess like it ok so like people need
to understand how callback that
functions can be passed they need to
understand currying they need to
understand functions as first class
objects and callback functions and to a
lesser extent asynchronous stuff so i
might even do some like some set timeout
or set interval examples to prepare them
for the pro maduro really do that for EM
well I know you can't you can do for
know but you can only do Frank well I
know so it's going to require some
additional test code what we would need
to do is be able to do a mock for set
timeout so we could capture the function
that was passed to it yeah okay yay
don't make that it bigger yeah so I've
been talking with Berkeley about it
quite a bit but he's I think he's been
doing the reactivation before he starts
working out the additional test
infrastructure he's doing this
anti-reflux fair so I think he's busy
sniffing gasps and unjust question
unsporting types in route no probably
not but what will happen is that
everything to be ran through Babel once
the framework refractors done again
especially for because when we didn't
react we have to support jsx but he's
stable anyway and we might as well for
that allows us to es6 chances and that
won't be go
what do you win you win the admiration
of your peers um sorry I jumped my pain
well there are extra but you still get a
brownie point for each one of these I've
lost my train of thought I jump my tank
mrow um juju oh yeah it'll be past your
table anyway so reacts will work Ian
thinks will work um I think either a
dancer typescript like if there's an
add-on for typescript that you probably
two variables or constants great
anything else I don't see your leggings
be trying on cylinder my conflict is it
is it possible to run Babel in a browser
sure winner lies okay hold on I am
liquid of playing on figuration and I
feeling that something that would have
done and you can use they able to
transpire client-side code that's what
when you're building reactions of your
rising but that's happening Mabel but
that's happening server side and that
its survey no the client side code it is
a node module so have to be written in
jf affair all right but if it's written
using es6 itself then it's not a threat
using it with everyone or cs5 because he
pointed to make something that compiles
server code from er6n es6 because then
you couldn't run and actually the
current version of node and I rjs will
run yes Xcode I believe definitely i'll
jesters and i think the new current
thing of note does if we take a quick of
it lib we take it yet j/s hmm weather
but anyway that's a stop there that's
not gonna happen like any time at x five
or six months i don't think that's a
longer term is being able to build react
stuff within no i think i should happen
in the next five six months I don't even
have my next month it'll probably be it
probably the summertime big releasing
would hopefully be and hopefully be that
um
wanna have any other question type
crisis yeah I'm not seeing any other
obvious question so i think i'm going to
sign off and i'm going to see about
getting these loaded and and all that
stuff so thanks everybody for coming out
and we'll catch you all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
