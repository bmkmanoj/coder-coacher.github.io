we are going to talk about what is a
network
so before we answer that question let's
take the example of two people who are
trying to communicate with each other so
what happens here when one person talks
he is creating vibrations in the air
which is the medium and these vibrations
reach the other party and that's how two
people communicate so one person talks
and the vibrations travel through the
medium and reach the other person who is
listening now in case of two computers
how do they talk they don't have mouths
yet or they can't create vibrations in
they're in the air so how do they talk
so here what we have to do is we need to
create some sort of connection between
these two computers so a connection
between two or more computers or more
devices to communicate between them is
called a network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
