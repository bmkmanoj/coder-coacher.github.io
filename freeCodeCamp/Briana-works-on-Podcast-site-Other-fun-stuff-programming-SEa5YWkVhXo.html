elements it's not here at this but it
looks quick and dirty way finish yeah i
can i can do that later I know how to do
that give me that look well at least a
thought so it's close your PR okay close
the BR you have two plates and stuff
doesn't type again I don't think babe
alexis you got there like that that's
ridiculous that's okay dance
the brakes just like different pace to
you now it's so quiet so if i go to so
before we do anything can we just check
that the play working for dana works
yeah and then you fight we have another
functioning site funny works download
works that's amazing click on the file
to make sure to catch on fire but if
downing and then betrayed oh yeah it's
it's it it's the thing its opening
another program which will make this all
run much more smoothly just to maximum
so my question is if i go download
itunes just close I just don't want
itunes open right now firstly um if I go
to and download another one of his files
oh hello John Casey oh my goodness
gracious and then if I just populate
that into the audio file everything else
automatically update yes how can i add
um description yeah Alice it's gonna be
hurt no it's not a shuttle I it's just
going to choir a sec card ok now you
pushed on his podcast to get up that
doesn't mean I Allah that's true it
doesn't those could you ever been to get
a more got expressed and then yeah
Shakira awesome happen to be any
different order though so you can't do
that what so that's whipped data if you
go into you can automatically if you
want to you on behalf of you can't do
anything right now so we now have to do
it is we have to build a server logic
okay I'm so turn on MongoDB the first
thing we're gonna do okay I have not
used Mongo for a while I think that
anything with it you use mongolab
yashica do i need to use my short let's
ease mongolab just go to use mobile app
Robin Lehner okay has it thanks and
thanks let's see what's up in the chat
it's ten people people are hating on reg
ex that makes me happy
ghetto people people oh my goodness look
fabulous hmm create new sure show one
cloud provider um who's gonna provide
the cloud single note geoffroy damning
change a single dad okay okay that's all
right and you can be with me like Sonic
it trailer Google what's today um
database name podcasts sure I go to
mongodb vision yeah shut up hey I've
treba all right is this gonna mess it up
if podcasts is the same that's fine
should go freshen good oh my back you
all right hungry okay so we've got the
database and kick on it okay and
see that connects using a driver from
your share MongoDB URI yeah the link
under oshkosh brainy pad need that copy
okay go to your web storm yeah go to
roots index touch is we want to go up
going to do fire Mongoose equals
Mongoose I require money site below s
bring my fess up let's put it on and
then below FS we're going to do monkey
stock connect and and then go to that
link Academy so it is yeah swing back
yeah it kind of dipping is your control
what see you see the angle brackets DB
user inside that make oh yeah make that
control a triangular rack up as well and
the password can be whatever you will
have to check Danger Close yep if I
stream now right so forgot to micro lab
yeah and users hmm a database user
control this and then hit create i
lecture you can make a separate
connection for our administrator make
that when we'd only for when i do that
right now if you go into you collections
uh-huh add a collection and call the
podcast
make a document side of podcasts
document now let's think about this what
do we want to be in here date the title
description and the link okay so let's
do that okay I think track doesn't quote
and called a pack it's probably a better
title no it's an URL I think she don't
Pakistan the title what because we
generate the title from the map do you
like an ID for you do something no I
should be out around I'm acting and make
each of those a string and just add to
it does create and yep okay so if you go
inside there uh-huh what do you mean go
inside there I am click try to add
something it'll bring it to him probably
no yeah no exchange daesh see the string
i put data now instead of the string and
then that'll be that sorted um hold on
put this side put the string background
the day and and then you're setting the
value to be able to date nail yeah
that's fair enough I need to make a
capital T authentic I'm trying to save
go back
purchase it either actually expect
please check your syntax nope it wants
double quotes um Oh them do a curly
bracket earn enough I was like a
function car ya know I thing like as if
you're calling now with a function
without me ya know I finish your calling
me as a function that's what you mean
yes ok nope doesn't work remove the
nervous ya go nope I mean if you leave
it is a string than when i enter lucky
they probably recorded if you want to
generate a generator ok let's fix em how
you do a date in manga well when you
push it to mongo than you can just push
the date is equal to gate in the
JavaScript yeah that makes sense to me
uh-huh except they have to build the
back n turf I'm gonna get all these
stores in on the back end yeah um um
Jesus Christ inside of indexed around
again thank you I party right
and I just need to keep checking mail
what does this before so inside inside
your rec Reza cash mm-hmm and the next
you need to give that another name it's
called admin or something okay so right
here okay i am i'm in the next parameter
and am very lucky before the function
yeah making new function yeah I'm build
at the same way today Iraq request next
slide there one of you if req don't user
okay and and then your body if the if
it's going to be just going to do next
unless you put the word next and a call
it like a function else and next inside
the parentheses there for when you eros
is just new capital e error and make
that like a function as a before a one
inside the function inside the okay
sorry like a function column out of
definition of a function okay gotcha
you can really make a movie yeah I can't
you do it automatically but you can't um
sometimes skimming the clutter okay um
and then copy and paste that again but
then after admin do /a ction and then
where do a rectal around same with it
before hmm I color admin action if you
know me so take it's like a stove
tingles admin Oh like that yeah and then
do for flash dandruff hmm a cough column
and then action okay i'm inside your
function on line 31 please switch rector
brown action director params direction
so I'm knock knock come a pasta oh um
I'm inside dash you to make that likely
it's got em to bracket and then inside
these cases the first case will be a
string and it would be it's funny syntax
knock off the air parenthesis I haven't
done switch cases in such a long time
I'm no quote for knock off here yeah
then you put your string dr. hey stream
yeah and then I click the cone with the
end of that and then go down two lines
and should put the word break
an SME collar ok your first case is
going to be so you want to do an action
we want to update so yeah and then after
cydia see at the top where if you've
read a gift after action do ford / wait
after i'm keen here and I'll at the top
I we're line 23 after action there
mm-hmm to afford / I call them and I
meant data and then a star so that means
is that for everything after the word
action is going to take give us data so
i want to counsel that log inside the
case new console that log data i get rid
of those am brackets no baggy our
brackets sure know your karma a sonic 1
newer semicolon left it after the
concert like I don't got into your
router hmm and I do read that render
admin and side your bottom function okay
I'm their admin in brackets make it a
string where's that render bad man yes
growth second Tammy triple-check Swedish
up to your index your foot your razor
gift for its left you know yeah so okay
and so let's go to our J's files in the
views yeah we need to make a admin one
right that's Ottoman few boos new Jade
file I mean up Gabe and no dude I'm in
touch a touch it honey dad and
just do extends layer and black content
and for you to just do like a h1 and say
welcome because we need to do in there a
lot of back end magic together to work
right so now we take a passport on so
the root file of your app Admiral won't
work because used to be all kinda care
to get their house or is expressed okay
passport gesture dork I look up having a
stare at the TV chef documentation I'll
look you
authentication middle way are fabulous
let's see we've got all mine people in
here still amazingly impairment still
pass portion let's get each other s okay
save it to my dependencies or open a new
window mm-hmm song projects / hello John
someone do exams install passport is it
two dashes or 12 double dash to wear a
single dash it's a letter okay because
if you give it a single dash it let me
tidy s and then I'll show near it
doesn't know an eighth means she's story
in an effort some fresh see if it goes
takes as long as everything else mark so
inside here op j SMS and you can throw
mm-hmm I clicked on skype my computer
just thinking really hard about actually
opening it up yeah oh gotcha goodness
gracious quickpwn and the viral
passport bet is to be treated separately
that if you put the stopper to
dependencies and the passport I choose
to be done brother okay so this goes
into dependencies up at the top no yeah
okay one thing hmm and and the other bit
can go below the body / service Oh would
you so both the apt I'd use tell her
that that use that I've meant so they're
just below the root okay so go down a
bit more good to lie integrity wanna put
it there I know what I gonna run put it
below uses
okay all right and that it looks like
npm install passport has been installed
and install passport hyphen uncle oh I
don't know I was maybe that exited out
too fast what does that do it Sam it's
its strategy dish using for like ants
