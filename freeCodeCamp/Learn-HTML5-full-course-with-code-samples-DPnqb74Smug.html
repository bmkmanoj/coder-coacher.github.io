horse on HTML in this introduction I'm
going to explain the role of HTML on the
Internet and why it is so important what
is HTML it is the standard markup
language for creating web pages and web
applications along with CSS and
JavaScript it is one of the cornerstones
of the world wide web every website and
every web application will render HTML
to the browser let me explain how the
web works in essence once you have
developed a website you need to host it
on a server to make it accessible to the
world wide web the server says here's my
number call me maybe that is what we
call an IP address and often we put a
domain name over that IP address so that
it is easy to remember when you type
that domain name on the browser the
browser will then give the server a call
and then the server will send the hosted
files back to the browser to be rendered
your browser will first load the HTML
which may reference other CSS files and
JavaScript files and will load those
references in the order that they are
listed in the HTML from top to bottom so
CSS and JavaScript is built on top of
HTML elements like skin on bones think
of HTML as the skeleton HTML provides
tags to name different types of contents
or rather elements on your websites for
example the header elements the links
Styles etc this helps your browser
understands what it reads to render it
properly even though the browser only
needs HTML to render a website think of
it as a skeleton with bare contents that
you will then make it dynamic and more
beautiful using JavaScript and CSS you
can think of JavaScript as the brains of
your website or web application it can
modify the HTML and CSS and rerender
elements of the page based on user input
or logic or changes in data from a
server this makes your HTML dynamic
rather than static a dynamic website
behaves more like this after the page is
rendered the user can interact with
inputs and elements on the page and
trigger JavaScript functions which can
modify the HTML elements and contents
the CSS and send or fetch data to and
from the server which then gets sent
back to the browser to be re rendered
games and interactive applications can
be built upon HTML thanks to JavaScript
however without rendered HTML elements
JavaScript and CSS will have no visible
usefulness on the browser you can think
of CSS like the skin of the websites CSS
allows us to enhance the user experience
for visitors design a user interface
implement a brand identity applied
typographic and visual design principles
make the site responsive for mobile and
desktop viewing alike and overall a more
enjoyable experience to look at and use
now regardless of whether you are
looking to be a designer of web sites
and web applications or a more full
stack developer of web applications a
thorough understanding of HTML is a must
and hopefully after this course you will
have HTML in your pocket in this course
I'll share with you the boilerplate tags
and declarations that you'll need on
every project we'll practice
element nesting and indentation we'll
learn how to use layout elements
semantically or properly learn how to
use metadata link scripts and style
elements we will use attributes IDs
classes along the way we'll learn how to
embed images video and audio will also
practice using text formatting elements
we'll learn how to make a numbered or
bulleted list of items and to wrap
things up we'll learn about forms and
tables as the results we're going to
build projects using the most useful
elements and best practices of HTML 5 I
will provide you with CSS and JavaScript
to make learning HTML more visually
enjoyable and fun my name is Eric you
can find me as I am tirado pretty much
anywhere on social media if you have any
questions feel free to ask me anytime or
ask questions on the Q&amp;amp;A section on the
sidebar and let's jump right in
for the browser to render a website it
needs HTML and for us to write HTML we
need an HTML document and what makes an
HTML document that is having the
extension of dot HTML over in the top
left of our workspace we have a gear
icon by clicking there I can select new
file and I'm going to create a new file
and simply give it the name of of hello
dot HTML to be added to my website
assets
you can see
render this and open the browser
see that we still have an error when you
enter a URL on your browser your browser
makes a call to the server requesting
the website assets the screen burg
browser is automatically looking for the
assets in your project files here on our
files panel but now it doesn't know what
the name of my HTML document is to
render it automatically if I tell the
browser exactly what document to look
for it can find it for example if I type
hello dot HTML
world let's hit save again and as we can
see it will render hello world but it
could not find this on its own so how do
we get a home page to load by default
all browsers will look for a file called
index.html in order to render it as the
home page also known as the landing page
for this reason every project needs to
contain an index.html file the browser
can load by default now I'm going to go
ahead and rename this to index.html and
I'm gonna save it and now in the browser
here I'm going to type index.html and it
will render hello world now the browser
will load this by default if you would
like to try this outside of screen bar
on your actual browser you may use any
text editor that comes with your
computer and simply save a file and name
it index with the extension of dot HTML
then drag it on to your browser and it
will render whatever text you placed
inside there more advanced and free text
editors out there that you can use to
edit HTML and other programming
languages such as atom visual studio
code and sublime text to name a few to
create a JavaScript file you need to use
the extension of j/s and to create a CSS
file we need the extension of CSS now
these don't need any specific name since
our index dot HTML document can tell the
browser the exact names of required CSS
and JavaScript we'll learn more about
that on another lesson but for now let's
name them index not j/s and index that
CSS as well index is
not CSS now that we have our HTML
document we can begin learning how to
code HTML see you in the next lesson
hello welcome to in this lesson we're
going to be practicing nesting and I've
pretty aired some CSS so that we can
visually understand nesting and how it
works and we're gonna begin by
connecting that CSS style sheet to our
HTML document so let's go ahead and
begin there let's make a link and you do
that with the link tag so you create
link and then we're going to type
arielle which stands for relationship
and you're letting the browser know what
relationship this stylesheet has to HTML
document and that would be stylesheet
let's go ahead and now and put the
reference to the index dot CSS okay so
we have named this CSS stylesheet as
index dot CSS it could be name styles
dot CSS or anything else and just make
sure it has the same name okay so now
let's hit save and see what happens
tada we have a purple background color
applied to the body tag that's why
everything turned purple let's remove
this hello world here and now we're
gonna play with nesting so I'm gonna
create a div element this is the most
common element that is used on HTML and
this element doesn't have any semantic
meaning it is pretty much for any font
that you want to divide from other
content that you're not sure if you
should use other semantic tags for and
as you can see I created this div
element with an opening tag and a
closing tag wrapped by the body opening
tag in the body closing tag so it's a
child of the body now let's add a class
by typing class equals in quotation
marks I'm gonna put white and now you're
going to
this element has a white background he
has a width and a height this is because
in the CSS I have applied a style to any
element that has the class of white so
think of white or a class as a cellphone
number that the CSS can call and then
attribute styles to any element that has
that class and similarly there is an
attribute called ID but the IV it is not
meant to be used on multiple elements
only on one single element on your whole
document should have that specific ID so
it's good for when you're making an
element there it's gonna be on your
website only once and you can call that
for example advertisement and then in
the CSS you can style that also
JavaScript uses IDs and communicate with
elements so we're gonna leave this is
class of light okay I'm gonna make
another element here and I'm gonna call
it div class green
now we have two elements and as you can
see they're not inside each other
they're next to each other and that's
because they are siblings now what would
happen if I grab this div with the class
of green
and put it inside the opening and
closing tags of the div with the world
class of light and I hit save
all right there we go now that green div
is visually also inside of the other
element it is wrapped by it okay so I'm
gonna create a proper indentation here
so that we can visually understand
what's going on and now you can boss
this video go in here and create another
div inside of the green div that has the
class of red I'll wait all right that
should look something like this
perfect I love it let's create more
elements here if you like feel free to
play around however you want with this
these are the only three classes that I
have styled so stick to those three
classes they're the white green and red
and you can have multiple elements
and you can keep doing the
thing for all of them pretty fun feel
free to play around with these elements
and see you in the next lesson
alright everybody let's go ahead and
populate this head elements with some
meta tags well before the meta tags
let's do the title tag unfortunately we
cannot preview what the title tag does
on this browser because the screamer
browser doesn't show the title of the
page but just to illustrate it the title
of this lesson is called head elements
and you can see that the title of this
course also on the tab of your browser
and that is because your browser is
looking for the content of the title tag
and placing that on the tab on your
browser so here we can say this HTML
document is called learning HTML and
there are other meta tags that you
should add for example the meta charset
equals utf-8 so this is telling the
browser what character set you are using
to write your HTML document with okay
and it's out there other ones gonna give
it a name of description and the content
of that description is going to be my
first HTML website and as you can see
there's no closing tag for the meta tag
and that is because it is a self closing
tag and never carries content so it
doesn't require a closing tag everything
is in attributes and values right inside
the opening tag itself there's one
minute a key that you must always now on
a document especially if you're going to
be building a responsive web sites and
that is called the viewport meta tag so
here we can type name viewport and on
the content we're gonna specify the
width of the site is always the device
width , and let that initial scale be
100% what this allows is for your
browser to render everything at a 100%
scale no matter what the width of your
browser is so you must always have this
tag especially if you're trying to build
a beautiful responsive web site okay
here we have the
tag that we brought over from our
previous document it is loaded in the
same server as our HTML but let me tell
you that you can also import an external
stylesheet from anywhere on the web on
our website we're gonna be using icons
that come from a stylesheet that is
hosted on font awesome com an awesome
com makes fonts that we can access
through HTML classes I'm just gonna
import that right in because we're gonna
be using it on our project so this goes
to show that you can import in a style
sheet so that's loaded on your server
or you can import an external style
sheet that it's on the web now you can
also have you can also have embedded
styles in the document just know that
whatever style is here you cannot use it
on another page because you cannot
import it or reference it or link to it
from another HTML page let's write some
content here this is the header one
element which is the most important text
on your site you should only use it once
per page just so that the browser know
what the most important text is here
we're gonna type hello world and as you
can see we have some text now we're
gonna explore the header tags later on
but now I'm gonna use the style here to
apply some text to our hello world here
so let's do h1 and I'm gonna do
text-align:center here you go I have
aligned the text now this doll right
here will override this index dot CSS
because it is after in the flow the
browser will read this and then override
it with this now you will be able to
overwrite this if you do an inline style
and you do that by typing the attribute
of style with the value of let's say I'm
gonna do text-align:left just to show
you that I can override it there you go
in a line to the left it over roads what
this specified right there now I'm gonna
do I'm gonna change the color to say
gold there you go so I'm applying
text-align:center here I'm applying
color gold here and this background
purple comes from the index dot CSS so
that's how ways that you can apply
styles on your page now there's another
element that you can use called script
so that you can run JavaScript right on
your website and I'm gonna run a simple
script that says hello universe and this
is gonna give an error let's save it and
that is because I don't have anything
with the ID of h1 on the document so
let's type ID h1 hit save and we still
have the error and that is because we
need to put script after the element
that we're trying to modify with
JavaScript hello universe there you go I
replace the content of hello world
with hello universe okay so I'm not
trying to give you a lesson on
JavaScript but even if you don't know
JavaScript you can import JavaScript
plug-ins that other people have
developed into your science so you
always want to make sure that it's
inside the body but it needs to be after
the rest of the content of your site and
now let's say I want this to come from
an external javascript file so let's go
ahead and cut this out I'm gonna put it
inside this javascript file
we lost the hello universe and now for
the script tag I'm gonna type source in
dot J yes and I'm gonna hit safe and
there we go we've inputted the same
JavaScript code that we had inside the
tag from here and now that we've got our
head elements set up our meta tags our
styles and script tags we're ready to
start building our layout let's go
in this lesson we're gonna be building
this beautiful layout using the layout
elements that have been provided to us
using html5 let me tell you a little bit
about how we used to do it before we
have these layout elements we used to
use the div elements to separate all
kinds of different content on our page
and to differentiate one div from
another you would use this classes and
you can do this today but html5 has
provided us tags for the most commonly
used layout elements so we're gonna
replace this div with the header element
in here I'm just gonna type header and
let's see what that looks like if you
ever want to see what these look like
without the Styles just feel free to
comment out or remove this style right
here and you'll see header right there
okay I'm gonna put that back another
great layout elements that we've been
given it's the footer element I know why
I did two closing tags there see what
that looks like perfect all right type
footer in here and another great element
that they gave us is the section element
now you may want to divide different
parts of your site by sections and you
don't have to use divs anymore you can
be a little bit more specific and say
this is a different section of the page
that's all it is pretty straightforward
in here I'm gonna type the main elements
now this tells your browser what the
main content of this document is so
don't put anything that's repeated
throughout different pages in here
don't put the header in here don't put
the sidebar in here don't put the footer
in here the main is for the specific
content of this document in here I'm
gonna write the article elements and in
here I'm gonna type article let's see
what that looks like
all right there we go I have an article
inside my main element I'm gonna
multiply this all right perfect
and now
as a sibling of the main element I'm
going to place the aside what this is is
this is content aside of the main
content so sometimes having ads or a
sidebar on our page can go inside of the
aside element
unless one that I'm going to use here
I'm going to replace this header type
here for the nav element this is also
very common elements and they've given
us an element for that and I'm just
going to type here navigation and hit
save all right here we go we've built a
basic layout using the layout elements
of html5 on the next lesson we're gonna
embed some images and a video yeah see
you there
in this lesson we're gonna play around
with the figure and image elements let's
go ahead and get started with the image
element so here is the image tag and the
image tag does not have a closing tag
such as article it has a closing tag
here and the closing tag for me it
doesn't have that it is what we call a
sale of closing element it does not
carry content inside of it so you're
just going to put a forward slash there
at the end of the tag and it has two
attributes that are required and one of
those is source and the other one and
the other one is alternate and you type
it as such for the source attribute the
value is simply the name of your image
or a link to the image if the image were
to be at the root directory of your
files such as where this index.html is
if it was at the same level you would
type simply the name of the image and
the extension if the image is inside of
a folder that is at the root directory
of your project then you would type the
folder name forward slash and then the
image name now I cannot upload an image
here on to screen BA but I can link to
an external image somewhere else on the
Internet so I'm just gonna grab a URL
and paste it right here I'm gonna hit
save there we go now we can see the
image feel free to play around with this
grab an image from the internet and try
to embed it right there in the source
this alternate attribute the value that
you place here it now for the alt
attribute what you are telling
officer is if you cannot load the image
what alternate information it can show
so here you simply type information
about the image such as a laptop with a
mouse on a desk and a pair of glasses
now this can be especially helpful for
people that are visiting your site but
are visually impaired and they may be
using a screen readers to view and may
be using screen readers to navigate your
site and though they cannot see the
image they can get an idea of the image
that you're using on your page as an
illustration or a graph so these are the
two required attributes of the image tag
now let's go ahead and move on to the
figure tag so this one does have an
opening and a closing tag so I'm going
to go ahead and put them in I'm gonna
indent image right here perfect now the
figure elements has a element now the
figure element has a child element that
is to be used together with it and that
is called figcaption that also has an
opening and closing tag and in here
you're gonna I'm going to write a
caption to the image just to give it a
little description it could be an e now
let's
Figg now now let's learn about the
figure element the figure element
specifies self-contained content not
just images it could be an illustration
and could be code photos diagrams etc
I'm going to write the closing tag here
and what's special about the figure
element is that it has a child element
that goes along with it called
figcaption and in here you can write a
caption that is directly related to the
content inside the figure element this
could be at the top of the figure
element or the bottom as I am placing it
here and here I'm gonna describe
and here I'm going to describe the
figure image I'm gonna hit save all
right and we can see how the browser
will attach this caption right to the
bottom of the image has a little
description alternatively you can add
styles to this and change how it behaves
as an example I have made a class that
we can add here I have styled this with
CSS to the class of hero I'm gonna hit
save there we go
we can see that the caption is on top
the image is blurred you can play around
with figure and editing the contents of
it so as you can see the CSS completely
modify the way the caption looks and the
image itself looks is now blurred so
don't feel limited by fit caption it is
an other tool that we can use to style
our content more effectively so as you
can see I have applied so as you can see
I have applied quite a bit of so as you
can see I have modified quite a bit the
figure image the figure element so as
you can see I have modified quite a bit
the figure elements and the contents of
the figure and elements such as the
image and the caption so don't feel like
it's going to limit you
it is simply more semantic to use it
when you need it and you are completely
free to make it look how you need it to
and you are completely free to make it
look just how you need it
hey guys in this lesson we're going to
learn how to embed a video using HTML
the first way is using the video element
I'm going to type video and I'm going to
treat it as a closing self closing
element or a void elements just like we
did with image meaning it has no closing
tag in it I can type source and for the
source I can type the name of the video
if it was in my root directory it would
be the name of the video if it was
inside a folder I would type the folder
name and then the video name but because
I don't have that I'm gonna go ahead and
use an external video source right here
now scream McCann not record the video
playing so I'm gonna tell you to pause
the video here open the preview and hit
play for yourself were you able to that
is because there are no controls you
need to type the attribute of controls
so that you can hit play go ahead jump
into the code and now try to play it
alright
I hope you were able to there are other
attributes you can use such as autoplay
so the video plays by itself there's one
called muted so that it is muted by
default loop so the video plays over and
over again by itself
preload so the video downloads or
buffers before the user hits play and
there's also width I'm gonna give it 600
pixels and there's also Heights can I
give it a height of 350 pixels alright
so there's my video but now I want my
video to be responsive if you can see
the frame of the video the width does
not change based on the width of the
viewport so I have used CSS to create a
class for a rapper so I'm gonna wrap
this in a div with the class of
responsive vid and I'm gonna hit save
and now you'll see that the boundaries
of the video should be responsive now
the video elements can take the source
as a nested element for that
going to need to create a closing tag
for the video element and the nested
element is going to be called source and
in here I'm going to paste the source
that attributes that I had before now
I'm going to use the type attributes and
I'm going to tell the browser this is a
video of the format's mp4 now this is
useful or necessary because some
browsers do not support formats like OGG
for example Safari and Internet Explorer
so you need to have a fallback source
for those browsers so this is good
practice for video make sure that you
can upload multiple formats of your
video especially if your website is
going to be used by people that may have
older browsers another way that you can
embed a video is using the iframe
elements I'm gonna type the iframe
opening and closing tags and the iframe
can take a width so you need to give it
a width so that you can see the content
and a height as well so I'm going to
give it 350 and these are pixel
dimensions again and for the source to
help you understand a little bit of what
the iframe does I'm just gonna type a
URL to the screen bot comm page so as
you can see it has put the screamer page
in a frame inside of my documents if
this is not working in the recording go
ahead and jump into the preview yourself
and try to play with this but it has put
the screamer website within my document
now this is the method that some
platforms will give you a video to be
embedded on your site such as YouTube if
you find our video on YouTube right
below there's gonna be a tab that says
embed go ahead and click that and you
can copy the code there which is an
iframe and paste it those are the two
ways in which you can embed videos in
HTML see you in the next one
in this lesson we're going to learn
about list items and we're gonna build
our navigation bar so to start off I'm
gonna disable the CSS and also this
figure element and in here I'm gonna
type ul a ul element it has an opening
and a closing tag that's because it's
gonna contain certain elements and those
elements are Li which stands for list
item and those have an opening and a
closing tag so you l stands for
unordered list I'm gonna type here item
1 hit save okay
it's an unordered list meaning it has no
numbers if you want one with numbers you
do an ordered list with an O L there we
go it has a number perfect let's go back
to ul now list items behave as block
elements meaning they will stack
vertically they will not go in one line
but you can override that with CSS I'm
gonna go ahead and put this stylesheet
back and let's see what happened to that
ul there we go we have it in a row I'm
gonna get rid of this text that I don't
need anymore okay I'm gonna add some
anchor tags and I'm just gonna put a
pound symbol there close the opening tag
for the anchor and have another anchor
closing tag here okay perfect so now
these are links inside of a list item
and that should add the default link
styles perfect I can have this outside
of my header for a different style that
I've prepared so these are different
ways that you can have an app you can
have it a little header or inside a
header as a matter of fact you could
have it as a sidebar or off canvas if
you notice that all of my content is
wrapped by a diff that has a class of
center and that is because I have styles
for sidebars I'm just going to go ahead
and type those up real quick as well as
a bar to toggle it triggering some
JavaScript functions let's take a look
isn't that neat okay now I can also copy
this unordered list and put it on the
sidebar for example and I see what that
looks like awesome beautiful okay so
there we go we have learned how to use
lists remember if you want to see what
this stuff looks like without styles
just remove the CSS take a look alright
there we go we learn about lists list
items and how they can be used we're
gonna keep building up our page on the
next lesson see you there
all right in this lesson we're learning
headings and headings are pretty easy
let's go ahead and get started I'm gonna
scroll right below my figure elements
right here and I'm gonna begin with the
most important heading of them all and
that is the h1 I'm gonna type that here
and let's hit save and take a look
alright there we go this is the most
important heading now I'm gonna go to
the least important heading they go from
1 through 6 so I'm gonna do h6 and I'm
gonna type a little description here
alright the browser will render these at
different sizes h1 is the largest and h6
as the smallest now we may be tempted to
use H 1 through 6 to style our text and
make them larger or smaller but the
browser and search engines and screen
readers
want to know what the most important
text of your site is so use H 1 through
6 to determine importance not the size
so I want to say that learning HTML is
the most important so I'm going to wrap
it in the h1 and I'm gonna use an h2 for
this header here and I'm gonna save it
and now we can see that it got smaller
but now let's say I want to make the h2
of a larger font size without changing
it to an h1 well that is why we have CSS
so I'm just gonna go ahead and put style
here and font size and I'm gonna make
this 3 yes and as we can see our h2 now
is visually larger but I'm still letting
the browser know it is not the most
important text of this document that's
pretty much it feel free to play with
headings h1 through 6 and see you in the
next lesson
all right in this lesson we're learning
about paragraphs and some basic text
formatting in here it's a little bonus
we have the HR a horizontal row is
simply draw us a line you can modify
that with CSS to look however you'd like
but let's begin with the paragraph tag
so that would be simply a P and we would
have an opening in a closing tag for the
P and in here you can type anything
you'd like I have some text that talks
about HTML so I'm just gonna paste that
in here let's hit save see what that
looks like all right there we go you got
a paragraph pretty boring so let's use
some extra markup here to jazz it up a
little bit so here we got hypertext
markup language I'm gonna make this bold
and we're gonna use the bold element
which is simply a B and we place the
opening tag there and I'm gonna put the
closing tag over here after HTML there
we go now that's bold pretty cool we got
some other ones we got italics I'm gonna
turn cascading style sheets and CSS into
italics so that is simply the eye and
let's it save and let's take a look nice
okay cascading style sheets and CSS it's
all in italic we also have another one
called emphasis which is e M is it save
and as you can see it also italicized it
but it is telling the browser that it is
not just italicized but it is more
important than other words because it is
emphasized so some of these tags don't
only change the style or the way that it
looks but also changes the meaning of
the words that are wrapped within them
we also have one called
as strong which is
to add emphasis to text and it is styled
like bold
also have another one that I think it's
pretty neat it's called mark pretty much
like you grabbed a marker or a
highlighter and went over the text let's
take a look at that there we go
HTML documents is highlighted I like
that and inside a paragraph you can also
put a link so let's say you want to put
a link in your text to another page on
your website or where another page on
the Internet
you can wrap your text in in an anchor
tag type the href I'm just gonna put a
pound symbol so it doesn't go anywhere
and put the closing tag here all right
HTML describes there you go as the link
doesn't do anything okay so this is
basic formatting
for paragraphs I'm going to show you a
little bit more in the next lesson
welcome to you text formatting part 2
now let's say that you want to break a
paragraph to start on a new line you may
have tried doing this right here but
that doesn't quite work and let me tell
you that there is a tag for that and
that would be the break tag let's see
how that looks all right we see that web
browsers is on a new line after world
wide web perfect
now I've seen people that will pile
these break tags like this to create
spaces between different lines of text
that is not good practice just go ahead
and make a new paragraph like this and
there we go those are the two ways in
which you can break a new paragraph to a
new line another useful tag is the block
quote tag if you have a quote on your
document and you want it to stand out
and I'm just gonna paste a quote that I
found on the internet about development
and I'm gonna hit save let's take a look
at that all right beautiful by default
it is usually indented a little bit from
the left of where the paragraphs are
aligned but I have styled it so that it
looks like this the block quote tag can
also take the attribute of site and you
can put a citation to the source of this
quote I'm just gonna say Twitter and
here we go perfect awesome we also have
a tag of code which is just letting the
browser know that you're putting code
inside of this element and I'm gonna
paste some CSS in here just to see what
it looks like
alright and what it did is it put it all
in a single line but the browser by
default will apply what is called a mono
space typeface but what if we want to
keep our indentation for that we have
another tag called pre now this code
elements doesn't really do much for me I
don't really need it I'm gonna replace
it for the pre tag and let's see what
that does
scroll down all right so three stands
for pre formatting so all the
indentation that I gave my code stayed
there now I don't want all of this
indentation that I used to keep my code
pretty so unfortunately I'm gonna have
to get rid of all this indentation and
let's take a look at it again all right
perfect
beautiful there we go and that is how
you use the code and the pre tag and the
block quotes I'm gonna teach you one
more tag called as a quote tag and for
that I'm just gonna replace this mark
tag for aq this is for a short quote I'm
gonna save as you may have noticed I did
not add these quotation marks but the
browser will add those quotation marks
by default all right I hope you had fun
learning these extra formatting elements
and see you in the next lesson
in this lesson we're gonna cover the
basics of tables tables can be a bit
complicated for some people it was for
me at the beginning but I'm gonna try to
make it as simple as possible let's get
started when creating a table the first
element that we need to create is the
table element and the table elements can
take child element of TR which stands
for table row and the table row element
can take a child that is called
the TD or table data element and in here
is where we would put our content so I'm
just going to type here table data I'm
going to duplicate this three times
let's take a look at that and we have
table data three times in a single row
now I'm going to apply a class so that
it takes on a CSS style that I've
provided and let's see what that looks
like all right here we go we got our
table with three table data elements in
a single row now I'm going to duplicate
the table row three times let's take a
look at that we have a three rows and
each row has three TD elements now I'm
gonna duplicate this row one more time
I'm gonna place it above here and there
is another element to the table row can
nest and that is the th which stands for
table header I'm gonna replace this with
header and let's see what that looks
like even though the browser applies
some styling by default this styling
right here comes from CSS now the table
header elements as well as the table
data element can take an attribute that
is called Col span in other words span
this number of columns so because I have
three table data elements creating three
columns on each row and I want one of
these to span across all three columns
all the way at the top and I'm just
gonna call this
spanning three columns and let's take a
look at that alright here we go we got
our table
spanning three columns similar to that
we have another attributes called row
span and I'm gonna apply it here and now
this is going to make this equal data
element span across the rows so if I
wanted to span through one two three
rows I'm gonna specify three and now
let's see what happens huh it spanned
three rows but now it pushed two items
out of the three columns and that is
because that row span has taken a spot
on this third row as well as on this
fourth row so that is as if we had four
columns on the last two rows and that is
precisely what we're seeing here on the
last two rows we're seeing one two three
four columns and one two three four
columns so we need to remove table
elements from those other two columns
for them to line up
in this lesson we're going to learn how
to use some of the more advanced
elements for tables there are three
other elements there are three other
elements in tables that allows you to
group certain so we have group table
data under table rows and we have all of
the table rows under our table elements
now there are three other elements that
we can use to categorize the rows that
is T head t body and T foot now I'm
gonna go ahead and grab this row and
move it into my head and I'm gonna move
my content here to the T body so now it
should look about the same but what this
allows me is to control all of the
elements that are inside the T head
separates from the elements that are in
the t body etc now I'm gonna show you
another element that is called Col group
it stands for column group and you type
it as such call group opening and
closing tag the whole group tag
specifies a group of one or more columns
in a table so that we can format it and
it is useful so that we can apply styles
to entire columns instead of repeating
the styles for each cell in each row
alright now we can nest an element
called Col so that we can apply a style
to that whole column and I'm gonna
choose background color let's do the
blue violet color that we're using on
our site and let's see what that looks
like okay there we go
and the style that we applied has been
applied to every single cell in that
column now what would happen if I copied
this over and let's change the color
here okay so now we have another column
now what if we switch them around in
order here
we'll also switch around which column
has which color and another attributes
that we can place here is the span
attributes and now I'm going to tell it
span across two columns and now we're
going to see that the yellow spans
across two colors again I'm gonna switch
these around and there we go now this is
purple here yellow here actually this
should be up right inside the entire
table and if I remove this style here we
can see that it affects all the rows but
because I have this style styling the
header it over writes the default style
there of the call group all right and
now that we've learned tables I'm gonna
have a little challenge in this
challenge I want you to make a section
element inside of the footer inside the
section element I want you to create a
table with the class of styled and
inside that table I want you to create
three rows on the first row we're going
to have a table header cell with a call
span of two and you can write work hours
in there and for the last two rows
you're going to have a table data cell
with the following content inside of it
we're going to be using these elements
in the next lesson you should be able to
do them either way I'll see you in the
next lesson
all right so now we're gonna add some
final touches to make our sites look
more real make it come alive a little
bit let's begin by changing our
navigation as you can see it says item 1
three times that's not very realistic
Eric why did you do that let's go ahead
and change these two top I'm gonna do
quotes and I'm gonna do contact us I'm
gonna add a fourth one that is called
next page now the pound symbol in the
reference stands for an ID so this is
trying to reference a blank ID that does
not exist now how about we create links
to actual IDs on our page on the main
elements here I'm gonna add the ID of
top now I'm gonna go looking for a
blockquote
and add the ID of quote and for the form
that we have on the bottom of our page
I'm gonna add the ID of contact so now
now that we have these IDs
I'm gonna type them in the values for
each one of these links so the idea of
top the ID of quote the ID of contact
and let's try these outs so I'm going to
hit save top okay I'm at the top already
let's hit quote it tried to place the
contact form as close as possible to the
top perfect now what about this next
page you may have noticed that I have a
document called next dot HTML here on
this page I am simply going to reference
the name of the file which is next dot
HTML and that is because it is at the
same level in the files directory as my
index.html now let's say there was a
folder here on the left that said pages
and the next HTML document was inside
the pages folder I would have to put the
folder name here
and then the document name but we can
leave it like this since next aside the
route there can I hit safe let's try
that out awesome
next dot html' we have linked to a
separate document in the same directory
so you can see it has different contents
and different colors because that
document has different IDs and classes
and I was able to apply different styles
awesome let's go back to the home page
and let's try the sidebar here this
sidebar does not yeah it works let's go
ahead and fix that so now I'm just gonna
copy this UL over to my off canvas
sidebar fix an indentation let's try
this out
top quote contact us back to top perfect
next page sweet now we're done awesome
I'm so glad you made it this far you can
pat yourself on the back because now you
know HTML remember that if you have any
questions you can drop them in the Q&amp;amp;A
section on scrim ba you can also
interact with the code and I hope that
with your HTML skills you can take them
to the next level take over the world
and see you in the next course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
