freako camp today I'm here to celebrate
a huge milestone our community just
turned 1,000 days old that means that
1,000 days ago I was sitting in my
closet and I had a little prototype that
I built and I pushed it live and I
started blogging and hoping that people
would care and that they'd come and
check it out and learn to code with me
and so far things have worked out great
we have a community where you can hang
out with a whole bunch of supportive
people you can build projects earn
certificates and you can get experience
while helping nonprofits by coding so
over the last 1,000 days more than 6000
campers have gone out and gotten their
first developer job using the skills
they've learned with free code camp we
have another 8,000 developers who were
already working as developers who've
gone out and gotten even better jobs
with the new skills they've learned and
we've issued a ton of certificates we've
issued five thousand eight hundred
seventy verified certificates for the
front end certificate and that each of
these certificates represents about 400
to 500 hours with a course work and
involves building 10 different projects
for the data visualization project
certificate 782 people have earned it
the back end certificate 510 and then
325 people have earned all three again
that's 1200 to 1500 hours of just
hardcore coding free code camp also has
a lot of other cool things going on we
have more than 2,000 local free code
camp study groups around the world these
are all run by volunteers and they're
run autonomously they just volunteer
their time to find a coffee shop or find
a local employer or a hackerspace and
create events and get people together
coding so they can meet in person and
support one another we also have a
really useful YouTube channel where we
upload videos every day and
have mediums largest technology
publication let's take a look at some of
the numbers behind free cocaine I'm just
going to dive in real quick so this is a
normal Tuesday we have six hundred
thirty four people using free code camp
org our core learning platform right now
at this exact moment we have about 250
people reading the medium publication
and we have about 74 people who are
using free code camps forum which is
basically we like to think of it as
Stack Overflow for the beginners it's
extremely supportive you can go there
you can ask questions you can get
feedback on your different projects
super helpful and over the next 1000
days we want to do even more we want to
launch a coding interview prep module
that has thousands of additional coding
challenges algorithms data structures
take-home coding assignments so that way
you can prepare for coding interview
when you're applying for jobs we have a
beta curriculum that's almost done and
that has six new certificates and is
going to have a lot of additional coding
challenges and the projects on there
will have test Suites and everything
associated with it it'll be great we way
better than the current curriculum and
then we're also building a ton of guide
for theoretical topics like mathematics
computer science design and we're going
to cover a lot of advanced topics like
machine learning and blockchain so we've
got so much exciting stuff going on at
free code camp and the future is
extremely bright free code camp is a
completely donor supported nonprofit if
you want to help us grow and expand and
improve even faster please consider
becoming a supporter all this money will
help us cover servers and other expenses
and it will make a huge difference in
terms of the amount of resources that
our community has to work with so that
we can improve the platform even faster
thank you again so much for being a part
of the free cocaine community and here's
to another wonderful 1000 days happy
coding everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
