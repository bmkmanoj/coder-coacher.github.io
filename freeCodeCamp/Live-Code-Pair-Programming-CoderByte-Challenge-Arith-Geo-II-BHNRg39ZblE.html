I want to explain it to you but to the
people watching the stream so the
problem says that using the JavaScript
language have the function in reggio to
take the array of numbers stored in
array and return the string arithmetic
if the sequence follows an arithmetic
pattern or geometric if it follows the
geometric pattern yeah XO plague got my
reference to two euro trip and if it
doesn't follow either pattern then
return negative one now there's a pretty
simple can you zoom in your screen it
should be ctrl + yeah and zoom in once
more one more level that way we make it
nice and big for everyone alright so
there's a there's a pretty simple um way
to deduce if something is arithmetic or
geometric so if it's arithmetic right
and we have the range two four six eight
right so we have two four six eight it's
arithmetic then 8-6 is going to equal
6-4 and so on and so forth and that
gives you the difference between the two
or four minus two is going to be equal
to 6-4 so on and so on if this geometric
it's going to be the same thing but
instead of subtracting you're going to
use division so for this one up here for
this range it would be 6 divided by 2
will equal the same as 18 / 6 so using
that we can write a pretty simple test
do you want to go ahead and do the
honors do you remember what we did
vaguely alright so the vert arithmetic
array and the geometric array all right
and then the the for loop going over hug
okay and I believe we were comparing
each element with the one next to it
yellow yeah and since we're going to be
looking ahead in the array by one
element we need to make sure that our
iterator stops at one lesson there
you're a length so well it'll be two
less because we're starting to zero but
still okay so you remember the logic on
it yep okay if just push just push the
value right right now know it know if
oops so arithmetic dot push take that
push our I plus 1 minus 1 yeah minus I
array I there you go and then geometric
is division division
there you go and then so we pushed all
of the differences between the elements
into the arithmetic array in the
geometric array so if the differences
are the same which means if they all
contain the same value yeah then that's
the pattern matched or it didn't match
any pattern so to compare them we can
just write a simple function to compare
all the elements I believed we used was
it every or did we use a reduce I don't
think we used any we did a separate
function down here and called it like
subset okay and then we need a
comparator something to compare it to so
you can just use the first value in each
array or in the array ok 0 and then yeah
compare or if our I is not equal compare
value it's very important to use two
equal signs with the not equal or three
equal signs for equality in JavaScript
indeed
because otherwise it will type convert I
ran into some problems with that in the
past always always always use three
symbols and you're comparing when you're
comparing for quality yeah I mentioned
that earlier in the stream I'd always be
explicit with conversions instead of
implicitly relying on the language to do
it so we change we can change this yep
subset tick geo I really don't like like
these boolean functions I usually use
like is subset oh well then go for it
just step just so that it's easier to ya
human readable I I just named it subset
because this is the in in computer
programming this is actually the subset
sum problem I think I pointed it out to
you on Wikipedia so and the method or no
this isn't the subset sorry yeah we
could name this anything we want I'm
already thinking to the next challenge
so do you want to explain what i just
did or should you want me to do yeah um
so this right here for any of the new
code campers washing this is the ternary
function all right and what this is it's
a really short hand way of writing an
else statement and it's perfect for if
you're going to compare something but
you're going to and you're going to make
an assignment based on that comparison
without really performing any other
logic in there like if you're watching
earlier when we were doing the character
transformation with with the previous
guy um
then there you still want to use if else
but here because it's just simple it's
it be if or if it is then return this if
not then do something else we use the
ternary and what this is saying is
returned if this is true then arithmetic
otherwise and we're chaining here so if
this is true then return geometric
otherwise return false so this is like
an if-else if-else with the with the
three so so we want to go ahead and we
start putting in test values for this
yeah and we probably could okay see it
see if we did you return true at the
bottom of the yeah okay good okay so
this should return 5 4 5 10 and 15 the
expected output is arithmetic and that's
what we get yeah we should get negative
14 24 16 and 24 because it doesn't
follow excuse me either an arithmetic or
geometric pattern right
that works and then some test cases up
here this is a geometric example and it
looks like the looks like our phone it
looks like overall our program works yep
so so all of the test cases past</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
