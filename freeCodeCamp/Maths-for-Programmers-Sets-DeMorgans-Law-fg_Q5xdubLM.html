very last algebraic law of sets known as
de Morgan's law de Morgan's law was
founded by Augustus de Morgan and it
states that the complement of a union is
the intersection of the complements or
it says that the complement of the
intersection is a union of the
complements so we're gonna prove that
the complement of the union of a and B
is is in fact equal to the complement of
a intersected with the complement of B
so to do this we have to show that the
complement of a union B is a subset of a
complement intersection B complement and
vice-versa
so let's get started suppose that X is
an element of a union B complement if
that's the case then by definition X is
not an element of a union B and if X is
not an element of a TVV that is if X is
not an element of the region a union B
which is the red here then surely X is
not an element of a and X is not an
element of B and if that's a case then
by definition X is not an element of a
complement and X is not an element of B
complement therefore X is not an element
of a complement intersection B
complement so if we go to the other side
here we start by saying let's let's
suppose that X is an element of a
complement intersection B complement
then by definition X is an element of a
complement and X is element of B
complement by definition of the
complements X is not an element of a and
X is not an element of B and with the
same logic X is not an element of a
union B because X is not an element of
this region and X is not an element of
this region so surely it's not an
element of the two regions combined and
by definition of complements X as an
element of a union B complement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
