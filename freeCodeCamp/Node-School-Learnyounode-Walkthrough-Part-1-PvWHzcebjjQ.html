don't over learn you know I've been
getting questions about it people like
heaven issues with callbacks and what
now
so we'll pretty much make it as far as
McCain I I kind of started going through
some of the stuff and then I figured I
you know what I'll uh I'll kind of make
it up as I go along
you know seeing that way if I if I make
any mistakes
it'll be perhaps a learning point
watching me debug it well so without
further ado let's go ahead and we have
this here we have flex that's making me
think I'm having a stroke so let's
disable this for an hour which I'll let
me know when the streaming is scheduled
to end anyway anyway so let's create a
new workspace again node and let's make
this one sec learn you know very nod to
uh great that is a password so it's
gonna students processing anyway it
finishes we go in and we can just
started editing right here alright so
greeted with our brand new workspace yay
we don't need the server or anything
like that like it's you know nothing so
we can go ahead and delete the server
right here
and so package.json and does her does
her whatever we can leave it it's just
nice to have a package file here so the
first thing I'm gonna do is npm install
and I'm gonna put a G in front of it and
let's install learn you node and while
this is installing I'm gonna go ahead
and go up to here keyboard mode and then
this enabled so there reason why I'm
installing and globally is because I'm
gonna be navigating down into folders to
actually run it and I don't want to have
to run it from the root to look in node
modules I can just run it from inside
any folder so i'm also gonna type alias
ly n equals learning node okay this way
i only have to type ly in instead of
learning no doubt because i'm not
persisting that to like a zfh I see your
badge RC file it's only going to be
asked during this session all right so
we're greeted with that some some
shortcuts some you guys are working on
the terminal if you're on Windows I
can't help you out with this shortcut I
don't know what it is on Windows but on
Mac you can hit command K and it'll
clear your terminal you can hit control
C to stop a running process so with that
let's get started so we'll start with
hello world scare ourselves um it says
so just write a program that prints the
text hello world to the console all
right so let's make a directory and
we'll just call it hello world
all right and then we're just gonna CD
into that directory
all right and I'm just gonna name this
file hello Jas I'm gonna make it just
what touch
so I assure you that it is making that
file called hello J asunder hello world
now we don't really need to open this
for for something this like something
this simple we can actually just echo
into the file so we'll console dot log
hello world and we'll go ahead and put
that right into hello yes all right
so we can open this and we can actually
see what the result so that were and we
can see that it literally just put
console.log hello world wish it wanted
us to read program that prints the text
out to the console so we can run
hello jeaious and we see hello world and
then we can verify and sure enough we
passed
so baby steps it says what does it want
us to write a program that accepts one
or more numbers as command-line
arguments and preach to some of those
numbers to the console okay so one or
more and then prints the sum of those to
the console so let's think about how we
want to do that right so we know that
the arguments come in as preface are
clean right so and the first argument is
going to be node and this second
argument is going to be like the path
here program name and stuff like that so
the third on there are going to be thank
you float flop TV thank you thank you
we're here to help so any way we can you
guys can read this I definitely
recommend opening the documentation
we're actually in a open airlock today
but what I'm gonna do is I'm actually
just going to slice this starting after
the second element and without an ending
element argument to slice it'll just
return me an array this to the end of it
all right so let's so we close that file
so we can see down here that we're in
our hello world directory so let's come
back up here and we're gonna make the
right here called baby steps and let's
go ahead and add the attending that with
CD type LS which is just like list and
we can see we don't have anything in
there right so let's just touch baby
steps Jas
all right now this one I can't really
echo everything into it so we're gonna
go and open it here okay and let's just
say that oh can you guys see let me buff
thee there okay I can't make the
terminal bigger I'm sorry guys but I can
make the editor bigger so
let's see yeah
yeah okay so that's just saying that our
args are gonna be processed hard to be
right and we're just going to slice so
see how see how that slice popped up
with with from - okay so we're gonna
slice from - from the number two
yeah I'm Tara kilobyte and slack and
we're not going to provide a an ending
argument okay so you know what I need to
you need to edit my preferences because
every time - updates it
- okay and we need to come down here and
I'm looking for JavaScript okay and I'm
just gonna really assess that workflow -
Jess all right so now if I do je s then
I should be able to slice and they come
down here and I just have the
documentation here right so the slice
method returns a shallow copy of a
portion of an array into a new array
object so begin this is error based
index to which begin extraction so as a
negative index begin to indicates an
offset from the end of the sequence so
slice negative Q extracts the last two
elements in the sequence and if begin
and submitted slice begins from index 0
and n pretty much the same for the most
part and if n is emitted slice extracts
to the end of the sequence or a read out
length all right so
we have this here okay so I'm just going
to then go ahead and say that I'm gonna
console.log Center chess okay and that's
just it you know what actually let me
I'm gonna do this a little different so
I'll do this a little easier very some
equals argos reduce function cumulate ER
okay and do some return team later plus
cart and then let's just console.log to
some okay and make sure we're in our
directory and let's run baby steps 393
then we'll verify baby steps and looks
like looks like we got it so they have
official solutions to stuff you know
everyone's gonna solve their problems
differently
I could have shortened this a lot so I
could have actually just done something
like this console dot log the instead of
args I could actually just change this
to process our degree that's less to you
don't reduce and done everything in my
console statement and then got rid of
that and that
this is a hell a lot less readable so we
can see that it still matches it but I
mean it's a hell a lot less readable so
don't always think that shorter is
better guys like it it's it's not
necessarily like a really short solution
may not necessarily be the best one just
because like this is you know kind of
cluttered anyway with that said close
this window resize this one again okay
and let's ring learn your node and my
first i/o all right so what it wants us
to do is write a program that uses a
single synchronous filesystem operation
to read a file and print the number of
new lines that contains to the console
some somewhere to running this command
can't file piped I don't know but the
full path to the file to read over right
it's a fresh command-line argument you
do not need to make your own test file
so gives you hints and so it told us to
read it synchronously and so it's going
to return a buffer and then we need to
put the buffer at T string
so I'm gonna go ahead and never get up a
directory
okay now I'm in my home directory I'm
gonna make directory called first I'll
synch I oh okay then I'm just gonna
touch this file and OH
move sink down js2 sink io sneak jeaious
there okay and know our files in our
directory okay
so with the hand any hints opened which
pretty much give you a lot of the answer
then FS equals require FS okay and let's
do something like this bear new line
file equals FS read file sync process
are we - and let's 15 coating the utf-8
and then we can just do something like
console dot log newline file dot to
string just in case just in case
something really really bad happened and
then we'll match the newline character
length and let's come down here let's go
or so some stuff look at and let's I
mean it run sync js5 okay hopefully
that's the right answer
hey and it passed all right so you can
see their official solution is is
different than mine
and they say they actually say you can
negate the call to string by passing
utf-8 up here so I did both oh well I
just went for the for the straight match
method that's available on strength and
then I just counted occurrences of the
newline character in the file this
returns an array to me and then I just
use length to count the elements that
are inside the array and I console that
number out so that's the way that whole
thing reads am I am I going too fast for
you guys or are we taking a pretty good
pace
all right you're fine team man thanks
so first async i/o so this starts
getting in the idea of callbacks right
so we're gonna come back up here we're
gonna make directory called async i/o
okay let's go into that and we'll just
call this a sink ass okay so I think IO
is here basic jazz and it said it's
pretty much the same for the most part
so more require FS and then we'll just
read file process art being - now this
one this is gonna take a function and a
callback or it's gonna take a function
rather than like the file back so this
happens asynchronously because haven't
read or watched a video on what the
event loop is I will find the link for
you shortly
so or see what the heck is the event
loop it's really really important that
you guys understand what the event loop
is in JavaScript and why we do things
asynchronously so I think that's it let
me make sure yep
so you guys can watch that after the
stream if you're wondering why all the
say sing stuff it's really illustrative
so let's come up here okay so in good
node fashion we're gonna handle our air
first okay
now because we returned we don't even
need a we don't even need to do one else
because we we said if there's an air
just like dump out of this function
don't even try and do anything else just
console the air and abort essentially so
then let's just basically use the same
so data to string okay match
and thanks
okay and then let's run and I called
this async verify async
all right in the past so what this was
doing with yeah yeah notes cool so so
what this was doing alright so you are
just like callbacks alright when you
provide these anonymous functions just
callbacks I could have written this as
like this function handle file error
data all right and then I could
literally just
so let's tweet this let's put this in
here and then if air then let's just
return call sold by air air okay
and then instead of this and instead of
this function call here well then I
could just do handle file alright and
I'm not gonna invoke it all right
I'm literally just passing this this in
his data so I'll just call handle font
error
no and no is actually not even required
okay
so and let's go to the beginning of this
okay otherwise we can handle the file
with no and Dad
well actually I don't even need to do
that because handle file takes errand
Dennis I handle file I'll do everything
so we can just get rid of everything in
here and we certainly don't need any of
these
so
and so we replicated the same thing
right it's still past so like don't let
callbacks fool you guys you guys they're
just functions all you're doing is
passing functions around inside your
programming environment inside your
execution context like it's your it it's
it's not a lot of magic that that's
going on so anyway we'll move on pending
any questions if you guys have questions
share them out so so third LS and says
create a program that prints a list of
files in a groom directory filtered by
the extension of the files okay so let's
close this empty this out come up and
again we'll just call this directory
filter LS and then we'll go into it and
we'll touch filter is okay come here
open our file okay and let's go ahead
and read the inscriptions again
okay so it gives you hints FS reader and
we know that this is an asynchronous
call because it's not rigged or sync
right it's also suing us I'll find nodes
path module helpful particularly the
extend name method that looks like a big
hint so let's look at the extension name
documentation so path extension named
index.html would return HTML and then
index coffee and be able to return and
be right okay
so cool so with that we actually have
what we need here okay and let's come
back over here check any questions
doesn't look like it
okay
so I'm gonna go ahead and open the
directory and put it for directory
they've provided me in process rb2 okay
and I'm providing my callback in line
okay so if I'm in there I just want to
return console dot error error right I'm
I just want to bail out of the function
okay
otherwise we could say and and we'll do
a regular expression we could bring in
the wicket we could bring in the path
extension name but you know this will
probably work too and you guys can see a
little bit of red X and actually see how
it might be useful in fact who knows
they may use vary X inside the inside
that module I don't know if only notice
open-source and I can actually look at
the code so
I could do data dot filter and function
now um all right and I'm just gonna
filter it by test test
no and all right that's a crappy name so
let's change that to your Vegas test
yeah and then for each and I'm just
gonna console the Allen that
okay so let's see if that works okay it
looks like we worked hello
ACK okey let's go camping we are camping
we are learning ode camping we're
talking about loony node around the
campfire
thanks for the fall so anyone have any
questions about what I'm doing here
I guess I'll kind of explain it while
people are formulating any questions
they might have
so I'm reading the directory providing
the arguments to my program and then I'm
providing a function as a callback to
Ritter
which it needs with its parameters and
data I check there's an error and if
there is I just bail out and I'm gonna
console I'm gonna I'm gonna log the air
out to the console error output then so
if there's no error I'll come down here
I create a regular expression test and
so I'm saying match any character up to
one so there must be at least one
character for this to match and then I'm
matching the literal dot character like
the little period and then I'm inserting
whatever extension name they wanted
that's provided as the second argument
to my program which lives in process
tower to be three and then I'm sure that
that's actually at the end of the line
so so it's going to look for dot
whatever extension they gave me and
ensure that's at the end of the line so
then what I'm doing here
is I call filter on data wish I got back
and from reader and I filter it based on
the results of this test so if it
matches this then it returns true
otherwise it returns false then I'm
chaining for each onto the end of this
and I'm passing each element of my
filtered array into this function so
then I log out the element which are the
file names no yeah that's what I was
saying earlier so we could have used
extension name but this is how they may
very well do it inside and I don't know
it just when so I did I did a few of
these for my blog it's like a it's like
primer or recap fur for people who might
be having issues and I actually didn't
even read like the hints for any of them
so which probably would have like help
me if I had but so I just I just did
this in line and then I was reading the
directions today no I was like oh look
that's right there they recommended the
extension name function on path so but
arguably - I mean reg X is available you
know you if you were using this in a
program you would have to import you
would have to import path into your
module or to make it available so all
that
yeah the the thing about rig X is it
sucks until you need it
and then it's like really awesome I try
to use reacts as little as possible you
know it's a very specially shaped tool
for a very especially shaped nail you
know don't don't think right yet so it's
gonna solve everything if you're doing a
lot of reg X what you should be doing is
looking at your data and seeing how you
can create a copy of it and then
mutating the copy in some way that you
can break your data down into more
manageable chunks rather than like super
I'm like super long archaic exotic you
know regular expression like that's way
way you know too much like it if if your
ax are starting to look longer than this
it's getting pretty ridiculous well I
mean there are reg if does it look
longer than this but like if it's like a
full-on line it like try and think of a
better way don't don't keep hammering
hammering on the nail so to speak</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
