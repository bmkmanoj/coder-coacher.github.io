you don't want that on your window
you'll you'll start tunneling into
infinity and you will eventually blow
your band width apart okay you said I
need what Alfred sharing yeah Alfred at
yep it's it's worth pointing up the
money for the powerpack I'd I'll just
tell you that right now like it's it's
worth the 20 bucks or whatever that they
charge for the power pack because you
can start using workflow integration and
you unlock some other features that are
just stupid retard Lee what does it do
it will replace the use of finder but it
does a lot more
it's the clipboard manager with the
workflows it's a doc set browser it's
just really nice okay look at that a
little later just loading the video okay
great
yeah and it looks like it's fairly
smooth I'm gonna turn up the volume a
little bit okay I'm gonna open it and
turn the line down I wouldn't I would
open it so you have chat oh I'll be your
ears I can just I can just listen I'm
gonna drop off this call okay yeah I
just keep the chat okay okay just like
pop it out or something the chat
yeah you can see okay okay I was turned
up all the way already
okay and we want to open your system
preferences
what's your Finder shortcut command
space yeah yeah
okay sounds gonna shut off for a second
don't worry okay now we want to turn
this up and that probably turned it up
in your ears that's fine
yeah and then yep so you can you can
manually turn it down like if you have a
microphone that you can adjust a lot but
sometimes you'll need to do that what do
you track all right I should be
significantly letter now yeah it sounds
lighter to me
there we go okay
all right you should be pretty much set
up bring that there and then we can
actually come back here and turn your
headphones down so your ears aren't
blown out this is what I do I come back
and I turn my headphones down okay and
then in this I turn I just keep the
sound flower all the way up on the
output okay yeah and it should be a
little easier on your ears but the
stream gets this volume here okay oh
that's good now yeah I'm glad you guys
do I have learned over the course of
everything all right let's bring OBS the
OBS window up one more time all right
let's check your settings all right we
want to move this out of the way there
we go
test test test yeah the volume levels
are looking pretty good
okay yep we're good there should be
something in OBS to broadcast and more
than one quality setting at the same
time for faster connections it doesn't
matter we don't have the viewership to
allow anything other than the default
twitch group quality setting so it it is
what it is
guys sorry yeah my download speed okay
the upload speed is the problem for me
it's only a two
yeah I think I'm at going to up yeah I
think I'm at fifty down and up to 25 up
Wow so I can have all the Internet's
going I wish that was the case here yeah
boy it's nano 7 let's get started so
apparently we're building a snapchat
clone what the hell
so snapchat is some kind of application
where you can send a picture to someone
else that supposedly times out if they
don't take a screenshot yeah that's my
understanding I don't actually use it
myself but the way I understand it is
you take a picture you can attach a
message to somebody and then after like
10 seconds it just deletes itself this
is the idea I believe so we're gonna try
to build the same thing except online I
think we could try to use socket and try
to build like a little chat application
and then just include pictures and I'll
just delete it yeah I think we'll stick
with the same setup I've used to for the
other three I using the yeoman generator
just call this snapchat you know what
Mac Lex you uh you settle down right now
all right
oh you're using the mean J s generator
or no that's bull stack I think oh look
a little bit better for me than the mean
joyous dude it just seemed easier to set
up and get going
I'll use Twitter login so was i'ma
clacks so was hi
I've had a long week man yeah all two
days mmm no my my wife was diagnosed
with leukemia
um Christmas Eve and as a side effect
from her last round of high tech she had
no immune system and ended up getting an
infection went into septic shock and
almost died so I had to fly home on her
on a red-eye a week ago from Korea
that's all right if life was perfect we
wouldn't appreciate it it's just been a
long week yeah it's true she doing okay
now
yeah that's good yeah she should be home
pretty soon that's good then next week
I'm going to meet Quincy in New York
City in San Francisco he is cause he's
just traveling therefore yeah yeah he
heard I was close and he was like dude
you're so awesome I got a fly at see ya
so yeah and you're in New York
yeah I'm just outside of New York City
I'm in northern New Jersey okay all
right you got the oh you're still
friending the generator yeah
I'll try and cut everything I want a
window there all right thanks bye see
you pulp the default page shown here
okay so don't need any of that I guess I
didn't leave the navbar yeah the navbar
will be handy for sign up and log in
yeah we can keep those systems yeah
you're on your own as far as you know
being around I don't use that him so
it's not you guys for me somewhere to
sublime text I use I use webstorm okay
it seems you're pretty popular here I've
never really liked it all that much
really Big E when you start dealing with
and as web applications grow you'll
you'll start appreciating it especially
with the indexing that it does and the
attack intellisense we could uh you know
what you should do is go ahead and push
this up to a repo which we have so far
and then import it into c9 yeah why
don't we give it a shot
it's milania's things taking forever
there it goes oh man what's all this dot
trash a demamp oh you're adding you're
adding a lot do you not have a global
get ignore shut up oh my god
no I just messed up a bit in my home
directory that'd be why well no I just
type RM Tech RF and dot GI t well yeah
but I mean I'll still have to go back
and clean up could they install the
actual app I think in there yeah it did
so it's goodbye can clean that up
I get ran the human generator in my home
directory hey Brianna how's it going
peace yeah I just removed it there you
go much faster
you already have that gift set up yeah I
think for whatever reason it doesn't
start it like I really start sides to
this afternoon I think it something with
like sh agent after the strain if you
want and we can fix your command line
get so you don't have to open the the
app yeah I think I think it just sets
the stage agent I don't leave actually
get it so
I'm led by a train track oh yeah it
comes by all the time I I'm so used to
it now I didn't even realize I was going
by that's right about that
all right so good and doesn't bother me
see where's this hole
ever get the music going like once he
asked so you need to have moobot open so
let's see and you may not be able to get
moobot open without the actual free code
camp to wish you but maybe there
I think it's twist-up moobot duck TV
yeah then you would connect with twitch
but it's gonna authenticate under your
twitch yeah so in lieu of that do you
have do you have Spotify yeah I can
start that yeah open spot a file I'll
pull up a chilla
playlist that's not paying for it though
so you might get a couple labs it's okay
yeah here we go and I won't be able to
hear if music is playing on your side or
not so there it goes the book circuits
and I guess I'll get my Spotify going to
a North Dakota thanks for the follow as
it is a cloned end you're seen Anya oh
yeah all right we'll be right
nor two cutter what do you mean by
similar demos and serious Lusa how you
doing
or they're all oka
if I continue working and then spoiling
changes once it's done
yeah it should pull in my name way my
clothes Gator was probably using some
stuff I don't need
all right you saw snapchats actual page
looks like this is our main page well I
think they're a own application aren't
they wow that's pretty minimal
please oh my god
these tumblr as their blog interesting
well there's not much to go off of here
I guess mmm you'd search Google Images
for what their phone application looks
like yeah I just trying to clone
something off dribble to Twitter monitor
I just yellow to the ghost
anyways winery we are looking at reverse
engineering snapchat and making it a web
app but considering it really only for a
mobile phone we're having issues finding
an interface to actually eight yeah
another view snapchat and I barely know
what it is except for ridding news and
apparently people send other people
naked pictures and then got all butt
hurt when they took screenshots and like
whoa hey surprise people can like still
take screenshots and photos of their
phone if they want be careful what you
send yeah I can send a tag so why would
I need a picture for everything
oh my god that what this seems to be
popular
well what if we just kind of copy a
login page that I already made like four
pages already made or like this one the
last base-jump just pretty much the
picture with a login I know he got
straight into the chat app broke there
were loads
well I'm something like this just big
picture with a login screen yeah saw the
rage big patient landing screen we
definitely do other stuff they're all ok
actually I thought I knew Nick Lexi you
you were allowed to keep your bad humor
arm the entire time men it's ok I'm
drinking beer while this is going on so
it's gonna get wild depending on how
much I drink
yeah perfect already
ginormous - wow that's really how to
work
they're real Luka
go set that up the background this
compare Plus snapchat equals regrets
yeah yeah but it's it's ephemeral right
it's only eight seconds of regret unless
this is it right we're using just pace
you snails we use JavaScript and HTML
and CSS all right that size good size
mmm it's okay man no need to be sorry we
won't send the rooms after you for not
knowing what programming language we
were using a unknown listener 15 thanks
for the follow background:url size
nice challenge seven I remember when I
was there keep keep going man you'll
make it
mmm look at that perfect full spring
background image CSS tricks I've done so
many times you think how I know by heart
by now I thought I had it but maybe not
I found URL a concise cover
yeah
yeah it's you're getting a not found on
your bootstrap CSS yeah that's that's
something to just wade with the
generator all right oh it's cuz its
assets laughs images that's why
kind of want to know what she's looking
at
she's looking at the new free code camp
snapchat up yeah right
actually I don't have use flexbox but
I'm trying to pray anyway to Center
vertically center with flexbox
yeah Lex there's uh with with like
stylus sass and less there's no need to
use browser prefixes when it compiles it
to CSS or trans files to CSS it will add
the necessary breasts or prefixes to
anything that needs it which is another
reason we use all of that awesomeness
Wow that's what snapchat looks like huh
that's that's a hot mess tell you posted
the picture yeah I suppose so we need to
call it something I've been snapchat
though I mean to call like I don't know
window pane or yeah I just dorm glass or
something yeah when the when the image
fades out we can do some CSS rain
droplets that just obscure the image so
that it blurs until it's just not read
not viewable
Jason Quesada Phi brillo dude what's
going on men running lunch task
a annecy thanks for the follow man you
hate American Airlines right now why do
you hate American Airlines tell us funny
story we need to we need to take
advantage of the natural lines that the
pictures have given us for positioning
our login box the difference between
triumph and disaster probably top give
it a top percentage there was a special
way he'll flex they made it really easy
I was forget I think yeah they hose you
when you want to use award miles when
you have an infant I just figured they
host you when you have award miles I
didn't know an infant was a was a factor
in the in the hosing
box on
yeah yeah CSS is I don't I don't really
like CSS all that much so I'll let you
uh play with it I'll do my favorite
solid-gold
I guess that's why everybody use red
borders I think gold makes it look a lot
fancier I think you should match the
rust that's on this I metal here I was
doing at the test yeah rust or dirt or
something it's a really nice color
actually it's like an orangish red yeah
new uses colorzilla pick whatever color
yeah I use a different sampling tool but
does the same thing lets me click on the
screen and pick whatever image I want or
pick whatever color I want yeah
it's it's justyou DJI monkey 64 I'm just
kidding it could be other people I don't
know
oh so you can hear the music I wasn't
sure if you can or not when we uploaded
to YouTube do we want to upload this to
YouTube
if so then yeah we have to kill the
music Quincy eyes has an on so do you
guys I guess you're trying to figure why
is not 10% of what no but through throw
like a margin:0 auto on the body yeah I
don't yeah I don't yeah I don't know if
you have normalized I don't know if
normalize this brought into this I would
imagine it would be if it's boilerplate
but yeah I mean it's already centered I
just need this to be bigger what is
going on here yeah that's the flexbox
container I'm gonna try to make that be
a full width so that way we can just put
it right in the middle I mean if not
I'll just go back to doing regular like
top 50% positioned but I'd rather not
rather use flexbox it's the right way to
do it these days
yes we want it we want what I think I
think I asked two questions that both
could be answered with the positive
Jason
we want no music and upload to YouTube
or we want music and no upload to
YouTube that's almost kind of strange oh
the music I can't hear what you're
listening to
oh yeah we do want to have this on
YouTube when you're done
so Jason Jason are our digital media
head is saying that you can't listen to
music already maybe you can just think
for us then yeah Jason sing for us Oh me
no I'm not singing that's that's not
happening
I see you've you've accidentally
misspelled can't you forgotten
apostrophe T at the end of that Jason
line items oh of course I can't do it on
the same
yeah DJ monkey I think there is but
that's like a if you were streaming and
then separately recording it and then
uploading the recording to a YouTube we
just export straight from twitch to
YouTube alright Jason would like you to
talk through what you are working but
wouldn't is your thought process ok the
thought process right now is I'm trying
to research flex to not only get it in
the center which it was but also
vertically centered which I think I made
just give up on and do it the
old-fashioned way
with absolutely positioning it there
since we don't really need anything else
there I think I'm gonna do that cuz just
taking away too long for nothing really
to gain absolute position top 15% tip
that works yep that worked
take fly and Center nope didn't work
okay
okay CSS is a lot of birthing at it and
see which one works yep DJ monkey you
are correct
if you would like to buy me a new Mac
Pro one I'll be your friend
well I'd be your friend anyway
regardless of the MacBook or a Mac Pro
but then then I would be more than
willing to do that okay login box
background color so right now we're just
making them all game box
mostly Cyril please what I think for a
logon box is small we can just use
pixels I don't think yeah let's sit the
background color on that login back to
our GPA and give it a give it an alpha
channel like 0.4 yeah I was gonna do
that by one to make sure I position at
first this I can see easier sure this
look think there's two left at least 500
and I looks like 35 yeah that's a little
better I'm gonna make this a little
smaller 4000 50
or 30 yeah move it down move it down
about 20 pixels okay actually I think I
might use viewport so that way it scales
to get down a little bit
yeah move it down basically right on top
of the glasses the glasses provide some
some nice lines okay yeah that's a
that's a good width right there like
that yeah and then let's pull it up just
a little okay - yeah they're down more
yeah that's that's pretty good right
there I think and then let's change the
background to rgba and give it maybe try
and mash this color a little bit and
then just give it a letter alpha channel
so that
nice be running slow strange use 100
view height on body but they're saying
oh well I guess that works
on the body yeah I can I guess min
height 100 th instead of a hundred
percent okay yeah that works
that looks pretty good did and then
let's get the background color of this
and give it a porter of this rust color
I can get this thing to work
I may be they're just opening up the
picture cuz that doesn't look right
it's not si si si oh wait I'm selecting
on that don't know why this thing's
messing up so bad
well anybody also find this got a phone
may be great yeah I'm getting my color
picker going what's going on
second remember my name is let's get it
because I gotta open up in GIMP
storm glass on it sexy news
it's six one five c6 e hold on let me
let me get that in okay let me get then
our GBA color format
alright are you ready for the code yeah
it is 6 1 5 C 6 e and you can convert
that to our GBA
okay six on five C over 6 e 6 e
and you 792 you one tell me yeah 5.7
close this down oh it's pretty good I
don't like that with you no I want to
stay in there in the little frame 35 32
that's better I hate that actually
really don't you need to did right we
just need an input box really mm-hm
just take all it out put all right still
the same please put type equals text set
model up easier dot user name no big
deal
yeah that's what I'm good background
color
oh man I hate doing this i thing about
that humor right food chefs stuff
well you renamed it from login box to
input oh right yeah that's my one gripe
about bootstrap is it it's so annoying
to overwrite stuff especially like
outside blows yeah and then probably do
a border color of this hold on let me
get the get the color let's do let's
call it C 563 see see 563 II just one
just just do like one for now let's
change the color the background color of
that to convert II 1 B II alpha 1 well
I'm wondering why it's not I guess my
trial route should be getting C general
code format
looks the same yeah I just changed it to
this back here to make it pop a little
more so we could
hmm DJI monkey is saying you can use
background position offset to centralize
the image relative to the box yeah I
could but I mean it's kind of like
moving your house to fit around the door
I mean it can work but I'd rather just
put box
it seems that work okay I guess I'm just
going on with the blue
yeah that's pretty strapped I'm so I'm
trying you're gonna it does that glow
when you click on it oh that's just
telling you how to yeah see there we go
I think that looks pretty good and is
contrasting enough that it kinda jumps
outage yeah okay I got every guy on the
border now order one pixels let's get
rid of that and make this more stylist
friendly all these importance I can't
stand up on TV but it'll do
there we go perfect now we should
probably add it a little font they have
a font you like yeah let's do em ma no
sons
yeah good to not Klaus indeed no I think
it's it should just be mono science I
thought I probably said it wrong but no
no no go back it's it's like right on
their front page opens yeah open sans
there we go this has some problems with
this on one of them but if you just make
it the first it seems to work like if I
put it down here anything I work for
whatever reason okay yeah yeah and let's
give it a font size of like 3m fill that
box up yeah yeah let's see how white
whoosh whoa
well it's it yeah looks pretty good yeah
maybe maybe a little bit smaller the
cursor is kind of taking up the whole
box two point seven maybe that looks
like a good change on the font size team
so then we just need to let's add some
some placeholder text to that and then
copy the box so we have user name
password yeah 51 51 51 for the phone huh
DJ Mikey's saying try on the color try
RGB 51 across yeah okay it's like all
the way out to the side I can't yeah so
good I am my eye on it yeah yeah yeah
that does and it matches it's close
enough to this it matches the the dark
colors yeah so let's add a set a
placeholder in the HTML it's just a
username and password and then we'll
need a button probably stick with the
same
color scheme for the most part I think
that actually looks pretty good
yeah I think I can just do this I don't
think I need to do it twice
tight password password
yeah we're overriding bootstrap oh it
did not work login box input box
no I think each one is gonna have to
because it's an ID not a class selector
that doesn't work outside it okay yeah I
kinda like adding it at the end and then
you can still put it in like a div put
it in
I got ya then you can log in form log
into the corn and then take this out
just login Fox
yeah the color hot side is line height
with padding catwalks looks pretty good
change the padding up probably give a
little margin between the two then the
placeholder coming here so CSS for that
don't remember
I don't recall off the top of my head
that's like input placeholder it's weird
how about there check David Walsh this
guy is like a genius is this work yeah
so just let's make any global I don't
think I'll get to change it else on here
no probably not
I'm just gonna set the color yeah just
set it to her
it's color I guess I could stop and see
if everybody is following us I know what
we're doing then who has any questions
I'm a watcher chat okay I don't think it
likes these I worked before though oh
maybe you're right
just try input placeholder I don't think
as don't begin uh was included so I can
try it
yeah oh it never hurts to try
I mean cuz the other way is just
completely breaking the layout wait he
said the blue glow can be killed by
input focus the border your are using so
focus reporter mm or did you put the
border down here I guess I needed it
done here - yeah both places so this
should work I thought it was more
complicated than that
I don't know I shouldn't even
oh this is gotta get out here yeah let's
remove for now this is not seems to be
there so then put the placeholder which
writing this thang
I'll try to maybe stylus it up color
I'll try it just looking for now see if
that works yeah okay that works
hopefully everything still works yeah
and let's give it the let's give it the
same yeah
or actually since we're stealing colors
out of the picture anyway give it like
see Charlie for Bravo echo alpha alpha
or Charlie for Bravo echo alpha alpha
that gets a little too light I'm still
waiting for yeah unfortunately it is um
alright let's try five Foxtrot five five
six four that's pretty good yeah I think
that works you can probably see what
color it matches to in the picture yeah
yeah and let's get rid of this title
tech stuff right here oh yeah yeah
probably also add a listener with the
jQuery lighter whatever it is angular
uses to listen for the Enter key as well
oh yeah yeah what's exciting ever you
happen in the forum it does
automatically this works if you were
feeling daring you could also stick in
the good ole important flag yeah I mean
that's what we're already doing though
the box shadow right here yeah
all right login button you you need a
text yeah I think we have a yeah and
then we want it to be the same color as
the inputs
can't you just applied login box to this
just just apply the login box class to
the to the button yeah I mean you
already have it all you're probably done
with the same color
yeah we're going to swap the board and I
think that yeah I think that looked
pretty good and then I would say right
align it so that the the right edge of
the login button
marries up with their right edges of the
of the inputs yeah
Oh
background-color no your screen here oh
yeah yeah not being able play music is a
bummer
that's why I like that's why I like
streaming during not official stuff
because then I can just play music all
them up yeah because it can't be in
there actually I received that c9 is
done you let's finish now yeah hey is
step Jets landing page wow it's still
says processing oh you might want to
refresh that and just check it see if a
hyung for some reason I can't believe
it's their site yeah well the workspace
I made got to lead it so Teddy
we could always clone Instagram next and
see if Facebook wants to bias for
nineteen billion dollars yeah I'll take
that
like one yeah oh yeah I take I'd take 1%
yeah just I'm not greedy just just 1% of
19 billion would do me just fine
I'm Java programming while watching
others program too nerdy Serpa 88
there's no such thing as too nerdy man
nerds are what make the world possible
there they're nerds give people the the
amenities and the quality of life that
they have I mean as as nerds and then
you're true blue collar guys like the
ones that build roads and bridges and
maintain them deep welding and CNC
machining and all that oh don't nest it
under the input it's just gonna throw
our it trying to nest a button under an
input is gonna give you an air where you
have this button here under the input
you can't nest anything in an input
that's invalid HTML okay
I think he's going to saying we have to
restart the session since we started
with music earlier so might have to
restart the stream oh alright never
