back up again i just tried it again just
to drop it even more the bit rate of it
okay i'm going to go and check the
stream on my side while you try to pull
that ok so just just go ahead and pull
mm-hmm get pull origin ux improvements
so it's telling me that I have on what
can I just stash my unmerged stuff um so
it doesn't work quite like that let me
show you like what you whenever you try
to stash something doesn't seem to be
giving me any control over your screen
oh really clicking in here and it's just
not very me do anything the terminal oh
it could be the framerate is just solo
coming from I mean it might just be the
your upload rate is way she's too slow
to both be streaming on OBS and doing
them that oh that would make sense
because before I've only cheered I've
only done the OBS from the shared screen
of someone else so you must be able to
do OBS but not also do extreme hero
simultaneously um yeah and I've done
screen hero before so maybe if we go
back to sharing your screen I can
broadcast it and maybe that work okay
let's just try that so um I'm going to
share my screen and we'll just do it on
my machine again I apologize to our
viewers for the back and forth but that
branch is good what you need to do is
you need to do get ed dash a before you
um before you pull or before you stash
otherwise it wants that it only stashes
what's staged so okay so what wiII
happen is you didn't stay to everything
before you stashed okay so then i can
just what i revert back to the previous
two to get that to work I can figure
that one out later low too yeah what i
would do is i just do get reset dash
dash hard head oh come get add
everything here i'll send you a message
so i would do get add dash a and then i
would do get reset dash hard head okay
okay and then then you can pull good
call origin you
improvements okay I'll fix that one
later so we can at least get something
going here for a little while before
before that I have to go but yeah but
yeah Lori's um I mean even if we didn't
get a whole lot done on this we still
got some basic discovery and stuff
setting up everything so let's go back
to my machine and so we're in what's
still called course right about JSON
even though as far as the campers will
know is it we're no longer referring to
these this course we're referring to
them as way points so we've got our way
points right here and we're using
bracket notation to find the end
character in a string and we've got a
passing test there so let's talk about
the direction the general direction we
should go from here so we've basically
introduced strings we've been focusing
on strings concatenated strings
accessing particular characters and
strings so the next thing we could do
would be for example to take a number
and turn it into a string for example
okay so what we give you next is we can
introduce kind of think that's the next
logical thing a thing is like there are
a lot of programs that exist like Khan
Academy code Academy have JavaScript
curriculums and they all do it in
slightly different approaches but it's
generally agreed upon that you need to
teach strings and and numbers and other
basic data like basic objects or uh
what's the technical term for that it's
I'm blanking on it but it's a few lacan
free curriculums challenges like the
ones in production
so basically they're teaching build
adventure game I think this is where the
code Academy challenges start yeah it
doesn't actually say but basically data
structures that's the word I'm thinking
of okay so so all the all the challenges
have a present progressive second person
of grammar to them so one we could say
would be use or we could do add two
numbers that could be like a simple
thing and then what we do is we the
first line is always what the objective
is and the additional stuff is how to
accomplish that objective so we could
put read about to say something yeah I
was just going to say is it still going
to be where a person does isn't required
to hit the more button they should be
able to complete everything based on
what's in that first line correct that's
correct that's the goal okay so the goal
is again for them to if they're in a
hurry or if this is review for them and
for many of our campers will be we want
it to be as fast as possible where they
can just like oh I know how to add two
numbers two plus two BAM and then
they're on the next challenge Bam Bam
Bam until they actually hit a place that
that stumps them and that's when they
start expanding to read more information
make sense so we could do add or set the
variable some code
to equal 5 plus 3 or something like that
and then in our challenge seed we could
have something like VAR sum 1 equals and
this could be like three plus three so
we can see set the variable some too
because I always like to have an example
so they can see pretty obviously how to
do it and then we'll just do return some
too and then we can do our some 2 equals
0 towards new poll and then we need to
wrap each these lines and you for quotes
is there a generator that works for this
to like there are for the bonfire
challenges there is not and we could
build one for sure um I never really
used the generator I always just did it
in JSON know that totally works i was
just just curious just in case yeah we
could definitely consider building one
um but frankly like the bonfire like
this core curriculum I don't anticipate
a lot of people contribute greatly to it
because it's not really fun sure writing
these types of challenges I mean this is
like more like like I'm trying to
actually raise money through grants not
through giving away I could hear
anything like that but I've applied for
a couple grants from LinkedIn and a
couple other places trying to get money
to help us actually get a professional
instructional designer who knows how to
code to help pair with me to build out
some of these stretches of a way points
because it's going to be just like does
you know hundreds of our to work really
um and if we could get like a
professional to help who has put a lot
of thought of this or taught javascript
extensively yeah
he or she will probably have a good idea
of how to introduce these topics and
what constitutes efficient hand-holding
things like that sure so if you run gulp
here and then I need to see okay so
let's see on this week we took and
bracket so i can see that at the very
end oh yay javascript is so or JSON is
so persnickety okay so let's try this
again and we almost always get this
duplicate here don't worry about it
unless it's affecting the one that
you're currently doing ok like this ID
needs to be fully unique there can't be
anything else with this ID you should
search for it if I won one match ok and
I recently went through and verified
that all the ideas were unique but
you'll just want to be careful if for
some reason it's not loading this
probably the reason why so now we can
try to go here add two numbers
we can verify that it's it's working it
doesn't look like it's working I mean oh
it says waiting for local hosts I think
we might be working I'm just going to
restart it okay so here we go right off
the bat I'll enter is picking up the
fact that we're missing a semicolon so
currently this some 2 equals 0 and if we
run it it just says no test for run
illegal return statement so that part of
the reason for that is because we're not
actually doing return statements we're
just doing them right now we're just
doing we're declaring the variable and
then we're checking to verify that some
2 equals 0 so for example here we could
do expect some to to equal 80 and let me
see it one time
okay so if we change that to eight let's
see if it actually works so it's
expecting it to equal the string 8 which
is probably because we have it in quotes
so if we change that to just the number
8 you see it again refresh run this code
all right and it works so all we need to
do is figure out like a way is a way of
introducing these different concepts i
mean i can put eight by itself but we
also want to verify that they're
actually doing three plus five so would
so that that will also work hmm so are
you thinking like just a regex for that
somehow or I mean does it really matter
though how they're adding those two
numbers together I mean would it would
the only way be to use a pleasantville
well we can do something like actually
we could there are a lot of different
ways they could do it more specifically
trying to teach them how to we're saying
set the variable to equal 5 plus 3 okay
so and so what we can do is we can do
test we can do a reg ex which will be in
this case 5 possibly space then a plus
and then possibly space and then a three
and we can just test it that exists
somewhere in the body dot-to-dot be true
I think that's the syntax for doing that
so they actually the way to do this is
and I'll teach you this I don't know if
you learn this in law fire but you can
create a script tag down here okay and
you can do something like dollar sign
our console dot log and then we'll just
go down here and we're going to use this
is using chai um the front end testing
framework and then we can do something
like exactly what we did here without
having to reload and reseat everything
we can just take this right here and see
what the answer is
um so it's giving me some airs oh this
is an HTML so I don't think this is
JavaScript so don't need the script tag
okay so if we do that and we run it so
it says false it's not finding that so
what we can do is we can throw up bangs
in front of it okay so he's still false
let's just get rid of the plus um so oh
yeah three plus five I had in the wrong
order oh okay I didn't even catch it so
basically what we're doing is we're reg
ex testing this to see if somewhere in
here is three plus five and I honestly
have no idea whether this will work it
says false right now it's not finding
three plus five the mate you need oh
yeah we need that in our eggs so what
are we were turning here and actually we
don't need to put this over here we can
just put this over here we don't need
the console log we can just run the test
and also i forgot to do that so let's
just see what it returns it returns
false so the red X is 3 let's just see
if it finds the number three anywhere in
the page so it doesn't see
to be fun name the door trainer so let's
just select body and see what it plans
for body now we can see that it found
all that so when you're doing that is it
it's not just taking it from the from
the box here it's not just going it's
searching the entire page that's correct
in order to access just the code pent up
it's like called code mirror um let's
let's figure out what that is this is
called code mirror dash code so if we we
attempt to select code married dash code
this is one of the things we were
working with I was working on yesterday
because it's it's awkward it's awkward
to deal with for example like HTML tags
exclusively because if I'm doing HTML
tags like it's currently you can pass
the test without a closing HTML tags
sure ok so here we go looks like it's
found two divs of the pre it's up here
and then this second one which is kind
of unfortunate because we just want the
second one so I'm wondering if there's
like an ID that wraps around this
specific one I'm almost certain there is
code me your code and code where lines
ah comb your lines so I think we can
probably try that specifically to see
what we find in coding realigns ok now
we've got two divs okays also finding
that so we need to find something that
this has
that doesn't in order to verify that
they've actually type how about you
instead of just used like the number
well does does it matter which one of
those like can't we searched both of
these and when it still work because
we're not going to have what we want in
this one for sure yeah that's true yeah
it's definitely true however if you
think about it it's just going to be
more efficient if it's all in searching
one especially if it's doing this a
whole lot so it only takes a second to
find the right class here and it looks
like code marish goal is exclusively
this class so let's take a look and see
what we can find inside code miserable
it looks like everything is nested in
here so let's just try cooking your
scroll this should only get one object
okay you got to all right so could marry
scroll apparently also grows full of
these well okay so maybe we could step
back for a moment because pokey one was
asking in regard to this test
specifically is is this overthinking it
so what is like what is the person going
to learn from doing three plus five
minor road yeah my initial idea is that
like this which is again it supposed to
be really quick and it's it's really
fast if someone hasn't like this would
be obviously some of the very elementary
beginner jazz things where someone else
how to do that they can do it really
quick if if someone doesn't know about
any of this kind of stuff it might just
still be really quick and for anyone
else that's not really wasting that much
time because you can see add two numbers
and you know how to do that is that kind
of the idea behind it or do you have
something more to it um I mean the idea
behind this is for it for this is just
too yeah it's to give them something
very quick that they can do so they can
just blow through these real quick
especially if they haven't it but it's
also to show them how easy it is to add
numbers like so if somebody hasn't been
exposed to using javascript as a
calculator for example
this will give them a quick like I
figure we can walk them through the
basic operations you know addition
subtraction multiplication division and
then exponential and modulo if you're
fluent modulo that's an important one to
four doing any sort of algorithms so
we're just basically building up for
very rapidly from the kind of obvious to
the less obvious yeah like you wouldn't
intuitively into it how to do an
exponent if you hadn't like been exposed
to it right yeah so you wouldn't
intuitively know that you can do like
that wait does that not work and how do
you do exponents in JavaScript accursed
one of it's just I haven't done that
myself so oh oh you have to use matta
pow that sucks I thought there in Ruby
you can just do x times um let's just
verify that runs without additional
libraries yeah it does okay so um and I
think similarly Matt thought squirt will
get the gift for root I think or meth up
route but um I'm getting ahead of myself
here so basically yeah we want to verify
that they're actually doing the equation
because if they just know the answer
then they could just keep moving in and
it's not specific to this question this
is I'm trying to extract a principle
that we can use in testing all things
going forward if we need to like if
they're like a lot of times you know it
might be really easy to just intuitively
put the answer like the answer for but
it might be very it might be how you
arrived at that answer that's more
important kind of like in in math class
people asked for you to show your work
so they can see how you arrived at that
rather than just the solution and you
can argue that that's not necessarily
the official way of going about it
anyway because um however you got to
that answer is a good way probably like
like it in objective
terms you met the you met the evaluation
criteria but at the same time for the
purpose of teaching concepts a lot of
concepts are going to be like easily
answered without actually but it's a lot
harder to apply the process you notice
I'm sure so it would be nice that there
was a reliable way that we could test
what they actually typed into the field
mm-hmm yeah and I think that that does
make sense i think the the important
thing will be to make sure that we're
again back to that reliable aspect so
that we're actually testing so like I
know some of the other coating services
where you can go through and sometimes
something doesn't work and it's it's
technically correct but the way that
their reg xing or checking it doesn't
work and so you know especially for
these simple ones will want to make sure
that we like can capture all the
possibilities that or sat directions
specific enough like equal like set the
variable to equal five plus three that's
just simple reading instructions if
someone writes three plus five and they
keep you know failure well that's
because they didn't read the
instructions very clearly which down the
road is also another key important thing
for people to know how to do is like be
able to grasp information from from
documents or anything else and and be
able to apply those really quickly and
part of that is actually being able to
you know not miss those little things I
would think but actually and you got to
you have to pay attention to the details
now we don't want to to get frustrated
yeah that's like I'd say the key thing
the key task of the the waypoints is to
keep people going through them yeah to
not give them a reason to stop man
reasons to stop would be their board or
they're frustrated those are being two
different edges of the same issue like
like basically if you're bored because
you feel like you're being patronized by
being shown how to do basic arithmetic
but this program that reports to prepare
you for a job you know um and and of
course the frustrated would be like
you're trying to do basic arithmetic and
you can't even get that to work so
you're just like what the hell I'm going
to go and go surfing or whatever
so um yeah so there's a I mean we can we
can just keep going here and because i
can't get this method to work anyway and
i have no idea why it's not working
yassuh more time because so if we look
at oh actually i dunno why not text ok
here we go see so nice to be back yeah
it was good that we talked because like
another code for a second so three and
then we can even do three bag / + 5 that
should be true and then the problem here
is if we do three plus five suddenly
this is no longer going to work but if
we do for example x / S Plus which means
some indefinite number of spaces sweet
so so like that's what I was wondering
so someone with that can enter as many
spaces in between Oh or invalid regular
expression oh because I have double
double backslash okay there we go so so
like now I can take this whole and
include this as a test two so basically
expect and then our regular expression
and I can grow up the semicolon to be
true as code marico text be true I'm not
sure if that's the right number of
closing parenthesis
okay yeah it is so let's go ahead and
just test this real quick because I
think this will be this will be a
valuable pattern for forcing people to
actually like use the operations because
if they can just put eight and blow past
it and they don't learn from it then
that might come back to haunt them later
