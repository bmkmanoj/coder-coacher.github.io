I'm here to tell you how you can use the
control shortcuts throughout OS 10 to
radically improve your typing
productivity and save you a ton of time
first what you're going to want to do is
go to system preferences click keyboard
you should already have these cranked up
to the very top unless you have some
sort of a issue with repetitive stress
or and accessibility issue these should
be maxed out next go to modifier keys
caps lock key it's worthless who likes
caps locks well it's much better as
controlled because the control key is
normally in an awkward position and
you're going to need the control key in
order to perform these shortcuts so now
we've gotten rid of caps locks and turn
it into the control key swap caps as
they call it I'm going to show you how
these shortcuts work they're just a few
shortcuts that can be used everywhere
throughout OS 10 the first is ctrl f
which takes you forward seconds control
b which takes you backward control n
will take you to the next line control p
the previous line so right there you've
got all four of the arrow keys and
they're just completely worthless now
you can just do this from the home row
with your pinky on the caps lock key
next this is very cool there's no delete
key on the Mac keyboard for some reason
there's a delete key but it's actually
backspace well here's a real delete key
ctrl D will delete ctrl H will backspace
you can just quickly delete and
backspace stuff look at that lovely
dance okay so once you've done all that
stuff the other thing you're going to
want to know is that you can jump to the
beginning and the end of the line with
control a and control e very helpful
when you're working with large blocks of
text so where do these shortcuts come
from they came from bash which is the
terminal interface so if you do this in
bash type some stuff you can go to the
beginning of line you go to the end you
can go backwards you can go forward you
can delete backspace everything it's
really cool you can do p control
to go through previous commands trying
to go through forward through your
commands they work just like the arrow
keys except they're a lot more
convenient also you can do this in any
sort of system you can imagine you can
go in here and just type in gmail and
then BAM back forth delete the entire
line with control k super convenient so
I hope you'll use these bosch shortcut
keys with the control key i hope you'll
never use the cash locks key as a cash
box key again i hope you use it as a
control key and i hope that this will
save you an aggregate over the course of
your working life many hours of tedious
reaching for the arrow key</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
