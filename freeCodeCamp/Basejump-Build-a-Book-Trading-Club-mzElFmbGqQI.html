using a website let's take a look at
what this will look like first we need
to sign up all right and we're signed in
we can see that we have the settings
where we can change your password or add
some facts about ourselves which are
important if you're trading books right
you want to be able to meet in person or
you know have some sort of in-person
interaction so you can trust people so
we can go ahead and click all books and
we can see all these different books
that people is submitted and we can also
add our own books so let's go ahead and
just type the name of a book and it
found a book by that name so now we can
go to all books and we can see that my
book that I added abundance is right
here so I can create a trade request so
you can see that right now there are
zero trade requests outstanding but I
can come in here and let's say I want to
grab this World Book Encyclopedia I
click this button and now if i refresh
and go to all books you'll see that I
have one authentic trade request it's
the World Book Encyclopedia and if for
some reason I need to cancel that trade
request I can click that and I'm back
down to zero and then other people can
have trade requests for me so let's say
hypothetically we create a second
account we're just going to open another
incognito tab
and I'm going to need to login again
I'll create a new account alright and
now we can go in and we can look at the
outstanding books and I can choose that
abundance book and now I'm requesting
that that be traded so if I look at my
trade requests I see that abundance is
requested now let's say I go log back
into my old account so I've signed out
and now I'm going to sign back in
and I can see here's my abundance book
and I have a trade request and if I want
I can accept that trade request yay and
now I will trade with that person so as
you can see let me navigate back real
quick
there were several user stories that
were fulfilled and this is a little bit
more of a complicated crowd application
than we've done previously but basically
as an authenticated user I can view all
books posted by every other user as an
unauthenticated user as an authenticated
user I can add a new book which we did
as an authenticated user I can update my
settings to store my full name city and
state look at that and bonus has a knob
as an authenticated user I can propose a
trade and wait for the other user to
accept the trade which is what we did so
um this will be a lot of fun it doesn't
necessarily have to be a book trading
club you could trade skateboard decks
you could trade records whatever you
feel like trading we hope that you'll
build this enjoy it and maybe even find
a use for it the real purpose of this of
course is practice but there's nothing
like building something that real people
are actually using which will certainly
do later enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
