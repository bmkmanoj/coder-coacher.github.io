very awesome JavaScript developer Sasha
grief hey everybody
hi from Japan thank you so much for
joining us so let's kick things off
first of all you're in Osaka Japan yeah
here's a one I am wonderful city if
anybody if you ever make it to Japan you
have to hit Osaka they've got the most
fun and gregarious people so so how did
you end up in in Osaka take us back a
few years and how you got there
sure yeah I can yeah I'll give you some
background on what I'm doing now in
Osaka and how I ended up here so the
main reason why I moved here was that my
wife was actually doing her PhD here in
Osaka and she she just finished and you
know before that so originally um I
studied the computer science at
university so I kind of have this
technical background but I pretty soon
realized that I wasn't that into like
hardcore computer science and and very
theoretical problems and what I we liked
was more the visual side and the
interactive side of things so I kinda
became a self-taught designer and I was
doing a lot of UI design work for a
while I did a lot of freelancing working
with startups and then something I had
wanted to do for a long time was try
working on my own projects so we moved
to Japan about five years ago and it
turned out that was a really good time
for me to kind of you know turn a page
on my freelancing career and start this
this new career which isn't really a
career it is just what I do now where I
build side projects and you know
try different ideas and try to make a
living like that
yeah so you've been you've described
yourself as like a professional side
project builder and you've built so many
exciting side projects that I think a
lot of people in our audience will have
heard of one of the technologies you've
really done a lot of work around is
meteor Jas yeah and what yeah so what
drew you to it so I really like meteor
and yeah I spent a lot of time over the
past couple years working with it and by
the way I should mention that I don't
I'm not actually affiliated with the
major development group or or anything I
just you know really enjoy the
technology so whatever I say today like
don't take it as coming from the
official people that REM here um oh yeah
what I really liked about meteor at the
time well when I first started using it
I was you know still fresh off being a
more of a UI designer and you know I had
done some front-end work some jQuery
stuff but hadn't really done any like
real full stack work and meteor was
really cool because for the first time
at least for me you could just build
your whole app with one language data
script and with a single framework
um and that really appealed to me
because like a big barrier I had with
things like rails is that not only did I
have to learn all these new concepts
like routes and you know migrations or
like back-end stuff I didn't really know
anything about but I also had to learn
Ruby on top of that and you know it's
looking back okay Ruby it's not a bad
language or anything but at the time it
was just too much for me for my little
front end engineer brain and so when
meteor came along it was full JavaScript
that was really cool plus the whole
concept on having an all-in-one
framework with the the database just
worked and the accounts just worked that
was really magical yeah yeah and
year was famous because they had like
the the coolest little hello world like
basically I mean seconds you type like I
think it was like meteor up or something
like that and suddenly your website was
up on it would actually host websites as
well yeah yeah exactly they really
nailed the onboarding like developer
experience um and it was super appealing
I think you know to to this day I don't
think there's anything that comes close
to like the original meteor experience
you know now there's things like next
Jas there's also my own project which I
can talk about a bit later but still I
think meteor is you know probably for a
long time it will be like one of the
pioneers of this kind of you know super
easy onboarding yeah and you had some
I'm sorry go ahead
yeah oh go go ahead sorry I was gonna
say um if you if anyone watching has
tried to learn meteor there's a very
good chance that you've heard of Sasha's
book called discovering meteor right so
what ended up happening is um the reason
I wanted to learn meteor was to build a
project that ended up becoming a sidebar
which you can find at sidebar dot IO
it's like a newsletter of design links
but to build that so I learned meteor
and then um I got a lot of help from a
developer called
tom coleman who was just you know also
like me just discovering meteor at the
time and we he was hanging out a lot on
our sea and so we ended up building this
open source app called telescope
together to kind of support what became
sidebar and so what happened is we spend
so much time you know kind of working on
this and learning all this cool stuff
about meteor we realized welders we we
know that this stuff and there's nobody
else that really has dug as deep as we
have you know outside of course of the
your company and so why not write a book
to kind of share that knowledge with
everybody else and so that book was
discover meteor and they did really well
and I think that to this day it's one of
the main meteor books even though it's a
bit out of date now but it is still you
know selling a little bit and people
yeah every time I meet meteor developers
uh there's a good chance they've read
discover me here and now of course
you're building your new tool which I
really want to learn more about
personally a Vulcan Jas named after our
favorite Star Trek yeah yeah um so as I
was saying I I build this open source
app named telescope with meteor and that
was kind of the the genesis of the book
as well because we reinvested what we
learned building that app in the book
and the concept behind telescope was
basically uh an open-source hacker news
or producthunt app so you could build
your own product hunt for cars or
watches or sports you know whatever your
interest was it was a really easy way to
deploy your own community basically and
so I work on that so I launched that
maybe was it four years ago yeah and I
kept working I kept iterating eventually
I realized that the really valuable part
in that that app wasn't so much the
features it was the underlying
infrastructure the framework part and so
you know did like how 37signals dated
Basecamp and then they extracted Rails
out of that and because they knew it was
it could be valuable to other people so
we're doing something a bit similar with
Telescope we're wearing we we're trying
to extract out the core and that's what
we called Vulcan so we've
with recently that kind of a soft launch
so there's are very minimal homepage you
can find at Vulcan jazz org and the idea
here is really to to recreate the
original meteor experience where
everything just works out of the box
except this time with the the more
modern tools you know of the JavaScript
ecosystem so things like react
relax graph QL Apolo and these are all
really powerful tools and really
flexible tools but they have a I think
it's fair to say I have a higher
learning curve compared to the original
media revision at least and so yeah yeah
you're just just to put things in
perspective meteor was like as simple as
you can make javascript in my opinion
like I experimented with it I went to a
hackathon I built the hackathon project
with it and it was just incredibly easy
to pick up it really did take like this
huge open field of different JavaScript
libraries and kind of wrangled them
together into like here are a few quick
quick tools that work well together
exactly like what you were saying you
made the comparison with Ruby on Rails
and how that tied the Ruby ecosystem
together into one unified framework yeah
I mean you know about JavaScript fatigue
and I think it's part of it is a bit of
a meme and it's kind of trendy to talk
about that but there's kind of some
truth to it in the sense that we went
from like oh let's use jQuery to
welder's web pack and babble and where
your transpiling your javascript and
your you know using typescript and you
know just a couple of years so it's like
javascript is all grown up now but the
people who were used to jQuery they're
kinda lost now and even with meteor I
think the same thing is happening with
the meteor community like the people who
like me actually were really seduced by
this original vision of an all-in-one
framework can be a bit lost in the new
world of like grown-up JavaScript
so yeah Vulcan is really trying to
bridge that gap and you know you have
the older tools and the power of
reactant redox and so on but at the same
time you're not really um thrown like
headfirst into the deep end of the pool
yeah so talk about the development of
this like how are you going about
building Vulcan how did you choose the
specific tools you mentioned graph QL
which is something I'm extremely excited
about but I can totally see if you
haven't if you're a new developer trying
to dive directly into graph QL would be
a pretty big jump because you know it's
it's like rest and graph databases and
and databases themselves all kind of
rolled into one tool yeah so I'm
actually following the lead of Tom so
MDG the meteor development group is the
company behind a meteor framework and
their new project is called a polo and
it's actually a graph QL client and
server so it's a set a tool Teeter on
graph QL and like they're really smart
people so I saw that they were getting
into the graph QL space I started
looking into it and so I'm kind of
feeling a lead in the sense that I also
adopted Apollo inside the first
telescope and now Volken and a graphical
is really really cool like um I really
like the idea of having this kind of
standard syntax standard format and
standard pattern of querying data from
the client because you know okay I guess
rest is a bit like that but it's no not
quite like graph QL in the sense that
you have to write a lot of custom code
whereas graph QL you really have these
patterns you have your mutations you
have your reason overs and especially
like what we've trying been trying to do
in Vulcan is give you these presets
where as we tell you okay a resolver for
example is a the you can think of it as
an endpoint for a specific
set up data so for example you have a
resolver for a list of documents and so
in Vulcan we can have these uh these
blanks that you just fill in with your
own code and then it just works it
creates the whole data layer for you all
so it's probably something very abstract
right now but the idea is really to have
that only one aspect but at the same
time based on standards right and and
not to be like not try to lock you in
but on the other hand try to almost
teach you like you know here's okay
here's how here's our way of doing
things
but if you follow that you'll find out
that actually it leads to like the
broader ecosystem because it's kind of
an introduction okay so just to be clear
by using the Vulcan framework it'll
provide kind of a nice smooth learning
curve for some of these technologies
like graph QL yeah
because for example so Apollo is powered
by Redux on the client so all the data
is stored in Redux so even if you've got
literally nothing about redox you can
still use the Redux dev tools to inspect
your client-side data and at some point
you want to go a bit further above that
and then you can start using like the
actual relax api's and you're not
starting from scratch because you
already know kind of how we duct works
and the concepts and I really like this
approach like where it's like you have
these these tools that you can use and
you don't really need to know how they
work but at least they're already the
right tools if you do want to go further
along right so so that's a very good
point about um what you're doing with
fokin it's it's like if you want to
leave volkens
uh framework at some point you're
already very well equipped to be able to
go out and function exactly yeah the
wild world of JavaScript and that was a
bit with people were complaining about
with the original meteor right because
it was super easy to get started but
originally at least it had its own
front-end framework it had its own data
layer its own account system
and they were all really meshed together
which which was good on one hand but
then you couldn't really transfer that
knowledge to nonlinear apps and since
you know these days I think it's much
more sensible to use react Redux graph
QL Apollo and if so by the way Vulcans
still use a meteor but the skills that
you will learn by using Vulcan are much
more easily transferable to other
platforms other stacks awesome and so
when you say you're working on on Vulcan
tell us a little bit about the day to
day like what are some of the current
technical challenges what are you who
are you working with
how many contributors are are there yeah
what what's what's it like day-to-day
working on Vulcan yeah so um you know I
think every open-source project is
different but at least for Vulcan we
have soldiers me team member in France
Xavier and there's some some really
really prolific contributor in China
comas and there's you know other lots I
mean obviously I can't name everybody
but there's a lot of other people
throughout the world that report bugs on
build our own projects and by the way if
you're listening to this and you're
thinking about the open source project
like contributing code is isn't by any
means the only way of actually
contributing you know like you can
report bugs that's one way you can write
documentation right tutorials so on it's
all super important for for healthy
open-source project it's like a plant in
a way you know you need kind of you need
sign you need water you need nutrients
it's not about just putting the plant
under a lamp and and that's it so I
think a mistake off first-time
open-source maintainer --zz make is they
focus too much on one single thing like
oh I'm going to get a hub but if you get
five
and stars but you're still the only
person contributing code and then the
product won't be sustainable so that's
something I learned the hard way
I think we're wrong you know the first
first version of telescope was pretty
well-received but I never really managed
to attract other contributors and so
this time around I'm trying to maybe
listen more to what developers need and
can go towards them more it's tough just
being like oh I'm gonna be number one or
product or whatever because that that's
a nice ego boost but are you going to
really attract the people who can really
help you um it might not always be the
case you know yeah I can totally agree
with that I see so many people who are
swinging for the fences as we say in the
u.s. football term and they're really
trying to like just go heads down and do
whatever they need to do and kind of a
burnout along the way uh but if you have
if you focus instead on building a kind
of a very stable team of contributors
then you'll have a lot more staying
power and that's the name of the game I
mean if DHH had sat down and said I'm
gonna build rails and just built it real
quick and walked away from it then he
probably would have died it needed his
continuing work and it need the
community that he was able to build
around it to sustain itself yeah I think
we got kind of a warped view from like
the startup ecosystem where you know
people talk about 10%
I don't grow like month over month or
something really good just like that and
if you wanna you can't you can compare
that with your current situation if you
don't have the funding you don't if
you're not in the bay area you have to
be in it much more for the long game
right so you have to be like okay does
this make sense on a tenure basis and
not on a ten month basis for example
yeah at least that's how you know for
now that's how I see my own situation
I'm in Japan I'm not making any money at
least not from Vulcan right now I can't
hire anybody so it's a very different
approach where I'm trying to be like
sustainable and people be happy to
contribute rather than just running
after uh growth and likes and stars and
and metrics yeah all those things you
said are good for your ego but not good
for your long-term uh your long-term
viability oh and speaking of making
those kinds of decisions and getting
finding contributors to surround you and
being sustainable choosing technology
that is going to be sustained and isn't
just like the the new hotness that is
going to come and go you've written this
amazing amazing guide that first of all
it's worth going and checking it out
just for the web design alone it's
beautiful never seen a survey survey
result page that this beautiful but you
wrote this amazing report called the
state of JavaScript in 2016 and it goes
through and it chronicles how all these
different technologies are doing and
what people perceive about the relative
strengths and weaknesses can you talk
about that a little bit and what
inspired you to build that yeah so you
know what inspired me was like I was
talking about before the that Tran off
complaining about JavaScript fatigue it
was pretty obvious to me that there was
a real like um you know it was a real
meme going around and people were really
when ur wrong or right they were really
feeling that so um I wanted to build a
survey just first of all for myself but
also for these people to try and figure
out well is it as bad as people say is
it is the ecosystem that fragmented or
is there actually kind of an easy answer
to most questions and I think there is a
pretty easy answer like react is kind of
the default answer these days and if not
react maybe view so
I feel like those two are pretty safe
bats because you know what happens if
you're a developer is you come hacker
news and you're like oh there's a new
framework that faster can react and
smaller than you and then the next day
oh there's a new framework that's like
faster and smaller than the one before
and you get this false sense that that's
so fast and leaving you behind and
there's no you can keep up but actually
you can't really compare like a
framework like that and react which is
maintained by Facebook and has you know
thousands or hundred thousands however
many users a huge ecosystem so Michael
is the story way was and I don't want to
put down like smaller frameworks by the
way um but it's just like you know let's
find out who is actually using what and
are people happy with it and is we are
going to go away in six months because
you do read things like that like oh
yeah react is just the latest flavor of
the day yeah unfortunately those kinds
of grand statements always pull in lots
of readers and they always do like up
whenever I go to hacker news without
fail I'll see some article basically
just shredding some framework and saying
oh it's going to die soon or whatever
and you know people have been saying the
same thing about jQuery for years jQuery
is dead and you look at it and it's
still got a ridiculously good install
base and you know and I think I think
their survey results show that least to
me that reacted on going anywhere like
because the main thing I wanted to know
is not only how many people use a
technology but already happy with it
because something like angular for
example huge is the base but you also
hear a lot of complaints about it and
most developers would rather use
something else for their next projects
and on the other hand react in view it
was very clear that people are happy
with them and they do enjoy using them
and so that was really the most striking
thing for me from that survey is it is
not all equal isn't all bad some
frameworks do
had like staying power because their
user believed these are not actually
enjoy writing JavaScript apps with them
yeah so do you think that like developer
experiences people have been calling it
do you think that that's the main
determinant of whether people will
continue to use it because I know jQuery
people loved using jQuery when it came
out is pretty easy to pick up powerful
and now react pretty easy to pick up
very powerful do you think that that
developer experience is the number one
factor how would you rate the overall
factors of what makes developers stick
with the technology um yeah that's a
great question
I think there's a lot of factors like I
think first of all you shouldn't
underestimate like the importance of the
actual technology on react is not the
most performant framework anymore but
it's still pretty good and they're
actually rewriting it with like it's new
react fiber thing and so you know the
team behind react is like it's hard to
find better engineers like you know like
or same thing with Redux and then
abramoff all these guys they're like
they're not just some random people who
are their own favorite like like me like
actual software engineers working for
Facebook so that's super important you
know they're not gonna you know mislead
you into using bad patterns right yeah
they've got a lot of time and over their
shoulder yeah and based based on that
you know the ecosystem order enough
packages to do what you want um and of
people writing about it writing
tutorials documentation you know sites
like egghead for example which have like
great video content so it's really like
a whole set of factors but I think react
it was I remember I think I saw that the
first react demo like years and years
ago and um like I was in San Francisco
randomly and I so I met one of the
reactive lovers and like he was talking
about performance right and he wasn't so
it was clear from the start that their
focus was really on performance on
scalability on all these things that are
still really important right and as you
said like even react isn't as performant
as you can get there's so there's like
this it's almost kind of like a like you
imagine like this kind of diamonds where
things trade off and there's like a
certain amount of surface area and
sometimes you know in sacrificing
performance you're sacrificing or in
trying to boost performance you're
sacrificing readability we're trying to
boost the value like the number of
different things you can do you're
sacrificing the ability to onboard
people do you think that there's like a
meta that like no framework is going to
be able to be absolutely better just
because of inherent trade-offs oh yeah
for sure I mean you know a lot of these
really performant frameworks sometimes
they don't support older browsers as
well that's why how they can get away
with being faster um but the important
thing is having something that's like
good enough right sometimes it's it's
can be a mistake to over optimize
because at some point you're just
diminishing returns and like 8020 law
and all that you reach a point where is
it really really going to make a
difference if I use a free act instead
of react and maybe it does for your
specific use case but I would say most
of the time you can probably just use
react all right well that's kind of been
our philosophy free code camp like we're
using react we're currently rebuilding
our entire platform to run on react and
make it all a single-page app and
everything and it seems like react is
just kind of the go-to tool and Redux is
emerges the go-to way of managing state
and everything and uh as a result like a
lot of this JavaScript fatigue may kind
of go away hopefully as people just
converge on certain sects like happened
with Python to some extent and happen
with Ruby for sure I don't think people
complaining about it will ever go away
but hopefully the the thing itself will
go away like the yeah yeah I think
that's what's happening there's some
it's always like I said there's a
prettier look like just explosion with
with tons of alternatives and then it
kind of settles down into a more defined
meta I guess
are you planning I like to play it on
I'm sorry go ahead I was I like to play
hearthstone so I'm a big hair stone
player and it's the same thing when new
cards come out like people play all
kinds of crazy combinations and then it
settles down and everybody is playing
the same decks so I think the same thing
can be said about frameworks yeah and a
lot of games have kind of that
rock-scissors-paper like like certain
approaches certain strategies or
stronger against other strategies than
they are you know some strategy so
there's always kind of like a like a
ecosystem of one animal eats this animal
this animal eats this animal kind of the
meta is gray I'm glad you're familiar
with the term I kind of threw it out and
I wasn't sure um but but yeah that's
great that that you're you're playing
hearthstone and you're familiar with a
lot of those concepts a lot of these
games they're just constantly
introducing new features that that
really force you to be on your toes and
constantly learning yeah it's a good
training to be a JavaScript developer
for sure so are you planning to do a
state of JavaScript for 2017 as well is
that something you're considering during
oh yeah yeah I'd like to do that I'll
probably wait yeah to do and do it at
about the same time as last year so like
next September maybe um you know just I
feel right now the result would still be
pretty similar I don't know off like
major developments in the JavaScript
world so I want to give it a little bit
more time um maybe also I don't know if
I should build like my own survey system
or something because last time it was a
bit painful to set out the I don't know
how many questions they were there were
a lot so using like an online forum
I was a bit slow and a bit thankful to
do yeah I can tell you that we're doing
a survey right now actually if you're
you're watching this check it out free
code camps 2017 new coder survey I'll
link to it below but basically we're
we've interviewed I think so far about
17,000 people we're using the hype form
so tight form is like Google you can do
this with Google Forms to with high form
it's got really good conditional logic
and it's got like built-in reports and
everything it's it's like 35 bucks a
month
so basically 35 bucks a month to use
type form instead of just using the free
Google Forms it's what we're paying but
you might try that that's just like
that's what I use actually oh there's
only whole yeah it's a great experience
there's this really slow to use their
back-end like their admin thing once you
have you know 80 questions or I don't
know column how many I had it just you
know slows down to a crawl and yeah I
think some of that though may just be
innately complicated when she is that
big of us with that much branching logic
and everything I was gonna say they
should use react maybe maybe you should
tweet at them and recommend maybe they
could try a Vulcan or somehow we good
maybe yeah let's get that here ah so
where can people find you online so you
can find me on twitter at sasha grief as
a CH a GRE i f aha there's also my
personal side static grief calm which
address redesign and I just realized
today it's already out update because
until points tubular old telescope
homepage instead of the more recent
Vulcan homepage and other than that you
know I'm always hanging out in the
Vulcan slack chat room or the Apollo
slack chat room so those are also good
places to find me and yeah I'm not
really hard to find if people want to
get in touch I'm sure they can awesome
whoa i thrilled that you came on I'm
thrilled you've wrote written
all these amazing medium articles which
are so helpful for people who are new to
react and new to JavaScript in general
where we hope to continue to publish
your awesome articles on our medium
publication and we're very excited about
the future of Vulcan and I'm excited to
try it out at some point yeah yeah I'm
actually giving like one-on-one live
demonstrations these days so if if
anybody listening to this you know wants
to learn more you can thank me and then
we can jump on skype and I can walk you
through for the framework well if you
ever get a chance to livestream those
I'd be very interested in watching them
as well
you could build up a lot of YouTube
