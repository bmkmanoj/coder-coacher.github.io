the description lick I asked you to do
the heavy speaking so because ma ok
that's fine my boys could be choppy he
goes okay okay so on the description
Fliss says make a function that looks
through a list and take the first
argument and returns an array of all
objects that have equivalent property
values coming from the second argument
and that is all the information we get
for this um every time I do a challenge
I like to run the code first and see
what kind of results were looking for so
if we look here this would be the first
argument and this is what we can expect
to get passed in then this is the second
argument yeah we also can see that that
could be that could be more than than
one value correct so in this case we
have a and B and no not just a pass it
is only yeah people we can also get
integers and not just names on we
compare these the same no a triple equal
sign should should work for either an
integer or string but we do have to take
notice this one does have two of them
whereas this one we're only going to
have actually this will have to as well
so we need to make sure both keys from
the object are equal
so Chris what do you think we should do
to get started vote what would be our
first step well I think after our first
step should be a ghost right away to to
feel the deep neck and sight of we cook
a a map or maybe another a 0 e in the
stars object okay it was a little hard
to understand you there um but what we
should do I i think is we should we're
gonna have to loop to the first argument
I think and check it with all the source
arguments so I'm more partial to using
us I gonna do a loop I do I was thinking
a lot of mapping a through the
collection okay okay that's that's good
a good way to do it to you want to show
I'm gonna show you thought process and
start typing sure yeah I first well I
goes define many more variables so it's
more clear okay I'm just chaining sup
okay that's good and to keep in mind
it's always very good to name your
variables as close to what they are as
you can get them that way later on as
you go to the program or if you're doing
a bigger size program if you ever have
to go back to visit your code it's
easier to understand what you were doing
or if you have to share code like we are
doing now we both understand what the
different variables doin are
now our two variables that are getting
passed in their objects you can see this
by the curly bracket a curly bracket
signifies an object so if you look down
here this is an object here now it's
being passed inside of an array so from
this square bracket which signifies an
array all the way down to this square
bracket that's an entire array now
inside each of these this array for each
element we have an object by the curly
brackets so we can see we have one two
three elements in this array good kick
okay go ahead Chris yeah I can see that
well now we have a an array with the
keys that will be our filter for our
source collection or yeah for our
collection value ok and now now we can
do a field a row I was going to say here
he used um you can use object takis on
any kind of object and this will return
an array of keys that are in there and
for here the keys say for this one here
which he called on source it only has
one odd one key in it and that's last so
he's going to get an array yeah with
just the string last ok go ahead
yeah now was thinking of a filtering the
collection array since the scenario
would object and and we put that in a
result that will be all
Chloe I use the dissonance
this is just a person's or no this is
just objects I won't call it person
and another will filtering we have to
apply a parameter so we either pass the
object to the result or filtering okay
and now what he's doing here he's
calling a filter on collection and with
filter you you can run some sort of
function inside of it and what is going
to do it's almost the same thing as a
for loop it's going to take time turns
and pass each element of the array which
is this object through it one at a time
and it's going to return true or false
if it's true it keeps it and it's going
to store it in the result if it's false
it's going to discard it and we're not
going to need it or use it so object is
going to be the subject here yeah and
now you have to run ooh our source keys
and compare them to what a inside the
object to see if they're there are both
known about word but the same number of
kids and all are the same a vault in the
Dodger resource we have to make an
iteration again
that could be made with a 4 which may be
or with a holy loop I always prefer the
I traitors so this case able to uh a
source keys
okay so we want to iterate hilton okay
yeah okay based on twitter I'll Celtic
okay so hit them okay so we're going to
iterate through all the source keys
because if we look yeah on the left oh
we can have multiple source keys we can
have a or we can have beef I've seen in
one of our other tests so we need to
make sure we can't just call element 0
or to get the first key and expect it to
be correct we need to take an account
there can be multiple keys and I will
define a variable that we look at us or
return balloon value I would call it may
be classic boss I don't know if if
there's more expressive name for this is
just a storage for our value that
started us on define which is full C and
okay so this trick this district start
true
and if I find that any of the source
kiss doesn't correlate with it or object
I will set it to false okay so we want
to double check to make sure all our
source keys are existent in the
collection is that we're saying yeah
okay yeah what I said Oh in this case we
have or sauce and now remember and for
each now yeah innocent innocent there
anything yeah okay now we want to
remember this object variable it does
get passed through we can access it from
inside the source keys function yeah I
know Oh soul
we can call it just by keys right okay
go ahead and we know you have the key
but we have to compare against the
values so i'm guessing source key and
this is causing people to our object
king
then he said fast Falls
and this should be or filter
and that should feel threatened it
should be
oh i just put any air or well let's just
run it and then we can debug it from
there yeah so if we run the code we get
nothing nothing is passed back at all
the filter okay we passed it are we
busted okay each object and passing is
set to true but for each e in source
keys if our source which will be
available doesn't equal or object with
the same key salad pasta sauce I don't
think we right here
yeah that you really don't wanna pass or
or otherwise it will always because
right so now let's see what happens if
you run it we still nothing happens Ilyn
enter so let's see result function
oh I think I'm gonna put this too high
up No Oh mom please it's all right
barsky's reach doing mushky your sauce I
I feel like we're not returning I feel
like we're not returning something here
let's see ah yeah I think that we have
to return now this is just under the
forage so all participants it's I should
be down there yeah ok now let's now
before we go on let's go back and go
just go over there everything again that
way we can clear up yeah so what we're
going to do we on this one we don't need
we need to get all the keys in our
source that way we need so we can
compare them so we need to get going
through our object we need to use object
our keys and this will pull all the keys
out so last it'll get us last and say we
had something else like something it
would give us last an animal but that
that way that's what object keys does it
pulls all the keys out of the object we
pass through it so now we want to take
our collection and we want to go through
it that's what filters lets it do what
filter does is it'll iterate through
every element in whatever you pass
through to it and return if it's true
it'll return that into whatever variable
you have it assigned so this collection
will go through and we'll start here
and it says we're using a flag here now
we're going to get past this and this is
going to go through another source keys
it says hey does last the key equal the
last key here so it's saying this
montegut equal kappa let if it does it
if it does it's good it goes through and
since this is set the true they'll
return it however if it doesn't if it's
false pass gets change the false and
this fails so then it does not get our
object does not get stored in our result
and this will look through every single
element in an array and compare it and
make sure all the things here it does
the same thing for other test case and
this is our method that lets us have
multiple keys in the source file ok yeah
do you have anything to say on that
subject it's bleep no I think it's
pretty straightforward I think I it
could be done maybe shorter if we just
return false instead of is setting the
flag and that should say goes maybe two
lines of code which I don't think it's
relevant and it's maybe better to be
readable babe its settings basically
what we're a testing against and what we
do when we find a cut a case that that
we don't like right so what he's saying
is we can remove this if at any time we
reach
a false inner thing we know it fails so
without a doubt we can we can fail it
but but that will only that will own me
I think if that only a return false for
the porridge no or it shouldn't be
expecting a return no it doesn't really
expect the region so that God woman
won't work either yeah it didn't like
that too because yeah but because it's
what the reason that didn't work is
because it checks this one then it fails
and it's returning to soon we get
involved I think that adoration can be
ray looking hmm i believe the flag is
the best is the best way to go about it
because that way i think it might be
more readable and you could help
understand it i think i always like to
use flags you can shorten it down but
shorter code does not always mean
cleaner or more readable code so so some
people like to take shortcuts and kind
of smash it down as small as you want
they can that's not always the best way
okay so let's go check out the next
bonfire let's go to the next one
oh I've already completed this one so um
hey that's right I have no please hey I
have a list of them all open over here
let me find it yeah
okay and the next one in this series is
called seek and destroy with this one is
asking us to do is remove all variables
from the last arguments from an array
the first argument and return as a new
array so what it wants us to do is go
through this array we get and remove it
so it'd be like one okay that passes
that's the new array then we get to 20
two matches here get rid of it now we go
to the next array 30 three matches one
of our arguments get rid of it one let's
add one two and three don't so this
would be what we're looking forward to
do so like I said before we always want
to run run it and see what kind of
values is expecting or what other
arguments we might be looking to get
because you never know when they're
going to throw a curveball and you might
have to take something into
consideration so now that we know yeah
and I think Peters is it's harder than
than doing them right from the start
yeah so I always feel it's a good good
way to just go through and check so if
you notice
one argument to augment three are events
but we only have one argument up here a
bra in this case in this case it will be
a thing that the discs but and now they
can they can pass yeah they they are
possible a only two arguments Utley but
the the purpose of this should be being
able to handle and undefined number of
having yeah we take as many arguments as
possible so javascript has a nice little
I believe it's called like a global
variable arguments this is the same
thing as these so when you have like our
are too
rs3 but you don't know how many there
are if you use arguments it's an array
of all the arguments passed to that
method so this lets you what it's not an
array but an RA lack object that is it's
good to have clear since you can apply
the most the most of methods the annari
government's okay but we know the first
one is going to be an array of an array
of numbers that we're going to need to
use so can you think of a good name to
call this week on any collection this
kind of stuff oh okay not true so ready
but I think so we know the first index
zero is always going to be the number
the array of numbers that we're going to
remove from so this is what we're going
to prune away from so we're going to
check if two is in here threes in here
and then the rest
we can iterate through so we're going to
want to create a return array we can get
rid of these and but yeah but how are
you going to get the rest of the
arguments was a good thing about this
cause arguments we can iterate over it
so if we do something like
no matter so what this lets us do no
matter how many elements are passed
through to our function we will be able
to handle that because we're going to
iterate over the rest of them so we can
have as little as none we can only have
our main array which would not would
defeat the purpose of this dysfunction
or we could have up to like ten thousand
million whatever number you want to use
it as but now somebody in the chat just
point it out we can you shift to get
just the first argument of the array and
that's very correct we I don't like to
modify this it's Elma or you can you
can't do gangis a the game just a shift
because argument is not an array you can
make a copy of the argument subject and
put it into an array you see an slice
for example and that that would be
another middle to do it but first let's
go to this one you've seen follow these
it's also the faster one if you
benchmark it and so it's not it's not
wrong to do it this way okay but do
taking notice somebody is saying we can
just shift this the first element off
and i would suggest everybody who's not
completely familiar with javascript to
go over to the mdn
over here and all the methods you could
think of that will that exists inside
JavaScript you can find here so like
somebody said shift shift is used on an
array so we can see it here we can go
through and read what this does how it
works we could see some examples of it
in use so if you're just starting out to
javascript i would highly suggest going
over to the mdn you can find it by just
typing at mtm JavaScript into Google and
then just go over and read some of these
just understand what they do and how
they work okay so now back to here well
it's visible yeah but for you do the
exercise okay so now we got control over
the rest of the argument and we're going
to loop through so what we want to do is
we want to compare if this equals
anything in here now how would we do
that I I suggest using another array
now we want to do collection darlinks
and now with this for loop will do
let's just kind of line break this
okay so now we can compare so if
collection why does not equal home this
could lead us into a problem because we
can can get okay let's use a
and what's the platform in case we don't
that that okay you're right I felt like
we were going to get multiple six
sessions so if collection does not equal
arguments and arguments is X we want to
take our return array and push our
collection is Ella creative yeah it
looks lipstick return react a push
collection yeah yeah arguments so i
spelled arguments wrong well it's okay i
would enhance a diaper so let's not work
i what am i doing wrong here let's go
back and look and then decide to be gone
yeah uh maybe I think I saw a thick no
it's not maybe i might have my loops
backwards maybe we should move to the
collection of aden can pick one yeah
let's let's flip through the collection
homes right
no let me check inside ya turned
everything backwards like a good kind of
lost what did it I shot around so you're
starting to look the over the collection
which is arguments 0 that's again then
and I wait this class 3 &amp;amp; 4 x star
impaired one and arguments to them
except I the if collection y which is a
is different no this I feel like which
is the flag like iris during before yeah
yeah it because this way you will be
passing the the value multiple times if
it's not the same as the asanas the day
arguments and after you look through all
of them if the flats of air is through
your door Adam I understand now what you
learned okay
ok so does not like that good rod and
let's be honest mmm yeah i'm just so i'm
just out of fun yeah yeah
oh ok so let's go over that cuz I did
cry I did a lot of things right there I
won't lie to you I'm not big fan of
nested for loops I think the I like
mortals the functional style where you
chain map and for each and mem fighter
tonight iterators instead of doing four
loops because I think us every time you
add something inside a loop you had a
complexity on how to read it so you have
a four and A four then an eve and each
other and at that point I already
starting to go through each iteration to
understand what's happening ok did you
have a good point so let's go over and
do it again but this time we'll use only
functional programming yeah babe but
also a yes yeah also a what would you
work with the arguments it's often
recommended that you do as someone is in
the chat set the that first to make a
clone of the arguments so you don't
touch the divided as RS and others are
passed by a reference or not not say you
cool in you could be ending in modifying
the arguments a and you don't want them
oh you say you don't say only like new
arguments ok I agree to assign it to the
new variable variable
this should be a setup
in the second and acting I have the
right syntax let me check with our
public age posted some under God we can
always it's reset it it's a good yep so
now we have a clone of our arguments and
now we can do what what they say which
is shifting the the first program it's
the first rally of that of that array
now that we have a problem area and you
can say that is
hey now so now we have all all of our
values in new arguments and all the
target array in collection direct and
now do you want to demonstrate how you
would use you could either use map or
filter it sure in this case now we have
almost the same as the first exercise
but only is simple because we don't have
to search inside of the objects we have
an arrow right away which is new
arguments a and we can do filter
and now remember what filter does if it
gets inside filter gets returned true it
passes it back and saves it to our new
variable or if it's false it discards it
and and now we will say time since we
will be returning an array from this and
we don't need an affirmation of variable
or our result oh well one you just
return what we get from filtering the
regular way correct like last time we
days days last time what we did is we
saved it to a variable and then we just
returned that variable what is saying
now is we can just shorten it and return
the result directly because new
arguments that filter will pass back the
result okay and now what I'm doing as a
filtering function is that we searched
new arguments with cheese or or
filtering numbers array and if we find
the number we know we should be it is
salsa so if we if we don't find it we
don't we pass it as true but is what is
it 0 or greater than 0 in delray we
don't return ok so what index of does is
it's like sort of like a contains
function it says hey if this exists in
here return the index of it so 0 1 2 3 4
5 so if you would search for say two
it's going to return the first time it
runs into two so will return one however
if we searched hear it said five and we
searched say like this so this index of
five it would return negative one
because it did not find that the five in
here so it has no index so negative one
so if it's less than zero it has to be
negative one
and since he's comparative like us that
values lynn i wish the values less than
zero we're treated as policy as I'm used
to in see but in this case on this zero
is threaded of a small spot less than
zero a means one is treated as true so
you have to add the the condition of
that is less than zero and not just the
value as you will do in some other
language okay um you didn't return
anything so let's see filter I you know
waited function I loved ones and it's so
we see in time
oh I is collection yeah the parameter ok
now how it should pass before you click
on that let's just so what we're doing
is we go calling on collection one
second please sure so we're calling on
collection we're saying filter
everything that does not equal this and
what this is check in it's checking if I
here is inside of new arguments if it is
return true and return that that number
so it checks is one in here no it's
tuner well backwards from what I was
saying it's two in here yes so don't
return it
you
right so if you have any comments I see
the drinks in this way is kind of
cleaner than doing it the other way yeah
yeah this is a little cleaner I filter
not probably the better way to go I'm
just used to using like more things like
Java and C++ Wilson yeah c++ where you
don't know how why don't use a filter
and never use a filter before until I
got to JavaScript ok so the next one is
going to be where do I belong
ok
and now what this is going to do return
the lowest index at which a value the
second argument should be inserted into
an array the first argument so pretty
much what it's asking where do I put
this number inside this array so it fits
so remember your next search is 0 so it
would be 0 1 now you want to put this
for the 60 because 40 50 60 is the order
so it should be one and now these are
our test cases and what is expected of
us so 30 yeah in this case it yeah and
its 200-day yeah yep now it is too yeah
so in this case if the 34 is 0-1 just at
a yeah it's see okay yeah cuz it's that
should be the new variable because 40
should get pushed up okay it's the index
index that wheel then your vehicle will
occupy on the on the new or our way
okay so how should we go over this no
matter what are you are your thoughts
about this and I'm always thinking about
using some some of the principal
iterator with which our origin MapReduce
and filter I if I don't find a way to it
you see that once i switch to other
brother medals lower latency I think
this would be made with only one forage
and one storage for the ingles so you're
suggesting with you use a for loop in
this case it because it would be better
using for loop cease using one of the
actuators means you do kind of trying
out to go over all of the connection but
if we start from the first element we
only have to go through the element that
interests us so it is the first one
there's there's no need to go through
all of the re to say to seek for the
corresponding index that we are trying
to insert their the value writing this
dispute this is better if we will need
to make it a recent problem
okay so
okay so if our number is less than
mmm
yeah we only need one wrong button I
think well in case say it say ur number
is 70 then we're gonna it's not gonna
return anything I'll just crash I don't
think it exhausting or so like that oh
yeah okay so this one this fells so 30
equal to ml need sequel in three yep
it's a maybe it's easy if it's less or
people then okay yeah so all we're doing
is we're looping through our array and
we're checking is 50 less than 40 no
bump the index up by one and check again
is 50 less than 60 yes so since we're
index one that should be 50 s new home
at index 1 and everything else should
get shifted back yeah well into the chat
a mega this is is telling us to use for
for each instead of a for loop once
again okay native methods for mapping
and filtering contrary to what one might
think are very slow like a hundred times
or a thousand times slower than doing a
for loop okay Oh for very simple things
it is better to use a for loop then
using foliage or or another kind of or
iOS iterator unless you yeah I also want
to point out if you use it for each
you're going to need some sort of
counter as well so then you're going to
need to add add something like ver X
before your for each and then
increment it every time you loop through
because here I'm using that that
iterator to help me keep track of where
indexes are with a for each I don't get
this variable so I'd have to create it
myself and use it but by incrementing it
and setting it to 0 in the beginning so
we can move that's fine this one was
very easy ok oh this one is where do I
belong so the next one is some all
numbers in a range ok so now little this
is saying will pass you an array of two
numbers return the sum of those two
numbers and all numbers in between them
the lowest number will not always come
first so right there that is one thing
we need to always check we need to make
sure we have the lowest number in the
constant same spot so we're going to
have to declare our two variables and I
say we set the lowest one two variable
lowest with a conditional statement in
the highest variable highest i think i
did did this one we maybe can I try it
on geroge sure i think i dont i dont
this one like how sometimes where is the
one of the methods i I don't see often
is using
at the just follow but for a range which
they could be scrambled and we will have
golfers and one second we could we can
use mad a we can say get it Adam inning
value from run from our array and now a
final available then give us our limiter
the max value from a rock from our aid
and first we have to nigga an
accumulator which is
ok I know I'm right here oh you're gonna
want to change this hey yeah I so you're
still here to while yet so big ok and ok
ok then a simple
c100 the number Oh possible Matt mini
pie are not supply our own home and see
anything wrong here well I think now
would be a great time to pull up n DN
and let's look up Matt
I know I know what happened okay is i'm
i missing a parameter here okay i just
remember apply it takes a context
parameter first and since we don't need
it we can pass null and okay yeah it was
okay now yeah what he's doing here is
normally you would do for conditional if
r0 is bigger than our one then you would
set our one to the highest else you
would set our zero to the highest and
vice versa r 0 to the lowest and r12 the
loss however he's using a nifty little
function here math dot men any supplying
it to arguments the array and it's
returning the lowest number in the array
and since we only have two numbers and
we're going from our lowest number to
our highest number this works
beautifully so he's saying start at the
lowest and go all it's the highest note
he's using less than or equal to because
we want to go up and include that number
and then we needs using just a standard
iterator then this is his son value
which is adding everything to and all
he's doing is using plus equals which is
the same as
this just shorthand and he returns it at
the end
well that was the one method a point to
be a very readable and short maybe you
want to try another one I would have
done it just the same way except I did
wasn't aware of this method right here
so Oh the only thing I would have done
differently is we know there's only two
variables so I already said like if our
human 0 is bigger than this
I would have said
and then change these top sets and I
were to use small here and big here but
I believe what you use is an excellent
use of that function
yeah well I also done it before you see
instead of this thing also that's a good
way to do it too well in this is a
modifying the VRA argument God but for
this kind of exercise it's just okay and
and so we stopped first day they re and
and then we can use just r0 and r1
asshole range good because yeah it
automatically sorted by values
that's another way this is two very good
ways to do it too this also valid yeah
and of course we can we will also cheat
so also to say and you just round them
yes because we do have access globally
to it yeah
d cool no you getting known no wow are
you returning it right oh yeah yeah but
is so time type of function
you're missing something here question
early heard you need a semicolon and I
AdNews were drunk
ah wait then fighting with the camera
too late too bad yeah it does the same
sort function yeah yeah you're right Oh
stressed out here just this spring soul
into the round at the condition he
doesn't go back so I do you need a sword
first and then I have arranged now this
you don't really have to know if you're
watching in chat this is kind of more of
extra thing there's something called a
library called Rhonda and site uses it
so it is available to the bonfires you
don't need it at all to complete any of
the bonfires you can complete many of
the bonfires using it um but you don't
need it at all
Oh Oh be nice yeah
yeah I need to to fall here because I'm
range takes a list of values not an RA
go in this place and check how do i
convert from binary choice oh okay a
Quincy set in chat whenever we're ready
to pass it over we can pass it over to
him well I think already we're just
trying to use Rhonda for next one it's a
function composition but we can leave it
here I will try to get it and post it a
bit later ince I'm just missing the way
for coming I marry into two discrete
values will sort of make I think it's
applied yeah it's applied but ok we can
we don't leave it here e trade's yeah i
just want to remind everyone in chat
always check out the Gator there's a lot
of people willing to help you out in
there um there's also a chat room for
pair programming so if you ever want to
pair it with somebody if you just post
in there and post what you want to do
save bonfires for example there's always
people looking the match up with you
you can learn new things like how we
learn math dot min T easily sort the to
a sort the array
yeah my name is mr. renter and I'm with
Chris and I hope you enjoyed our shrimp
tonight gyrating the sacrus a well thank
you to everyone does walked in and
having a very nice time first time I
