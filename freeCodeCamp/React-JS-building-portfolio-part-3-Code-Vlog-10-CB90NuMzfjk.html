first page
right now i'm watching the react
tutorial from Linda calm I want to
achieve the moment when each sub page
whether it's for website applications or
design will render appropriately just
only when clicked and this portfolio
will be single page using react there's
the discussion which desk is better the
one at which is our standing or the one
at which you're settling I use both of
them but the best desk is the desk from
what you stand up very often and go go
out in order to stretch up at your
muscles
it's Friday
this week I also announced another
coffee and coat anita in malaga and
quality for other co campers decided to
take part in it for our local my gal
frequent come group for members still
fits a step farther because more people
I don't say part than the last time this
thing I was learning a lot about react
and I have just patched the basics of
react for the lovers from our
programming and the reactor a long time
it's like nothing what I did despite the
fact is that small step I really
appreciate that that I managed to do it
this week each step count especially if
you learn something from scratch you
started you did it you use the first
event of react code in your app in your
website and everything works and
everything is fine so now you can go the
step farther so making small steps but
in the direction of progress it's always
what would a bayesian this is how the
page looks right now since the last week
i changed the pattern here behind the
colors i created my own pattern in this
section of repositories and i also added
the pages that are loading here
dynamically so
I chose few applications one website
right now and one example from design I
loved these portfolio sub pages using
reacts I use routing to as you see the
link changes dynamically look here we
have applications website and design I
tried the first time to load the
subpages this way using react it wasn't
easy at first I found a great article
that helped me a lot and I also asked
for some advice more experienced
developers this week I was also working
on styling get a bit more this is how it
looks on smaller screens it's fully
responsive one more thing i wanna share
and that i will provide link to in the
video description below is the mock up
to the online backup tool you can
customize the final results so what size
of the folder we get and and the other
thing is online and you don't need to
use photoshop or any other tool and
right now next week so next week next
week I'm going to continue the portfolio
side I'm going to test this ferroli next
week I also get out few meetings and in
one of them i will be your binding and
discussing my code of the previous
project later it will be time to come
back to free code camp challenges
