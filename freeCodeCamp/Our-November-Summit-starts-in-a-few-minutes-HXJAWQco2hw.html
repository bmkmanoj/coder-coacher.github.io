overarching facebook group for people
that are organizing their own Facebook
groups so feel free to join this if
you'd like we have about 450 different
campsites in different cities throughout
the world and many of them are meeting
regularly to drink coffee and code
together what we call coffee and code
those are picking up and every week
we're having more and more of them and
we one of the most successful post we
have on medium is about coffee and code
and I'm going to paste that in here real
quick
so I'm hearing that some people saying
the stream died I don't think the stream
died according on my end it looks like
it's working can I of each brush can can
you all try refreshing it yeah as soon
as you're working fine oh yeah okay just
it up so I don't want to like blast
twitch but they have occasionally
outages and stuff that are out of our
control so if the stream like has
something funky happening I'll know on
OBS because i'll have like drop frames
and a warning so it's something on
twitches side I suspect I don't want to
throw it under the bus here but just
refresh if something weird happens and
it'll nine times out of ten fix the
problem with twitch so I just talked
about how we have mediums we have twitch
of course which we use extensively for
live coding we're always looking for
more people to stream on Twitch so if
you're interested in streaming we have a
special chat room on git er which also
post into the chat live live coding
thought yeah here it is just clean this
up real quick yeah so if you jump in
that chat room we have people discussing
streaming on twitch and you can you can
stream on twitch as well and finally we
have YouTube where we're publishing all
kinds of instructional content we're
basically building a computer science
curriculum on there we're also going to
build a design curriculum those are
still pretty nascent and I definitely
still recommend using other resources
for computer science and design beyond
freako camp but it's an area that we
aspire to get really good at right now
we're focused almost one hundred percent
on getting like a really awesome coding
curriculum because coding is like the
practical skill and computer science is
kind of the theory
so that's it for our greater kind of
cinematic universe of social media and
other platforms that we use at this
point I'd like to hand it over to
berkeley to talk a little bit about our
curriculum berkeley would you like to
share your screen ah sure let me share
my screen yeah I think you have to make
me presenter do that yes you are now
presenter
are you able to show you screen Berkeley
I yeah right there is not showing up um
it doesn't seem to be showing up yet on
my end can you all see Berkeley screen
oh there it goes we can see it now yeah
it's in the tavern okay cool so I'm
going to talk about to kick the
curriculum and contributing to the
curriculum and how campers like
yourselves can't help out and help us
fill out the curriculum so we've got a
really cool project going on with st.
Peter being the main driver essentially
we have come to the conclusion that
there's a big cliff right before
bonfires and a lot of people are
dropping off that cliff so we want to
fix that um but creating curriculum is
really hard it takes a lot of time and
in the current state it's kind of a
menial task a lot of editing JSON a lot
of waiting a lot of trying and then
repeating so we're trying our hardest
we're developing a lot of tools to make
that process a lot easier on my end I'll
talk about the changes to the actual
code base one of the changes is we're
adding solutions to the actual
challenges themselves in the code base
so that we can test any changes to the
testing suites for those challenges so
most of them already have solutions I
should say most of the bonfires have
solutions we're working on adding
solutions to all the rest of the
challenges if you want to contribute to
that that'd be very helpful right now we
are testing bonfires and some JavaScript
challenges it still needs a little bit
more work to test everything else but
that'll come pretty soon the other thing
I want to talk about is continuous
integration
so one thing I've added is is the
ability to see the pool requests passes
all our test automatically so if you go
to any of these poor quest here let's
pick this one here for instance mr. mr.
Logan Eggman RL tignan on github you
probably seen him in the issues you've
been doing all good work for us as a
issue moderator contributing code as
well you can see that he's changed this
test here and you'll see that you get
these green check marks here so if we
show checkmarks it says here try to see
I build pass what this means is his code
was uploaded to Travis di and actually I
can share that here Travis CI will clone
get full clone free code camp install
all dependencies and then run all our
tests to see if Logan's code bright
anything and so at the moment it's not
testing the whole code base but it is
linting all the challenges it's linting
off javascript in here you can see the
tests and it tests the challenges that
have solution then that were chromed
testing and this output is looks kind of
funky here but I can do is show you what
it looks like hi it can can everyone see
my camera I see them here yeah there's a
little bit of a delay it's like a super
low frame rate but I can see the Travis
it's got your eye can see Babel node
seed / test challenge is that's what I
can see is that your current what you're
currently shown no hey probably sup so
I'm going to run the test of upper wing
it just so you can see what the apple
looks like because it looks it looks
kind of weird on Travis because of the
way out place up something pros
nevermind we won't show that oh yeah
thank you fix it
there you go seahawks now sorry i'm just
making some changes selecting everything
lynching off the JSON files and then
here is our testing suite you could
seize young cat it's pretty cool I have
fun here yeah so those are the changes
there's a lot more changes to come to
make things more exciting to make
curriculum development a little more
exciting another change I think Quinn
see if you can add ben i think i saw
been in the chasse i absolutely Kim's
had been then I'm going to send you the
gotomeeting request real quick I'll just
do that in get er if that's cool with
you those are you watching please don't
jump in order to meeting you you will
see the stuff to do so but please just
don't just work from eating so Ben
McMahon think I have it on my clipboard
somewhere I thought I did try that bin
think it'll work
so Ben McMahon our friend from Dublin
Ireland I will just give him a quick
introduction and he is a very precocious
high schooler who has contributed a ton
to our JavaScript curriculum and to our
code base in general so then should be
joining us shortly yeah and he'll be
talking about one other really cool
feature what working on especially been
Benz Benz main spearhead behind this
project called the challenge o matic
1000 so hopefully we can get him on soon
yeah keys man just a 30-second delay I
think something like that for whenever
we system hey Ben's joining yeah awesome
this guy is capable hello hey babe how
are we doing folks we're going on oh
yeah everything's better when I'm
involved I taught my craft I'm exercise
feedback well welcome in are you ready
to share your screen and give us the
beauty that is the challenge o matic
what you built a bit so far sure let me
just set up web stop but updated a
having looks very nice house awesome
berkeley can you pass presenter ship to
been in go to meetings done perfect and
while we're doing all that i'm going to
op a couple users I'm sorry I totally
forgot we want to make some people mods
so I'm at jeffs torbeck you're now a mod
oh I think recode existence I see you
all the time here let's see don't take
offense i found that mining the st.
peter's should definitely be a mod if he
isn't already code no profit you're a
mod now thanks that soon Michael Johnson
he normally he's almost always on the
stream he this time he was like well I
don't have anything in particular let's
let's focus on other things so he's
hanging out taking questions and asking
questions in the
okay room today instead of being on the
screen I'll be sick you're a mod now I
think I think that's everybody damn it
hit a great great a funny medium post
their den and yeah I think I've wanted
most people that need to be modded so
let's turn back to friend here isn't
there working we can see your screen now
yes we can see your ridiculously large
resolution so keep in mind that um
gotomeeting like scales everything down
significantly so it's like we're looking
down from an airplane at your screen
okay i was even once I open my coaching
great just window by the way everyone
who's tuning in we're almost certainly
gonna go over um due to mostly to me
just having to sort out those sound
flower issues and get the audio working
properly so just uh please note that in
advance we're saving the best stuff for
last Mike and Christian are going to be
demoing some some pretty awesome stuff
so you'll definitely want to stick
around just don't expect like if you've
got something and you need to run also
we're we're kicking all this over to
youtube as soon as we're done screaming
so you can always catch it later then
but we won't run to too far over we
budgeted for an hour it'll probably be
about an hour 20 minutes I've been take
it away and make it bigger mega tow oh
this is just call oh oh I remember 60 to
80 s fantastic so here is the opening
screen cover the worst opening screens
I've never seen your life for what is
technically an enterprise-class to
left-click on and so when it opens up I
have no idea what to select she go it
might be like your desktop if on Windows
or your home directory if your Mac Linux
present so you'll go through fact you'll
adjust it is you get your free
how campaign stuff you're going to seed
your gift is Jason I hear what you want
that's cool but most will be challenges
and let's pics advanced bunch right
because the first one I life is too
short and you'll then get to this screen
this screen is where all the magic
happens Kings you will know to start on
a new challenge for a second one second
Quincy can you zoom into Ben's screen on
gotomeeting oh it doesn't seem to give
me that functionality unfortunately okay
sorry guys wait I can do this this is as
big as Raticate it's a little bit bigger
okay sorry to interrupt the Clinton okie
doke unless you can get a better thing
set up adobe after we left off to save
countless how to go to anyway that's
right on top what you actually do is the
moment this is purely for adding
challenges you can't really make stuff
yet but that's common hope you this
weekend what we've done is if you look
at the actual see it for this soil yeah
Mia Mia which bill do its own approach
it again a flash oh this is ting hello
open freak okay you window and let us
take a look at this so what you're
getting is you're getting the name
you're going to be ID which is a stage
girl and we aren't giving the order we
are given time again the challenge seed
the test what the hell let's saloon
description yeah this is where this blog
description so below that the nested
object is the actual challenge okay okay
so you're getting your ideas on what a
tidy hid atty subscription your tests
and the challenge see it faster this
with you I like that and MDM likes him
and solutions are here all this kind of
stuff down here so you're only getting
stuff actually need
82 and his dog and he does stop things
indeed and you only get what you need
this will actually be taken out or it'll
just be like today is like an editable
fields because really you don't need to
change the seeds and they'll just be
like when you crane your chance in
general angle ID so it'll be handled and
the title fair description there and you
you get mostly color highlighting I
think this is still going in JavaScript
so this makes this a text and HTML who
bit the code so Josh good looks nice I
might change HTML to make it like the
old attacking so for you um you'll
notice for anyone's ever done tests
before there's no escaping strings it's
all done which is just like 20 hours off
your day forever try to make challenges
so that alone is an improvement your
challenge seed which is what you get we
go to you should be sliced smooth I hope
or take 20 minutes who knows go to map
will go to so you can pop it in after to
valley de yeah you'll notice eventually
that this correspond exactly forever
here and and then you have the type
which is this is more from use nine
times of stuffy for making challenges
will be waypoints and the challenge type
will either be no your bonfire earlier
you'll pick one eases execute the HTML
waypoints the GLA points and so what
this will allow you to do is it saves
you at this current station by 10 20
minutes archenemies mending the end go
is that it'll be like a one-stop shop we
don't have to even well you will have to
open Treecko hemisphere they look good
you can make the whole challenge you can
make sure the tests are good my kind of
stuff would add a robbery free coal camp
and doing if you're familiar with the
development process is that Mongo
filming walk but all the challenges to
ever need to be put in there and do MPM
install their own style go pins that
Eric Cooper on and go from this other
hundred things so
yep any she just to do this is the last
and debilitated is to save you a lot of
pot hope that is the end go and when you
totally make your changes so let's add a
word like quirky I think i mighta breath
in this last day and I fixed it but you
know we're gonna do one of their life is
your hands this could look terrible who
didn't have it all right um so what we
should see is it didn't change cool I
need to make a lawyer to me and what it
is in export to jakes aren't as
important but with the changes you've
made I'm gonna watch it worth their be
doing it on purpose make me look bad
this is the first a way to move and nip
never do it life I should pre / petr
korda next time when it works like yeah
disney read the video playing imagine it
every day um but you had that's just
that's the best exciting of the guess I
am we have I'm very proud of this it's
multi file mode we can open up you know
your advanced and you can open up your
angular and you can have you can do both
are you hit export export all of them
that works really well and I think of us
actually open ass it's gonna be great
I'm but that is it for now I'm way what
a mistake did you do okay okay we're
back so is this their search box test
new challenges there is a solution in
the seed and I'm having trouble getting
the editing the solutions to work
because it's taking off from the width
of his exporting it and she'll 64 again
and show you what it does it actually
pasts new lines which really just
wrecked my head and Boop m-e-e-e-e-e-e I
got srl you solutions not have a callous
I'm anything apparently
okay yeah I'm Alexa shorts very life
Bush there a solution fields in most
stuff all the time you're a fraud
investigations hello reload choose file
advanced explore here we go so angular
challenges downtown equals external but
internal challenges do so you'll see
here it's doing is zooming million times
and there's my place today's your
solutions array that's from the next
line fix stuff put a TC it's breaking
the string so that is vanilla genius
let's fix that and you'll be officially
patterning fan club if you can serve
today and if you can't know where it's
at some point but the whole idea behind
it that will improve the workflow and
hopefully make it to any old pressing
common law and great challenges for the
site obviously have to get them
submitted that kind of stuff but yeah if
it's got it good and to reiterate what
Berkeley we're saying a moment ago our
goal is to make it really easy to submit
challenges because we want our way
points to grow significantly because
javascript is very complicated I think
it's way beyond the scope of what we
teach I think it's way beyond the scope
of what anybody teaches we really want
to have a truly comprehensive kind of
almost encyclopedic assortment of
waypoints that that walk you through
JavaScript not just like showing you how
to do stuff but like taking through
iterations and really getting you a lot
of practice with JavaScript concepts so
that you'll be able to just fly through
the bonfires and then be confident when
you go into the zip lines and BASE jumps
thank you very much man no way would you
make Mike the presenter please plan Matt
musical presenters musical chairs make
presenter and present data request cool
and I don't use to gotomeeting installs
but if I ask you to do it's an extension
now I have to
CF actually if Septimus my friend might
want to take a look at that and
configure a gyro doing screen Chang with
an extension which in JavaScript yeah so
very quickly on this subject of making
it easier to contribute one key thing
that you really need to do in order to
be able to effectively contribute free
code camps open source project is to get
free code camp established locally on
your on your computer and and Mike's
going to talk a little about that take
it away Mike it would help if I was
Anita there we go I forgot to be myself
okay um okay um so I'm currently working
on any project and is utilizing a tool
called vagrant and the big ern is
basically a rapper that goes around
virtual machine tools so like virtual
box so our home VMware and basically
that virtual machine or that vagrant
tool and spin up a machine for you and
put everything that you need inside of
it so that you can just hop into the
Machine and start developing and it's
pretty nifty um ideally it's gonna look
like magic but currently there's a
little bit of um I wouldn't take
tiptoeing but there are a few steps to
take anyways um I'm not sure how large I
need to make my phones that everyone can
see it your buddy what actions my
comfy some that consoles pretty good not
like the other stuff over the group oh
um okay so i was trying to run this
while everyone else is talking cuz it
takes quite some time i want to do it
well i think cuz i have this stream hope
in and gotomeeting my name kogda vent
but anyway i'll just talk up on it so
this screen on the right which no one
should be able to see in so we make it a
little bigger is basically the free coke
and website or gym hub repository um so
basically we hop on here it's basically
the frico camp to have all the substance
here there's this nice little bit at the
bottom
where they talk about getting started
and essentially when you're getting
started with development on the
repository you have to you know pull in
the repo and then do some things to make
the repository work appropriately but
you need to be doing this inside of a
development machine and there's a fair
amount of people I would suppose that
have trouble setting up a developing
machine and contribute it was working
not necessarily developing local ease oh
I mean one thing to say that this
prerequisites for this project are air
mama to be enough yes but to have those
book resolve on a machine isn't really a
development environment it just means
that you have those tools on your regime
so the idea is we want to really give
ourselves an environment to work in
point of the posture that I'm creating
and so essentially it all and install
these tools for you and a few many more
and get you started and really try to
you have time so that this npm install
trenches but we can talk about what the
project actually does sure it uses
vagrant and a little bit about the tool
at quincy search just put in guys put em
it's a hashtag the relevant to go to
time the last this is thuy ashtag big
 campfire i think what's not you
won't be taking any questions mash
anyone yeah just ask your questions
right here on free code can't let me
just go and modify i can turn it off if
you want anyway sorry that's just sure
um and let me just edit the title real
quick to our November summit let's throw
an exclamation point in there can't have
too many of those right okay thanks
connect Lee okay so the question again
from these little bandwidth as possible
um so basically vagrant is like I said a
rapper it has lots of cool features this
like a getting started guide the
documentation it's pretty it's pretty
good for just getting started it starts
to lack when you get
to like the interview and / advanced
areas and need to like really do some
interesting things with it it's really
terrible but for like someone who's
super new and just wants to like learn
how to use vagrant it's the degradation
is amazing now you just literally just
go through one by one you'll figure
everything out it's pretty great
basically what happens is you spin up
and I'll show you what agent products
like you spent of a machine in this case
we happen to be using smaller size large
10 is that should be significant onesie
and we're using you might too trusty 64
which is the 1404 version of ubuntu
which is a long-term support version
which means that it'll never go anywhere
and it will be forever and the virtual
machine by default has two gigs of ram
so he'll be a section that read me for
my repo that basically says had some
small things so for instance if you're
using like a budget macbook air that
like a gig of ram something you can tone
this down so that doesn't utilize too
much same with the cpu cap these things
just it's a virtual machine can use as
much resources as it chooses to on this
particular instance though I have a lot
all right I'll I get to use items and
I'm going just kinda nice scale this
physics so I can see them good um so
basically what you have to do is a hop
over to the three cocaine Japan and on
their page you'll see a list of
repositories that everybody's working on
and much stuff that gone with Rico can
and the one you're looking for or just
happens to be the third one from the top
which is kind of flattering so if you
click on that and it'll bring you to
this repo which currently is a little
out of date because I haven't published
the changes I've imprinted nature yeah
that's fine and
and basically what's going to happen is
you'll clone this repository with a jet
clumsily and and then you'll run two
commands in the console essentially and
everything will work really well so what
I can shoot is the commands in action
and i'll just show you on a really
simple this is really beautiful here so
basically the screen that you're looking
at this is just a simple fragrant
machine that i used for development I
all my projects into it it's really
simplistic there's nothing super huge
about it but essentially I have bigger
it installed oh it's not a spell version
really feel like I doing this yeah this
I'm of trouble come come on focus on
class Jiali like week good yeah so i
have a group insults and basically if
you run the command bacon status it'll
tell you what's going on in this current
directory if there is even vagrant in
this current directory and there miss
decides to finish something I've noticed
this is like complete aside in a
developer note that I just met it in my
head the bacon commands don't run dates
aggressive a like tie up processes
really well it's just not necessarily
different anyways this mega machine is
not currently buddhadeb but if I were to
run a command I'm big enough and it'll
spin up this box and do some really
really interesting things and however
I'm gonna cancel I've not let it do it
because it's going to heat up processing
power that's ain't taking where the
other bigger machine currently um and
basically what happens is will this end
up that's basically what happens is
it'll spin up a box and you ssh into
that virtual machine using the command
vagran SSH go figure and it'll bring you
into the command line for the machine
and you can exceed you into the
directory that you need
and it's basically end goal you get
something like this so you'll have this
project open so you don't know how to
make the folders on the side bigger so
hopefully everyone's used some sort of
editor or IDE that has the tree view of
the project you're working on and so in
my tree view here this is basically just
the repository for an FCC vagrant you'll
note that there's also this free code
camp directory that's here so basically
what happens is when you run a vagrant
up it'll do all the nifty provisioning
things which are listed off over here
for you and and essentially when those
interesting things happen you'll be able
to bigger and into their SSH into the
vagrant machine and do something like
the environment variable in the bower
install well that's kind of a
complicated scenario and it's just
easier if we can just work in our own
editor right so the idea is that it
symlinks the folder in your project
directory to the project folder inside
the virtual machine so this folder here
is actually residing inside my virtual
machine currently and so like this node
directory no more directory is actually
ending up doing right now because that's
what's happening on the screen but I'll
notice I have this like nifty
environment variable that they talked
about in the free cooking directories um
we have to set up our and variable so
instead of having to do all this stuff
it's kind of just here for you so you
can put in your manual user name
password your session secret stuff if
you need it if you choose to use the
Facebook integration or developer Trella
or Google or Twitter you can add them
things to it otherwise it's pretty much
set up as is and basically what this
does is allow you to run the Gulf
command inside of the virtual machine
and then you have a working copy of
freako camp inside of a promotion
and I really would like to demonstrate
that but as I mentioned before the NPM
install command is really bad it is
really unreliable and so right now it's
just hugging venoth and taking a long
time to build things hashtag never works
like oh yeah it was really struggling it
built like three times before it got to
me and then I was making changes and I
was like okay I'll just built this last
time I'll be ready to go and then that
last time took forever there's a flag
recognize that it is like kind of cake
sandwich Carrick NPM plates but it slows
down enough uh yeah he told me when it's
actually in the project it's um set or
IPM configset jobs space one good one
job the time yeah so it's currently
that's the flag that's set in the
provisioner because i was having a lot
of issues where when you try and grab me
a PM can command the provisioner didn't
like how many things are happening at
once and depending on what kind of
system resources you have this is
somewhat like chug as NP i'm trying to
do everything inside the virtual machine
and originally I had my virtual machine
only allowed to use fifty percent of my
cpu usage so it would like cap at at
fifty percent and just utilize that
trying to install everything and then
just bottleneck and then things started
to fail because it didn't have enough
cpu readers so head up at a hundred
percent in this particular case but
doing that job space one thing that's
really helpful so Mike yeah if this were
a like hypothetically NPM were to finish
installing is that like one of the last
steps before we what would you do after
that okay so after you ran or ideally
the provisioner will do the MP i'm
running except for you but currently i
have it a little bit separate so that
you can do it yourself so basically run
the npm step into the list of steps is
here so the puppet Commissioner will run
up until about here um and then
everything below that that's a lie here
and then everything below that is
something that you're gonna have to jump
into the console and do which is pretty
simple so you basically jump in you run
the NPM install command
so you're on the MPN and soft man which
is currently the command that's running
now and then you would installed
globally so that you can utilize it and
you would install power globally so that
you can utilize it because power
installs some defense is the perfect
pieces then you'd run the bower install
command which is really simplistic also
super speedy that happens with maclee
and then you would if you haven't
already deal with your environment
variable and so that was that they made
sure if you have left here which is you
know the mandrel and all in fun stuff
and then once that's finished you just
run the sea in command um which is
really super simple it's listed on the
free cooking repository which is here so
you ran an Afghan run first em and then
it's the pyramid environment Liz Evans
okay thanks it spins up the free cocaine
repository pretentious liebe dich see
the database and get everything up for
you and then you run gulp and the
projects running and then if you were to
visit so this isn't gonna work right now
but if you were to visit I think it's
when I had it set to me double check
spelling of that information interesting
yes I know people who want to do this
you still be careful of what you have on
your machine am I was like a web summit
on Thursday and selling the talk of am
performance phantoms and what it was
that he hypervisor there were two
machine village which is effectively the
PM is your machine the hypervisor and
then to be answered on tougher
hypervisors just what left to DM talk to
the machine anyway doesn't know and what
he was saying that people were seeing
blocks on one of the apps because the
other app was doing something like
garbage collection I'm blocking
everything everything sitting there
waiting for the i/o to conclude oh so
actually top tips put a plaque computer
he's Firefox not chrome you doing
development and i still like perfect for
a chrome but eats a lot of horses
if you are gonna use any browser less
windows is more I'm close anything you
don't need a victory yeah because as you
can see there's a lot of you bless you
should go again right now yeah I chrome
eats up a lot of from Brandon um Sonny
nice to be able to after yeah after you
run the golf community to be able to do
it down badge we could came back depth
actually cocaine colon three SS the pork
I think I didn't know if you'd have to
you Steve Hansen to be honest and and
then ah I don't think any of the what's
on the local machine in I think it's
real and so anyways you would go to this
and just clear that Porter now I'm gonna
bring you to a version of your cooking
up that's residing on your local machine
not so that's basically as far as you'd
have to go then start contributing snow
strengthens we find a typo on some page
you'd be able to go that page inside
your tree directory by the typo and edit
it and never actually contributed to the
freakin camps I'm not actually sure
berkeley will know this prickly where is
if I wanted to change for instance
change the world holds a question okay
so say I wanted to add a picture of
myself to this page Ricky Alan rich
where would I find this index file their
purview server resources on 2 reviews
resources home I believe it's called are
you talking about the enemy page planet
asia yeah i mean i would on the second
word is exactly oh I'm that didn't come
it is a matter is home budget yeah so
then I could jump inside the Jade file
so I could jump in and not do some
modifications here and then the
modifications that I do here will show
up on my version of free cookie box
right and if I was satisfied that i
could crimp or questions my version of
free cooking in New York my phone a typo
for instance perhaps spill wrong and I
need to fix that I can jump in and find
where the word notice on this page and
say like this secret spell don't know do
you really want that to be yes but if
you wanted to change that that meeting
be such a thing check in a glee iOS
lower case uh yeah and it's also not
really a thing anywhere then yea truly
useless facts yeah yeah and then you'd
be able to submit it so the workflow is
actually speaking with Berkeley about
this generally on the eco camps say
there's around the repo is a folder
called contributing um and so the idea
is to fork the free coke and repository
to your own personal checking account
and then work on your stuff there and
then create a pull request with the
feature that you or I could create a
push your changes to a branch of your
fork which is called feature or
something
um feature request sir I grabbing your
grandma her terrors better graphics Oh
is there a grammatical error there no
there's not that I hope this ain't good
yeah and then you could once you've done
that then you would create a pull
request to bring everything from your
fork or your branch of a fork into the
breed co tam when I say that I lab that
sounds really complicated that's really
not essentially you're forking the repo
which is super simple it's a button on
here right at the top let's see it oh
it's up here so you just click fork and
then you'd create a when you create a
fork you'll see Richard help page and I
should i'll just do right now in our
then you get a screen like this and it
just says forking the frequent camp and
copy and paste everything which is
pretty fantastic so this is my github
account notably at the top but I now
have a version of fruit Co camp I would
create a new branch and call it fix taio
and then on this new branch I would make
the changes that I wanna change so that
would be done by cloning so this step
that happens in here where I said so the
step instead of just the parishioner
cloning the standard freecom camp I will
just clone my branch and then I have a
list of all the things here I would have
the exact same setup i'd have this free
coke camp directory up here service and
such and I would go to that home layout
page and I would change note to iota
chance and then I will take my changes
and then I would create a whole requests
and which
can I loss is forecast and the polar
press is going to go freaking freaking
camp to staging a blu ray doesn't really
want invite Berkeley okay yeah and then
I would pull from my my own branch she's
told or is it a club for people who
aren't Donna Reed access it's gonna be
and if you have compared across forks
it'll give you the year it's like into
from that means I thing on the left such
a chocolate empty nothing on the writers
are taking from so yeah you would want
to know you'd want to smell the way
around yeah and it's gonna ditch there
even a cute Oh what didn't well when I
did at this DVD to give you this if you
get out there on the right to your one
it should do the yeah there we go so I
would change my typos fix in this
teaching and I would see the first
chorus and so on and so forth yes so
noted here he's uh this is totally
hypothetical arm we are going to create
a lot more documentation about how to go
through this process but what mike has
been working on essentially will make
creating your development environment a
piece of cake relative to how it used to
be like it's so much easier to get set
up locally and one of the things that
free code camp emphasizes is actually
spending time coding and not spending a
whole lot of time trying to configure
and tweaked out your dev environment
because honestly like you can quickly
Google a lot of that stuff and that
stuff changes a lot but actually coding
skills take a lot of time to build up so
we think you should spend as much time
actually coding as possible and so this
is definitely a step in the right
direction making it easier to get your
dev environment setup so you can start
contributing and submitting pull request
open source projects on get up
well thank you very much Mike for this
walkthrough um as soon as everything's
done we would love to announce this with
a big medium post and keep up the hard
work on it and thank you again for the
demo so when words we'd like to close
with a demo from Christian so like if
you can make Christian presenter make
sure can mmm I see what screen actor
sure if I can share this one smoking you
will see the screen with yep you know so
um runt one or two months ago me akira
lane and urine started working on this
project it's a music app where you have
different stations all of them have one
playlist in them that everyone can
contribute to its completely open source
it's written in media and yeah so i'm
now going to go to showcase it so on the
homepage you just get display of all the
stations with the what song is playing
right now and by whom of course you can
login logout you can make an account
yourself and you can login with github
so i would personally suggest login with
github rather than making account
yourself but it's all to you um yeah so
when you go with green real quick cuz we
just see your desktop with the cool fox
on it oh it has a good
does the fox say there should be a song
be pre-populated with
Joe Panik tomorrow frame about this vid
clip showing my second screen oz mom 2 1
okay can you guys she'd website now yes
oh I like obvi awesome so the domain
everyone who's watching is we sorry com
yeah yeah yeah okay is that so on
something in a foreign language either
uh doesn't mean something in the foreign
language but it's basically a mix of
music and share so you sure yeah um
what's keeping you can sign up login you
can make your own account when you can
also sign up get up and look at it later
so once you're logged in you don't have
to login to use the website but it does
give you some more features so you can
go to a room I'm gonna so if a volume
slider here it will display either to
youth video or a SoundCloud image we
have the preview like a demo of the song
including the title the person who made
the song and where the song set right
now and how long will last The Seeker
boy here we have the whole playlist
including where it is at right now you
can if you logged in you can add songs
from youtube and from soundcloud so if i
just quickly do this it will give you
you built if you click on them if we'll
try to autofill these things in by
retrieving it from the spotify api and
if it doesn't do that you can do it
yourself or there's also two other
moments were asking either from spotify
API so once you do that you can just
click add song and now it will get added
to a queue for admins to review and I
under you can also hide the video if you
don't want to show the video for some
reason
if you are logged in you can I don't you
can like the song you can dislike the
song and you can also do your like or
dislike this is completely permanent so
this will always stay on your profile
we're not sure if we're actually in this
display where which songs you've liked
or not but you can always undo your
dislike were like then you can also
report the song this is variously from
if it's not playing or if it doesn't
exist the title for being incorrectly
inappropriate are the same thing the
duration for being too long to short the
audio for being appropriate when you're
playing album art for or basically same
things and just order and then admins
also have some other nice features
admins can pass the whole room for
everyone and I should also mention that
the same song place at the same like
location that song at the same time so
happens can pass the room and display
the room again we can skip songs and we
can also show for the whole playlist so
if I show for it then you can see that
the whole playlist is shuffling so then
i also want to show the app input so
this will display how many users are
going on it and the queue is basically
it's the queue of all songs we can
preview the image we can preview the
song themselves we can edit the song
over here and retrieve the spotify data
and then after we've done that we can
decide if we put it in the playlist or
if we just remove it
then here we have to play lick
themselves basically the same thing you
can remove the songs you can edit them
preview them prefigured images and here
will display the young info of them and
then at last at the bottom you can add
rooms so as yeah this is a mod only
action i can happen only for now but we
might make it a modern lee like right
now we've only worked with
administrators not really with ranks
okay and so one thing i should mention
so around 16 17 s coating go chromates a
change that is pretty bad for the app if
you go to a station and you then go to a
a new room and this song ends then it
won't play next song so Google Chrome
this layer disabled it so that it
doesn't play new music new audio if
you're not in the top so you would have
to go back to the tab and then cisplatin
so yeah we up good here for a very
unfair yeah so we hope from it makes an
option for us to enable or disable it or
just reverts it so yeah that's about it
at this point I think we can go ahead
and start taking questions from all the
campers watching and everybody can feel
free to jump in you can ask questions to
anybody here including of course a
christian and mike who download their
apps and Bend who hope the Challenger
matic so I'm gonna I'm gonna jump over
into the chat room and I think we have
some mods in there that are already
taking a look at at some of the
questions coming through it looks like
Mike is no longer on the call
um italy's work okay but we will we will
all be happy to answer your questions
all those questions lino how do I feel
about renting let me tell you something
you know hang on Nathan you can ask the
question directly on the audio feed you
don't have to type it in the twitch cuz
you're on the call so let me tell you a
little thing I subscribe it oh I know I
know oh here we go here he is I'm glad
photos limping so I made the whole
challenge I'm attic and we were taking a
look at it one like Henry like let's go
practice into another time make it
better until we put it in one of course
nathan has this ridiculous like
totalitarian es lint config file but if
they sustain to the place it goes
absolutely look them up on your app and
so after spending half an hour moving
spaces around we gave up and ever since
then he's been gives me the fat fella
real anything I might be looking at like
this this is a team of strong together
in like an evening it's just been six of
other times on a high continue writing
the whole thing because I'm sex is my
mind chance fixes and it's kind of like
firefighting so if you are looking at
the code now it probably will be gone in
a week but anyway so the total the
totalitarian linting file that we're
using is actually a frico camps eous
lint config file what is yes it's too
hard well you know I mean it's hard it's
hard to obey all the rules when you're
playing a game of chess or something but
but it's easy to fade when she starts
from the staff but I've done the whole
thing without following them and read he
turned around oh great I've never seen
so much red in my life it was like I
program with JavaScript and put it
csharp ID and it just went down
so that if that was my trucks be
incidental great well we've got some
great questions coming in from the
audience one question and I saw are we
still moving forward with moving
everything to flux and react and
Berkeley would you like to tackle that
one sure the answer is yes that's good
aspect so do you want to like lay out
like at online or some of the things
that were that are we need to do in
order to move to flux and react sure so
one of the biggest challenges there's a
there is a trade-off with moving to
react and that is the bats these there's
an increased size in the amount of
JavaScript needed to load before you can
do anything on page so with that trade
up in mind with that trade-off dictates
what pages can be multi react first and
and how fast when you do that so since
most people spend their time on free
code camp doing challenges that's what
we that's where we will see the most
benefit moving to react and flux that is
also the most neglected well not
neglected but a lot of the code that
goes into challenges it's very it's
what's called spaghetti code like
there's so many things going on so many
places so one of this one of the main
holdbacks right now is refactoring the
challenges framework to you know just
make the code a little cleaner and make
it a little more modular and just
involves a whole lot of refactoring so
that's going to be one major step in
before we see large sections of the site
turning to react but there are other
places where we can move to react faster
so for instance news camper news can be
react at pretty soon since if you open
up camp renews it it opens up in a new
tab anyways
you can either leave open most people
just leave it open so that's one space
where we can see react ought to hear
their other sections of the site there
are react but we haven't actually
publicly released them yet but they will
be soon and you should hear an
announcement from us but yeah the first
place most people will see react well
most people will be using react will be
the challenges but balaji no one that
happens you're just for people not men
our like the challenge framework which
the thing that like loads month other's
hands Nathan ritas redness once or twice
and I rewrote the whole things well
mostly from scratch and then / keys are
in a twice and scratch and it to do this
the two new features that are being
brought in overall and react and photo
does require their own enjoyment
rewriting so it's like this evil in the
cube comical ah it's real funny out that
it's it's hard to do correctly but it's
really hard to people have difficulty
with this like like Codecademy has a lot
of bugs and they have millions of
dollars and dozens of employees working
on the sort of stuff so I'm happy that
show me as it does but we definitely
have a long way to go in terms of making
the challenge and work even better and
and daddies I mean Berkeley am I correct
that's the main obstacle to react to
find free code camp is just dealing with
the challenge long yeah it's just yeah
it's just so many people have touched it
and a lot of the code was just I don't
say this it it's just a lot of things
were added that it was built to suit the
time I have work everything around a
change so we'd have to be changed
everything love very grandis everything
works great except Dooley it doesn't
scale so need to notify Gail and change
it easily without having to do major
rewrites we have some chick questions
Christian a tee time girl asks Christian
how long did this take and another
camper asked a little bit more about
tech stack that you used to create a
Christian and and of course Johan and
Akira may also be in the the chat room
answering questions as well but
Christian you want to take that uh yeah
ok so the development itself okay I'm
just gonna look at this so we not sure
when exactly we started i think it was
back at the end of sep tember i think
the 29th of september's when we started
and since then a carer has been working
on it for a few hours every day i have
as well a few hours every day and like
5-6 hours in the weekends and yond has
been active more like eating and more i
like the last week or two so i would say
it took around 12 months let me see
number at times yeah two months around
two months okay what's the use meteor to
make it can you talk a little bit more
about that yeah okay so media is a full
stack javascript library it basically
takes care of everything it's a it's
good for client-side and it's good for
surface I'd it's I can actually show it
over here so off the drop script for the
whole website is on this one file so we
yeah so here at this is all the show fur
coat from done here and everything up
there is just all the client code it
works a little bit like angular with
just templates like this I it also has
the ability to add user packages that
people make and it's just you know for a
really good performance in connects good
with Mongo client side swept aside just
really good
great um Jeff sorbic asks hey are you
going to talk about the seasonal zip
lines and sure enough we are um thank
you for mining me Jeff so free coke camp
is going is creating some some seasonal
or rather Jeff's torbeck has created a
seasonal challenge that everybody can
tackle if you feel like getting some
extra front-end development practice and
it is this beautiful recipe list it's
basically a recipe box and this is our
holiday challenge if you feel like
tackling it you probably don't want to
tackle this is your first zip line but
it could be done you know probably after
the basic zip lines if you felt like
tackling it basically as a user I can
add zip line I can add recipes so we'll
say oh wait so that's not this is
searching so right now we just have
pumpkin pie right here we can click it
and we can view it's pumpkin and it's
pie and I think this is throwing at my
local storage or something because this
is a static file I don't even know how
it's doing it but it's probably doing it
in the local storage I could take a look
at the code but I'm pretty sure that's
how it's working let's say I want to add
one right so I want to add stuffing now
we're going to say bread you know what
else do you had to stuffing like onions
maybe garlic and then let's say like
maybe I I could be more specific like
two pounds of bread and like two onions
and five cloves of garlic you know like
a real recipe thank you tell I don't do
much cooking and then I could cover and
you can see that uh I think should show
up oh wait this is for pumpkin pie so I
have to navigate back but you can see
stuffing is now here and it's got a full
text search so if i type I everything is
there but if i type in
gee then just stuffing but pumpkin has
iron as well so this has full text you
know real-time search as well which is
awesome so basically you would want to
reverse engineer something like this and
this could be something pretty cool but
you can show your friends and there are
a lot of different directions and visual
styles you could apply to it and we're
hoping to have a lot more the seasonal
completely optional zip lines and BASE
jumps that you can tackle so big thanks
to Jeff for creating that i believe jeff
has created a chat room just for a
seasonal store beck events so in here
he's got his some people have come in to
talk about this basically i think this
is where he introduced the recipe box if
anybody else wants to create
holiday-themed you know there are a lot
of holidays both secular and from
various religions in this time period
including New Year's Day for example
Chinese New Year stuff like that if you
want to create some challenges like that
we plan to exhibit them probably in the
same place we exhibit everything else
which is free code camp labs which is
where we're currently showing some
things that campers have built and we'll
add some additional things to here as
well such as of course lusair where you
were to get that in here and I'm eager
to to check that out after this stream
ends as well myself because that just
went live I think this morning so some
other questions if anybody saw any
questions that jumped out at them yes in
Jeff's torbeck confirmed it stores in
local storage and it has the delete and
undo the late why it even has undo to
Luke very nice
alright so if anybody else has any
further questions um please let us know
otherwise I don't think Wesley is going
to be able to stream but if nobody from
our audience or anybody on the stream
would like to stream Nathan been if
either you guys want to stream you're
welcome to take over the screen and what
I plan to do is export this as quickly
as possible to youtube so that our
audience which we actually have like
usually five or six times as many people
watch it on YouTube is watch it live
apparently we have some questions on the
Twitter according to Johanna I think I
can't fire take a look at those so is
just people tweeted with the hashtag
Riku campfire first a chance today dear
auntie like boy right okay great so
thank you everybody for tweeting these
let's just answer them real quick yeah
we make daily weekly or even monthly
coding challenges that's what a ellis
spec asked I think the seasonal
challenges are going to be a fun thing
we can do in that direction keep in mind
even though about like eighty percent of
our campers are coming to coding fresh a
lot of more experienced developers also
use free code camp just to practice
building projects and learn new
technologies and generally just keep
their skills sharp and explain their
portfolio so I think the seasonal
challenges are great offering for them
because they can just jump right in
start building something fun right off
the bat so yeah we would love to create
more of these seasonal challenges we
talked a while back about creating like
a an email where you got an email and
you would open up your javascript editor
and just like solve some JavaScript
that's in that email right there and
then I'm in the JavaScript console on
your browser
we decided not to do that just because
it was extremely limiting and I mean
that was the main reason we haven't
completely dismissed it but it's not
something we're planning to do at this
point let's see 47 minutes it could you
add a link to this we add this link to
the wiki ah something about a security
and across site so this would be a great
um if you'd like full-stack web design
if you would like to create a wiki
article around this currently our wiki
was vandalized heavily Berkeley you want
to talk a little bit with that real
quick yeah definitely so yeah as Quincy
said just we have a huge issue with
spammers on every one of our wikis on
every one of our repos so unfortunately
that means we we just can't have nice
things so so Wikipedia is now sort of
contribute the way to contribute to the
Wikipedia arm sorry the wiki is we
created a separate repo of Quincy you
can if you want to navigate to the fat
repo at pre code camp oh I'm sorry
github.com / free code camp / wiki so
now it's it's own repository and you
would contribute to it the same way you
contribute to freak account the Wiccan
that was ironically also vandalised what
does it do it yeah everything was
challenged America had millions as well
get at some point yeah but family came
to the facts jasmine yeah yeah so I went
through it and we did all the wiki's and
besides that one so to contribute to it
you would just fork the Wikipedia or the
wiki repo edit the files and github and
then create pull requests so it's a
little more cumbersome and definitely
will probably see a reduction in the
amount of people that are willing to
contribute but if you can it's not too
difficult then we really appreciate it
the other thing to announce with the
wiki is will be moving it to be directly
on free code camp com so you'll still
have to edit it on github but the result
will be shown as a separate at website
or is a separate page on fecal chem calm
and that that task is being spearheaded
by let's see if I can pull up his
username what man while he's doing that
alright point out one thing that's good
about this new wiki thing is now
contributions to the wiki will show up
in your github activity as contributions
to an open source project previously for
whatever reason don't know why but
github chose not to consider
contributions who github wiki's to be
considered like they're open source
contributions for the sake of like the
total contributions in the heat map
however with this um you will now get a
contribution whenever you commit to the
wiki and another convenient thing you
could already do this but you can just
pull down the wiki and edit it locally
instead of having to edit in code pens
or in a github graphic user interface so
we you were looking up the person who is
spearheading the awesome awesome I never
yeah so he is spearheading that we're
gonna be moving it to a static dynamic
framework called that's being a chick
yeah it's it's kind of weird it
generates static pages for you so you
can use it with github pages but it's
also reacts app so you load the initial
page it'll actually give you the static
page and then it will load react and so
any page transition from there on its
single page so it's too weird hybrid but
it's really cool and allow us to do
really
stop with the wiki so it's named after
the great gatsby plenty of plenty of fun
puns there sure so the other question
yeah gasps pjs flash Gatsby the other
question people were asking a do we plan
to introduce a capture the flag on preco
camp so info information security AKA
InfoSec the kind of stuff you talk about
if you went to like Def Con and places
like that cryptography that's really
important but that's that's a very
specialized field I think the average
web developer doesn't need to have a
deep knowledge of that ideally you would
be like t-shaped you would have a
variety of basic skills like you know
doing some basic DevOps stuff knowing
some computer science and how to you
know design a scheme and everything like
that but the main thing you would be
really deep on it's just actual coding
skills and building apps which is what
we focus on but we would be interested
in having a capture the flag event like
stripe i think has some amazing capture
the flag events some other companies
have them too it's just that it we we
don't want to focus our own personal
time on building that so if you come up
with some capture the flag type
challenges and you want to promote them
through freako camp we're for the week's
games like we would love to have our
campers practice that stuff as long as
it's not too big of a distraction from
actual coding as I said repeatedly ad
nauseam I really think people need to
focus on just coding as much as possible
and not get distracted with all the
other millions of things that they could
also learn that would be good butter my
opinion less important than cody and
quench people for asking abish a few
times there how does he make money oh
yes yes people keep asking that so one
thing that we're getting ready to launch
soon is a job board and employers some
of them we've already hired our campers
are interested in posting
jobs that are in these jobs I mean I
could show you the job board should I
show them the job where does it not
totally trashed I don't think there are
any jobs on there currently but
basically they'll be here soon we've
already we just finished setting all
this up and whether it's not loading we
have all my followers and that on there
but basically this will be a place where
employers can post jobs and once they
post jobs campers who have the front-end
development certification in the full
stack development certification will be
able to apply for those jobs so they can
eat the employer can either require a
front-end development certification or a
full-stack development certification for
the employers it's a really good deal
because they are basically guaranteed to
get somebody who has strong skills
because there just aren't people that
complete free code camp that aren't good
at coding I mean it's like way too much
work it would be extremely hard unless
you plagiarized of course which any way
to complete your eyes and you sign an
academic honesty promising you don't and
we randomly sample and reserve the right
to strip away your certification if we
find out that you plagiarize so don't
blaze your eyes but I mean if you're not
plagiarizing like you are really really
strong after you complete the prime
development certification but you're
really really strong after you click the
full stack certification and then if you
go and complete those additional
nonprofit projects you're going to be so
strong that like I mean it's pretty much
inconceivable that you wouldn't be able
to get a job unless you were just a
total douche bag or something I think
you would have to have some really bad
people skills to offset the amount of
development experience and coding
ability that you have from completing
all that stuff and so far we haven't any
problems as you probably know people
nobody's actually completed all for
non-profit projects we have tons of
nonprofit projects that are waiting
we're ready to start those as soon as we
have campers that are able to tackle
them but in order to be able to tackle
them yet to complete the full stack
development certification so generally
what happens is people complete this
vacation they go get a job they complete
one of the projects they can get a job
we would like for people to actually
stick around and click the other ones
but if you're eager to get a job go
ahead and go get a job now this is going
to provide a way that free code camp can
essentially get some small amount of
money that like maintain operations and
servers and everything make sure that
like some of our core contributors have
burritos to eat and things like that and
are able to pay their rent and also it
will it'll help campers in terms of just
giving them a clear place they can go
where employers have basically signed on
to hire preco camp graduates people that
have completed our programs oh so I hope
that answered that question exhaustively
enough it also have to take chest as
well oh yes we did sell some t-shirts we
didn't put a huge boost behind the
teachers were just like your the
t-shirts um and I think we sold like 300
of them so if you haven't gotten your t
shirt in the mail you should get it soon
if you want a t-shirt we're going to do
some other t-shirts they won't be quite
like a one thing people said was the
t-shirts were a little expensive they
were twenty-five dollars plus tax and
shipping I think they were a little
cheaper in Europe but if we do another
t-shirt campaign in the future which
we're not planning to do at this point
but one of the lessons I think is that
they should have been cheaper and that
even if it's not like incredibly high
quality made in America t-shirt from
american apparel people will still get
it if it's if it's a lot of cheaper so
we're hoping to basically make the next
campaign as cheap as possible but the
shirts that we sold that's essentially
like a limited edition if you did get
one of those congratulations you've got
the early adopter shirt and we're never
going to make a shirt exactly like that
again so props all rights million indeed
do we have any other questions from
the audience some people are saying they
would like to see a hoodie I'm green
socks green swords or they wanted I just
really thought they just want to be
modded is not ta 74 awesome for a form
my fakes got one okay and yeah cafepress
it's not that great like we found
another place that we will probably sell
it through instead of teespring will see
teespring had some problems sorry if you
had any problems with teespring those
are just a few t-shirts I didn't know
that um okay so i think i'm good place
to wind down unless anybody else has any
comments or closing questions Nathan if
you want to say anything witty at the
moment without anyone sesh for the after
shame so if I keep all my questions
enough to on your act over yeah what we
might do is there's this thing we can do
on twitch so we use this watch people
code sometimes watch people code calm
and I forgot to list us I guess
technically we were coding oh wait
somebody listed us thanks thanks Nathan
so we're going to go down here and we
can see I was twitch installs arch linux
we could broadcast that I don't know to
Ave topia live twitch game what is this
guy doing live switch game that doesn't
seem like programming oh I think what
we'll do is we'll stream twitch installs
archlinux unless anybody else wants to
stream so i think i can do that by doing
the host mechanisms which I'll do as
soon as I get off so just to be very
clear does anybody want to stream after
this anti-gay ah
ah one real quick question from Scotts J
we would love that thousands of
waypoints currently we have about 400
and we we really do think that there's
room for thousands like there's that
much stuff to be covered and st. Peter
is really leaving leading the charge on
this and of course me Ben Nathan a whole
bunch of people are going to continue
contributing to the waypoints because we
don't want to have that huge drop like
that you're all familiar I think
everybody's seen this oh yeah why
learning to code is so damn hard my
friend who founded the Odin project and
is now doing a boot camp called Viking
code school he wrote this blog post and
he talks about in it um he talks about
how like these tutorials like Codecademy
and you could argue that the frico can't
wait points kind of give you this
hand-holding confidence boost and then
suddenly you're faced with the blank
page and you go down this cliff and
you're like oh my gosh so hard to code I
thought I was so good at coding and
suddenly I had to actually code for real
and so so basically what we want to do
is we want to taper that off as much as
possible so that we can eliminate as
much of this cliff of confusion and
desert of despair as possible we it'll
probably be impossible to completely
eliminate that but we want to do what we
can to ameliorate it and that's the
purpose of us expanding our our way
points I'll go and post this another
chat can I can I say something on that
note cleansing sure and guys um that
that confusion that you might feel don't
be afraid of it it's not necessarily a
bad thing um you know a lot of times
like through school through a lot of
school and things like that like we're
given things to help us and we're given
a lot of resources learning to code is
pretty damn hard but you know if
everything would see
easy it would be as rewarding you know
you can't be in a position to true
succeed unless you're also in the same
position where you can truly fail um and
by family I mean not not learning the
code it's more you're going to get
errors and you're going to get
frustrated um you know cherish those
moments take time to actually study the
errors and take time to maybe analyze
and see where it's gone wrong when you
overcome that hurdle you're going to
feel a lot better about it but going
into the future those errors that you
can that you know those problems that
you buttered your head against for a
long time it's going to make you a more
efficient coder in the long run simply
because you have experienced that and
you'll be able to either avoid it or if
you do get that error you're going to be
able to just hammer it down real quick
and drive right past also don't be
afraid to skip thing to come back to
know if you're stuck like someone
bonfires a bit maxi require you to if
you've done 50 bonfire and you get to
like the orbit one and you actually
can't get your brain to think actually
work if I'm not fine just just give it
come back to it and because like the
whole go outside get your fresh air oh
geez yeah come over does have a lash ok
I'm being handed a baby jocelyn say hi
everybody so i'm going to i'm going to
go ahead and end the stream now and
we're gonna we're going to be posting
twitch installs Arch Linux which should
be a lot of fun it's a collaborative you
know everybody enters commands and try
not to enter you know our mrf star but
basically we really appreciate everyone
joining us and I think the message from
all of this this this article that i
pasted it into the chat just don't get
discouraged and just keep going as long
as you keep coding eventually you'll get
good I mean it's just a matter of
of practice really and and we want to do
everything we can to make you make this
as time and efficient as possible we
would love for you to go through this as
quickly as possible so you can go get a
job as quickly as possible but we're
never going to like pretend that
learning the code is easy we're never
going to tell you you can learn to code
in like 12 weeks because I simply don't
think that that's viable and I don't
think very many people that have learned
to code on their own or with an open
source community like ours have done so
in 12 weeks I think it's much more like
six months or nine weeks or nine months
at the very least and many people
including the famous there's an article
learn to code in 10,000 hours it's like
Lauren c plus plus and 10,000 hours i'm
going to paste that in real quick like
that it's a great article as well and it
just underscores how like this is a
complex profession yeah teach yourself
programming in 10 years because there's
this they're all these people that are
saying like oh you can learn to code in
a month or whatever and it's just
complete completely over-promising and
under-delivering and i think they're
setting a lot of people up for
disappointment so just just keep at it
everyone and I completely agree with
what Nathan said you're going to fail
and failing is part of the process of
getting good found a good thing and I
can stand with them it's like Josh and I
have to go to school work so i can take
some less F if someone stay on I can
hang around also all right well my
baby's kind of heating up to go start
crying so everyone thank you so much for
joining and have a beautiful weekend
happy coding and thank you again for all
your questions and for contributing to
free cocaine Cheers
do you guys that care folks hi everyone
beat a little bit i'm closing ok what's
