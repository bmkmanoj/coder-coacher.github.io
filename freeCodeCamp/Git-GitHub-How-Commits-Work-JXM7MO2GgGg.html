exactly a commit is now we talked about
a commit being a snapshot and that's
exactly what it is a commit is
represented by a forty character sha-1
hash and I wrote a couple little
shortened versions over here but in that
forty characters there's a lot more than
just numbers and letters there is a blob
of the changes so blobs represent files
so you may change in say two index.html
git stores a blob of that file which is
a reduced version of that code in a very
lightweight way it also includes some
metadata if that means who made the
commitment what time did they make the
commit and what's the parent commit you
know what's the commit that was made
right before this on this working branch
all of that information is stored and
compressed in that forty characters
sha-1 hash which means that commit ID is
very very important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
