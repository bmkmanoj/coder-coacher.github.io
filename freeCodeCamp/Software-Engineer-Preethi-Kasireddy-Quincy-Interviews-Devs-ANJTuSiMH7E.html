who is a software engineer who
previously worked as a venture
capitalist at Andreessen Horowitz and
she is going to tell us all about her
transition from finance into software
engineering welcome creepy thank you
glad to be here uh oh my god so where do
I start
so I did write a medium post about this
about exactly a year and a half ago
because that's when it happened
I was a partner at Andreessen Horowitz
so my job was to meet with entrepreneurs
every day and learn about what they're
building and then see if it was a good
investment for engies and Horowitz to
make and you know it was it was such an
amazing job because you learned from all
these entrepreneurs and you learned some
of the problems they're solving how
they're solving it technically socially
politically etc and so it was a very
mentally stimulating job obviously and
as I was meeting more and more these
entrepreneurs oh I finally realized that
hey actually this is what I want to do
the long term like I want to go and
build something really important for
this world and I had the entrepreneur
bug and the one skill said that I felt
like I was missing though was knowing
how to build my own product from ground
up this is something I really value i
when I when a founder I really value
people who can build the product from
ground up because it's you can really
envision the product in a much holistic
way rather than like outsourcing it
typically and if I was going to build a
startup I want to be like a core part of
who a core the one of the core
foundational developers I'm in the on
the team so then I was like okay so I
don't know how to code and so I was like
trying to learn how to code and I
started with like Python I used like the
book learn Python the hard way and it
was just too much to do while I was and
while I had a full-time job so I ended
up getting through six weeks of it and
then I just
dropped it slowly then I was like okay
maybe I need something more structured
so I joined like an online course a paid
online course like something like
lynda.com type stuff um and it went well
for the first four weeks again and then
what took over and then priorities other
priorities took over and I just like
kinda fell off ah this kind of cycle
went about like three or four separate
times and each time I was trying
something new to see like if anything
would click nothing really clicked I
then I realized hmm like I was really
good at science and I sorry math and in
college maybe I should do like more on
the data science route so I took a data
science course that one really well I
actually finished it but then I didn't
know what to do with that I was done
which course by the way it was on it was
on thankful and thankful has a really
cool model where you you pay you pay a
lot more but you get mentor that you can
talk to once a week and that really was
like such a key part of learning because
you're you inevitably get stuck when
you're learning how to code that's
that's all you're doing when you're
first learning you're always getting
stuck always frustrated and so it was
nice to have like that saving grace at
the end of the week be like here's
everything I got stuck on like I really
need help
whereas like if you're alone sometimes
it can be very daunting and that's why
you don't even want to come back to it
so then I realized there was something
key there with the mentor but I didn't
really want to do data science so then I
my boyfriend was like why don't you try
JavaScript it runs everywhere and it's
like you can use it anywhere and it's so
much easier I don't know why you're
learning Python and I was like I don't
know because I thought it was a good
language and so I tried JavaScript I
remember I stayed home from work that
day and I just went through ten hours on
Coursera sorry I'm I think it was the
Coursera or one of those codecademy
spend ten hours just going through the
JavaScript course and I like fell in
love like that's when I was like oh my
god this clicked and I was like ever
since that day
started doing more and more more
incrementally everyday and after three
months I had already built like my first
like website my first web application
and this is all just following tutorials
like treehouse or or a quote Academy or
like egghead IO like all these different
online things I'm just like following
along and learning as I go
and at some point at work I was actually
starting to find myself coding at work
too and like my boss one time walked
walked past me he's like what are you
doing there why do you have an editor
open shouldn't you be meeting with
entrepreneurs oh and I was like and
that's when I realize like I'm really
into this and and at some point I'd
loved it so much that I was like I want
to make this my day job I don't want to
have to rush home at night and like to
spend like two three hours on this every
night I want to I want to do this like
full-time I've always been someone who
like if I like something I'll do it a
hundred percent I can't really like do
half that half this I have a hard time
like multitasking and so I want to just
go all-in and I was like I'm very
impatient too I wanted to know this
everything I can like right away and so
I could have definitely take that a lot
of my friends were like just this you
know slowly learn take like a year or
two take your time don't don't do those
stupid boot camps like there are ways to
tie their raise the money you can learn
this on your own
and I was like I wasn't do one year and
let it go out the other year because I
knew I wanted this as fast as they can
so I started to like really take it
seriously
study law I applied to one of the boot
camps I got in and because I was able to
afford it I ended up going and just
spending the three months there and and
just like basically dedicating my whole
life to this whole transition and I got
out of it and it was like probably the
best thing that I best decision I made
ever and I came out with a skill set
that I didn't have before and that I
really really wanted and I got it faster
than I expected and I was learning at a
rate that I was like pretty shocked I
was like shocked in my own
so like how fast I was learning this and
it was merely because I just like loved
it and it was just like I would devour
this stuff so that happened and then
that was about exactly a year ago was
when I graduated hack reactor and then I
spent a few months actually just hacking
on my own I worked with an open source a
very well known open source author on an
up side project I worked on my own side
project I kind of want the like a few
months for the things I learned in hack
reactors to sink in and for me to
explore my own technical interests
before I go and get a job and so I did
that for a few months and then then I
went to go work at coinbase for a bit so
that's kind of my transition awesome and
along the way you wrote a lot like you
were a lot of great articles about
docker about how javascript modules work
about how the web works HTTP and and
rest what inspired you to take all these
things you were learning and channel
them into these these articles and share
them with the 'greater developer
community and the community of people
who are learning to code yeah sure so
one of the things I did before going
hack react before going hack reactor was
talk to like a bunch of people that went
through boot camps and I asked them what
advice it'd give me and they're like one
thing you should do is write because it
helps you learn to and is kind of I was
just like okay so maybe I'll try this
whole writing thing and I remember I
wrote my first article and it went
really well like the reception was
really well and people kept telling me
wow like you have a way of teaching that
I really enjoy you have a way of
explaining concepts there's very easy to
understand and so I realized I had
something there so I was like why not
just do this I'll continue to write
people seem to be getting value out of
it and I get value out of it too because
I learned this topic much better if I
have to write about it so that's kind of
how it started and then over time
honestly I just became obsessed with
writing like I I never thought I'd like
writing I like hated writing in school I
hated any like even like writing fancy
emails I hate what I used to
writing emails and now I enjoy writing
you know I read books on writing I read
techniques on writing he'd recommend
yeah on writing well it's probably the
best book ever and so right now it's
more it's because it started because
people just told me like Oh writing is a
good way to learn but now it's because
I'm finding that people I love teaching
and so this is my way of giving back to
the community and and helping other
people get up to speed people who are
struggling maybe or people who just
don't understand certain topics that I I
had a hard time with um and to because I
just genuinely enjoy writing and I want
to continue to become a better writer
and on the subject of teaching you are
teaching a new course on functional
programming yeah yeah well how did that
come about and what inspired you to
created an entire course just specific
to functional programming of all things
yeah sure um anticipating of course I've
always wanted to try it I want all my
blog posts I've just been like random
topics that I've learned that I want to
share with the world but I want to see
if I can create a cohesive course that
lasts for a long time and so that's the
reason I did the course approach instead
of a blog and I made it free and the
reason I chose functional programming is
because I think this is an interesting
time in the front end where we we kind
of started going functional about like
six seven years ago but then we drifted
into this Oh world
object-oriented world in the front end
so like backbone Ruby Ruby on Rails I
the original angular jQuery like it was
very object oriented and I think people
are trying to realize that with the
whole advent of react UJS all these new
front-end frameworks people are
realizing that like functional actually
makes a lot of sense for the fun end and
not not necessarily like purely
functional like people aren't trying to
bring half
go to the front end but they're trying
to use JavaScript in a much more
functional way because it offers a lot
of benefits and that's kind of what I
want to teach or at least give an
introduction to in this course because I
think it will be a huge ship it will
continue to shift over the next 10 10
years and will continue to see just more
of this and so I think it's important
for people to at least be prepared for
what's coming in the future and know why
it's useful and when it's useful because
realistically it's really hard to be
hundred percent functional it's just not
practical so it's just easier and better
in some cases but like there's it's also
important to know that there are certain
use cases where functional programming
does make things better for front-end
specifically where there's a lot of
state and all that and yeah that's the
reason why I chose functional
programming well how's the course going
so far you're doing it through emails
yeah all emails so it's it's a 10
lessons in total and they go out 1
lesson and then right after the lesson
you get like a 5 to 6 question quiz and
the quiz is optional obviously but you I
recommend that you take it just so you
can remember some of the concepts you
learned and it's completely free it's
all an email you get everything in your
inbox and all you have to do is like
read it so I would say probably takes
you like at most 5 minutes a day to read
one of those emails and you learn you by
the end of it you get like the the gist
of the basically the core tenants of
functional programming that's a goal
this the court so that you have a solid
foundation of like all these different
terms or principles that you might have
heard of in the wild like purity
immutability referential transparency
like with examples as well and like
caveats and then the goal is I'm also
creating a more full-length video series
at the end of the year and I want people
to use this course as like a foundation
to see if this is something interesting
to them and if they want to go deeper in
this area so that if when I actually
create the full course you'd be more
inclined and prepared to sign up for
that which will go into much more like
in-depth on each of these topics as well
as practical applications built using
these top practical funded applications
using these topics yeah and you have
written an excellent article that has
kind of a quick primer for functional
programming built into it that you use
to announce yeah yeah and and just so
everybody knows I've included a link to
that down below in the description so
click through check out that article and
sign up for preethi's course it it's
like she said it's completely free it's
not a huge time commitment and it just
comes right to your inbox so you don't
even have to remember to go do it you're
going to get a notification every day in
the form of an email and that
notification will double as the content
and then you're using are using like
Google Forms or something like that for
the quizzes uh type form type form
awesome you know quiz maker yeah uh so
one of the things you've really
emphasized and you wrote this really
important article last year that was
very popular and he got passed around
and a lot of development circles uh
which was learning how to learn and you
talked about how learning how to learn
is the most important developer skill
what brought you to that conclusion
um I think okay so first of all I'm
passionate about learning in general
because I think one of the things that
really bothers me is that no one teaches
you how to learn um when you're in grade
school when you're in kindergarten like
they teach you but no one teaches you
how to learn everyone kind of finds your
own way and that way could be a fish
efficient for you or that way might not
be the best way to study and this is the
problem I deeply care about and
something I really want to solve and
with that's kind of what I want to do
when I go out and build my product and
and so I realized that that same thing
applies to programming like people
people don't really teach you the
importance of like the fact that
learning as a skillset is
set itself like it's important to know
how to learn because things are
constantly changing and if you if you
don't know how to learn you're going to
just going to fall behind and it's not
like you have to spend 30 hours a week
learning new stuff it's there's just
it's a skill set that you gain and
learning new things becomes easier and
easier and easier it's just that you
need to gain that skill set and I
realize this because when I first
started programming certain things have
taken hours to learn and then over time
it would take me like maybe a few hours
and then over time I can get to a point
where right now if I want to learn a
technology I can just skim through the
docks for like a few minutes and get a
gist of it like I can skim through API
Docs for literally two minutes and get
the gist of what I mean what I need from
it and it's because I've built up the
skill on how to learn and and I think
that's such an important part of being a
developer because we're continuously
given chum we like people shove new and
new and technologies at us and we have
to keep up with all this stuff and you
don't know how to learn then you're
going to quickly get overwhelmed I think
for everyone who's watching who is
interested in learning how to learn more
effectively is there like a single tip
like low-hanging fruit where they could
go out and immediately start applying it
and learn a little bit quicker as a
result that's interesting a repetition
so there's no yeah there's no it's it's
I think especially for programming it's
repetition and like like actually
sitting there and doing what you're
learning I don't expect to learn by just
reading a bunch of books uh and
understanding code because that feels
like you're actually learning but not
that you're it's often the case that we
actually have to go code something that
you read you won't know how to code it
really or you'll get really stuck up on
some things I would say particularly
with programming it's like repetition
repetition until the concepts sink in
and and
even if you don't get it the first time
just keep going like even though it'll
always feel blurry at first like you're
just kind of like shoving you're just
trying to get something to work and
that's totally fine if you don't
understand how it works for you got it
to work then go back and be like how did
this actually work and then actually
understand it and it's almost 100% the
case that if you actually understand
what you just learned really well and
that will also apply to something else
that you learn in the future and it
becomes easy that's how this knowledge
builds up it just becomes increment eat
easier because you're incremental
building this knowledge up if you're
actually taking time to deeply
understand everything that you're
learning and then the next thing becomes
easier to learn and the next thing
becomes easier to learn at least that's
been my experience so kind of leveraging
the associative power of the human brain
and just the more things you have in
your mind the more relations you can
build yeah like focus on just learning
learning one thing at a time and don't
focus on knowing everything and then
over time it will automatically build up
you don't even have to think about it I
think like just pick something and learn
it too it's said until you get to the
end get to the end don't don't get
discouraged don't try something else
because someone else told you that's
better
it's like get to the end on a few things
and you'll see that the snowball starts
to form but it's important to just like
stick to one thing for a long time until
you actually understand it and learn it
and it sounds like with your adventures
into Python and to data science and
things like that you really that one
thing that you really stuck to was
JavaScript yeah so I exactly like I I
did really really try Python I didn't
really really try it in science but they
didn't work out but JavaScript it
something about it clicked and I I'm not
gonna give it up because it just feels
right and I know there's other languages
out there that are probably better or or
more suited for certain things but I
think it's important that it doesn't
matter what language I pick it's just
important that I get really really good
at it because there's that's that's just
that's just how it works like it doesn't
really matter what you do it just
matters like how well you actually do it
yeah so on the on the notes just
mastering a specific thing you're going
extremely deep into JavaScript you're
writing this functional programming of
course other any other projects that are
on the near horizon after you you finish
this functional programming video series
yeah I feel like the video series is
going to take up a lot of my time this
year because I am still in the outlining
phase once that's done I want to see how
that goes
I wanted to see the reception from the
community I'm becoming very passionate
about functional programming sÃ¶nke if I
if I'm still passionate about it by the
end of the year after finishing this
series I'll probably continue in that in
that route and if and honestly if the
audience is receptive to it if not
honestly who knows things things change
so much in a year as a developer your
interests are kind of like I think if I
only take it like two to three months at
a time because sometimes you you think
you might be interested in something but
you get really you get somewhat deep and
you're like oh okay maybe maybe I want
to take a slightly different angle and
so you make a slight turn and so you're
kind of just like taking taking the path
as you go so I don't know what I'll do
like next year but um I mean in a year
and a half I've come a long way so a
year from now feels like eternity yeah
well um thank you so much for joining us
prithi um thank you everybody from our
live audience for tuning in uh I've put
links to several of preethi's most
important articles below including her
announcement of her functional
programming email course so I strongly
recommend everybody check that one out
especially in sign up for it and of
course I strongly recommend you follow
her on Twitter she has some amazing
insightful tweets and I enjoy reading
them as they come in and thank you again
for doing this thank you have a
beautiful day
you too cheers everyone
