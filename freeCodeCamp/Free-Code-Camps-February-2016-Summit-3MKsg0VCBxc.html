start everybody with quick introductions
Rex you want to go first there everybody
a wreck shredder I'm a curriculum
developer and general dogsbody for a
freak okay great and Justin first of all
I'd like to introduce you since you are
brand new justin is our director guy in
charge of campsites we don't use very
formal titles around here and justin has
already done an amazing amount of work
on improving our campsites Justin why
don't you tell us a little bit about
yourself um what can I tell you my
graphic designer I'm trying to learn how
to code thankfully we got free code camp
for that and I'm currently in Toronto I
used to live in San Francisco as well
mmm I don't know I'm here to help you
guys whichever way can I am one of the
leaders for the Toronto campsites so
there's a little experience I can
provide in that sense wonderful thank
you Justin Brianna hello I'm Brianna I
am a contributor to free code camp with
the video curriculum with those short
little videos to help with some computer
science theory and beyond i also am a
user of free code camp trying to get my
javascript and web development skills up
to up to a point where i can do that
professionally great and brooke Lee hi
everyone my name is Berkeley i am the
developer guy here at people can all
right wonderful and berkeley and i are
in san francisco brianna is ensure paint
champaign-urbana justin is in Toronto
and Rex is in what is those really there
Rosa ok it's a Roseville up near
Sacramento okay wonderful in California
all right well I think we're going to
launch right into it berkeley
is going to talk a little bit about our
Spanish curriculum and go straight to
demo so berkeley i'm going to give you
I'm gonna make You presenter alright
Brookley take it away yeah so we can't
finish awesome can you get a few nipping
now again come on oh alright so free
crack free code camp is launching an
initiative to be a little more
international friendly so we're doing is
we're relocating all urls to be
namespace to be specific language so if
you can view my screen here the URL this
is live on vader right now we've added
here the small little language
abbreviation here all this does is it
tells us which language to you prefer
now it's going to take a little a little
bit more work to get this perfect right
now it's pretty close so if you go
launch to free cooking right now equal
English we're going to have the ability
for you to select which language you
want and if that languages supported
you'll be all might be redirected to
corporate language at the moment where
are you supporting English and we're
very close to launching Spanish Spanish
i believe is almost completed that rifle
yes that's correct basically everything
is translated i think there are a few
little challenges that could use a quick
update but i think everything has a
translation now awesome so we're room of
their probably watch it this weekend as
you can see your house is the standard
free coke count all right that's the
regular no translation then if you just
change this URL here tes which is a
spanish abbreviation and see that it
automatically changes the header and the
description of the challenge these are
translated by human being
computers are actually much better than
what Google canoed but i'm sure that
google will will eventually beat us at
some point yeah i don't know if we have
any questions we're really close to
launching what see was the second
language that we were launched Brazilian
Portuguese see which is very similar to
like European Portuguese from what I
understand Portuguese Portuguese
portugal portuguese i think is what they
call it oh I think there are actually a
lot more Portuguese speakers in Brazil
yeah we've got a lot of campers in
Brazil working on that as well yeah so
our language initiative is driven I it
contributors a freak okay so really
looking for people who are have the
language skills to translate these
challenges so that we can launch launch
the languages as soon as they're almost
one hundred percent coverage for the
challenges all right wonderful so
Berkeley about how long do you think
it'll be before that's live live there's
a couple bugs a figure out but it should
be live by the end of the weekend
awesome so look for spanish language
challenges by the end of the weekend
thank you very much for your hard work
on that berkeley i would like to also
acknowledge Vladimir tomara and his team
for their hard work on the Spanish
language translation and I'd like to
also acknowledge the Russian campers the
Chinese campers Taiwanese campers and
the the Brazilian campers of course that
are also working actively very heavily
on on these translations so if you're
interested in contributing to the
translation for free coke camp which I
see people already asking in chat what I
would recommend you do is go to
get ur dot I am / free code camp /
translators I believe is the yeah well
just I'll just paste this into chat and
then I'm gonna ask my wife and she can
move the baby to a different room in
case you all can hear that one second ok
so the chat is right here okay great
alright so um next I'd like to hand
things over to Brianna to talk about the
video challenges and I'm going to go
ahead and make Brianna the presenter
here all right Austin so we'll just take
a second finishing up here here we go
alright so the video challenges are
something that we have been talking
about for a long time um you guys see my
screen yes okay fantastic so the video
challenges they were called hikes so if
you remember talking about hikes the
same thing with a new name I'll just
short like between one minute 45 minutes
videos with a true/false check for
understanding at the end these videos
are meant to be for people with no
background in computer science and
they're also something that should be
viewable on mobile devices so that
people who don't have access to a
computer all the time things will keep
learning and working so what I'm sharing
right now is on the beta site and this
is what it will look like right now the
current categories are through your
basics sonam JavaScript lingo chrome dev
tools and Big O notation and she'll just
for example about some of the things
that you can learn about and some things
that I talked about our arrays loops
none of it is super in detail some of
you have already checked out on youtube
so if it isn't enough for a while so
when you click on one of these if you
click on IP addresses you know these
challenges that I'm looking at now
our live on free code camp com it's not
working on the descent perfectly yet so
if you expect a both we just process it
give it a little bit of home before it's
totally worth it should be a lot of in
just a second I'll be right back okay oh
we get started you should be wiser than
just a second I'll be right back okay
you only get started okay I think it's
live now so when you click on this if
you want a computer you oh wait still
showing my strict okay I you can choose
you also hold something like this okay
here's my wife works right though the
bell on this if you want a computer even
a review of the way of talking about I'm
here to put on the reason I home to
audience and then like me with a
question this part is really when i'm
excited to renewable what are these felt
you so question one IP addresses are
necessary to use and participate in the
internet true and so it'll be like a
swipe right swipe left and it's just one
or two questions um and then it'll take
you to the next one and it gives you a
little thing you make you did this
challenge and you can move on the most
exciting thing about this is that i
think there's a lot of room for
communities so i'm going to take my
window here to this medium article but
i'm going to share in the chat um this
is a good place to answer any of the
questions of how you can contribute this
isn't like i'm going to be the only
person up there you've already gotten
contributions I want sure Don grooms and
James Whitaker are working on a theory
about discrete mathematics it looks
awesome I know more about a discrete pic
now just from working them and they did
after graduating college um erica is
working on experience architekten
category and Anthony's working on a web
category so a lot of ways these is
interviewed check out that medium
article this what doesn who else you
wanna chat is the war room for get ur
room for the hikes it's called home
fittingly calls a technologist either
way pop in there if you're interested in
contributing and we can touch bait and
get it goin final link xamon if you take
a look at the github repository on free
code camp for hikes the readme is a
really simple explanation and kind of
outline of what we have so far and then
where we need help so if you were
interested in recording some these
videos and writing some scripts for
these these are where we could use your
help anything is Calla sized is
something that we want to add um so it
goes from tools like gulp and grunt do
web design agile software engineering
data like everything additionally if
there's any um any topics that aren't on
here that's something we want to expand
also the expansion for this type of
curriculum is limitless not only do we
want to add a lot more categories and
things but so like earlier we're looking
at the Spanish site a free code camp
having these videos recorded by somebody
who speak Spanish or Portuguese
Brazilian Portuguese would extend this
education to so many people and helped
so many people to learn really on the
point n ill too much time or effort to
put in you can really do a lot um once
you get going with these so if you want
to contribute please touch base in any
of those links i just sent in to chat on
because i think this is going to be a
really cool feature of free code camp
I'm gonna look and see if there's any
questions in the chat something about
removing camping references yes camping
references are going ok just video
challenges for these but yep that's
that's what we've got there anything
else from from you guys maybe I missed
okay to recap what Brianna said so if I
may so first of all these are already
live and we're going to have more live
soon we are hoping to get more
contributions from campers I can go
ahead and quickly on my side show what
are what it looks like our video
challenge repo right which is github
hikes the rules okay and I'll just kind
of scroll through these real quick so
we've got we're hoping to cover
accessibility agile computer science
concepts data visualization databases
DevOps embedded and the Internet of
Things game development gamification
machine learning math for programmers
mobile java script development software
engineering principles statistics which
is part of like a data science core
tools and then UX design and visual
design so we we have a lot of ambition
for what we'd like to do with these
video challenges and we would love your
help scripting them recording them and
potentially recording them in different
languages so just a typical kind of MOOC
whiteboard setup where you would be in
front of a whiteboard talking and you
would have a script that you kind of
loosely follow and you just diagram like
Briana I've been doing all right and
with that I'd like to hand it over to
Rex to talk about the wiki Rex I'm gonna
make You presenter here
okay okay so you should be soon soon
though screen so we've we've actually
presented this before in various formats
but what we want to do is we want to
move away from github hosting of the
wiki pages and instead go to our own
website this for a couple reasons the
first is that there are a number of
limitations on the github pages that
doesn't support name spacing and in
particular it doesn't support a
multi-language so we should have very
shortly here the same sort of language
name spacing for the wiki pages that we
do on the main site and so we are
looking for people who are interested in
translating some or all of the wiki
contents we have about 500 articles I
don't know that all of them necessarily
need to be translated but there's a lot
of good information here we also now
have the same sort of article search
that we did before and this is
significantly faster than the github
page because it's all react ified and so
you can just click and go so we're
hoping to have this up by the end of the
weekend as well as so that when you
click on the wiki page it'll take you to
this interface and we should have it
integrated with the full site so you
have a regular nav bar and so on this is
just a proof of concept right here so if
you are interested in contributing to
the to the translation effort we have a
wiki page on git er all that up so you
can just hop in there and we should have
instructions in the wiki page we should
have a wiki article about how to
translate the wiki on the wiki shortly
so that's what I've got mm-hmm wonderful
thank you very much Rex for walking us
through the wiki um next I would like to
talk briefly about Franco camps
a lot of people like the by far the most
common question I get on personally on
Cora and that people ask in emails and
seem to ask in chat is how can freako
can't be free now people people
frequently asked like how does free
cookie and support itself we don't
accept donations we don't have any sort
of venture capital funding or angel
funding I've turned down a little bit of
funding just because I want to keep free
coke camp completely neutral and make
sure that we have as few people that
we're accountable to aside from our
community itself really so a lot of
people have asked how do we pay for
servers and how does Quincy Larson pay
for his microwave burritos and things
like that and so that's a good question
so far we've just funded everything out
of my savings we do have a job board
which honestly because we keep expanding
the curriculum we haven't had a lot of
we haven't actually had a lot this is a
reacting so it's just going to keep
struggling we haven't had a whole lot of
job postings yet because we don't have a
lot of campers that have actually
completed all the certifications for the
record I think something like maybe like
50 people have completed the backend
certification and about 500 have
completed the front-end development
certification and like maybe five or ten
have completed the data visualization
certification so far and then of course
as far as nonprofit projects are going
we still have many of those going on but
in order to get to those you have to
complete the three previous
certification so because our curriculum
has gotten a little bit longer it's now
2000 hours a lot of people were taking a
long time to get there but our eventual
goal is of course to have a flourishing
job board it's just that we wanted to
have a job board on our own
we didn't want to have just a generic
job board so as a result you know in the
shorter term like we basically have no
revenue or anything and at the same time
we have a lot of people asking us for
things like laptop stickers for t-shirts
and things like that so we have decided
to create a shop so effective probably
later today on the top navigation which
does not have very many links at all we
try to keep this as simple as possible
with no drop downs or anything we are
going to add a shot button and currently
the only thing in our shop is this a
free code camp function call logo
t-shirt that's on kind of a dark fruit
code camp green and it is a 100-percent
cotton unisex t-shirt that is available
until februari 15th which is about nine
more days and if you want to go get one
its twenty dollars shipped in the US and
we're going to open up an EU campaign
that we should have a link to shortly
which will be inexpensive shipping for
people in Europe as well right now the
shipping internationally on this one is
a little bit expensive but I'm going to
go ahead and share this link in the chat
for everyone who's interested and this
is a way that you can get some cool free
code camp schwag and also support our
community and help pay those growing
server costs
and somebody immediately said I'd like
to have it without the word just just
the the big bonfire logo as people have
began calling it and yeah we're going to
we're going to create a lot of t-shirts
in fact we welcome your designs if you
want to submit designs if any of you are
artists visual artists or graphic
designers or people that are generally
good with typography and iconography and
and coming up with cool illustrations
please submit those we're very
interested in printing t-shirts we would
love to have kind of a bake-off with a
lot of different designs frequently to
determine what our next t-shirt is going
to look like for example so we welcome
all of your designs as well going
forward and we hope that you'll pick up
one of these cool shirts and pick up one
for your significant other if you're
interested or for your kids we have men
all different kinds of sizes here and
they will ship within 10 days so again
in the future our shop is going to have
a lot of other stuff of artery ordered a
whole bunch of free code camp laptop
stickers with which Justin did the
design for thank you very much Justin
and that should be available within the
next few days as well our goal this time
around is the last time a lot of people
said that the t-shirt was a little bit
too expensive last time I think was $25
for a shirt plus shipping which came up
to like twenty nine dollars in the u.s.
in like thirty five dollars
internationally which is really
expensive for a t-shirt so the last time
our reasoning for making it expensive
was that's what teespring told us to do
they said this is a suggested price for
a t-shirt but we decided like a you know
16 bucks is really cheap it's like nine
dollars cheaper than it used to be and
you know hopefully you know we'll make a
lot less money per shirt but hopefully a
lot more people will buy shirts because
they'll suddenly be a lot more of four
so if you all have any questions or
suggestions for t-shirt campaigns going
forward in terms of what you'd like to
see on t-shirts whether you'd like to
see hoodies or other things like that
actually we can create a little poll
real quick we have time let me go to
move on which is our little twitch bot
and I'm going to create a poll so um
perhaps a Berkeley Brianna Justin you
can help me out a little bit we need to
figure out what kinds of things we want
to have on this poll so what are some
items that people might be interested in
I'm going to throw one out right away
that a lot of people in tech are
interested in hoodie yeah I just add
that as an option okay a lot of people
pants I personally would love some
freako to camp pants I don't know if
anybody actually makes custom pants
water bottle although Justin saying once
they're saying mugs on the chat logs
yeah also t-shirts for like women and
men's t-shirts I like having a
distinction right to be on well
definitely consider doing that um like
only the unisex shirts were available at
the price here that we were looking at
and we wanted to wanted to do like a
cheaper run we can do like a more
expensive run with like women sized
later lately oh caps jeff has mentioned
sock several times if we could do custom
socks that would be awesome goodies or
like nice socks I don't have both either
way so do people used to still use mouse
pads we could do potentially a mouse pad
thing so keep in mind like whatever we
get will probably have to keep in
inventory so we want to make sure like
ideally it's stuff that is easily
shipped especially internationally
because more than half of our campers
are overseas now polo shirts I love
wearing polo shirts so
I'll add that it'd be a little bit more
expensive but that would be awesome have
a little stitched bonfire logo in the
area ninja that'd be awesome alright so
I've just opened it up real quick and
everybody can vote with the bang
vote-bank vote and then like one of
these five different options we'll just
see what what people are interested in
in terms of schwag going forward um I
don't know whether we've sold any of
these yet I'm personally going to buy
one as soon as I can hide my credit card
information I don't want to do it while
everybody can see my credit card
information alright looks like we've
already reached our minimum goal so
thanks everybody for for buying these
t-shirts I don't know exactly how many
we sold but it's only been like publicly
available for like three or four minutes
here okay great I see the votes rolling
in will just take a moment and let
everybody vote team plushies that would
be cool maybe like he-man action figures
where we put Justin said on it I would
definitely have an awesome he-man like
Rex whipping poseable arms and
everything maybe like a little bobble
head maybe yeah oh there there
complaining and chap that I don't move
on on the stream he just not you uh we
need to like put some bristles in your
seat or water rope what do you boo all
you're gonna tell my mom texted me and
she said she's watching and she says
that we chef freaking free code camp
computer totes and she's like guys don't
use totes do that and I was like that's
a great way for women to advertise that
they're free code camp users we can have
like a nice computer total is free again
Thank You ivy for that one shutout mom
awesome Wow Briana's mom is watching my
parents may be watching too I just
recently found out my dad started
posting on Quora so I'm gonna be like my
I've set aside of my my Saturday
afternoon to read some of his recent
koro posts that's awesome
yeah alright so I think we've probably
got enough votes in this is not like a
scientific poll or anything please don't
think that we're this is going to
dictate our future behavior this is
merely a curiosity and will potentially
guide us but we can see right off the
bat mugs huge hoodies huge caps kind of
the smallest of these socks has a decent
chunk and then a lot of people just
didn't use a valid vote it doesn't look
like caps ish oh yeah caps is here okay
great so first of all we can see that
quite a few people voted because it's
showing me like this small percentage so
what we're going to do is code nonprofit
he's probably watching and he is going
to he's going to throw down the Europe
campaign he's going to throw open the
Europe campaign and he's going to post
that link in chat and when you go to
shop I've already got it it just links
to the hash mark right now but it will
actually linked to the European campaign
and that'll be available soon so like
I'm gonna seriously investigate how we
can make some mugs because it's clearly
clearly a camper favorite here in the
meantime again I'll just paste this link
one more time see spring and we'll have
that live soon you can continue to vote
we're not going to shut down the pole
for a while I'll just reference it
toward the end all right so let's take a
look at the agenda real quick and next
I'd like to hand it over to Justin to
talk a little bit about camp sides
Justin can we go ahead and share your
screen um I'm not sure what I need to
show you could show the the wiki article
that has the campsites the entire list
of campsites i'll go ahead and show your
screen real quick cool
you may have to download something oh
yeah this search box is really helpful
by the way bricks I guess by the way
bricks Justin Brianna and Berkeley can't
actually see my screen in order to
preserve man with I'm not sharing it
okay great so we've got a Justin screen
live okay okay so um ass off right now
we have 938 campsites on this list
that's a whole lot of people yeah in
fact I just received notification about
the last one from Greece I'm gonna add
it into the list and a few minutes after
we're done with this um I'm sure most of
the people who are watching this are
probably already in the roofs and the
Facebook groups if you're not please
join join them it's an amazing source of
resources some of your local campsites
may not have links but you can be the
first one posting them you obviously
haven't seen the one we have here in
Toronto we keep on sharing articles
pretty much three four times a day
everybody posts everybody asks or
reviews on their portfolios the meetings
are also really important when you go
out is not only to attend the class or
to hang out with people ah clearly it's
just sitting down chillin coding
learning together it's an amazing
experience um what else can I tell you
there's the group's the we've removed or
we don't mmm the organization removed
the city groups like the chat rooms but
on the Facebook thing we can still do it
we are on the Toronto campsite we just
keep on chatting over the facebook and
we resolve each others house furthermore
if your campsite if you detect that it's
inactive
people are not posting and stuff and
even the admin sir are kind of sleepy
maybe you can take over it just reach
out we can get together and get you
going again I don't know what yes Justin
how many like what percentage of these
campsites would you say are like highly
active like Toronto mmm highly highly
yet active i would say about a
twenty-five thirty percent but you said
like toronto we we have activities all
the time we actually have three local
campsites Toronto has also a couple of
like borrows and we are constantly
hosting every week every few days we
have different events a few settings are
like that there's um shout out for
accessible in Japan there's a couple
more I just the names are kind of
escaping my mind right now but i would
say about thirty percent a lot of the
camp camp sites however are limited to
just trying to meet but they never
actually end up doing it and you should
you should you have no idea how much it
helps meeting with like-minded people
and sharing doubts and trying to figure
out things together pretty cool all
right well um again thank you very much
Justin for joining us and for taking
over our as basically our head of
campsites you'll see Justin he'll
probably gradually join all the
different campsites and you probably
already talked to him if you recently
created a campsite he was the person
that went and added it to the list and
everything yeah so a lot of people have
added me and and they also have friended
me on on facebook I see there's a couple
of questions here on the chat maybe I
should answer them um you leading those
meetings but yeah usually we do I mean I
should be there right now I just decided
to stay behind because well this but I'm
about to meet him in a few minutes
they're currently meeting up and they're
probably watching right now um it helps
a lot or go to
yeah people just saying exactly the same
thing it helps a lot it sounds like it's
going to be awkward and what a drag
having to go out there and stuff but
it's not so much about meeting the other
people which is awesome in itself it's
about having other people on the same
process and knowing that whenever you
get stuck it's normal it'll it happens
to all of us so just come out come out
let's join great and I'd like to open it
up to any other questions anyone has in
chat for Rex again I'll just do a quick
introduction Rex is in charge of our
curriculum Justin's in charge of our
campsites Briana's in charge of our
Theory curriculum are our video
challenges and Berkeley's in charge of
our general code base and open source
project so if you all want to just does
I haven't been monitoring the chat
closely they're probably been a lot of
good questions that have come in though
there's a question here about the
algorithm stuff being being super hard
and that's kind of a like a problem
everywhere like I've always heard that
that the algorithms class is is the
maker break class for computer science
and that's just because it's hard it is
difficult to do we've tried to increase
the difficulty and the depth of the
basic JavaScript and we did that it'll
be at the beginning of the year rolled
out a bunch of new waypoints but at some
point you're going to need to apply
those and that's just kind of how it
goes i think that that's where things
like the campsites and the chat room
really are helpful to try and and get
you over the hump to get you into
applying those tools that you've learned
we're of course going to continue to try
and improve our curriculum the best
weekend but at some point that's you
know the rubber is going to beat the
road there's a great article which I
will link in
chat here called why learning to code
it's so damn hard and this really rings
true with a lot of people it's just it's
sort of the nature of learning to
program and you know I don't think that
it's necessarily a bad thing that it's
hard I think that if we acknowledge that
it's difficult thing and that if we
apply ourselves and just keep at it you
can definitely get through there's sort
of this misguided notion that some
people are cut out to be programmers and
and other people are not and that is
just not true there's plenty of research
and evidence that shows that anybody
that is willing to apply themselves and
put the time into learning something can
learn it and you know it may take some
people longer than others but but I
absolutely believe that everybody who is
listening to this and and anybody who
wants to learn to code can learn
together so those may be a little bit
longer do you expect but it's something
I'm very passionate about I believe that
firmly that's what a big part of why I'm
involved in the curriculum development
here free cooking yeah I agree with you
yeah like you said meeting up with other
people going through the same thing it's
it's helpful knowing that everybody's
going through the same learning curve
and hitting those blood loss and going
down and up it's just it makes all the
difference in the world so somebody
asked if we can add a timer button to
see if we test ourselves see how fast we
solve the challenges and I actually
don't I don't know that that's a helpful
thing to do it's the same reason why we
don't try and judge the efficiency of
code and we actually don't encourage
people to go back and redo challenges or
algorithms that they've already
completed really moving forward and
using the code especially later on when
you're doing practical exercises is a
much better way to learn than to rehash
what you've already done
you know and and I don't I don't know
that there's any significant value and
how fast you've completed something I
guess you can get yourself a chess clock
and and give it a try yeah i mean i
would certainly echo that I I encourage
you to take as much time as you need
don't worry about speed speed is not
something that's gonna like speed might
be rewarded in an interview where you're
under like time pressure and there's
certainly an argument that like a really
a good developer can can solve problems
faster than a less good developer
however like when you're learning I
don't think that that comes into play at
all you can certainly go back and like
time yourself on the challenges later
and during our whiteboard code interview
training that we're going to launch in
the near future that you know speed and
pacing could certainly be a factor
because I mean the real there's a real
human element when you're in front of a
white board writing out an algorithm and
your interviewer is getting impatient
because you know she needs to go to
lunch or she's got another interview
immediately afterward and I can affect
the interview certainly so but in
practice in the workforce like speed is
certainly not the most important thing
that you want to optimize for I think
readability and maintainability a code
is far more important than then either
writing it fast or giving it to execute
faster and unless it's like in like you
know a loop within a loop within a loop
if you'd like it if it's in the inner
loop of course you want to optimize it a
little bit that it's interesting you
like it's it's funny we have a sort of
the code golf is is a thing where people
try and write this show to shortest code
possible and you also have things like
code fights or whatever which are
encouraging you to solve problems
quickly but I think that both of those
things are almost an typical to good
programming practices the most important
thing when you're writing code that
you're going to share with any other
human being is that it's readable by
other people and that it's maintainable
by other people I your
you only get to write your code once you
don't get to go back and rewrite it a
bunch of times and you may have you know
two or three other people maybe even 100
other people looking at your code and if
they can't understand it or it takes
them a bunch of time to read it then
you've almost failed as a programmer
it's not just enough to solve the
problem correctly but to solve it in a
way that other people can read it so for
change needs to come they can make that
change and I think the thing that really
made me get religion on this is that
I've been maintaining my own code I
wrote some macros that are used by my
co-workers and and I would come back and
look at code that I written like five
years ago I my what what was I doing I I
literally cannot read my own code it's
it's it's almost embarrassing but it
made me it made me better at writing
comments in my code and in structuring
my code so that I could understand what
I actually had done yeah perhaps if the
time is such an important matter that
there's a good project you could build
like build a timer right well you know
pomeroy o'clock is I don't know how many
people actually use their Pomodoro
clocks I certainly use other campers 4
o'clocks if I want to do a pomodoro I
just you know pull actually oh let me
show that this is so cool one of our
campers evaristo just just wrote this
Roku yeah check this out you can search
all the different zip lines that have
been completed and submitted it takes a
minute to spin up but basically it's
like every so wrote this and so if I
want to look for for example Palme d'Or
oh I can look through and like see all
these different um pomodoros and their
stats like how many like this one jeff
store box has been viewed sixteen
thousand times that's pretty impressive
of course Jeff store Beck is
some but you can see like they're just
like a time like I I'll just grab Ashley
drop those real quick Ashley Drake's you
know I'm being refactored so I presume
that this still works yeah so works and
it's got like this cool big you know
concentric circle or not concentric
circles what's the opposite of
concentric anyway uh yeah this is a
really cool tool for you to get
inspiration on other people's stuff and
and use these polymer clocks I didn't
mean to pull us too far away from the
topic of coding quickly versus coding
slowly actually I think if you if you
google coding slowly there have been
like Abby's n-type posts that have done
really well on medium about you know
taking time to write like actually being
a bad typist is it good for your code
because you sit around and think more
than rather than type and of course yeah
yeah totally me somebody asked if
mechanical keyboards are good for coding
I have heard that they're better for
typing which I guess makes them better
for coding but they're not better for
your for anybody that's sitting near you
it is like thundering a good way to side
is to have I used to have one of those
old school buckling spring and I really
liked typing on it but it sounds like a
machine gun going in my you got so I
guess it if you don't have people that
will kill you if you use it then they're
probably great alright so we've got some
questions I've just been kind of taking
notes as we go through here so um some
good questions that have slit kind of
flowed through the chat recently ok
European shirts are live that's the
update of the minute um it looks they
look very similar I think they're the
exact same as the one that we were using
on the other one and i think the
shipping will be significantly cheaper
for our international campers in europe
and africa and maybe even in Asia
awesome so let me take a moment to just
belt out some quick answers to some of
these questions first of all the d3
react and sass challenges those are
coming very soon hopefully in March our
goal was to just get the projects ready
by new years so that people would be
able to start working toward the
certifications of course somebody else
asked a question which is very closely
related to this actually is free code
camp enough should i be using other
external resources certainly we want to
be enough we want to have we want to be
the most comprehensive web development
resource on the internet we want to put
you know w3 schools in the number two
slot one of you google something instead
of number one like it is currently and
i'm hoping that the Mozilla developer
network and put it down to number two
before we do but you know like we
certainly want to be an exhaustive
resource but I mean we have to be
realistic like development is extremely
deep you're going to be using things
like stackoverflow for sure you're
probably going to be making extensive
use of the documentation so some sites
that i would recommend real quick dev
docs I 0 is amazing and it's a very well
built app think it's an angular app
actually and you can actually download
it and use it offline and everything and
they constantly have these updates and
this actually pulls the official
documentation and it's searchable and
sortable it's it's great so I would
definitely be using external resources
in short you can also use online courses
Coursera EDX have great great free
courses that are taught by university
professors that will help you fill in
some of your theoretical gaps somebody
asked me this question the other day
oh yeah here I'll just paste in somebody
asked on Korra like why aren't there
more free technical books well actually
there's a great list of free technical
books which I'm going to attempt to open
right here and I mean you can see that
it's got literally every language under
the Sun and it's you know if you needed
to learn get for example there of course
with plenty of paid resources for
learning it as well but before you
resort to paid resources I encourage you
just take a look at the free resources
out there because these are things that
people have taken you know tremendous
amount of time and energy to create and
then have just released for free which
to me is just like yay like they want
they they're not in pursuit of money
they're in pursuit of helping people
essentially when you take a resource and
you make it completely free and then you
know there are tons of other you know
back-end languages on here a lot of HTML
CSS resources that you can use in
addition to free code camps resources
one thing I'll tell you about free code
camp is we strive to be as time
efficient as possible and that often
means leaving out details that we think
are not as important you know like for
example I'd go ahead I think the way
that I would put it is that is that
we're trying to prepare you with a basic
understanding of the concepts so that
when you do need to learn something on
your own and and let's face it you are
going to need to learn much of this on
your own there's we're in a rapidly
developing field and there are always
new technology is coming up so we're
trying to give you a basic understanding
so that you can go out and pick up the
material on your own right this is right
I don't know that any one resource could
truly be exhaustive but we can try and
give you that baseline understanding
so that you can then continue your
education on your own I mean this is all
about learning how to learn and and how
to get yourself you know prepared for
the for the real world a lot of the
additional kind of like so so I would
say I envision our curriculum first of
all free coke camps all about coding
which is just a subset of technology in
general if you think about the design
there's you know digital marketing is
one thing that is really useful and
understanding of like search engine
optimization for example there are a lot
of other areas of Technology there's
hardware there's embedded we're focusing
purely on coding specifically web
development which is just a small
segment of the overall knowledge it just
happens to be generally the most useful
for going out and eating a job that said
there's a ton of theory as well and
there's also there are also a lot of
additional facts that are useful but not
everybody doesn't need to know those
those are the sorts of things you look
up you would google how to for example
set up you know domain using Heroku and
using you know Go Daddy is your provider
or one of the other popular domain
registrar's is your provider for example
you would look up a quick tutorial when
you need it to just in time it's not
something that somebody needs to sit
down and teach you in advance of you
needing it so there's always going to be
this just-in-time learning that we want
to prepare you to be able to do the main
thing we want to do is just give you a
ton of practice of coding with our core
curriculum and then our video challenges
are going to teach you kind of the
ancillary theory think of our video
challenges is like a Coursera course
digested into two minute segments that
that doesn't have like a whole lot of
homework assignments it's just very
casual you can watch it on the go that's
how Briana has been doing it to where
you don't need to take notes or anything
you just watch it the content density is
not such that you're constantly pausing
it and taking notes you're just
listening in
you know we don't want to overload you
with these and then the wiki of course
which is going to be multilingual will
span a wide array i mean we could easily
have tens of thousands of articles on
different aspects of javascript HTML CSS
and other tools and also on you know
docker and other kinds of technologies
that you might use I can see the wiki
and the video challenges embracing the
long tail if you will so I can see some
some funny stuff is being said in chat
as I gone Quincy needs to hide from his
child but they wanted they want to get
you an office I said no no your height
your safe in your closet my closet is we
call it the fortress of the fortress of
solitude you know it doesn't have these
crystal spikes everywhere but it feels
like it's like I'm Superman this is bad
i mean is small and humble as it may be
um reactance ass challenges Rex do you
want to talk about that just a little
bit so we have some infrastructure
dependencies for all three of those
challenges and Berkeley is Berkeley does
not scale right Berkeley's been working
on internationalization he's been
rocking working on reactie fication so
there are things that we need to get in
place before we can do each of these I
think that the ones that were closest to
completing are the sass challenges akira
lane one of our campers and issue mods
has actually written most of the SAS
challenges and we mainly just need to
have an obstruction in place to test
them so i think that's going to be
that's going to be the big thing is is
can we test these I don't know that
we're as far along on d3 and react that
curriculum but I would expect to say the
first would be the SAS material coming
up
awesome uh streaming Brianna do you want
to talk about this question that Maddie
l0 22 asked is there a centralized place
where we keep a schedule of campers who
are streaming currently know there is a
git er room let you find that the link
now it's free code can't flash live
coding and the usually Septimus names
Wesley but on guitar Hugh Septimus and
you can see him in that chat room or
myself we can help get you set up if
you've never done it before but right
now there's no formalized schedule
that's a topic that has come up a lot
but really so far there hasn't been a
need for it so far there's you know
something like this event is really
consistent on Saturday mornings first as
a month but other than that if you just
hop in the chat room hop on twitch see
if anybody's already on if nobody's
streaming just asking the chat room for
anybody planning on it and announce that
you're going to and then then you're
welcome to stream on the channel once of
course you go through those steps
earlier to get set up and make sure you
read the Terms of conduct and things
like that but we would love to have more
streamers like ideally I think it'd be
awesome I know Quincy think has
mentioned this and Wes it to have
streamers 24-7 always some kind of code
going on where people can extend that
community to if they want to watch
somebody and interact that way so if
you're interested message me on Gator or
Septimus on Gator and we'll help you get
set up I know wes is also working on
some wiki articles to help streamline
that front part of that process oh great
thank you very much Brianna and by the
way we did try having a master calendar
at one point and honestly I think people
there's just like a barrier to entry
people are intimidated by the concept of
getting on and streaming in front of you
know generally if you stream on free
code camp you probably can have at least
20 viewers at any given time and it's
intimidating but if you're interested in
streaming just jump on general
all is like yet we just have one very
simple rule which is like if somebody
streaming you wait until they're done or
you messaged them and ask if you can
start streaming you don't try to like
start screaming when they're streaming
in fact I don't even know if you can and
that you don't like you know block of
course the big live stream like the one
we're having right now one one question
that Bobby wrath asked is other plans
for a mentorship kind of program where
people can go to people individually for
help mentorship is great but I think in
the real world you don't learn from any
specific individual you learn from a
community of individuals we have the
saying it takes a village to raise a
child and one of the things you're going
to need to learn to do as a professional
is to use the people around you as a
resource rather than trying to go to any
one individual because I mean this is
2016 people are super busy you're going
to be hard pressed to find that you know
yoda-like figure who's going to help you
learn how to levitate space crafts and
stuff you know most likely you're going
to be like asking questions to the to
the person sitting in the cubicle next
to you and just trying to forge
friendships where you can like learn you
know things that are not on the internet
there is always going to be tested
information inside any company you know
how do you guys deal with you know
continuous integration where is the
style guide where do we keep all the
passwords to you know AWS those kinds of
questions right and you're going to need
to get used to asking people and you're
going to need to get used to using chat
systems because increasingly if you work
you're probably using HipChat or slack
or dinner if you're doing an open source
projects look we do and you need to just
figure out how to ask for what there's
not some central mentor that you want to
ask so in many ways I view the fact that
we don't have a mentorship program as a
feature not a bug if you will is there
there isn't a plugin or that
and stuff in the near future up to that
end you know we've got we have the the
help rooms of course and by the way I
even if you're learning going to the
help rooms and helping other people who
who are just recently you know who are
at where you just recently were is a
great way to learn so there's sort of
some informal mentorship there and I
think that the people who are frequent
contributors to the help room sort of
build relationships with those that
they're helping which can be great you
know and I on occasion I've have help
people out via private message though
that's not not an invitation to
everybody private message me because I'm
pretty busy also the the the campsites
right there are we hopefully have people
with different skill levels they can
provide advice and the same sort of
thing you don't have to be an a master
or an expert to teach somebody you just
need to to you know to know what you've
learned so I think that there that's a
great place where you can go to to get
your question to answer yeah that's
exactly what I was gonna say that's what
the campsites are for even if everybody
around you is not an expert they're all
going through the same doubts so might
as we'll just put your heads together
and try to figure it out it's multiple
skills developing at the same time Oh
general nuisance said well if you want
to watch me completely grind stuff out
painfully I'm up for bring popcorn and
rocks honestly like watching people
painfully grind things out is what
people sign up for when they when they
watch coding on twitch unless you're
watching notch for example the guy who
created minecraft like you know he knows
exactly what he's been he's doing he's
been working on minecraft for the last
five years or whatever you know like
generally you're going to be watching
people Google stuff and read
documentation and ask questions to the
viewership Briana wrote this incredible
article
streaming let me see if I have it in
here seven wise fights you a better
coder yeah I feel like half the time
what really inspires me and actually
gets me motivated to stream is when I
truly cannot figure something out
because for whatever reason people will
watch and they will help you and you
know half the time people only help me
because they get so frustrated that i'm
like missing something that slop like
y'all I'd uh like it's this thing and
I'm like chilled like there's a lag I
get it okay so I mean it's a don't be
don't let that hold you back that you're
worried that people are gonna be
frustrated with how bad you are because
if you think about it that's awesome
because then they're going to help you
and then they will make sure you
remember that by telling you several
times as long to have a sense of humor
about it it's awesome it simply help
it's a gentleness is mentioned uh
contributing to somebody else's code and
so I'd like to emphasize the free coke
camp is an open source project and we
have campers who are not any we're done
with the curriculum who are contributing
every single day I'm anybody can do a
pull request and if you look at the
frico camp repo there is a Help Wanted
tag and most of those Help Wanted tags
are really simple textual type changes
and all we have a complete guide in the
contributing md that describes how to
get a local instant setup we have a help
contributors channel that where we will
help you to get set up and running we
definitely encourage self starters there
right so if you're truly if you're truly
a novice or or you're not able to do
stuff on your own then please please
don't come cuz we don't have too much
that much time but I know that I
personally have learned so much more
just by participating contributing to
free code camp then then even just doing
the curriculum lots of it's very I think
there's there's a lot to learn there I
just wanted to chime in like one of the
top articles from like to
days ago three days ago it's got 40
points on camper news which if you don't
use camper news I check it every day and
there are some really great articles
about learning to code and coding in
general that are posted on here but M
camo 8870 posted this link to matt
mullenweg of course the founder of
wordpress and one of the most
influential developers from around
period and basically says the title is
getting a job after a coding boot camp
but this just is this just as relevant
for free code camp it's all about open
source contributions and definitely if
you have a second it's a very short
article it's only like four paragraphs
but I think it does a good job of
arguing why you should be contributing
to open source projects particularly if
the company you're applying for has some
open source projects that's a good way
to get on the radar um and the another
very quick question somebody asked how
might I know when people are streaming
it's hit and miss i go to free code camp
or twitch TV / free code camp nobody
streaming well what you can do on twitch
actually is what i recommend you do if
you haven't already done this is you can
follow a channel and then there's like
some way I don't see it on here but
probably because I'm it's my own channel
it's like I'm logged in as free coke
camp which owns the free cooking channel
but basically they're the way you can
get a notification whenever somebody
gets live and it'll just send you a
quick email um i would recommend
activating that and that's how i find
out when people are streaming for
example is i just see it like oh it's
live so i said i'm pretty sure if you
just follow all you have to do is follow
the channel and as long as your settings
are set for it you'll get an email
whenever that goes live yeah so follow
and then there's also a like an
additional thing that you check and I
can hear the winner you hear that Mario
ping that's somebody
so thank you for following those people
who just followed the other thing I
wanted to say it like also how about one
volunteer to be a streamer again if you
just if you just go to live coding get
er I am / free code camp / live coding
you can jump in there and talking and
there are a bunch of articles that
Briana's posted on our medium
publication about streaming that you can
read as well if you're not subscribed to
our medium publication I'm the editor
and I spend probably like 20 or 30 hours
a week like reviewing submitted articles
and writing them myself so I strongly
encourage you to subscribe to that as
well it's medium if you just go to
medium dartford okay calm i'll post that
in and then I think Septimus is going to
stream after this Septimus are you in
the audience right now Septimus was
talking about streaming today as well
did he get a new computer yeah he got a
new computer his computer was
unfortunately destroyed by his nephew I
don't know what happened but apparently
it was not just water damage it was like
completely destroyed this enemy action
so the last thing I think the this this
is an a good insight from Christie
zhihua who said helping other people
when I'm stuck on my own project makes
it easier to reframe and then go back to
the problem at hand so this is certainly
an argument for hanging out in our help
chat and you know the help chat is
powered by volunteers like when you go
in there and you ask a question and
somebody answers be sure to pay it
forward be sure to spend some time in
the help chat helping out this time
permits and okay it's pronounced java
java okay thank you Chris Java all right
so um does anyone else have any burning
questions before we end this
aim and pass it over to Septimus
Septimus is going to be doing some live
coding star going to throw on some some
VOD okay tunes they don't get muted on
the YouTube dump we are going to put
this entire thing on YouTube within the
next few hours if you missed any of it
you want to watch it again again I
strongly recommend if you want to
support our community and if you're
interested in getting some cool clothing
this is the EU link for our t-shirt
campaign and this is the u.s. lanky yeah
kind of people all right hey Brooklyn's
got a bit a guest and Brianna already
dropped and sort of Justin so we're
going to go ahead and end thank you all
very much for joining us we have so many
features that are going to be pushed
live soon if you want to track or
contribute to free code camp and you're
interested in the kinds of features we
have in the pipe if you you go to github
and you just look at / milestones you
can see some of the features we're
working on which include among other
things teacher mode real-time pair
programming on challenges we're going to
need to do some WebSocket stuff there a
lot of people have asked about HTTPS why
aren't we using SSL we will we just have
to refactor our challenges a little bit
because there's something that conflicts
with HTTPS right now as soon as we get
that done we'll be on HTTPS offline mode
is coming soon for those of you who have
in a you know like spotty internet and
then of course like the additional
waypoints are coming as soon as possible
the data visualization waypoints and
soon free coke camp will be completely
react ified berkeley i had previously
was using a framework he built himself
called a flux framework called
thundercats jas berkeley is switching
things over to redux which berkeley
thinks is the clear winner
you want to say set a bit about that
Berkeley what your thoughts on redox are
sure sure it's the fantastic API and I
think the biggest reason why the switch
is important is because it'll make
contributing to the react could based a
lot easier for new people to react
instead of learning Emma cast and as
well as our x GS now we just need to
have to learn functions javascript
function and understand I need to build
immutability which is not not too
difficult yeah so hopefully it increases
the contributions to the guy i have
thing great well redux will definitely
work its way into our curriculum
eventually um I'm keen on learning it as
well and we'll look forward to seeing
you all on upcoming streams seeing you
in the chat if you have any ideas if you
have anything you want to contribute
just open github issues and open poor
requests that's what it's all about keep
things moving forward have a beautiful
Saturday have a beautiful weekend and
happy coding everyone happy coding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
