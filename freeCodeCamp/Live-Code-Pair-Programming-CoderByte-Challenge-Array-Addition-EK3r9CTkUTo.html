is the subset sum problem I'm going to
see if I can get any more people in
because a lot of people have questions
about this one so will you pull up the
subset sum problem on Wikipedia is that
large enough yeah
okay we'll give it a second see if
people click the link but ok so the
subset sum problem says really problem
and for example given the set all these
numbers can some subset of the greater
set add up to 0 and for the values they
provided the answer is yes but so this
one brute forcing this is typically not
a good solution because of the runtime
of it and the complexity substituting
everything out it just it balloons
extremely quickly but knowing that
cutter bite doesn't provide any large
arrays we're going to go ahead and do a
brute force solution that involves
recursion um so yeah let's go back and
start programming ok you remember how
yep ok um so this particular problem
we're going to take an array of numbers
that's passing ray and return true of
any any combination of the numbers in
the array can be added up to equal the
largest number in the array otherwise we
return false so in this example up here
it would return true because all the
numbers add up to 23 which is the
largest element in the array
and we're going to do we're going to
solve this in a recursive fashion here
so we need to check our base cases
that's very important that you do this
early on in recursion because otherwise
this will execute indefinitely and your
computer will run out memory well I
think I think we're going to need
another another function to actually
perform the recursion in because first
we're going to need to get the largest
element of the array out that's yeah
it's true now we could do it we could do
it in there because you could just do
array comma largest you could change the
method signature because in JavaScript
if you if you pass and extra arguments
to to a method or a function it it just
doesn't even bother with me this could
contain negative numbers should we use
number negative infinity well now is
there because largest number is going
we're going to determine the largest
number right after this right so right
but if we encountered a negative one
like in this example that's not larger
than zero right but so what i would do
is write an if so if largest number then
perform some kind of calculation right
to get your largest number otherwise go
on and move on which is why I also kind
of like doing this in two functions
because you're separating concerns at
that point
okay get rid of all this right and now
you since we're going to do it in
another function we can just leave the
original signature the same we can get
rid of that largest number and this and
we can just that we can calculate a
largest number and then call a recursive
function down below okay our largest
number I wouldn't do 0 I mean you can
you can do it yeah well I wouldn't
reduce it because cells that modify the
original ray uh you know i'm i'm i'm not
sure if it will let's take a look at the
mdn but personally what I would do is I
would sort it and then pop the last
element off because that way i'm not i'm
modifying my array anyway which I need
to do because I need to pull that last I
need to pull the largest element out and
and then I'm so sorting is a is just a
byproduct they could come in in any
order to the recursive function it won't
matter but we do need to remove that
last element so yet and then our
recursive function here
all right okay I believe weren't we
popping numbers off each time and
stopping the recursion when the length
hit zero yeah that seems like a logical
way to do it right and just in case
people are wondering so you go ahead and
write out the base case so what he's
doing right now is he's defining in the
base case it whenever you do a recursive
function you want to really define when
should this recursive function stop like
I don't want it to run anymore so that's
what he's doing with array dot length
equals 0 and the array dot length equals
0 you may wonder why it's like that it's
because we're going to pull elements out
of the array and we're actually going to
subtract those elements from largest
number some people are thrown off
because it says will they have to add up
to it well okay if you start with 0 and
you add say nine and one you're going to
equal ten if you start at ten and you
subtract nine and one you're going to
equal zero so if you're checking 40 or
you're checking for some sum of numbers
if they add up to your target number
it's essentially it's the inverse of
each other and by subtracting each
element off of largest number you save
yourself having to store an additional
data structure
actually want to do that up here largest
number no no no okay so what I would do
here right is we we know we know how we
want it to end right so we can just
return our case right so now what we're
going to we're going to define our base
case all the way and the base case or
the the base case is array dot length
equals zero and then we're just going to
return this largest number equals triple
equals zero so this is a going to
evaluate to a boolean true or false all
right so that's it now we need to
perform the actual meat potatoes so the
recursive function so the first thing we
do is we'd say there let's say we'll
call it possible i equals array and
would just call it the first element in
the array right and then array equals
arrayed slice one and what that does is
it slices the array starting at the at
index 1 to the end so remember arrays
start from zero so if we did slice 0 it
would give us the whole array slice one
gives us everything but everything in
zero index and then down here is where
we would call our recursive we will call
our own function
so in the return here right we need two
on one side test our value so and then
on the other side look and see what
would happen if we don't and you use
really long names for everything so on
this side we are subtracting the element
from largest number on this side we are
not subtracting the element from largest
number so each time this function goes
through and you know what can i just i'm
going to rename some stuff real quick
because really what this is is the
target right so and can yeah there we go
okay so target
okay that's a little better so all right
so the way this is going to work and
let's go ahead and conceptualize what
would happen if we passed in the array
one two three and let's say five all
right or and five is our largest so the
first time this comes in the array has
elements one two and three and larger
and target is now five so array dot
length is not equal to 0 so it doesn't
bother with this it goes down and be
else all right very possible is a res 0
which is one and then we call array dot
slice one so that removes one from the
array permanently all right so we're
left with two and three on this left
side we are calling our own function
recursively all right with an array the
end the array contains two and three and
target- possible is 5-1 so this is going
to equal four when it calls it so it's
two and three and four on this side it's
going to spawn a whole new execution
chain and it's going to compare or it's
going to pass the array two and three
and target but target isn't being
modified at all so the value is still
five all right and it's going to keep
doing this every time it comes through
so one becomes to those to become for
those four becomes 16 so on and so forth
it or eight yeah it it doubles every
time it gets pretty ridiculous which is
why a brute force solution isn't a very
good idea but because the like anything
over 15 elements will actually crash
your browser i'm pretty sure but let's
go ahead and test and see if it works
so you could actually run that to get a
false value
yep so all of the test cases passed
right so let me make sure does anyone
have any questions the best part about
that is there going to hear me asset
like 10 seconds after I've typed it
and 15 second rules says nobody has any
questions on recursion so let's go
submit code and move on um I'm gonna go
get something to drink real quick if you
want to start hammering away at the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
