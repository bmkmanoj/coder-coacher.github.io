Vancouver
he's a front-end developer and he's
going to talk about his amazing new
article on animated CSS flexbox CSS
flexbox described through animation we
are alive with Scott dome Ed's in
Vancouver
he's a front-end developer and he's
going to talk about his amazing so we
start already have some people shuffling
into to check it out awesome home so
Scott please tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into coding
well first of all thank you so much for
having me Quincy um it's been a big
honor I've been overwhelmed by the
response the flexbox article that's been
amazing
so basically my story is that I've been
working as a front-end slash mobile
developer at a company called muse find
for about nine months now before that I
took a degree in English literature and
then spend some time working to
marketing before ending up in the coding
world awesome so that's a pretty big
jump right so you my understanding is
you studied English Literature at the
University of British Columbia which or
anybody who isn't familiar with
candidates so like one of the major
universities in the Vancouver metro area
and so English literature that's pretty
different from both marketing and
ultimately front-end web development can
you talk a little bit about how you
transition between those three
disciplines yeah so the reason I took
the English degree is I actually wanted
to be a high school teacher that was my
original plan along the way I sort of
became disillusioned with working in the
public school system I started looking
around for something else and I was
completely lost as to what that might be
how I fell into coding just sort of
happened
by chance I was actually researching
good careers like literally googling
good careers and what came up was UX
designer and I was like that sounds
pretty interesting I'm like okay so I
started playing around with coding
played around with JavaScript on
Codecademy and I just got hooked I was
traveling at the time in Peru and for
about two weeks there I just went to a
coffee shop and for eight hours a day
just learned to code and I was addicted
so after that I came home signed up for
a boot camp here in Vancouver and then
got the job with Muse find awesome that
tell us a little bit about the coding
bootcamp it was lighthouse labs right
yeah I was eight-week boot camp focusing
primarily on JavaScript and Ruby on
Rails it was it was really good I ended
up using react for my final project
which is how I got the job at Muse fine
because they actually use react and
rails so you ended up learning Ruby on
Rails but you still use it on the job at
nice find yeah they're a real shop and
you're also using react heavily and and
I understand that you're even using
react native which is kind of the new
way of quickly building mobile apps yeah
so we decided to put out a mobile app in
the past few months and so decided to
use react native because we want to
share a lot of the code from our web
applications and the app is now live you
can search it on for a I phone you can
look on the app store called Muse find
yeah and it's been really exciting to
build a lot of fun and on the job how
some of these non developer skills
you've built up you said you were
interested in in working as a teacher at
one point I'm sure you learned a lot
about education as a result and and
you're also interested in marketing and
worked as a marketer and now you're
working as a developer at a marketing
agency how did how do those skills play
into your day-to-day experience I
you ever able to apply those as well
well it's funny because a lot of people
hear that
I have an English degree and I'm now a
programmer and they're like oh what but
there's been an amazing amount of
overlap between the skills because when
it comes to literary analysis which is
why I spent four years doing your
tracing patterns through text which is
exactly the same kind of thing I'm doing
now it's a lot more logical now it's a
lot there's a lot less gray area with
programming but it's the same basic idea
and all those skills of proofreading and
good communication skills oh that's
really transferred over I've been really
shocked by how much is transferred over
and in your day to day experience well
working as a developer you were in Peru
you were studying eight hours a day
learning the code during that initial
two weeks when you really discover your
passion for it um I'm sure at that point
you had some precepts of what working as
a developer in technology would be like
no is it at all how you imagined what
are some areas where it's similar and as
opposed to completely surprising the
main thing I think that has been
surprising for me has been that it has
been as fun as the self-study was yeah
I'm still enjoying it as much as I was
when I was first playing around with
JavaScript on the internet it yeah it's
the same experience of just actually
building something and I've really
enjoyed it the other big difference I'd
say is that when you're studying by
yourself you're kind of overwhelmed by
how much there is to learn and what you
learn on the job is that you don't
really need to learn everything all at
once like you don't need to know all of
reacts or all of angular all of whatever
library you just pick up what you need
in pieces and that's a lot easier when
you know what you need from the library
versus if you're just studying by
yourself you don't know what's relevant
so it's it's a lot less overwhelming
when you're on the job let's
a little bit about your flexbox article
which is incredible it's it's been it's
gotten more than a hundred thousand
views on medium we publish it in free
copious medium publication I think last
week and it's still one of the top
articles like I checked the top stories
every day and I think it's still up
there it's been well received by reddit
and hacker news and a whole lot of these
other places and most importantly a
whole lot of people who were interested
in flexbox and really had no idea how it
worked now I have a great reference that
they can go back to and see kind of the
different properties in action in these
short little gift loops can you talk
about how you came up with the idea of
visualizing these with gifts and yeah
like how did that happen well it was
very important for me to take a visual
look at flexbox it doesn't really make
sense to talk about layouts in the
abstract it's not very intuitive but
once I filled with the flexbox once you
see it in action something clicks so I
was thinking about how to do that and I
thought about doing a video but I really
like writing on medium so I thought
gifts would be a good compromise and
yeah it seems to work out absolutely and
I guess one question always had to ask
when somebody does something that's
clearly brilliant that people were there
was a big latent demand for why don't
you think anybody tried to explain
flexbox with these little gifts like ah
I have no idea honestly um yeah I was
just luck of the draw that I came up
with it I'd certainly didn't anticipate
the response would be this big but it
writing the article really helped me
clarify my ideas about flexbox so it's
been a good learning experience for me
as well and there are some properties of
flexbox which you didn't cover in the
original article
are you planning to write a follow-up
article that'll potentially address
those with gifts as well yeah so in the
original article
I talked mostly about the Styles you
apply to the container and not the
children elements and flexbox has a
bunch of properties that apply to the
children I'm
working on a follow-up article on those
in my opinion they are a little less
intuitive so I really want to make sure
I get the explanation right for those
but it's in the works
do you have any seasoned UI designer
people who are really familiar with
flexbox whom you can run things by I
know I'm just sort of figuring it out as
I go along like I've ever used flexbox
for REI react native apps so I'm
familiar with it but like I said this
has been a really good experience for me
to really nail down my understanding and
make sure that I'm communicating in the
most intuitive way
speaking of react native tell us a
little bit about how you managed to pick
that up because that's still very new
technology and it's not it's not widely
used yet
what were some of the drivers behind
adopting react native so quickly and so
as such a big part of what you all do
right well we're a small startup so we
like to build things quickly and get
features of the door as soon as possible
and since none of us had any mobile
development experience react native was
certainly the best proposition for us
because we could use some of our
existing code from a web platform and
we'd be fairly familiar with the syntax
so it's been fantastic in that way it's
been really easy to pick up great and so
I understand that your preventative apps
are progressive web apps that run on
mobile phones well you tell us a little
bit about how all that works so our app
isn't a progressive web app but I'm
hoping that progressive web apps will be
taken off very soon okay do you think
the 2017 will be the year that they do
take off my short answer is I hope so my
long answer is that I really think it
depends whether people get comfortable
with it and get familiar with the idea I
think there needs to be some sort of big
app that everyone wants to use that is a
progressive web app because I know for
me
personally I've had Google every time at
Google the weather asked me to add it to
my home screen as a progressive web app
and for a long time I simply didn't know
what that was so I didn't do it so I
think you need to get people to the
point where they're more comfortable
with this compared to regular apps
otherwise they'll just stick to what
they're comfortable now you said that
your app is not a progressive whether
it's a is a is it a react native app
that's in a mobile app shell yes exactly
awesome and is it for what what
platforms did you build it for that's
for iOS iOS okay
so just to make sure I understand you're
relatively small agency does not
actually have dedicated mobile
developers no it's I guess I'm the
closest thing to a dedicated mobile
developer Wow so yeah so tell us a
little bit about the like I mean I know
you're not a mobile developer but you're
developing apps for mobile so maybe you
could argue that you're a mobile
developer in the sense that you're just
using javascript to do it yeah but tell
us a little bit about the advantages of
using someone like react native and
basically shelling if I'm using the
correct term shelling a JavaScript app
inside of a native app well there's some
big advantages in terms of being able to
quickly switch gears between your web
app in your mobile app share the same
codebase shared a lot of the same
components there are some disadvantages
as well react native I think it's a
great platform and it has a lot of
promise it's not quite at the point
where it delivers what it promises in
that there were still cases where I had
to dive into the native code which I was
very unfamiliar with which made
debugging kind of opinion at times and
there's also a lot of problems with
react native that are hard to debug just
because of the layers of abstraction but
overall we haven't had any major
problems with it it's been a dream to
use we haven't had any issues with the
app so it's been a positive experience
for sure
one of the reasons that people build
native apps instead of web apps that
function like like native apps is
performance with a with an iOS app that
uses Swift or objective-c and goes in
and gets really close to the proverbial
metal you can get some like extreme
performance out of the processor and you
can access all the different aspects of
the phone you know the tilt sensing push
notifications stuff like that my
understanding is you can do a lot of
that you can access a lot of those
features now in rack native but is the
performance anywhere near what you could
get if you were writing a native iOS app
no I don't think so and I'm not sure it
ever will be for our purposes we didn't
need an intense amount of performance
our app isn't that intensive so that
wasn't high on our priority list but
we've gotten great performance so far
but at the end of the day no I think a
native app if you need performance
intensity then I think the native app is
still gonna be the way to go for a long
time maybe someday reactivated we'll be
there but I don't think it's there yet
have you taken a look at possibly
contributing you you talked about react
native not necessarily having all the
not being 100% not being quite where it
needs to be have you looked into
potentially contributing to the react
native project I would love to yeah I've
been thinking about it I just got to
find somewhere where I can be of help
basically now is react native actually
written totally in JavaScript or does it
have like C libraries underneath it how
does it work how does it actually
function yeah I'm actually not entirely
sure a lot of it is JavaScript from what
I've seen in the codebase but then
there's also a lot of native code in
there too great Oh before we go I want
to I want to first of all point out to
our viewers that progressive web apps
and just web apps in general react move
distant I'm sorry Twitter recently moved
its entire mobile web experience over to
to a progressive web app I think they
did it last night
yeah yeah so just if anybody watching is
interested in progressive web app since
we've been talking about it I figured
I'd throw that out people big big big
websites or jumping onto that yeah it's
definitely trending in that direction
the other thing someone from our
audience asked an excellent question
that I think a lot of people probably
want to ask and I was gonna look for
their name real quick here in the chat
so I can credit them charlie pop Charlie
pale I think is how you pronounce his
name asked I'm curious how is flexbox
different from a responsive framework
like bootstrap flexbox aims to solve a
lot of the problems that traditional CSS
had especially with alignment it's not
very intuitive using a float system to
arrange things on the page and bootstrap
also tried to solve that in their own
way and by giving you preset classes
that would do a lot of the alignment for
you but I don't think that bootstrap
fully is able to provide the kind of
solution that Flex boxes providing so
flex box just gives you a more robust
set of tools to align things exactly how
you want with less code than bootstrap
so it's it's kind of the equivalent like
the vanilla CSS almost equivalent of
trying to use responsive framework it
gets you really close to a CSS itself
yeah exactly you you're working directly
with the CSS compared with bootstrap you
got to throw a lot of extra divs in
there to align things how you work how
you want them whereas with Flex box you
can just set properties directly on the
elements you already using just out of
curiosity if somebody hasn't really used
flex box that much or they're relatively
new they understand CSS at some level
maybe they've worked through the
introductory free cooking of CSS
challenges how long do you think it
would take them before they could start
actually productively building you eyes
using flexbox like how many hours I
don't think very long
to do some basic layouts you don't
really need to know a lot of flexbox I
think the properties that I covered in
my article should be enough to get you
going
and then from there it's just basically
it's very intuitive you'll you'll see it
as you start to build I would say
honestly playing around with it for a
few hours should be enough to get you to
a solid point well Scott thank you so
much for answering our questions I know
you have to get to work and there's a
foot of snow outside Europe Vancouver so
we will go ahead and let you let you get
on the road we wish you safe drive to
work according q yeah thank you so much
for having me the pleasure so everybody
who's watching or listening to this I've
put the link to Scott's amazing flexbox
article again I think it's one of the
best articles on medium for 2017 it's
it's already here this article like
packs so much learning into such a short
time using the power of gifts everybody
check that out follow Scott on Twitter
and try out flexbox we're gonna launch a
section of our curriculum that's
dedicated the flexbox that'll be 8 that
will be live pretty soon and it's
already up on beta if you want to go
play with it they did that free calm and
we're very excited to hear more about
flexbox
and react native and if you do make some
contributions to the react native code
base we would love to hear about that oh
yeah buzzer and I'll be very committed
at that point and we're all really
pumped to see your follow-up article so
yeah shoot that to me it's ready and
I'll jump right on it and publish it
because I'm super excited to to help you
help all these people understand this
new technology awesome thank you so much
yeah I really appreciate it
thank you Scott and thank you everybody
for tuning in have a beautiful day bye
