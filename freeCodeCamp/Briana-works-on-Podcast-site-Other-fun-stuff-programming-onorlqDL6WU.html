streaming rbs teacher yeah yeah you did
okay it's right go to wish you get node
run it does not like this new era thing
hold on hold on let's let's let's take a
look at this for a second ya see at the
end of line 42 you're gonna have one
close parenthesis 42 yeah yeah yeah nice
save try again hi Chris yeah there's
only like six people watch it well
apparently it's not you right now it's
not people at work I think um or doing
something better with their time like
they have to be tricks ovation yeah and
share that one with them you're safe now
right yeah I'm saving it is it doing the
thing where it goes back and no it says
it's too many this is this the same
thing Oh go to file fan right top left
Mac Mac but the best on this file and do
save in there so I say borrow your
turkey they're looking it was and I this
should not be any different well
somebody's looking that's good I saw you
post the books a 9-ounce show so now you
now finally believe me that will work um
yeah I don't know why it doesn't is some
problem with the amount
of of things that we got going on as you
thought the fact they open i'm 27 oh
oops that's what it's talking about
maybe nope first um I guess okay let me
open up another terminal another
terrible just one arm is fitting
terminal City I just a mongoose yeah MPX
up on you how was work good incredible
you're amazing appear dependency
included from long ago will know and we
automatically installed your application
will need to depend on explicitly okay
so i have to install Cara burrows okay
it's but if useful attending it a chair
has written no Jess just in case you
forgot you know oh my god gotcha a
critic typing just to make sure I still
do so all that's going i will do
Mongoose and then that should fix that
error I know eight people still lurking
okay okay
the warning someplace good NP complete
complain all at once so long as it does
thing doesn't matter Miriah monkeys what
don't write the word market dunno tipper
I whatever I don't know bitches whatever
I thought I had to start mongers and her
running in the background the monkeys to
joy over to connect to Mongo Mongo one
hmm never mind if I just said you got
okay so it says it's listening on port
3001 waiting for local host ID let's go
looking on it okay guy collapsed on
mm-hmm go to your rights go to the top
of the file uh-huh I want to try all
your name you can't fake it um how does
 fungus work and don't let your like
a busy no users you can you you don't
control no that's that's the database
control user so let's database using
German you need to create user object um
oh I don't know okay so once among you
stuck connect me to make a few folks
okay so
so far products keema huh see heme
equals um view one crystal schema is
that capitalized yes god bless um on
them it's like a set of practices mm-hmm
and on the inside you put an object okay
all right we need to build another
object so the palace scheme has passed
the date on the description so it's
going to be packed column string with a
capital s dash column and then that's
Frank let's go be an object right so you
to put in the sign of the actual
definition is an object oh it's wage I'm
ok customizable keep going and then
description is a string ok I see heme OS
an A sorry tanay change the today ok
science to it and you can then do a fire
product I'm cottage products side
podcasting change love the product
podcast so we podcast model be the next
in the video anyway
um I'm not it's going to take the first
I good it's going to be podcast gamer an
outside the first leg one's going to
 off so we're going to call the
podcast with an S sectioning I'm I need
to give this string huh so like we're
podcasts has to be a stray second thing
is going to be a podcast gamer that we
just made there's no up there's no
object needs to go on there the last
thing is going to be the word podcasts
again okay um what I'm going to do the
copy pasted halting again and change the
podcast for you user but a username and
password in and then it's the same
process pretty much we need to schema
under all of it and then everything else
is the same here would be user and then
class word so this would be user and
password right yes they're both
strengthening digits good job together
and go back up to date and change the
word objects to to a an objective
JavaScript object and then the first
probably is going to be type wait oh
right type and then date is going to
what's called cup they're thinking
logically on them default date nail
couple the again yeah picture yeah right
let's see if this compile their runs are
going to college
see ya what's just okay so how are we
gonna see if that runs what do you wear
nothing will go wrong when you hit two
notes been to visited earlier nope Denny
went long co-chair schema for second
what wasn't even talking about it's your
models getting it go back to the English
for second to read them Oh see user
password changed us both to users online
23 why do that I should use it make it
user as plural because what the first
one is the name you're going to use
fresh with in Mongoose and second ones
database table you want to extract from
and remove the new from them from the
user schema oh yeah yeah so how come not
only that one from but say okay you
better go nope instead of in the
Mongoose library there's something weird
so perfect in your schema put the new
back in but ditch manga stuff
just there yeah just in case don't want
to be happy with like that okay so
invert what we've just done so put them
on this back and listen either where it
is and remove the news from the models
yeah sorry that's the way to do in a
minute we're going to try removing all
the news okay try removing all the news
now are you sure it's emos capitalized
that's definitely Oh model right for
higher case mom the lower case it should
be lower case imagine it's at the trail
hmm wow that is I saw it so let's go and
build a final page quickly so if you
just literally copy and paste like the
logon page and change the Nephilim sign
up on the path to sign up where you
great the J far you'd have to put the
Duchy at the end it yeah I got na third
automatically automatically and change
action to sign up okay that's all you
read yes okay then we need to route to
it somehow now the last thing ignore the
sine of X you for a second we're going
to destroy user in I'm going to play
text password using strattera Lydia add
that in
there's no witch okay serialize user
starting there yeah below what hello are
you on after GS yeah try opening up
another and then go up to all your body
parts or stuff and add a duplicate the
cookie parser life sure to click listen
to them instead of don't put don't ipod
you don't like and replace cookie parser
with passport initialize just need the
whole would ya put the bed spelling on a
special new come on D command D and
change the second exercise the session
create a great what are you looking for
a quick fix pack and go back to your
team magic your plan grown up ok
and we're going to go to the home to the
home button yeah and go into podcasts
I've been called a 10-7 thing there and
gone to podcast and then make a new
collection mhm Carly users we're gonna
make a username just on the browser you
have to go to another project find a
head to sign up they just around again
um so in the user objects can be used
name test pass your tests like that
every strings okay don't forget your
clothing no he doesn't string doesn't
close to the test oh yeah okay and then
we start your app and trying to find any
thief it works you'll know it works
because we have to go to the admin page
so I just go here it looks like this if
I go to John go to wal admin and logging
press login test test test login what's
your con tres a good escape for a second
and then do see if the talk to use the
concert there off it's not a lovely
okay try going to 24 / admin that could
be some hair doing is a jack
sickly 0401 um go to your server console
just doesn't see so that whole thing
happens in you sure you have that no I
MnDOT no that doesn't make sense
log in that game again and we've already
added so how does react handle the like
on click type stuff for which in general
for this cause researching this oh well
then there's no like this button doesn't
do anything it doesn''t button and the
waiting it's like built into the browser
