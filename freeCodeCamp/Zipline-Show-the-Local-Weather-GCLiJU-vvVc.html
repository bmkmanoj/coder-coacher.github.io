out where the user is and show their
local weather let's take a look at the
finished product so you can see that it
detects that I'm in an island called
Alameda California which is in the Bay
Area the sky is clear and the wind speed
in nautical miles it also shows the
weather in Fahrenheit and that it is
partially cloudy outside so first let's
review the rules for these zip lines
rule number one don't look at the
example projects code figure it out for
yourself rule number two you may use
whichever libraries or api's you need
and rule number three reverse engineer
the example products functionality and
also feel free to personalize it so here
are the user stories that you'll want to
tackle the first user story as a user I
can see the weather in my current
location this is accurate weather for
where I am right now I can look out the
window and verify this and some bonus
user stories that you can do if you have
time that'll make your app really cool
and interesting as a user I can see an
icon dependent on the temperature which
adventurer bear who built this
implemented right here as a user I see a
different background image depending on
the temperature and we can see that she
also added a nice background image here
that this will change depending on the
temperature and as a user I can put I
can push a button to toggle between
Fahrenheit in Celsius that would be very
convenient for our international users
that are outside of the US where we
still use the imperial system instead of
the metric system for some weird reason</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
