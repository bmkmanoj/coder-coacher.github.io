revisions forever using git git is a
powerful and popular version control
system we're going to learn how to use
it with this challenge which will
conduct on cloud nine so if you already
have a cloud 9 account let's just jump
right into your dashboard I created a
new workspace we'll call it get - get it
that's the name of the node school
challenge we're going to be working
through so years nodejs is your template
and click create workspace now we can go
back and we can grab the command we're
going to use to install get it and we'll
just run it in the terminal while it's
running that I always like to drag this
up and give us a little bit bigger of a
terminal window just type git - hit to
run the challenge so the first step as I
said is to install git which is already
pre-installed in cloud 9 dot IO so
there's no need to do this we can
literally just run get it
verify and we've passed that was easy
now we're going to run get it again keep
in mind if you're doing this on your
local machine you actually will want to
install git but it's unnecessary in this
case so now they get it is completed
we can go on to the next challenge which
deals with repositories so first you'll
notice unlike the previous note school
challenges this doesn't try to give you
the instructions right in the terminal
what it does is it tells you to go to
this website and it has a nice walk
through right there so we'll copy this
will open up a new browser tab and we'll
just paste it in and we can see that
here we go will click on repository and
here are the directions for the
challenge good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
