free code camp nonprofit project we
created a transportation application for
options Inc first off I wanted to
introduce myself and my partner my name
is Andre Alonso and I live in San Diego
California I am a former software
engineer before starting an internet
advertising company now I am a
stay-at-home dad I am interested in
working in the software field again so I
joined free code camp to brush up on my
programming skills my partner is
emmanuel Antonelli and he lives in italy
emmanuel did research and development
and materials modeling and has some
experience with a matlab and c++ he
joined free code camp to learn web
development and improve his coding
skills the nonprofit we are helping is
called options Inc they are located in
Big Lake Minnesota which is about 45
miles northeast of Minneapolis they are
a licensed day-trading
and habilitation program serving 250
adults with intellectual disabilities or
with related conditions such as cerebral
palsy epilepsy autism or traumatic brain
injury options Inc currently picks up
and drops off around 250 consumers with
23 vehicles the problem they have is
figuring out how to assign consumers to
vehicles the consumers are located all
around the options Inc facility which is
indicated by the red marker their
consumers have certain constraints or
needs such as the need for a wheelchair
they might require medication sometimes
they have seizures all of these
constraints needed to be modeled into
application options Inc has 23 vehicles
of varying seating capacities a minivan
could hold 7 passengers a full-size van
could hold 12 passengers a bus could
hold up to 12 passengers and 5
wheelchairs
in this diagram you can see that some of
the buses have foldable seats where to
folded up seats could fit one wheelchair
currently options Inc is using an Excel
spreadsheet to figure out which
consumers belong on which vehicle they
are also giving each driver of each
vehicle a printed word document that
contains the consumers on the vehicle
route and the directions the driver
should take on that route the problems
with this solution is that it's hard to
visualize where the consumers are
located it's also hard to add a new
consumer how would you move around
consumers and know this is the optimized
route we wanted to create a solution
that would allow options Inked to
visually see the consumers on a map and
keep track of consumers and vehicle
constraints and optimize driving time
here's the solution a manual and I came
up with this is a single page
application and it uses session based
login after you login you get taken to
the main portion of the app which we
call the map page this page allows you
to assign consumers to vehicles
configure vegan routes and get
directions in the navigation bar you can
manage consumers vehicles users there's
also a Settings button allows you to set
certain global settings here's how you
add a new consumer you click on the add
new consumer button and you can either
name sex address
phone number any notes you have about
the consumer then you can add choose
their needs so let's say I need a
wheelchair and I need medications and as
you can see here I'm added then you
could also edit the consumer so let's
edit Abdul give them some needs submit
and then you can also delete we also
implemented real-time filtering so if
you want to see all females that need a
wheelchair you can do that and it does
it all in real time you can also export
the entire consumers collection to excel
so here's how you can add a new vehicle
so you press add a vehicle let's name
this bus 9 say the vehicle has eight
seats two foldable seats and for
wheelchairs press add and it's added
here you can also edit and delete a new
vehicle so once you have your consumers
and vehicles set up you can start
assigning consumers to vehicles we will
be doing this on the map page
so we have some consumers located in st.
cloud and this is how you would add
consumers and say cloud to vehicles you
choose a bus that see these consumers
sometimes they have wheelchairs so you
would try to find a vehicle that have
that has a wheelchair so let's choose
bus one and you can add consumers to
this vehicle by clicking on the marker
you can also remove consumers by
clicking on the marker again or clicking
on the X button
once you have passengers on a vehicle
you can configure the vehicle route and
print directions you do that by clicking
on configure route here you can optimize
the route and it'll minimize the time of
passengers riding on the vehicle so you
click on optimize route and optimize the
route so the optimal route is to pickup
Yuki first then Catherine if for some
reason you don't like the optimized
route you can change it so let's say you
want to pick up Catherine first you can
do that by doing drag and drop one of
the requirements was to add a stop to
the route so you can do that this way so
let's say you need to go to Becker City
Park
and let's say Rosie well this is her
workplace
okay so then you would um try to
optimize route again and it chose to
have Becker City Park as the 8th stop on
the route once you have the route you
like you can get directions click on to
get directions in here you can set the
start time for the route and they'll
calculate the route stop time in real
time so let's say you want to start the
route at 8 a.m. that means they'll leave
options Inc at 8 a.m. then go to the
first consumer at 8:41 and goes down the
line and eventually it returns to
options Inc at 10 a.m. you can get the
route for the for the pick up of
consumers in the morning and then in the
afternoon you can get the directions
when you drop off consumers so to get
the drop-off directions go to p.m.
directions and it's the exact opposite
of the a.m. route so you would start at
Pebble Creek Golf Club and it'll go down
and it'll end up back in options Inc you
have the ability to print directions so
it's print directions which you can give
to the drivers of the week of the
vehicles or you can also export it to
word
options Inc can add additional
information to the document before
giving this documented drivers
here's the text stack that we used for
the application we use nodejs for the
backend Mongo for the database react to
build the front-end view and Redux to
manage the view state some notable
libraries have used were the Google Maps
directions and geocoding API also Tom
Chen wrote a wonderful react Google Maps
library that simplified our app in
developing the app we use the agile
software development methodology this
consisted of 10 weekly sprints at each
at the end of each sprint we would meet
with a client to improve all the
features we worked on the prior week we
use Trello to manage user stories and
features my partner and I also had one
our daily meetings which we used as a
daily stand-up to talk about issues and
also do pair program on bug fixes and
small features we use github for social
control and bug tracking we also use git
er for daily chatting we wanted to thank
the following people for making this
project happen we have learned a lot and
this would not be possible without this
project we want to thank Matt Carlson
the director of programming operations
at option sync and our main point of
contact we wanted to thank Michael
Johnson who organizes all the nonprofit
projects for free code camp Jason
Reynolds for helping out as project
manager Quincy Larson for starting free
code camp none of this would be possible
without free code camp we also want to
thank the testers that looked at our app
and gave us valuable feedback George
Stepanek Manuel
Orlando Elias and irken this is the end
of our demo so if you have any questions
or comments please don't hesitate to
contact us thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
