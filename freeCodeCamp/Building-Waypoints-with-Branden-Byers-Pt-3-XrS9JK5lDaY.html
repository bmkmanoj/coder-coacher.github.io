there yeah I think I'm yeah for some
reason is giving me a legal escape
sequence for this I have no idea what
illegal escape sequence even means maybe
I add like an extra back space in front
of the east to the double bed space
escape them oh these are in Jason yeah
let's try to treat a few dead end see if
it works I'll just get rid of that and
now what I'm going to attempt to do is
run it and we'll see that okay the JSON
that's actually how it should look so
now if i change this to three plus five
and run it what if i do three plus five
okay three with a space the plus with
space the five wonder if i can actually
well i won't be able to see the output
of it here are there too many
parentheses this one on object is not a
function maybe this isn't maybe this can
be evaluated because it's on a page yeah
that's weird anyway let's go ahead and
just a table that for now I what were
you how are you doing the regex for any
of the other tests so yeah for these
tests we don't actually let's see test
so we're using we're double escaping
them so that's normal however we're
doing it for
we're not doing it for specific we're
doing it all within that one box so if
we could actually if there was actually
a way that we could test within that
that entire div like for example what we
previously had was if we do like body
yeah let's just try that let's see if
that works because in theory that should
work okay so let's do three plus five so
it's basically it should be looking
within this entire element yeah but it's
not so so that would be something for
future to make sure that we understand
how that works yeah I think Nathan
probably understands how it works but i
think the tests are loaded and run
purely within here yeah and i would
figure the body would be the top level
element within their but this isn't
actually an iframe this is actually part
of our code so i think it's looking
within that Dave already the question is
how do you get all the texts all text
and current octave I mean I could
probably I could probably figure it out
but basically i think what is happening
is it's using jquery within it's like
using like a dot that of this or
something like that and finding
everything within that element um yeah
and if it's doing that then there are no
tags or anything in here that we can
latch on to in addition to what already
exists in fact I don't even sure how how
its able to test these that's so there
are some gaps in my understandings
especially related to this one there
aren't as many gaps in my understanding
on the HTML ones okay well since I am I
my time is limited right now
are what are the key things that that I
should know when putting up some drafts
of these so yeah are you seeding the
data every time to get it to load after
reload or are you just yes okay yeah
after you reload you just go to and you
just up see you know like that okay we
let's talk strategy a little bit more
how much time you have you have like
maybe five or ten minutes yeah I can do
I could do 1015 if that works okay great
so let's so one of the things we talked
about with javascript is like what
concepts are we going to introduce like
on the high level because frankly like
it's pointless to try to come down and
micromanage because so many concepts are
only apparently you're actually the
thick of things oh man like I needed to
do this but first I need to learn how to
do this so i definitely recommend
against coming up with like a specific
list of challenges you want to do i
would recommend you do them in order and
you always write the copy and the test
and everything like don't try to create
like an assembly line where you like i'm
just going to write the titles then i'm
just going to write the you know the
tests or something like that lecture i
think that they should be completed
piecemeal but we can look at some of the
concepts like we three schools is not
the greatest but it does have a
javascript curriculum if you want to
call it that and you can see like it
walks you through I mean you can kind of
try this stuff yourself but basically I
don't even know if this is meant to be
consumed in a specific order but where
to so they they actually show you how to
do a bunch of stuff uh with inner HTML
like based on a website which we don't
really need to worry about because we're
going to be using jquery for all that
stuff we're more interested in
javascript scripting and in doing the
actual writing code part than wiring
things together in a view sure select
the basic foundational concepts of
JavaScript that
that honestly sometimes like people that
might use JavaScript but they're not
looking like it's a subset of what they
do they may not even understand all the
fundamentals I mean you can do you can
manipulate things in the view you can
use jQuery you can do anything but like
we're talking about like the fundamental
aspects of JavaScript as a programming
language the foundation of any I'll do
later so because of the way that
javascript is used it's used first and
foremost as a browser-based language but
it can be used as a fully featured
scripting language like Python so you
might be more informative to look at how
Python is taught because python is you
use purely is a back end up language
sure so if you do like full Python
curriculum and we look at the way that
Python concepts are introduced actually
I'm kind of curious to see what this
good thing is ASCII our turtle power I
mean these look cute um I'm not sure if
they're actually designed for for
beginners but what we're it we'd be
interested in is how is because the goal
with this javascript stuff is not so
much to show case like the use of
javascript in the client but just on the
backend like the server writing scripts
just like the bonfires basically we want
to write something that sufficiently
prepared as people to tackle the long
fires and the bonfires are going to be
further experiential practice okay so we
might be able to find like a I mean
learn python the hard way is a good book
that I worked through when I was first
learning python and we can we can see
kind of like how I mean learned out
there might even be alarmed JavaScript
the hard way I'm not sure if he's
written that book for this series yeah
yeah I was familiar with it with a with
Ruby learn learn durable doozy yeah so
of course they're pointed eloquent
JavaScript which is fine
and I didn't find eloquent JavaScript to
be sufficiently basic hmm yeah I mean
yeah I mean I've read through a decent
part of that book I mean while it sells
a lot of a lot of interest interesting
concepts not really the like bite-sized
kind of same I mean pretty much we could
make any of that kind of stuff more
bite-sized but but in the way it's
presented is far less that kind of
online yeah so if you look like it what
he says I mean he sermonizing a lot in
this but basically showed you how to
output something console that log
essentially and then only after that
doesn't bother teaching you what a
string is he teaches you comments
actually before he teaches you anything
else just which is really interesting
and and his goal is to have you actually
running a code basically like like you
have local files or something like that
which we don't need to worry about with
JavaScript because something will be
calling your JavaScript but and he also
takes big steps like he's introducing
all the math uh terms right here less
than greater than and greater than less
than so I'm wicked we can certainly rep
include all this and basically his whole
thing I think he's like do a lot of
practice you know practice typing all
this stuff out and here's a string you
know print a string in combination with
numbers stuff like that yeah and I guess
so that's like in a lot of books or
whatnot it's always recommended it's a
good thing to to not just copy code
especially if you're if you're using an
e-book or whatnot Dutch just copy the
code but to actually type it out because
part of that typing out aspect is is
helping to internalize it how much of
that do you think will be a part of any
of these kind of things where it's going
to be valuable for someone to
copy different lines or is that kind of
what the the example line that kind of
shows them what to do is that kind of
what then they can in essence they're
switching it but they're kind of copying
it along right I mean I'll tell you my
very frank opinion of typing making a
better programmer typing code repeatedly
and this may be like a harsh analogy but
if we look at like what is the benefit
of looking something up in a dictionary
there's like a great core I answer on
this kind of summarizes this even long
it teaches them that the hash table
lookups are not always going to be
available and sometimes they'll need to
implement a binary search algorithm
themselves okay so like people are
always like oh look a book you should
look the words up in the dictionary it
actually helps you remember it better I
really question that reasoning and I
question the reasoning of typing a lot
because it's going to somehow make you
understand the code better like what it
does is it gives you more time with the
word in question if you're looking up in
the dictionary we're holding it in your
head or with the coding question where
you're holding in your head while you
type it I don't think the actual act of
typing it the overalls anymore it's just
an expenditure of additional time which
is an expenditure of focus which
increases the likelihood that you're
going to retain it you know the actual
act of typing I don't think does
anything if you were to sit there and
just think about the code for a minute
or two would probably do the same thing
well and what it like so what do you
think we'll build in that context busy I
agree that that's that's really what it
is it's about spending more time because
it's so easy to just like copy some code
over and not even look at it like I
always think it's valuable even when I'm
looking up something on Stack Overflow
to at least even if I don't fully
understand what it is that I need in
there like I can I spend enough time to
to grasp it before I'm going to use the
code
just because it's a nice learning
experience and so like how I mean is or
is it the way that these are going to be
set up that it's not necessarily that an
important because someone's just going
to get so much repetition and just going
through these fast that it doesn't
matter since they aren't complex bites
the complex pieces they're like small
little digestible easily digestible
bite-sized pieces are they pretty much
going to there's not really even any
need to spend much time per each one
because they're just going to get a
little little bit of focus a little bit
of focus a little bit of focus does that
make sense right yeah that's enough of
my my operating theory is that if you
just if you just give them so many hours
of this which we're aiming for a hundred
hours which is a lot I mean if you look
at like Codecademy the entire curriculum
for for all their different languages
you could probably get through it in
less than 100 hours if you're trying to
go for sheer bulk like that that will
give them a lot of practice and they
don't necessarily they can there could
be some degree repetition it shouldn't
be like direct reputation okay you did
this do this again but they should
figure out novel ways of like
reincorporated things and cycling things
back in and stuff like that cycling
numbers back in and now it's time to get
the numbers back in you know and things
like that and I think that'll give them
sufficient repetition so they get
sufficient you know focus on a concept
sure and then a one other thing that
comes to mind is how will it work with
um like say someone that does have more
experience that these beginning things
are really easy is it still going to be
I guess required in the sense that they
will need to still go through all the
the the very basic things my like I
would recommend unless they are already
like a practicing JavaScript developer
who just wants more practice I've been
telling the campers basically the same
thing if you are very calm if you're
able to complete all the bonfires
without going through the challenges
then you're probably ready and also the
same thing if you're if you're able to
complete the zip line
and the base jumps and the bonfires
without going through the the the
waypoints then you're probably ready you
didn't need them anyway but but for like
probably ninety percent maybe ninety
five percent of our campers these are
going to be like the natural starting
point for them to rapidly get up to
speed on how these things work okay does
that answer your question yeah that puts
it a little different context in my mind
to of thinking about it it's like it
almost makes it even easier I'm not like
these aren't necessarily being written I
mean they are to prepare someone to be
able to have a career in JavaScript or
whatnot but it's it's that very
beginning foundation more importantly
it's just easier to put in the context
of these challenges are preparing
someone to be able to complete the
bonfires to be able to complete the zip
lines to be able to so like that's a
nice measuring point of it's like what's
going to get them to that stage yeah
yeah and I think that's basically the
role of this is the you know if you have
no evaluation criteria then there's no
way to evaluate the the content that
you're working through but the
courseware that's why I like every class
you'll probably ever take will have some
sort of exit test but you know a lot of
more progressive professors it would not
care if you even came to the class if
you could come and pass the test at the
end of it so it's kind of like that
that's kind of how I view it I don't
want to lock somebody into having to do
these if they don't want to but we do
need tests and these are not intended to
test your ability as a program these are
intended to give you a rapid fire
training in javascript in these tools
and yeah like it's definitely optional
but it will be a lot of work that will
hopefully help a lot of people if they
do choose to do it ok so then one last
thing before I have to go then to what's
the what are the most important or I
guess what has been covered in the in
the JavaScript you said Michael wrote
some so I feel like Michael wrote it
together I think we were like 12 towns
mean it's literally like less than a
percentage of everything like all the
bonfires that are written so far maybe
like three or four percent of the
bonfires that need to be rid Eric I'm
sorry wait points that need to be
written so you can see in here like
actually starting starting here I think
we wrote like 12 of these and and part
of it is like it may seem like oh we
need zero progress you know if you think
about it like you know Abraham Lincoln
famously said if I had if I had eight
hours to chop down a tree it's from the
first six hours sharpening the axe once
we get like our philosophy and
everything locked into place and we'll
just bang these out yeah um but but
currently like this is all like I could
throw this all away and start over and
it wouldn't really be a big deal I would
have learned a lot from just having
built these initial ones um so I
wouldn't worry too much about what's
already been written I mean you can look
at it right here and course first out
JSON I also wouldn't try to do this on
your own I would try to do everything
pairing okay well I'm going to do for
those that are watching I'm going to
relaunch the stream as soon as Brandon
hops off and we're going to be doing I'm
going to be building zip lines and BASE
jumps and those I can build on my own
but the course where frankly is like on
a whole different level than the
bonfires and the base jumps and zip
lines in terms of like just the amount
of thought you need to put it to it
because everything is integrated into a
whole curriculum and we want everything
to be consistent and I don't really want
it to be built piecemeal sure you saw it
is then things won't necessarily fit
together so pretty much everything that
ends up getting pretty much any anyone
that's working on these uh these
waypoints pretty much takes it from like
the next like wherever they are like say
these 12 that are here someone starts on
the 13th one would be right if like if
I'm pairing with someone else like we
would just go to the 13th we wouldn't be
thinking about in the future we'll be
doing this one because there could be
found some foundation or different
things lost in there
yeah i mean i'd like to I'd like to
create a document that's going to steer
the overall sequence of their learning
and i'll probably be thinking a lot
about that and looking at and i'd like
to talk with a professional
instructional designer who's built
things like this before and get insights
from him or her because the actual
strategy of what to introduce in what
sequence is going to be really important
yeah but but basically assuming that we
do have that in place then it'll be
obvious like you're working with numbers
what are some different things that you
should be able to do with numbers and
then we'll move from there okay but yeah
i'll try to get together a document that
outlines kind of our goals for the
course where r for the for the waypoints
it's definitely the thing that i think
will be the last thing to be completed
of all the current initiatives okay so
what i would recommend you do is is
don't they just think about this and
then when you had time if you have time
to do bonfires your excellent making
bonfires those bonfires you made a
really popular build more bonfires okay
and then when we have time hopefully
i'll have put a lot more thought into
this and any thoughts you have based on
this conversation i'd love to discuss
because this you know the curriculum
development we've like had a lot of
false starts because it's just such a
massive task but 100 our curricula and
making it sufficiently modular like we
have basic principles in place basically
we're hoping to follow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
