going to use sass and react to build the
game of life if you haven't heard of the
game of life it's designed by
mathematician John Conway and it's a
pretty cool kind of mathematical
experiment basically it simulates the
lives of cells who either reproduce or
die based on the number of neighbors
they have it's it has some very basic
rules which are explained in a video
that I've linked to and also in the
Wikipedia article for the game of life
but as you can see squares gradually
coalesce into these patterns that don't
change so this looks pretty complicated
but again it's based on a few simple
rules let's talk about the rules for
building this zipline itself the first
rule as always don't look at the example
projects code figure it out for yourself
fulfill the below user stories using
whichever libraries and api's you need
be sure to give it your own personal
style and be sure to use sass and react
to build this project the point of this
project is to give you react practice
let's talk about user stories so when I
first arrived at the game it will
randomly generate a board and start
playing automatically I can start and
stop the board I can set up the board I
can clear the board and when I press
start the game will just play out each
time the board changes I can see how
many generations have gone by so let's
let's take another look at this real
quick first of all I can clear the board
I can add some squares here if I want to
and you can see that that didn't last
very long
but the generations keep counting up
even though nothing's happening
I can also these are some additional
things that you don't have to do but the
speed of the simulation the size of the
grid those are things that can be
changed fairly easily once you have
everything built with react and if I
were to refresh this you'll see that it
just has the new board and it
automatically starts running the
generations are ticking up so this is a
fairly challenging zip line but it's a
lot of fun I encourage you to watch the
video link here and read the reference
and once you're done of course be sure
to share it in our code review chatroom
and also on Twitter and on your city's
campsite on Facebook
enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
