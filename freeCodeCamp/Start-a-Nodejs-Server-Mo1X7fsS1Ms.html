to use note schools learn you know de
classe so first let's go back to cloud
nine and if we're already signed in we
can just go ahead and go to the
dashboard and we should still have our
project that we used for the NPM class
so let's start editing that so like the
NPM class learn your node is a node
school challenge and it will be quite
challenging indeed so expect to spend
maybe two or three sittings to get
through this but it's definitely going
to be useful obviously you'll be doing a
lot of node development in the coming
months so run this command that we have
right here and then just like the NPM
node school challenge you're going to
basically run this command to bring up
the interactive challenge selecting menu
all right and we can run it and we can
see it's very similar so we can just go
to the first challenge and it will give
us hints and just like the other
challenge it'll evaluate our code so
first things first it wants us to create
program j/s so I'm going to create that
right here you file program j/s and they
just want us to have it log something so
let's see they want us to have it
log hello world to the console using
standard out and the way you do that is
with console log like in their example
right here so let's go ahead and double
click this and open up program Jas and
we'll just do console
the log and it looks like they wanted in
all caps hello world and let's not
forget the semicolon and we can save it
and then we can just run this command
right here larger you know three or five
programs yes and it's a pass and it
shows the actual input and the expected
input so keep going through these
challenges there quite a few of them but
they will harden your skills for doing
nodejs development which you're going to
do extensively in our lines base jumps
and nonprofit projects enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
