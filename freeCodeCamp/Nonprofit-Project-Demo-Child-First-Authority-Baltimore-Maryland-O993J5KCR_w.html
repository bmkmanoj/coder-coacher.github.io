today I'll be presenting a free code
camp project that Dennis and I have been
working on for the past several months
so I'm just gonna start off by giving
you guys a brief overview of the
organization we're helping scope of our
project and then I'll go into the app
highlight a few features followed by a
brief discussion about the tech stack
and then followed by some contact
information if you want guys want to
follow up with us after the presentation
so the organization we're helping out is
childfirst Authority they're a Baltimore
based nonprofit organization and one of
their main goals is to help address the
issues of truancy that are occurring in
the public school systems that they
serve and the one of the essential
components to addressing this issue is
tracking student data in terms of
absences tardies etc and all this data
that they're tracking right now is
currently being done via Google spread
use me uh excel spreadsheets so our main
goal was to provide them with an
application that would help aggregate
their data in a more orderly fashion and
allowing them to easily monitor and
update records so moving onto the
application here is the login page so to
address the issue of privacy of student
data and information we wanted to make
sure that our authentication was fairly
secure and we decided to go with Google
authentication as the only means of
locking into our application so if a new
user wanted to
sign up for our to use this application
they could do so in a few steps so first
thing user must attempt to log in and
they'll be redirected to a page that
tells them to contact an admin for
access or approval so once they go about
doing that the admin will then go ahead
and login themselves
and they will change their role from a
guest to whatever role they'll be taking
on the in the program so in this case
we'll just set the new user to teacher
and we will give them a school
assignment as well so now when we try to
log in as a new user we should be able
to get access and we should be able to
see our new school sign so this is the
main dashboard this is a what everyone
sees when they first log on to the
application in this main view you will
get a list of students that are
currently in the database now in terms
of tracking as you see there's various
fields here for absences tardies days
present are enrolled and changes between
absence records and above here
our overall counts on outreach triggers
that have occurred based on their
absence or tardy accounts so to upload
data to the application you can click on
one of two places this top bar right
here records or on our sidebar and since
I've been assigned to school in my
current level
our role is teacher I can't choose a
specific school I want to upload to
however if my role is administrator or
super admin I could select the school
here moving on we'll go ahead and upload
a PDF and we'll choose today's date
as you can see we first given a preview
of the data before it's uploaded to the
database um so if everything looks good
let's go ahead and confirm and we're
notified that the entries have been
successfully uploaded to the database
going back to the dashboard we'll see
our new list of students along with the
data that we've uploaded and if we want
to get more information about a specific
student we can click on their student ID
that will redirect us to a student data
info page provide a more in-depth look
at their current attendance current
statistics of their absent ISM data and
also more importantly outreaches and
interventions
so our reaches are actions that are
triggered and provided when absences or
tardies reach certain levels
interventions are actions that are taken
on top of our beaches so let's just try
to create a new intervention for this
student I'll just say it's a phone call
and you want to provide more details we
can even add a note about the phone call
interventions can be archived and we can
see our craft interventions if you want
as well by toggling at screen finally
just click on this tab right here that
provides some vital statistics and a
lists for childfirst Authority one being
at risk for chronic absenteeism and then
another list for students that are
currently chronically absent and then
also an outreach summary of different
outreach interventions that have been
triggered per student and like the
dashboard lists all of these can be
sorted searched as well as downloaded as
a CSV or PDF
we go to options settings you can see
these are the different outreach
triggers and as a role of a teacher you
can customize and edit your own schools
coverage triggers and that pretty much
covers the general functionality of the
app as it stands today in terms of the
tech stack we went with the mean stack a
scaffold scaffold ADA our project using
yo angular generator so with angular
running the front end and nodejs Express
MongoDB running the server-side some
notable third-party packages that we
used include UI grid bootstrap although
we recently made the shift to using a
flex stylings file upload PDF PDF Jas
and hi charts which will actually be
using down the road and also to maintain
a stable development environment we both
you just a vagrant box and this is a
configuration we used in the vagrant big
and Broncs some of the global packages
we installed a few of the upcoming
features we're gonna be adding data
visualization to the project using a
charts we'll also be adding archive and
car on archive schools and their
students and also a few more in-depth
summaries and reports and data that will
help childfirst Authority when it comes
to writing for funding and reporting to
their schools if you'd like to take a
more in-depth look at our project it's
available on github
and under the child first authority FCC
project group here the you'll find three
different repos currently one with that
web app itself the other with the vacant
box and the third one including some
sample PDFs that you can use during
development
you guys wanna contact us or have any
questions feel free to give us a shout
on the free code camp chats on Gitter or
we're both on twitter and you're our
handles Dennis's is d underscores ting
and mine is PG&amp;amp;E and that pretty much
does it so thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
