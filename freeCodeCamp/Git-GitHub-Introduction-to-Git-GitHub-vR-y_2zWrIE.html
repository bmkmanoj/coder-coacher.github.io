I'm Briana from 
freeCodeCamp.
Today we are going to be 
talking about Git and GitHub:
how you use them, 
when you use them,
and some of the differences 
between the two.
To start off, 
let's talk about Git.
Git is a 
version control software,
which means 
while you're coding
you can save each little time 
you make a change.
So if you 
make a mistake,
you want to 
undo something,
or you just want 
to look back
and see how 
it was before,
you can do 
that with Git.
Git is also 
open source.
You can find 
Git to download
at http://git-scm.com
they also have 
great resources
for documentation.
Now let's talk 
about GitHub.
You've probably been 
on GitHub before
for some 
freeCodeCamp things,
noticed it there, 
you probably even have an account.
GitHub is a 
collaboration website
that interacts with Git 
and works with it
on the projects 
that you work on
in your 
version control.
It's hard to tell 
where the line is
between what's Git 
and what's GitHub -
that's okay, 
you don't have to know.
What you need 
to remember is
you'll use GitHub 
to interact with Git.
You'll use it 
to collaborate
with your peers on projects
using version control.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
