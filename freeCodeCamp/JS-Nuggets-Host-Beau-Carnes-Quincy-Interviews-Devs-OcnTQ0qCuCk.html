joining
today Bo cons the host of Jay s nuggets
a brand new YouTube channel all right we
are live
hello thank you for joining us today and
bo is in Michigan in a town with about
50,000 people you know it works as a
special education instructor mm-hmm and
he is a very active camper within freako
camps community I was looking at his
github he's completed a ton of projects
and he's also participating in the 100
days of code challenge so Bo tell us a
little bit about yourself oh yeah yeah I
am I'm currently a special education
teacher but I basically decided that I
want to switch careers to software
development so I at the this last summer
I did great I graduate the degree within
software development and I've been doing
a lot on free code camp and I've just
been trying to do a lot of things to
prepare for a transition at the end of
the school year to software development
and one of those things that you've done
in order to further practice your skills
and expand your knowledge and also to
apply your teaching experience in your
teaching ability is to launch this
YouTube channel which I believe you
launched about maybe 45 days ago yeah
yeah so I have this jeaious Nuggets
YouTube channel and I've been posting
one video every weekday and they're just
short JavaScript training videos so I
kind of set an ambitious schedule for
myself of doing one every weekday I
basically said it started because well
kind of a lot of different things but I
had recently read this book linchpin by
Seth Godin and when I one of his key key
ideas in the book is that it's important
to become indispensable in your
workplace and I was
I don't really they want to be
indispensable in my workplace because
I'm planning to switch careers soon so I
was just trying to think what can I do
to become indispensable in my new
workplace which would be hope software
development then of the school year I
want to switch over and so and even
though I'm switching careers from
teaching
I still enjoy teaching and so I was
trying to think of how I can kind of
combine my passions of teaching and
software and so that's when I started
thinking of the YouTube channel and
another thing I've heard from Seth Godin
and from other people just the
importance of having a lot of content
out there to kind of get you get your
yourself out there so now that's kind of
how how I keep the idea of having this
YouTube channel to hopefully you know
make me more indispensable to whatever
company I I I met in the future and then
hopefully it will also just provide a
benefit to others just trying to learn
to code because you know I'm kind of
learning as I go so a lot of the I'm
learning to to do some of the concepts
as I as I make the videos about the
concepts so it's definitely a way to to
really learn learn better you have to
know it you have to understand a concept
better to be able to teach it so that's
another bit of benefit of having the the
channel yeah and I can absolutely test
testify that or a test to that reality
that by teaching you really learn the
content better there's a saying that
until you're ready to turn around and
teach somebody a concept you don't truly
understand it yourself and through
teaching it's it's a very practical
opportunity to further cement your own
understanding of the concept mm-hmm so
you've been just cranking out these
videos I mean it's amazing you've been
creating thing one every day or at least
one every weekday for the past month and
you've got quite a large corpus of these
short videos tell us a little bit about
the format and how you settled on just
having a screencast and just super
to the point jump straight in and cover
a concept well for one I'm a firm
believer in really ambitious goals so I
mentioned I got that degree in software
development it's the school I went to is
called Western Governors University and
they allow you to work at your own pace
and nor since I had some classes that
transferred in that was supposed to take
about two years to do their degree and I
was able to finish in five months five
days and they you actually work with a
mentor that they call it the every week
from the school and she was kind of
using me as an example to some of the
other students that to show to show like
what's possible
I specifically remember um she said
there's one student that was passing one
class every six months and so she told
him about me doing like one class every
two weeks to kind of hopefully hopefully
didn't discourage it more but when I
decided to start the YouTube channel I
also really wanted to have an ambitious
goal of trying to do one one video every
every weekday just to well for one it
kind of made me what make me stand out a
little bit to be having that goal and
then also one of the goals is of the
channels to I mean there's a lot of
things I'm excited about for the channel
but I'm hoping that it will help me am I
going to get a job in the summer and so
I want to have a lot of content out
there to point to by the time a I go to
try to switch careers so that's another
reason for the channel I'm kind I think
it lost track of the question a little
bit yeah or I'm just observing first of
all you're cranking out these these
excellent videos they're really well
done they're really well thought out and
really well executed and and you
explained the concepts very well I would
recommend everybody who's watching if
you haven't already subscribe to both
channel I put a link down in the
description of this video
oh isn't kind of how I chose the format
of the video yeah how did you choose the
format and and how do you keep up this
pace yeah well I was trying to well
there's a few reasons why I want to try
to make quick videos anyone because I
want to do a lot of them so short of
videos you can do it doesn't take much
time and I know when I'm when I'm
looking to select a YouTube video that
I'm gonna watch I generally will try to
find the shorter videos so and then I
also I look for a video with the good
like a good screenshot you know so for
that I actually just had my wife take
cuz you know it's all it's mainly when
I'm making the videos all it's all audio
so I have my wife take about like 60
pictures of me in different poses it's
just on one photo shoot day so so for
each video I've pulled a new new clip if
you go into the channel you'll see that
each each video has a screen shot of me
in a different pose so I just take it
from this one day they had this one
photo shoot with a lot of different
pictures so that's kind of why I chose
the short format was so be easier to do
and then hopefully be more interesting
to people and another thing I do is as
far as the format I try to I don't know
if you can tell this in the videos if I
do I speed up the video is just slightly
because um personally I watch all videos
at like one and a half or two times be
mine washing one YouTube I don't know
it's just a way to try that information
quicker you know so I so for the my
videos I started when I first started
making him I would do at one point two
five time speeds like 125 percent I did
I asked some people on the forums on
free code camp about that and one guy
was recommending well let let people
choose if they're gonna speed it up or
not so I I've been making him not I've
been making them at one point one point
one five time speeds so not quite as
fast but still the part of the video is
supposed to be like Britt
this supposed to be quick so I'm still
speeding up a little bit and as far as
trying to find the time to do it
one thing I've kind of done recently I
every once in a while I'll try to change
up my daily schedule a little bit to see
what it's gonna work and for a while I
was trying to I have a two kids and a
four-year-old and a two-year-old so it's
much easier to focus when they're asleep
because they're they're very active and
I really enjoy playing with them you
know so I was trying to do a lot of work
after they went to sleep but by the time
the end of the day came my brain was
just so fried from thinking all day that
I couldn't really focus so I've been
actually going to bed early like right
for my kids go to bed so usually in bed
better on night I wake up at 4 a.m. just
to do the do the the Jays Nuggets video
and then you mentioned I'm doing the
hundred day lifts of code so I'm trying
to code for at least an hour a day so I
do both of those in the in the morning
then up until like the point my kids
wake up and then I usually let my wife
sleep in a few minutes and help the kids
with breakfast before I go off to work
Wow my day so just to make sure I
understand correctly you're going to
sleep when your kids go to sleep you've
got two kids two til child kids all
these kids and you're going to sleep
early you're waking up at 4 a.m.
you're not only recording these videos
but you're also participating in 100
days of code challenge yeah and then
you're going to work you're working tell
us a little bit about you so you're a
special education teacher and you're
also the coach of the High School
Robotics team yeah yeah so I'm doing
because I'm a high school teacher of
doing special education and one thing
often
I might once break I'll even sometimes I
do some planning for the Jays Nuggets
videos on my you once break so that's
another thing I kind of do to get in
similar time during the day too for that
but yeah I coached the robotics team
it's my first I've done a middle-school
robotics team but it's my first year
doing high school and I definitely
really enjoy it I mean my my schedule is
kind of overbooked right now with all
those different things so I'm looking
forward to the robotics team being over
so I get a little bit of extra time
because that's this right for school so
like right after my school day I do the
robotics until I and then I come home to
see my family for a little bit before my
kids go to bed you know so Sosuke the
robot season will be over and then I'll
get a little bit extra time there well
great and you also teach like
programming as part of the robotics
class I mean the robotics class what
percentage would you say is actually
working with hardware and what
percentage of it is writing the software
that controls the hard way yes it's
mainly the hardware but yeah there is a
programming component to it so I've been
trying to get like show show students
different programming concepts and and
and help them with that and so it and
it's a I teach Kevin uh you know it's
more than like an urban school district
setting and a lot of the students don't
have a lot of experience with
programming like programming and
computers at home I mean almost all the
students have a have a cellphone but as
far as having access to um like a
desktop computer it's not it's not all
the students have that so I try to give
them give them some exposure to that one
of the challenges actually is that when
you most students have no idea what
computer programming is like if you say
computer programming or coding or
software development they think they
think it's using programs and it takes a
while for them to get excited since they
have no idea what it is it takes them a
while to get excited about it because
they don't have any concept of what it
even means to create a program this
getting them excited about it let me ask
you so as somebody who regularly tries
to get young adults or
rather teenagers excited about
programming what is like the fastest
most effective way you've found to to
get them for everybody who's watching
who has like you know a nephew or a
niece or just some some teenage friends
that they want to get interested in
coding what would be like the elevator
pitch for why people should learn to
code and what it involves oh well yeah I
think I think all students should be
exposed to coding I mean because it's
even if you're not going to go into
software development as a critter that
there's so many but there's so many jobs
where it can be helpful just to do a
little bit of software development of
coding to helping your job and just
since there's more and more software
jobs every day you it's no matter what
job you're and you should have some kind
of experience and knowledge of what it
is I go say and a lot of students have
no I don't even have an idea of what it
is so I think it's important for all
students to learn software development I
would summarize that mysoline particular
this was the first year they ever had a
computer programming class at the school
so it's common that a lot of schools
don't have computer programming classes
so I just think it's it's a it's a it's
an important thing for for students to
learn and and there's so many great
resources out there one of the best as I
found as far as like teaching students
beginning coding there's code.org right
cool thing about that is they have they
have something for basically every level
they have something for elementary
school middle school age high school-age
students but there's there's entire
curriculums on there for pretty much
every every grade level on on there and
then obviously um event so they can move
on to a frico camp comm where at that or
go for a web development yeah and have
you tried using so specifically for
learning robotics are there any tools
like I've talked to a few people are
building robotics related curricula that
run in the browser and things like that
but you found any tools specifically
robotics as far as the software
generally with this Robotics Club
they're specific you like for the high
school level you can can't choose what
what programming language is what
programming language you use you can use
Java or C++ or as it could give you some
options and they have different
resources to help you with whatever
programming language you're going to use
and but one thing I found for like
introducing I just kind of found out
about this there's um I was able to get
a grant for this little robot called
Cosmo and it has it has like an
artificial intelligence built in it's
just it's like basically the size of a
fist even smaller but you can connect it
to your computer and a hit and you can
program it to do different things and
someone made it an extension for a
scratch you know the scratch program
languages what we give toward kids but I
was having it as an introduction that's
what I was doing I was having um
students program this little tiny robot
using scratch and you can get different
commands and it's more of a graphical
interface so I found that that was kind
of a good way to start introducing
people to it right so scratch is the kid
friendly language mostly like graphical
drag-and-drop components to program
developed by MIT a few years ago yeah
you start off your robotics classes with
that yeah as far as like one of it
teaching them to for the programming
aspect when I get to that that's what I
was doing at least this year I just
found out about this year so this is my
first year using that but since the this
little robot already has some built-in
programs they can do and then you can
add your own so at first they can get
excited about what program what robots
can do by this thing was already vain'
built into it and then they can start
kind of adding their own code so and I
even them to learn how I tested out with
my four-year-old and he was actually
pretty excited about it too so we the
one of them if you you cannot you can
actually program them to save different
things so it was my four-year-olds idea
to make it to me I can say I love you
mommy
and then he he there he he we set up so
when he when he pressed a button the
robot said that so I brought the robot
over to mommy and he got to press the
button so he was pretty excited about
that Wow I mean that is just such a
great example of kind of contextualizing
the value of technology in a way that
you know parents and kids can understand
that's really cool way to apply apply
those tools kind of a little love letter
conveyed by a robot yeah so we we have a
live audience they've been asking some
questions and I want to jump to one that
a camper sea lion Stefanski I hope I'm
pronouncing your name right he's from
Israel and he's very interested in WGU
Western Governors University I it's a
private nonprofit University operated
out of Salt Lake City I think or
someplace Salt Lake City mm-hmm yeah and
I've heard a lot of things about this
university because it's a very
economical it's it's almost like if you
want a speedrun University yeah tell us
a little bit about how you discovered it
and your thoughts on it I mean obviously
it's your alma mater
like III my first degree is actually in
video production that I went to a just
like a state university in Michigan and
then I ended up switching to teaching
but I went to Western Cumbres University
for my teaching degree and so I was kind
of wondering how it was gonna be hard
for me to get a job with an online
degree but I actually I don't know if it
was luck or what but I got a job within
one month after graduating and so when I
went to switch careers again it's this
take me a while to figure out what I
want to do with my life so I just got my
third degree I decided to look into
Western Governors University and it the
they charge you every um every six
months you pay I think it's three
thousand dollars about
and so that's so it's a lot cheaper than
other universities and you could work at
your own pace so I knew my own pace was
super quick I actually I think I
mentioned I did the degree in five
months five days and something that was
really motivating for that was I knew
that if I took longer than six months I
would have to pay three thousand more
dollars so there was some things that I
could have spent more time on different
aspects of the program but I realized
well I'll have time to do that
afterwards and actually I did do that
afterwards up one thing that is kind of
interesting like as part of the program
you get a subscription to lynda.com so I
was thinking I could like watch all
these videos so they have the
subscription but it's gonna be cheaper
just to finish off this degree as quick
as possible and then continue watching
videos and somehow my subscription still
lasted the rest of the year so it
actually continued learning and I was
after that day to the Freak OPM so as
far as trying to get things quick I went
through the front end certification on
fleek okay I'm in just three weeks
Wow the difference about that was that
um that was during my summer break as a
teacher and this last summer was my
first summer they didn't get a summer
job I always got a summer job before but
this summer I was like I'm gonna focus
on coding full-time so well so I was
basically doing it full-time when I when
I was able to get through that front-end
certification so I've been able to
continue like developing projects like
through Western Governors University
there weren't there were some projects
but not as much as I would have liked
from a portfolio but it gave me a good
foundation to continue to go on to
develop things on my own
and I've talked to a lot of people that
went to more traditional universities
for computer science and programming and
it sounds like it's pretty other schools
don't really give you that much projects
either compared to how much employers
that are really looking for but a great
thing about freako camp is that you get
the opportunity to develop some projects
for your portfolio yeah yeah and that's
what I've heard like even from people
who study it like Stanford for example
MIT they do do projects they do a few
big projects like semester projects they
don't have a big portfolio of just 25 or
30 projects like you get working through
freako camp or like West boss recently
launched JavaScript 30 week oh yeah 30
projects and they're really cool
projects too if you all haven't checked
them out I mean there's just a wealth of
different project ideas that people can
build if they want to sit down and work
on it and so you basically just to make
sure everybody who's listening
understands so you had you were on
summer break from your job as a teacher
yeah and he sat down and in the course
of three weeks you built all ten of the
projects associated with the the
front-end development certain yeah I
mean for one I didn't I do very many of
the option you know how some of the
things were optional I didn't do much of
those and I did have I mean I didn't
have a lot of experience but it had some
experience with the web development
before in the end so I wasn't coming in
with with no knowledge like this so I
it's fine that people take longer than
that you know but as things I want to
say about the Western Governors
University is that I ended up making a
blog post that basically detailed waited
for each class to finish quickly and so
this person that was interested in
Western Governors if you want to do the
degree I did in software development I
have a blog post about what it did for
each individual class and that and that
I get a lot of views on that a lot of
people doing that program go and check
out that blog post where I just kind of
give details for each class of what how
I was able to do it so quickly excellent
um I will link to that in the show notes
to that blog post okay a bunch of people
are commenting on the size of your beard
and wondering well a bigger beard
correlates with more ability they're
crank through coding projects well you
know I've had a beard for like 12 years
but I haven't this is the I don't always
have it this fall but just recently I've
been inspired by some people I've seen
they had such full beards and I wanted
to try it out so so far I'm liking it
awesome well does it make it more
challenging to chew your food
um I mean definitely it's it's easier to
save some food for later for this big
but is it's not not too bad
awesome well thank you again for joining
us whether this has been a blast
congratulations on finishing your degree
so quickly congratulations on finishing
the front-end development certificate I
hope everybody who's watching or
listening to this checks out J s nuggets
I've been watching the episodes as they
come in and learning a lot from them and
I think that they're an excellent
example of how to film short or tutorial
videos so we'll probably be hearing a
lot from you later on and thanks again
keep keep doing what you're doing okay
well thank you thanks again for uh for
doing the interview with me I've enjoyed
it alright have a beautiful afternoon
and thank you everybody who tuned in to
watch ok bye
