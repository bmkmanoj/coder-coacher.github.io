Seattle she is a marine biologist turn
data scientists and she recently wrote a
data visualization article that was
quite popular it got picked up on
Mashable it got picked up by a ton of
foreign press and it was about a very
controversial topic but she did an
excellent job of visualizing it and
really driving home a lot of the
considerations and a lot of the things
that basically she used data
visualization to drive home a very
important point and I'll let amber tell
us what that point is sorry so I decided
I wanted to look at the difference
between dialogue that females have in
movies and males have in movies so I did
a very small sample I wanted to just
look at the top 10 highest grossing
films from last year so that included
you know movies like Captain America
Civil War and rogue one which is you
know was a really hot button topic
because people were kind of mad that
there was a second Star Wars movie with
a female protagonist and I saw that
movie and really just didn't feel like
there were a lot of women that were
actually represented other than Jane who
was the main character so I decided to
do a data science sort of little dive
into the dialogue for those top 10
movies and just see was I correct where
they're actually females equally
represented in those movies and so I did
the project and visualized it and wrote
it up and like you said it's gotten a
lot of a lot of traction which is really
cool yeah and tell us a little bit about
your findings the article by the way is
in the description of this so if you
want to click through and take a look at
the data vision and I also link directly
to the data visualization the amber
built but tell us a little bit just in
brief about the findings great so
ultimately what happened is none of the
top ten movies from last year had an
equal number of female speaking
characters so I looked at any character
who said even one word
and I tried to categorize their gender
based on the pronouns that were used or
the actors IMDB page and things like
that and all of the the descriptions of
my methodology are in that article as
well but yeah ultimately there weren't
there wasn't gender equality in any of
those top ten movies for a number of
characters and when it comes to dialogue
finding dory is the only movie that had
more than 50% female dialogue or even at
50% all of the others had way below 50%
female dialogue or at least below this
is kind of surprising so you talked a
little bit about your methodology for
collecting that basically did you you
watched all of these movies I have seen
all of them now what I basically did is
I tried looking online for transcripts
so people who had already gone through
and watched the movie and typed up all
of the dialogue that happened throughout
the movie for some of them I was able to
find it with you know the character
attribution so this character said this
and then this characters got this which
made my job really easy because then I
just had to feed the text file into a
program and figure out how many words
each character said other movies weren't
quite as easy I had to use things like
closed captions and things like that
which had all of the dialogue but didn't
have which character said what so for
those movies I did have to manually go
through and watch the movie and
attribute each set of words to the
character that said them so it was a
labor of love I guess so tell us a
little bit about the software that you
use to actually do the calculations
sorry so I use the program called are
its free and open source and if you
haven't used it it's really great
specifically for statistical analysis
which is mostly what it's for but it's a
base software and then you can download
specific packages for your needs for
this project I really didn't need any
specific software or any specific
packages for our because I was just
doing simple text parsing which was
really good practice
for my regular expression skills which
are you know not awesome but I had to
tell it basically to go and look for
things like sets of characters in
between spaces so it's good so you're
you're feeding these big files in and
you're basically just going through and
using regular expressions to parse like
full scripts of movies essentially
mm-hmm yep and then I was able to join
all of the data by character so I just
had like a word count for every
character and then went through and
assigned gender to each character as
well so that's the data collection part
but the really exciting and a really
interesting part I thought was the
actual data visualizations you really
how did you build those so I used d3 or
data-driven documents JavaScript library
for that which was actually unique for
me because I had never used d3 before
most of my visualizations I had always
made in R because R has the capability
to make those visualizations but I ran
into a couple issues and that I wanted
something really specific for these
visualizations I wanted basically
bubbles each one representing a
character sized based on the number of
words that the character said and then
sort of grouped together and I was
having a really hard time doing that in
R and having the level of detail that I
really wanted for this and so I did some
research and found that d3 made that
possible so I started looking at
tutorials and other just examples of
things that people have already done and
I looked at their script and it was kind
of trial and error
honestly figuring out what all of the
pieces did and figuring out how to make
that work for my information so what's
the name of the type of visualization
that you chose to use to represent the
dialogue I think it's called a bubble
chart so it's it's just a grouping of
bubbles sometimes when you hear a bubble
chart you imagine it being on an XY axis
which I did actually try for these data
was putting kind of like a scatter plot
of different circles that were sized
based on the number of words that were
spoken and I tried putting them on an XY
axis but what happened is the characters
that have
a lot of words were way off in the
corner and then all of the minor
characters were like bundles down in the
other corner and you really couldn't
tell the difference between those minor
characters so I wanted to get rid of the
XY axis so if you look at the
visualization you see this grouping of
bubbles that's just sort of in like a
circle and one of the things I really
like about your visualization is its
interactive you can click the button and
roll it'll separate out the no
characters dialog from the female
character dialogue was that tricky at
all the setup with d3 or was that pretty
once I knew how to do it it was really
easy that again was kind of one of those
things that I decided I wanted my
visualization to look a certain way and
to behave a certain way before I had any
idea how to actually make that happen so
once I knew what I wanted it to do it
was a matter of going through and
figuring out how to actually make it
split and I had seen other
visualizations made in d3 with double
charts where the bubbles could be
separated so I knew it was possible so
it was just a matter of figuring out how
to do it which actually wasn't terribly
hard I had some issues with the bubbles
like running into each other and
overlapping and never never stopped
shaking which was kind of entertaining
but eventually I got it so how much Java
Script did you have to learn for this
you know I think the visualization that
came out of it was a good baseline for
me but I definitely have spent some time
after finishing it going back and
brushing up on the basics of JavaScript
because like I said I'd never touched
JavaScript before this and I've had a
couple people go and look at the script
that generates those visualizations and
be like this is not totally optimized
like I know I'm working on it like it's
it's a work in progress so I'm still
learning do you plan to use d3 and are
that combination of statistical and I
also submit ization for future projects
yeah absolutely I actually really
enjoyed d3 and even though it took some
some getting used to and like I said I
had some weird errors where bubbles were
shooting across my screen and stuff it
was really great and I love the
interactive element and you can get that
a little bit with certain packages in
our but I liked being able to have
something that was totally personalized
and customizable so I will be using d3
more let's talk a little bit about how
you stumble upon this project you
mentioned were you proactively looking
for something to create a visualization
for or what's the story you know
normally when I do like personal
projects like this yes I am normally
looking for like something that I want
to do and usually I make my personal
projects revolve around some new skill
that I'm trying to learn so it might
seem like this one I went into you know
trying to learn d3 but this project
actually for me was really different and
that I had I didn't plan to do this
project originally the reason I started
it is because I I saw rogue one in
theaters and I was really excited about
going to see this the newest Star Wars
movie you know I grew up with Star Wars
and I liked the films and um and I was
excited to see another female
protagonist and then I kind of left
feeling like I could name all of the
female characters and so I started
having this conversation with friends
about if they noticed the same thing or
if I was crazy and there actually were
more females and I just didn't notice
and so I decided to stop just guessing
and asking people what their perception
of the movie was and just to actually
put numbers to it and so I decided to
look at that movie but then that seems
we were just to look at only one movies
though I expanded it to 10 and and chose
the top 10 highest-grossing films from
last year what point did you realize
like wow this is probably a whole lot of
work the first couple of movies that I
started working on were actually the
ones that had all of the the character
and like dialogue information like set
up really nicely so I was like this is
going to be so easy
and then the last several were the ones
that I had to like
find closed caption data and like go
through the movie manually and do it all
so I kind of realized it was going to be
a lot of work after I was maybe like 30
percent of the way through the data
collection but at that point I was too
excited to stop so I just kept going
well you collected a lot of data in your
previous career before you were a
biologist a marine biologist when you
transition from so you have a master's
degree too right I do yep in marine
sciences okay and as I understand you
were working for Disney as a marine
biologist what was that like in what
spurred you transitioning into data
science so yeah I do have an undergrad
degree and a master's degree both in in
marine biology or marine sciences so
I've been doing research in the marine
animal fields for a number of years now
and I've always liked the idea of asking
questions and and studying different
things and learning learning new things
and a lot of my work and I honestly did
not realize this until I was like almost
three-and-a-half years into working as a
professional marine biologist that my
day-to-day work almost entirely
consisted of data analysis data
visualization and data communication and
so I kind of took a hard look at my work
and what I was doing and the parts of my
job that I really enjoyed and realized
that I kind of although my job title was
marine biologists I was really a data
analyst who happened to be studying
marine data so I kind of made a decision
to shift slightly of marine biology is a
fantastic field but it's one where jobs
are really really limited so for me I
needed to find something that was a
little more stable and had a little bit
more growth opportunity and so data
science seemed like a perfect transition
of the
I was already doing the things I enjoyed
doing and a field that had some growth
opportunity to it do you think there are
a lot of scientists who are kind of in a
similar boat they've been working with
data for a long time it's a big part of
their job and they normals maybe realize
how similar it is to working as a full
blown data scientist you just working
with any data set that's not
domain-specific I think so and honestly
I'm part of a meet-up in Seattle called
Seattle data for good where we it's
basically a bunch of like data nerd type
people who come in and we're trying to
do data projects for social good and a
lot of the people in that group or at
least more than a few have a science
background you know there's a decent
number of them that were biologists or
you know had a degree in biology or hard
sciences and things like that and they
kind of came to the same realization
that I did that they were already doing
a lot of data analysis and so it kind of
made sense to bridge the gap so it's
it's kind of interesting how that how
that works out what have been some of
the more surprising aspects of that
transition from being a domain-specific
scientist focusing on marine biology
focusing on just general data so I
started using our when I was in grad
school and I thought I had a decent
grasp of the basics for it like I've
been using it for years mostly for very
specific purposes but I thought you know
that I had a pretty good understanding
of how it all worked and then I started
looking at online classes just to
refresh my memory and realize that I
never actually got a really solid
foundation in our programming so even
though I've been using it for a long
time I had to kind of backtrack and fill
in like the gaps in my knowledge that
weren't important for me as a marine
biologist necessarily like I didn't need
to web scrape anything as a marine
biologist and you know certain loops and
stuff like that were useful but others I
never needed to know mmm at least for
the work that I was doing so I had to go
back and sort of fill in those holes and
things
like that but that's really it
everything else you know I could plug in
any type of data for for the type of
analysis that I now know how to do you
obviously have to pick the right kind
for the data that you're working with so
I think that's a skill as well as
knowing how to look at your data and
knowing what type of analysis is
appropriate but yeah I think I think
that all just comes with practice we
actually have quite a few scientists in
our lab audience
Oh awesome one gentleman is actually but
he has a undergrad and biology strongly
considering going into software into
data science cool and then we have
another who's still pursuing
marine science degree working through a
frico camp so he's very interested in
drone technology and ways of you have to
collect data so those of you who are
watching her scientists specifically if
you have any questions for amber go
ahead and start thinking of and ask away
I couldn't relay the to her in the
meantime I want to talk about the
success of your article it was a
profoundly successful article it got
picked up as I said by Mashable I saw
references to it in a lot of major
publications and it got like a lot of
people were basically summarizing it and
translating it into other languages to
share insights talk about what happened
what was that like for you to one day be
you know watching a bunch of movies and
lunging through a whole lot of it
and the next day to have this article up
that was attracting all this attention
you know it was actually really bizarre
and totally surprising so I I did this
article and I thought it might be sort
of interesting for some other people who
might like these movies but I definitely
did not expect all of the attention that
the article ends up getting and what was
kind of interesting is shortly after I
published it on medium my phone started
buzzing like crazy because people were
tweeting it and every time they were
tweeting it from me
it was like including me and the in the
tweet and so I was like I've never
received this many notifications from
Twitter before in my life like it was so
strange every time I picked up my phone
it was like 20 new Twitter notifications
like what's happening which was great
and and you know a lot of people were
commenting on the article and and some
of them were just you know commenting
that they really liked it other people
you know had some some concerns about
methodology and all of that was
fantastic and I was really excited to
engage with those people and and I
started by trying to you know talk with
those people as much as I could and
respond to their comments after a while
a lot of the comments started repeating
so I did end up writing like a follow-up
article of frequently asked questions
but yeah it was really cool and then
getting picked up by other other
publications some of them emailed me
because they wanted to ask specific
questions but others like the Mashable
one I actually had no idea that that was
a thing and I got a text from one of my
friends who just texted me and said
congrats on Mashable and I was like I
have no idea what you're talking about
so it was really interesting and that
happened a couple of times I was
apparently people at IGN like the video
game website had a video post about the
article at one point that I didn't know
about and my dad found it and texted it
to me and was like I was looking at
video game things and they were talking
about you you know it's just really
bizarre but awesome you know it's it's
been really really good and really
interesting for me to have such a wide
reach I guess and to it interact with so
many different types of people over
something that I just did as a fun side
project you did you get so I know that
you currently amber you're looking for a
job in data visualization or as a data
scientist did you get any enquiries as a
result of the article I did a couple
people sort of reached out to me either
for like freelance opportunities or or
just working with them on other sort of
similar projects and you know applying
for jobs and reaching out to other
people this this article and and that
sort of thing have been really good for
me because I can point to to something
and say this has gotten really good
public feedback and so as a data
scientist or somebody who's making data
visualizations you need to be able to
communicate your work to a wide variety
of people so having something to point
to and say here's this you know data
science thing that I worked on and I
wrote up you know kind of like a how-to
for it but then I also wrote something
that was you know aimed more at a
general audience for anybody who happens
to like movies and be interested in this
concept all of those things are really
good I don't want to say resume builders
but but good like experience to show
people that you you can do those sorts
of things so it's been an incredibly
positive experience for my my job
hunting what advice would you have to
somebody who is interested in data
science and in or data visualization and
would similarly like to raise awareness
of their skills and have an artifact
they can point back to you to say like
hey I know my stuff look at what I've
done I think the biggest thing for me
has been doing personal projects so I
had been working on a lot of online
classes and things like that and there's
a lot of projects that they have you do
for those classes so that you get used
to working with your skills but for me I
needed to know that I could like find a
topic that I was personally interested
in and do an entire project from start
to finish which I know for some like
online courses is like a capstone
project but I just started doing them on
my own and so I would like find a data
set and analyze it and make
visualizations and that has been so
helpful for me because it helps me
realize like where I have gaps in my
knowledge and where I need to fill it in
and it's also unique so if you're
completing a class with you know these
online classes have thousands of people
all taking the same class and every
single one of them has the same project
that they they come out with you know
they can all apply
for the same job and point to the same
project which is good for employers but
you know if you really want to make
yourself stand out I think these
personal projects at least for me have
been really pivotal to that and having
something unique and different to point
to you said that you took a lot of
online courses what specifically did you
find helpful
you know I've I've gone through quite a
few for working with are a lot of the
classes I've been taking have been on a
website called data camp and the reason
that has been sort of pulling me is
because it's an incredibly interactive
medium there's a lot a lot of classes
that you can take out there and some of
them are like lecture based and and
others are project based and for me I do
really well when somebody says like
here's one little idea try it and make
sure you do it correctly before you know
moving on and and you get really far
down this rabbit hole so for me those
sorts of really interactive courses have
been really really helpful and then
honestly the rest of it I fill in as I
go if I'm working on a project like this
one and I realized part of the way down
the road that in order to continue I
need to know a certain skill I kind of
go backwards and find the class that I
need to teach me that skill so it kind
of goes back and forth between classes
that I specifically sought out before
starting something and ones that I kind
of reactively took once I realized I
needed to know how to do something and
one person you go ahead and get their
name here named Shackleford is asking
whether you've had any trouble did you
do you studying math intensively as an
undergrad and grad school other bit have
you had to go back and learn any math so
my undergraduate degree I have a
bachelors of science which for my school
required that we take two levels of
calculus and statistics
so I already had a background and I
guess calculus and statistics and I did
take a course in graduate school that
was kind of a general statistics class
it was called research methods but it
was focused on how to use R and
basically how to do statistical analysis
within R so I have a decent background
in math I've read a lot of people
suggesting that you learn linear algebra
which is actually something I don't have
a background in and it's it's on my list
of things to learn but I have not run
into an issue yet with like that lack of
knowledge that is not to say that I
won't run into an issue with that but
that's that's kind of the only one that
I'm lacking at this point I think and
your Twitter account says that you
co-founded an organization called unbox
sigh like yep what's that all about what
do you all do it there so that actually
started when I was in grad school you
know you as a graduate science student
you work on a thesis and then when
you're done you write it in a paper that
gets like published and hopefully a
scientific journal and and like stored
away somewhere and my project was
looking at the way that baby seals were
growing and developing when they were in
a rehabilitation center so you know
they're growing up in these small pools
and and all of these things and so the
information that came out of my project
was really applicable to people working
in rehabilitation centers who don't
really read a lot of scientific journals
because why why would they so I really
wanted to make my research really easily
accessible for people who would benefit
from it so I started going down this
road of trying to figure out ways to
communicate kind of complex scientific
topics and I started working with an
animator and realized that making short
animated movies that were like a minute
to two minutes long was a really great
way to communicate something that was
complex so we worked on one for my
my graduate thesis and I got this
insanely huge feedback from other
scientists who either wanted to make
something similar for their own work or
wanted somebody to make it for them so
we sort of co-founded this this service
that we call unbox science and we helped
people take their really complex work
and either turn it into you know short
videos or infographics or things like
that to make it make it easier for
people to understand because it you know
science just gets locked away in these
journals and they're covered in jargon
and they're really difficult to
understand unless you're in that very
specific field so so yeah so I work with
that as well and that's that's fun it
helps with my communication skills I can
imagine for sure oh if if our four
audience wanted to go and check out some
of those videos are they publicly
available yeah um you can find them on
YouTube I think where youtube.com slash
unbox Sai s CI and we also have a
website it's unbox science awesome
well I'll include those in the show
notes okay thanks yeah and if anybody
has feedback we that that project has
kind of been on the back burner a little
bit as I'm like career transitioning but
if anybody watching knows of anybody who
would like some help in that area
definitely let us know awesome
and just to close out we have a lot of
aspiring data scientists and data
visualization practitioners in our
audience and I think a lot of them would
be looking for maybe just a few quick
words of advice maybe some lessons
learned along the way it might be able
to save people a little bit of time in
their journey um I think like I said
personal projects are so so helpful like
don't shy away from doing personal
projects if you are gonna do them try to
find something that you find personally
interesting because if you find a
dataset and you're like oh I'm going to
do a project on this but you find it
really boring you're not gonna finish it
or at least it won't be
as exciting for you when it's done so
try to find something that at least like
you get excited about working on I think
another thing that's been helpful for me
has been talking with other people so
getting feedback has been insanely
helpful so if you are an aspiring do the
scientists or data visualization person
and want some feedback you can always
contact me and I'd be happy to chat with
you about it even though I'm still
learning too but I think that's been
really helpful and reaching out to the
community for for help I when I really
hit a wall I go to things like Stack
Overflow and ask you know the experts
for some help but trying to work through
problems for a while before getting to
that point is really really good as well
so I think I think that would be my
advice just keep pushing forward try to
do stuff that you like and and don't be
afraid to ask other people for feedback
or for help never thank you so much for
joining us and for your sage advice all
too many people even people who are just
learning the program and our building
program related projects certainly for
data science as well just to
recapitulate what she said keep going
ask questions build things you're
personally interested in so you can have
the staying power to finish them out
thank you again so much for joining us
I've included your Twitter handle the
notes below everybody follow amber
really interesting and we're all very
excited to see what you what you build
next well thanks for having me this is
exciting and yeah let me know if you
guys have any questions or comments
thank you everyone for tuning in have a
beautiful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
