hey as ago Quincy so how C was kind of
enough to join us and share some of his
insights on getting a developer job
negotiating your salary and a new
program called earning to give which
he'll tell us all about welcome hey
thanks for having me thanks for having
so as Eve has a really interesting
history a couple years ago he started
transitioning into working as a software
developer and the way he did that was he
went through App Academy which is a
coding bootcamp in San Francisco then he
went on to teach App Academy's
algorithms class for about a year and
then he started his job search I see
tell us a little bit about that job
searching and what what that process was
like yeah absolutely so um so haha okay
let me tell the story my job search so
when I started so I was still working at
apik a debate as so I was technically
role was technically director of product
but it basically I did a little bit of
everything so I wrote a bit of software
I taught and I also worked on business
II stuff but basically I had a really
weird profile so I was a career switcher
as I guess a lot of people in your
audience are and I kind of thought
because I had a number of buddies who
were also instructors at App Academy who
had really easy job searches you know
like they had people contacting them
things seemed to go really smoothly for
them so I just assumed that everything
was going to go well because I felt
pretty confident my abilities like I've
been studying this stuff for a while and
so I you know thought I'd have some good
sailing so the first thing I did is I
started applying to a bunch of companies
you know so like 30 40 applications that
I sent out and a lot of the applications
that I sent out were to companies that
I'd actually talked to like I knew
people there and like had you know there
was some connection that had already
nurtured and every single application I
sent out got rejected like my resume
went straight into the trashcan
and I was a little bit uh taken aback
because I thought that like with you
know I don't know the pedigree that I
had that like I was technically even
already writing software it felt like
even though I had this really weird
looking resume uh at least someone
should give me a chance but I wasn't
getting any bites anywhere uh and so I
kind of had the idea that like okay
maybe I'm trying too hard to get into
the front door
maybe there's another maybe there's
another way in and so I had the idea of
starting to basically leverage my
network more aggressively so one thing I
did is I has you know I had a lot of
students who'd gone through the bootcamp
and I had a lot of peers who had also
gone to the boot camp and I started
reaching out to them and thinking that
maybe if they could vouch for me if I
had people in my network who I knew even
if you know it was not you know the
super super strong connection just then
being able to say like hey this guy is
legit you should go talk to this guy
maybe that would get me in the door so I
started doing that and through that I
eventually got uh ever I got my first
interview at 23andme which is if you're
not familiar it's like a it's like a
genetic testing something I don't know
company that sends you like a genetic
test that tells you whether you should
likely get Alzheimer's or whatever right
sequence your genome or okay because
would you know when they tell you about
specific pairs yeah yeah yeah anyway I
don't college which other company
so anyway so I do the phone screen I do
the interview and I totally nail it like
I remember when I went into the on site
like I was super nervous was my first
interview uh and I just like every
single problem like I finished with
extra time I got the optimal solution
like ball my interviewers were like wow
that's that was really fast people don't
finish this fast and we just sat down
and like talked protection by the time
so I remember you know I was walking
back from from the the part station in
Mountain View just being like oh man I I
destroyed that like that was awesome not
sorry Cal train station
I just feeling like just total
confidence and then the next week I got
an email saying that they they'd already
show the position and they didn't want
to work with me and so that
really mess with me and started really
kind of cracking a lot of my a lot of my
confidence that this thing was going to
go well and that I was really being
given a fair shot and so it turns out
you know several I had even despite all
this like despite all these things that
were really discouraging and kind of
frustrating uh I'd still put a lot of
irons in the fire and I was still really
aggressively applying to companies and
talking to people and networking and you
know expanding my network and then you
know pretty soon a few uh companies that
I've been talking to finally converted
into offers so I ended up getting an
offer from Yelp then I got an offer soon
from gussto then I got an offer soon
from triple bite the the company it they
also connected me the companies but they
also have given me an offer
and pretty soon after having these three
offers everything to kind of changed and
so I got an on site from Google and
they're passing the Google on site and
getting an offer from them
once I had a Google offer all the
floodgates completely open so all these
companies that I was talking to that
were like you know somehow I was stuck
in their pipeline suddenly their
pipeline just you know I don't know it's
like pouring grease into their pipeline
and I just kind of flew right through I
end up getting an offer from stripe I
got an offer from uber I got an offer
from twitch and then finally kind of in
the eleventh hour I ended up getting an
offer from Airbnb which was one of my
favorite companies and one of the
companies was really excited about and
basically long story short so I wrote a
blog post about all this we're trying to
you know becoming very popular so if
you're curious you can go read that blog
question which we did a lot more detail
here the story but essentially I decided
to join Airbnb and about ten months ago
I started working there and that's
that's where I am now so that's the
fairly abridged story of what happened
to my job search right and in that
article I'm going to I know you did a
significant amount of negotiating and
playing companies against one another
playing offers against one another to
get a good starting salary yeah yeah so
yes that is one of the things I ended up
writing a lot about it was surprising to
me a little bit just how much
overwhelming attention that grad
relative to everything else in the
blogpost Glidden and really think about
it that much until I realize how much
people never talk about negotiation you
know it's kind of one of those things
that people people either they had to
think it's some skill that people either
have or don't have
and then it's in some way I don't know
like a black black art it's like I'm
learning or it's like somehow taboo to
really talk about and so I ended up
writing a number of articles about
negotiation for precisely this reason is
that it seems something that it just
looks so nebulous to people to really
understand how to negotiate so uh yeah I
can talk more about negotiation if you
like yeah well so you talked about the
role of getting multiple offers and I'm
like once you got the Google offer you
said that basically opened the floodgate
yeah you were able to use Google's
sizable offer as leverage to be able to
get a higher starting salary and
compensation package from Airbnb right
talk a little bit about the process and
what was going through your mind when
you went through that yeah yeah so
negotiation negotiation is tricky
because on the one hand every
negotiation is about like you mentioned
it's about having leverage and having
better alternatives right if you have no
alternative meaning you only have one
offer or you're not working or basically
like if if nothing goes well in
negotiation you have to take the offer
anyway right if that's your situation
then you don't have much leverage in the
negotiation because if the company is
aware of that which they're usually
going to be uh they have really no
incentive to kind of give you more than
than what they initially gave you right
because they know whatever they give you
a probably end up taking so the best
thing you can do for yourself is really
seriously represents the company hey I'm
a better alternative so if you're if
this deal that I'm negotiating with you
doesn't work out I'm totally cool I'm
going to go take some other deal like I
have other options and if a company
understands that then they're much more
likely to negotiate aggressively for you
and of course you know being wanted by
other people signals that you're a
really desirable quantity that you're
really good that you're you know good at
attracting attention which probably
means that you're desirable to work with
but the other thing too is that like a
negotiation is also at the same time all
about relationship right it's like when
you're negotiating with somebody I think
there's one of the reason why people are
really nervous about negotiation and it
kind of strikes them is being something
really uncomfortable I think that's in
some heart for the right reason because
people know that they're gonna have this
relationship with their employer for a
long time after the negotiation is done
right and so you don't want to seem like
a jerk in your negotiation you don't
want to seem really greedy or aggressive
but at the same time I think a lot of
people assume that negotiating at all
makes you seem greedy or aggressive
which is not true it's possible to seem
greedy or aggressive in a negotiation
and I think if you are kind of like
ruthlessly just being like hey I Google
gave me this much so you should give me
this much right that's that's a really
good way to kind of seem a little bit
you know kind of money hung money hungry
and not caring very much about the
relationship but so long as you pay
homage to the relationship that you're
gonna have with your employer uh and you
kind of signal very clearly why you care
about what you care about right
everybody cares about money we all know
like you know you don't have to pretend
that you're a saint and that you're you
only care about the mission and that you
just love coding right I mean maybe you
do I do
you know fine but you also need to pay
your bills you also need a you know
invest in yourself so it's totally okay
to be like hey you know I love to come
work for a company XYZ I think you guys
do really awesome stuff but you know I
have another really competitive offer
and it's tough for me to make the
finances work unless you can unless you
can make me a stronger offer you know so
let me know what you can do I'd be
really excited to come work for you guys
but you know it has to make financial
sense right right that kind of way of
framing it such as it's not like hey
give me more money
Google's better you know come on you I
you know because I have this offer from
Google therefore you should give me X
that's not the way negotiation works
like you always want to convey both
respect and excitement for the company
that you're talking to even if you don't
think it's going to work out like I
think being mindful of that relationship
is probably one of the most effective
ways that you can one get you know have
a negotiate effectively but also kind of
lower the stakes for the negotiation
like not make it seem so adversarial
not make it seem so intense or scary or
kind of like I don't know bullying ish I
think what a lot of people imagine
negotiation they think it's like this
really aggressive thing and it's not
it's really it's really not aggressive
and if you realize that it's not that
way it's just a lot easier to do so yeah
I encourage people to take that take
that mindset I talk about that a lot in
the blog post yeah and for everybody who
hasn't read it I strongly recommend you
check out the all linked to receives a
blog post about how he got the job at
Airbnb but he also wrote a guide to it's
basically ten rules of offer negotiation
and I've already link to that below if
you want to check that out afterward so
one of the things that I know because
negotiating certainly in the Western
world we're much less accustomed to
negotiating when I travel to China for
example pretty much everything is
negotiated and there's this culture of
negotiation and it's a norm it's totally
reasonable to have a back and forth but
in u.s. you walk into a store you don't
grab a shirt off the rack and walk over
to the cashier and say hey can you give
me a slightly better deal on this most
people don't actually do that actually I
have a lot of friends who come from like
from like East Asia and Southeast Asia
and stuff who are in South Asia who are
very good at negotiating they'll go into
like pretty much anywhere and try to
talk to the manager and negotiate right
and I think that's really good practice
what would you say would be good way for
people to practice getting over that
kind of counterintuitive uh kind of icky
feeling they may have when they're
trying to negotiate in advance of
getting into a high-stakes job offer
negotiation yeah yeah that's a good
question it's tough because negotiation
like there's kind of you know there's no
real uh there's no real substitute for
like an actual negotiation that matters
because when it matters is when a lot of
elements come into play that wouldn't
normally matter but so okay to give to
give I guess a clear answer to things
that I would say that I like even I
person
when I was practicing for my
negotiations so first of all
negotiations are something you can
practice for so it's not like you know
you don't just have to fly blind or like
be like well I guess I'm gonna see how
well I do when I go do this the two
things that I would say one is kind of
map out what you're going to ask for and
how you're going to ask for it right
it's like basically I remember before I
ever talked to Google initially when I
started interviewing with them I spent
11 but I was like up super late one
night because I was super I was very
anxious about about this conversation
was going to have with Google and so
literally what I did is just to kind of
get it on my head is I wrote down
everything I was thinking so basically
every you know counter-argument that I
thought I was going to give every reason
why I thought okay here's why actually
you know you're you're saying that this
is worth this much but this is actually
slightly worth less because this and
this is another consideration of
bah-bah-bah and I kind of mapped all
this stuff out so that I wouldn't freeze
in the moment if you know I just kind of
got my nerves get the best of me so that
is I think one thing that's very helpful
is you just write it down and get it out
of your head so that it's just somewhere
on paper such that when you're on the
phone to somebody you can just look at
this thing and be like oh yeah okay cool
talk about this so just like as well I
don't want to get too bogged down in
details but the second thing I think for
a practicing negotiation is honestly
just roleplay you know like find
somebody who you believe will will you
know be sufficiently tough on you in a
role play and will actually give you
good useful critiques and pretend ask
them to pretend they're Google or ask
them to pretend they're some other
company it can be a little bit tough
Aledo n-- tactually know how
negotiations work but even if they don't
honestly it's still really really
helpful because just the process of
framing your mind and getting yourself
to think about when would I actually say
to a recruiter when I'm trying to ask
for more like when you just hear
yourself talking be like oh I should not
say that you know like just just that
act alone even if the other side of the
phone doesn't actually sound like a good
recruiter uh that's going to get
yourself one acclimated to the process
of asking like just getting the words
out of your throat is in and of itself
useful and will just help you you know
and if you don't have anybody who can
help roleplay with you honestly just
like get a voice recorder and role play
both sides by yourself you know you
that I think would be like significantly
helpful especially given you know a
negotiation you know it sounds very
high-stakes but but really the way to
think about is that there's so much
money on the table that you can make so
easily in such a short amount of time
well it's almost anything else you'll
ever do in your life you know right well
gotten perspective so just to just give
people who are watching who aren't as
familiar with you what the the starting
salary offers were and what you
ultimately went with thanks to your
effort to negotiate yeah well so uh yeah
so I get at not starting salary but
total compensation which is the just
probably more relevant metric Andrea in
in the tech world so that includes the
value of the stock you're getting also
includes a sign on bonus many any other
non-cash or non salary compensation that
you're getting so the total value of the
very first offer that I received was I
believe a hundred twenty something K uh
and the value of the final offer that I
received was roughly 250 K so basically
through a process of negotiation also
getting other offers I ended up
essentially doubling the value of of my
package and just to just to ask like how
many weeks was it between when you
received your first offer and when you
altima accepted every B's uh yeah I
don't remember exactly what a probably
about three or four weeks so within
three or four weeks you can argue that
you made funny man I don't know if you
could argue that or that's of course
your base your base salary will be
higher as well so that's like a
recurring uh every year you're gonna get
basically end up yeah yeah Muller's more
yeah typically that's that's annualized
that's that's a year after year yes okay
yeah exactly and um there had to be some
point in which you realize like okay
this is enough like I don't need to keep
pushing it further I don't need to keep
pursuing how did you make that decision
as to not pursue other offers or not
negotiate the offers you had any
right so so one thing that's naturally
going to constrain you is time frame and
I talked about this quite a bit in the
blog post about how you know you kind of
have to time things effectively and your
job search is naturally going to trend
towards ending when basically like your
your best offers are closing their
windows right like that's fundamentally
where you have to make your decision
and essentially like you know it I mean
I guess it's possible that like after I
got the app from Airbnb I might keep
looking but the one I was pretty sure I
wanted to work at everything like that I
was very confident in that um but the
the other thing is that like as your
offers come to you know all the offers
have experts and if they don't you
should impose one yourself because
expert dates especially when they're
consistent among multiple offers really
make a negotiation a lot more effective
right
if one offers would expire another one
that another one that another one that
another one then it's very very hard for
you to actually negotiate synchronously
with you know a number of companies and
actually get some final decision uh I
have a quick question on technology so
you should expert X expiry date
expiration whatever yeah so the
expiration date is how would you
contrast that with like what you call an
exploding offer yes okay so an exploding
offer this is a you know this is a thing
kind of in some parts of Silicon Valley
now I don't know if it's so common
outside of it but basically it's Moffit
startups and essentially what they'll do
is they'll give you an offer and they'll
give you 24 to 72 hours to make a
decision and basically if you don't make
a decision by the end of 72 hours the
offer is gone it's null and void you
cannot accept the offer anymore so this
is a way that companies will often
basically try to get you to not
negotiate and to put a ton of pressure
on you to basically accept the offer on
the spot or leave it you know so yeah
what would your advice be to somebody
who receives an exploding offer yeah
so my advice somebody who's receiving an
exploding offer and of course this is
with the caveat that you know everything
okay so I guess I should I should say
this because I've received like a few
piece of info but maybe feel a little
bad I should know that anything you do
in the Association carry some risk okay
so there's a possibility that if you you
know don't you know if you if you just
like uh say no to an exploding offer you
might
not at the offer right that's obviously
true but so basically with any floating
offer actually I think about no one's
actually ever told me that hasn't worked
so maybe this maybe this has zero
percent failure rate I'd be surprised if
it does but it's possible basically when
somebody gives you an exploding offer
that is anathema to your ability to
actually negotiate the offer right
because you just have no ability to
actually get anybody else to make a
decision within 24 hours so that's
essentially what it's designed to do
it's designed to constrain your ability
to actually effectively hold a market
right a job search is a market you are
you are going to the market to try to
find the best buyer for your skills for
your labor uh
if someone gives you 24 hours to make a
decision you can't really like that that
sort of screws up the market the market
doesn't work as effectively so your job
in that case is to basically tell them
hey you know I'm really glad with this
process I really like you guys like I
really you know I'm really interesting
to work for your company but there's no
way that I can make a decision in 24
hours like that's just not tenable the
the offer you've just given me given the
fact that you never told me you're gonna
give me an exploding offer now that I
know this offers exploding there's
actually no way I can even consider it
uh this is just off the table like
you've actually unfortunately you've
wasted both of our time don't say that
but basically different impression
they're like you call it an exploding
offer if you get it like should you just
call it what it is um I don't know that
I would call an exploding offer because
that is like it's kind of a it's kind of
a like a like you know sort of an insult
I guess a little bit that's not a good
thing
no puts it in the category that it is
but it's like you know I don't know
maybe it's best not to call a spade a
spade but to just basically say that
like you know because if you call an
exploding offer it's like hey it's bad
that you're doing exploding offers right
like don't do that like don't chide them
for what they're doing just place I feel
like
sorry I this doesn't work for me right
because if it doesn't work for you then
they can just like oh okay well we'll
make an exception because it doesn't
work for you you can kind of let them
say that you know like it's important to
let them it's kind of a thing in
negotiation right like let yourself be
an exception because essentially like
that's what people who negotiate well
are all exceptions you know but you
don't want to say like I know that you
you know I know that you're you give
everybody this offer but give me some
other offer right like don't say that
instead to say like oh this really
doesn't work for me and then it'll be
like oh great we'll make an exception
for you because you're very special and
you have the special case right
in reality it's just that you know how
to negotiate and other people don't so
are are these employers taken aback by
your ability to negotiate in a world
full of pushovers but I don't think
they're taken aback I think they're you
know there are people who are good
negotiating generally the people who are
better negotiating are the people who
historically had more offers had more
options I'd have been more desirable in
the job market those are the people they
tend to assume negotiate because they
just have learned how to because they
always had multiple offers so if you
just start negotiating people will just
assume that you are in that category of
people I get you know they're like oh
okay look at somebody who has a lot of
options we know what that looks like you
know it's not that weird so I would say
that if anything people are going to
respect you more generally if you
negotiate because it's a signal that
you're competent and that you know
you've done this before right and that
could that confidence could be you know
that the halo effect from that perceived
confidence in negotiating could be they
may think you're better at software
engineering as well well okay I wouldn't
I wouldn't necessarily go that far I
think that that is one anxiety that a
lot of people have right so people are
who believe
oh hey but if I negotiate then people
can have these like raised expectations
and then even managers can expect all
this more out of me in blah blah blah
and I wanna make it really clear that
all of that is a fantasy no no that's
true okay negotiating more money in your
offer doesn't mean that people are going
to expect you to do more work doesn't
mean they're gonna expect you to write
more code to ramp up faster you know
that stuff's true
that's all baloney uh like you know I
can tell you at Airbnb or at pretty much
any other company I know nobody gives a
crap how much more you like if you made
another 10k or 15k if you got a sign on
bonus whatever it doesn't matter once
you join the company it's it's a wash
everybody like as long as you're the
same uh you know category of like okay
I'm a junior software engineer senior
software engineer software three
whatever it is that's the category by
which you're gonna be judged within that
you know your managers not going to like
oh this person's getting compensated
more so they'd better you know finish a
pull request one day faster no like
they're not thinking like that like
that's that's absurd so uh regarding
like transfer transparency in
conversation which i think is something
a lot of people are advocating for you
advocate for
Engineers put in their salary out there
and I do I do I know it's tough and you
know certainly there's there are a lot
of cultures that make this very
challenging there's a lot of politics
that goes into it
you know but specifically for myself I
mean so one I think I think just in
general like there are a lot of social
problems that can be enlarged part
ameliorated by us just being more honest
about about money and potentially about
things like inequality that make is very
uncomfortable as Americans and even
things like class that we really really
hate talking about but are really really
there and kind of you know inform a lot
of the dynamics that we see in society
and I think pay transparency is one of
those things that helps it also you know
it exposes discrimination against a lot
of classes of people who traditionally
haven't been as well monetarily
compensated losing minorities including
immigrants including women but even uh
you know on top of that for myself
I earn to give and I also publicly
aren't to give meaning that I talk about
the donations that I make every year and
in order to do that I excellent by proxy
tell people how much I make so let's
step back and this is something that for
those of you who don't know a lot of I
had seen this is one of the most
interesting aspects of Hasib uh and and
that is learning to give and I imagine
many of our viewers have never heard of
this movement could you just give us a
very high-level overview of what earning
to give is and why it's important
totally totally so actually it's funny
because the entire essentially the
entire reason that I got into tech was
because I want to turn to give and I
thought that getting into type would be
the best and fastest way to do that so
learning to give is this very simple
idea it's essentially you know if you
look at all the ways that you can
improve the world you can do a lot of
different things right you could let's
say all you care about is I want to make
the world a better place so you could go
and you could decide ok I'm gonna go
work for a non-profit and maybe that's
the best way to improve the world or you
can decide hey I'm gonna go and you know
I don't know try to try to volunteer on
the weekends or something like that and
maybe that's one way would just be nice
and people around me I don't know stuff
like that right but another way that
people often don't think about
is like hey you know one thing that the
world really needs in there you know one
very direct way to intervene and improve
the world is with with money like money
is what actually funds nonprofits money
is actually what gets volunteers to be
able to you know do good work money is
actually you know if you want to get
more vaccines or if you want to get more
anti malarial bed nets or if you want to
you know do any of the the interventions
that we already know work in the world
to reduce suffering uh they require
money and so if you think about it like
well there are all these careers that
are kind of available to you if you're
kind of hardworking and in the first
world that make a lot of money you know
one of them is software and essentially
the idea by no need to give is like hey
maybe if you wanted to improve the world
as much as possible you could go and
pursue a high income earning career and
then donate as much of that money as you
can to charity kind of in lieu of
directly working for that charity
yourself and when I first heard these
arguments they totally made sense to me
I was like oh yeah that that does make
sense that doesn't possibly to me like
the most good that I could do would be
to go into a high income earning career
that most people can't do like they just
don't have access to it most people in
the world that is and go into those you
know abnormally high income earning to
isn't donate as much money as I can to
charity so that's what I did when I came
into the tech world the first moment I
got a job which was June 2015 last year
I started donating 33% of my pre-tax
income to high-impact charities and I've
been doing that ever since and that's
what I intend to continue doing as I
keep working in the tech industry so
last year year before last in 2015 it
was my first year earning to give and so
I donated I think $21,000 21 to 22
something like that and last year I was
the first full year ready to give and I
donated just upwards of $50,000 and my
hope is to continue doing that so
eventually as I go into I know that at
some point tech entrepreneurships in my
future and probably when I do that I'll
donate you know 33% of whatever company
that I found and yeah this is something
that is just a really fundamental part
of my life but that's that's why I'm
here doing what I'm doing is so that I
can improve the world in some
substantive real way and I think tech is
a great medium through which to do that
Wow so just to just to recap that in
case anybody can catch that has he
donated $50,000 to nonprofits last year
I'm gonna I'm sure a lot of you that
yeah it's amazing uh first of all just
to give you all a quick recap of
learning to give the general idea is
sure you could go work for a non-profit
and work as an executive director at a
non-profit or at some of these larger
nonprofits you could try to rise up in
the ranks that is a challenge to say the
least
nonprofits are historically underfunded
and to some extent underappreciated in
my opinion and a lot of the work they do
is not particularly glamorous it's just
nuts and bolts getting mosquito nets and
distributing them I mean that's how you
combat malaria how do you solve the big
problems of the day well a lot of them
are not big splashy things they're just
things that require a lot of resources
to go out and accomplish so instead of
trying to become a an executive director
of one of these organizations and and
lead that way or instead of volunteering
your time as a physician for example to
go and serve in Doctors Without Borders
you can earn a whole lot more money and
you can focus on earning as much as
possible and then donating as much as
possible to those organizations so you
can you can fund them that way so it's
right an alternate way to help you can
think of it a bit is like you know it's
sort of a modern-day Robin Hood approach
to approach to life you know like that
that's kind of the way that I know that
I imagine myself but I imagine sort of
the the practice of earning to give in
in our society you know it's it's a
pretty it's kind of weird like it
definitely gives you get you know you
get you get a lot of looks from people
who don't really have a category in
their mind for what exactly that is um
but it's it's I don't know it's like
what it's what keeps me motivated and
it's what makes me proud of the work
that I'm doing
if you don't only asking and I think you
published an article which I'll link to
below uh where you talk about
the organizations you support how did
you decide which organizations to
support yeah totally so uh I am the way
that I think about about giving is under
the rubric of effective altruism so
effective altruism if those of you are
not familiar it's like a movement that
came out of Oxford and Cambridge like
five six years ago and essentially it's
a very simple idea basically the idea is
when you think about doing good you know
when you think about altruism most
people kind of turn off their brains
when they hear the word altruism they're
like okay so let's uh you know let's I
don't know let's teach violin to people
in the inner cities or I don't know like
so just something that sounds good and
kind of gives them this warm glow on the
inside right but the way that they think
about business the way they think about
economics the way they think about
almost anything else in their life is
exposed to a lot more scrutiny and rigor
then what should be one of the most
important things which is helping people
right like you should be really really
rigorous about the way that you try to
help people because it really matters
how much people get help how much
suffering gets alleviated and what
doesn't doesn't actually happen so the
whole idea of effective altruism is what
is the most effective way to actually
help people right and not constrained
within a particular category so not
being like okay well I want to do you
know breast cancer stuff so what's the
most effective way to do to alleviate
breast cancer or I want to do you know I
don't know children's health so what's
the best way to leave it children's
health kind of stripping away all of
those categories and just asking the
fundamental question which is really
what we all care about is how do I
reduce suffering because it doesn't like
I don't really care whether it's
suffering from breast cancer or
suffering from you know malnutrition or
suffering from whatever all sufferings
bad I hate all of it and I want to
improve anything that I can right and so
effective altruism essentially says how
can we improve the world most
effectively given you know X amount of
resources and so if you look at some
organizations that do this sort of
analysis giveWell is one of them so I
donated actually quite a bit of money to
the top giveWell charity which is which
is AMF the one we talk about about
anti-malarial bed nets and you know
basically other other parts of the
effective altruism movement which I
think are very effective at galvanizing
people to start thinking more this way
and kind of spreading a lot of these
memes an idea is which I think are very
effective
to get other people to give more and
ultimately have these larger effects on
society that's kind of where I try to
put a lot of my money towards and just
out of curiosity I'm gonna be looking
all this stuff of I'm sure for the cause
one of them like is a base metric like
number of healthy years lived or
something like there there would
obviously be like a bias toward helping
young children and preventing a you know
infant mortality and things like that
Absalom is that factored it I guess
David instead of looking at the
aggregate number of people helped to
look at the a thyroid right healthy
years to be lived
totally totally that's exactly right so
the way that uh specifically the way
they give well which is probably the
most well known and most respected a you
know effect of ultras organization the
way that they analyze interventions is
basically using essentially the same way
that global health is kind of measured
which is this notion of vertical
qualities which say QALY
which stands for quality adjusted life
years which is essentially like
essentially the number of years of life
that you're saving but adjusted for
quality right so like if you have five
years of life but you're going to be
blind that entire time maybe that kind
of sucks a little less and if you had
five years of life you were totally
healthy right if you're a child and
you're avoiding an early death then okay
that's a lot of years of life where
we're adding to your life uh but if
you're you know if you're an old person
you're about to die and maybe okay yes
we could spend a lot of money on you but
you wouldn't actually it that many years
of life relative to a younger person who
has much more potential lives to live
special years to live rather uh if
you're a Buddhist maybe potential lives
so yeah that's that's exactly the way
that essentially these things are
analyzed interesting in have to point
out the obvious it's completely the
opposite of how you know health care in
most countries works where a bulk eighty
percent of your health care consumption
will happen in your last year or two of
life writing is that commonly cited
statistic you think about it you took
the if you flip that and spend eighty
percent of it on the first few years of
life hmm
that could have such a huge impact yeah
of course it's it's politically hard to
do all these oh it's it's politically
and culturally hard I think it's
it's just as much a problem of culture
as it is a problem of our institutions
yeah I don't want to delve too deeply I
know a little bit left field
I don't Healthcare and stuff I read a
lot about it and it's something I care
about um so uh I have linked to your
Twitter account below I strongly
encourage everybody follow Hasib he has
some really insightful tweets and he
writes a lot of articles several of
which he has published in free code
camps open source community medium
publications and we're looking forward
to hearing a lot more insights from you
receive in the near future about getting
a developer job about negotiating wages
and about continuing to learn on the job
all these things that your vocal about
and of course we're always interested to
hear your periodic check-ins on how
things are going with earning to give Oh
totally thanks so much Quincy I really
appreciate your taking the time to chat
with me thank you so much for coming on
and thank you to our live audience for
tuning in have a beautiful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
