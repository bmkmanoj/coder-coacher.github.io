camp nonprofit project my team and I
built for an organization called taught
us taught us is an organization in
Tennessee that provides services and
influences policy related to addiction
and mental health and they came to us
wanting to update their outdated site
which I'm showing here with a new modern
website and they wanted the new site to
include their library of free
publications which is here so it's a
library that contains like over a
thousand different pieces of literature
and posters all related to alcohol drug
addiction etc so they wanted that to be
included in the new site and also their
library of free DVDs which before was
just a PDF so here's our final product
so it includes some basic informational
pages homepage and a sponsor's page
contact page and we built the site with
the apostrophe content management system
so everything is modifiable vice anyone
who has administrator privileges so if I
log in
then I'm able to edit existing content
this or I can also add new content if I
wanted to and I can also add and delete
pages
and this is the new database of their
free publications so it was kind of a
challenge to migrate all of the
publication's from the old database to
the new database mainly because the way
apostrophe structures the data so it can
display it on the page is very specific
so I had to import the data from the
sequel database and then parse out
information from all the documents and
update it so that it would match the way
apostrophe wanted that data structured
and also I had to rename the files so
that apostrophe could find them for each
piece of literature has a PDF download
and those are stored on an Amazon Bucket
this and the publication's that say
request this item are for the ones where
there's a physical copy available for
people to order it's also searchable so
you can search by subject tobacco
so if you click request this item it
adds the item - it's basically a
shopping cart and this was built with
react and if you submit the order it
takes you to an order form and
submitting this order form just sends an
email using the node mailer library so
there's also a DVD library which works
basically the same way it's also
searchable
and that's about it thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
