everyone welcome to our october or
november seventh livestream our dough
over 77 and I am Quincy Larson I'm
thrilled to have you here on our call
today we have Christian who is a camper
Christian could you introduce yourself
real quick yeah i am a christian i have
been in free comp cam for a few months
now and rods I think two months ago
round 1 12 months ago me a Caribbean and
yo and so I just working on a new app
that we're going to introduce this
luxury great and I'm hearing from the
audience that there's still a little bit
of a echo okay cool i can see Mike I can
see Mike's photo sorry about the echo it
looks like if you refresh that will fix
the echo so we can see Mike is anybody
else gonna be visible does anybody else
have a screen that they want to share
brooke Lee do you want to share yours
yeah i'm working on i gotta claim camera
okay cool um so while we're at it Mike
could you introduce yourself yeah yeah
I'm like I'm currently working on a
vagrant actually environment or I guess
development environment for freak okay
cool contributes really hates the same
way and mike is it possible you to turn
your mic up just a little bit virus all
right how's that that sounds better
anecdotally I mean if you can talk a
little bit more I give you idea right
here at work brooke Lee Martinez please
introduce yourself hello everyone my
name is Berkeley Martinez CTO free cold
camp sponsible for the code base and
he open source curriculum in general
awesome thanks for joining us and and
then Christian started to introduce
himself could you just introduce
yourself one more time real quick
Christian yeah so I'm a camper I've like
I started a freak out camp a few months
ago and run two or one months ago me and
one of the camper and one other person
yo and Anna Caroline we started working
all day music app that we're going to
introduce this live shrimp awesome so
that's one of the really exciting things
that we're going to go over today and
then finally many people have wondered
where Nathan Lin is a ka tera kilobyte
has been recently I wanted to welcome
him back is a special guest on this
stream and hopefully he'll become a
regular again in the near future and why
don't you go ahead and tell us a little
bit about yourself Nathan well hello
folks I'm Nathan I enjoy team ups in vim
mixed with some webstorm every now and
then I like coding and building things
and answering general JavaScript
questions I've been extremely busy the
past few months with everything going on
in my real professional life but now
things are slowing down so I can get
back in the code awesome well we're
thrilled to have you welcome back and
welcome everybody so I'm going to just
quickly pop up the agenda which I think
I closed but it's on the wiki let me
just bust that out everything we use is
on the web so it's easily accessible so
I've actually created a page for it
already November so summit here we go
this is what we're doing today so first
I'm going to talk about the medium
publication which is very exciting
Berkeley is going to talk about our
curriculum improvements and some ways
that you can contribute and then matt is
going
demo his new big rent tool basically he
built a vagrant box and it's going to
allow you to rapidly install free code
camp and all its dependencies on your
computer so you can help us dev on it
chris has pointed demo is a
collaborative modern music app that was
built by him and a couple other campers
that he mentioned earlier and then we're
going to take some questions and then if
Wesley's internet is prevailing then
he's going to take over and do a bonfire
solving marathon if it's not we may just
see if anybody from the audience is
interested in jumping in and streaming
because usually there's a big audience
that follows after like a lot of people
continue watching while they code
they'll watch some other people cut to
so without further ado I'm going to dive
right in and talk about our new medium
publication so as you may have heard
medium is this awesome tool created by
the same guy that created blogger and
Twitter and I mean there were obviously
other people involved too but his name's
ed Williams and he is a really really
hardcore person who kept blogger going
on life support before it was acquired
by Google and it's clear that he's
learned a lot about blogging along the
way and he created this new tool called
medium a few years ago and recently they
introduced publications now a
publication essentially allows your
organization which are open source
community I view it is like a big
organization which I'll talk about in a
minute we have a whole lot of campers
and many of them are also skilled
writers and write about coding and about
things that surround coding and their
own personal struggles and triumphs with
coding so if you go to this link which
I'll just go ahead and post in the chat
you can see that we have a variety of
articles written by campers some of them
are quite interesting and stuff that you
probably weren't aware of such as Gil
fear Feaster wrote this excellent piece
about Isaac Newton and his experiments
with light and how he actually literally
jammed a needle into his eye to like
movies I ball around and distort it so
that he could do like a light experiment
and and just how like that kind of
spirit of discovery can be applied
toward coding and then some general kind
of agile tips don't live with broken
windows and then a lot of other
interesting pieces written by campers
technical pieces motivational pieces so
really this is just a great way if you
want to write about coding and write
about your experience learning to code
and anything related to the process
going on in an interviewing for jobs
building an app on your own freelancing
anything like that this is an avenue and
generally these these articles get
hundreds sometimes thousands of views so
it used to be that you wrote your own
blog and you spent all this time trying
to publicize it like you email all your
friends said hey check out my new blog
post or people would subscribe to RSS
that doesn't really happen that much
anymore RSS is definitely a fading
technology but things like medium allow
you to basically write and then publish
to a much larger audience right now free
code camp we just launched this like a
few weeks ago and we already have it
that a thousand followers and certainly
if you have a medium account we
encourage you to click the follow button
as well so you can follow it currently
I'm the editor so if you submit a piece
I'll go through and edit it and
basically we'll go through and kind of
touch it up and make sure it has like
cool visuals like mediums are very easy
to read form
they've spent a lot of time and energy
on typography and just the experience of
writing an article it's much easier to
use than blogger it's probably easier to
use then maybe easier to use than ghosts
and Jeckle on some of these newer
blogging tools as well so the other
thing is if you already have a blog you
can cross post on medium it allows for
you to import and it usually does a
pretty good job of cleaning everything
up after it imports it and you can
publish yourself on medium and then
submit it to free code camp and we'll
basically look at it and we can edit it
into a state where we feel comfortable
publishing it to our entire community
then we'll do so if not the very least
i'll give you some feedback and you can
rework it and resubmit it so yeah that's
that's medium I'm really excited about
it we've got a ton of articles here
already and we're getting a lot more
submissions every day so if you're
submitting pieces like Stephen and
Tiffany and a lot of these other campers
keep it up and if you haven't submitted
one yet but you enjoy writing please do
submit one the other thing I wanted to
talk about very briefly is let's see if
I can pull it up here before we move on
free code camp is an open source
community distributed across many
platforms what that means is free code
camp is essentially we have free code
camp calm which is where our curriculum
resides and our code portfolios reside
but we're also distributed across all
these other existing platforms and one
of the reasons free coke cans been able
to grow so rapidly and and have so much
high quality functionalities we're kind
of standing on the shoulders of giants
so to speak github is a very powerful
application and we make extensive use of
github we're using git er for our chat
to build a chat system as sophisticated
as dinner would take well a team like
getters and a whole
time and money so we're leveraging that
existing tool we have hundreds of chat
rooms on Gator most of which are dormant
but we have a good core of maybe 20
rooms that are highly active camper news
which we built ourselves Nathan who's
joining us today was a huge contributor
to that we have facebook campsites which
is where we have our local groups and
this is actually our local leaders room
so it's kind of like the overarching
Facebook group and and this is actually
our local leaders room so it's kind of
like the overarching facebook group for
people that are organizing their own
Facebook groups so feel free to join
this if you'd like we have about 450
different campsites in different cities
throughout the world and many of them
are meeting regularly to drink coffee
and code together what we call coffee
and code those are picking up and every
week we're having more and more of them
and we one of the most successful post
we have on medium is about coffee and
code and I'm going to paste that in here
real quick
so I'm hearing that some people saying
the string died I don't think the stream
died according on my end it looks like
it's working canals of each brush can
can you all try refreshing it yeah as
soon as you're working fine oh yeah okay
just up so I don't want to like blast
twitch but they have occasionally
outages and stuff that are out of our
control so if the stream like has
something funky happening I'll know on
OBS because i'll have like drop frames
and a warning so it's something on
twitches side I I suspect I don't want
to throw it under the bus here but just
refresh if something weird happens and
it'll nine times out of ten fix the
problem with twitch so I just talked
about how we have medium we have twitch
of course which we use extensively for
live coding we're always looking for
more people to stream on Twitch so if
you're interested in streaming we have a
special chat room on git er which I'll
also post into the chat live live coding
not yeah here it is just clean this up
real quick yeah so if you dump in that
chat room we have people discussing
streaming on twitch and you can you can
stream on twitch as well and finally we
have YouTube where we're publishing all
kinds of instructional content we're
basically building a computer science
curriculum on there we're also going to
build a design curriculum those are
still pretty nascent and I definitely
still recommend using other resources
for computer science and design beyond
freako camp but it's an area that we
aspire to get really good at right now
we're focused almost one hundred percent
on getting like a really awesome coding
curriculum coding is like the practical
skill and computer science is kind of
the theory
so that's it for our greater kind of
cinematic universe of social media and
other platforms that we use at this
point I'd like to hand it over to
berkeley to talk a little bit about our
curriculum berkeley would you like to
share your screen uh sure let me share
my screen yeah i think you have to make
me presenter do that yes you are now
presenter
are you able to show you scream Berkeley
I yeah I'm not there is not showing up
um it doesn't seem to be showing up yet
on my end can you all see Berkeley
screen oh there it goes we can see it
now yeah it's in the tavern okay very
cool so I'm going to talk about the kick
of the curriculum and contributing to
the curriculum and how campers like
yourselves can't help out and help us
fill out the curriculum so we've got a
really cool project going on with saint
peter being the main draw over
essentially we have come to the
conclusion that there's a big cliff
right before bonfires and a lot of
people are dropping off that cliff so we
want to fix that but creating curriculum
is really hard it takes a lot of time
and in the current state it's kind of a
menial task a lot of editing JSON a lot
of waiting a lot of trying and then
repeating so we're trying our hardest
we're developing a lot of tools to make
that process a lot easier on my end I'll
talk about the changes to the actual
code base one of the changes is we're
adding solutions to the actual
challenges themselves in the code base
so that we can test any changes to the
testing suites for those challenges so
most of them already have solutions I
should say most of the bonfires have
solutions we're working on adding
solutions to all the rest of the
challenges if you want to contribute to
that that'd be very helpful right now we
are testing bonfires and some JavaScript
challenges it still needs a little bit
more work to test everything else but
that'll come pretty soon the other thing
I want to talk about is
integration so one thing I've added is
is the ability to see a pull request
passes all our test automatically so if
you go to any of these poor quest here
let's pick this one here for instance
mr. mr. Logan Eggman or l tignan on
github you probably seen him in the
issues you've been doing a lot of good
work for us as a issue moderator
contributing code as well you can see
that he's changed this test here and
you'll see that you get these green
check marks here so if we show
checkmarks it says here travesti i build
pass what this means is his code was
uploaded to travis di and actually i can
share that here Travis CI will clone get
full clone free code camp install all
dependencies and then run all our tests
to see if Logan's code bright anything
and so the moment it's not testing the
whole code base but it is linting all
the challenges it's linting all
JavaScript here you can see the tests
and it tests the challenges that have
solution then that were chromic testing
and this output is looks kind of funky
here but I can do is show you here what
it looks like hi it can can everyone see
my camera I see them here yeah there's a
little bit of a delay it's like a super
low frame rate but I can see the Travis
it's got your eye can see Babel node
seed / test challenge is that's what I
can see is that your current what you're
currently show yeah it's probably good
like so so I'm going to run the test w
just so you can see what the apple looks
like because it looks it looks kind of
weird on Travis because of the way out
place up something present era mine we
won't show that oh yeah
thank you fix it there you go seahawks
now sorry i was just making some changes
selecting everything lynching off the
JSON files and then here is our testing
suite it sees young cat it's pretty cool
I have fun here yeah so those are the
changes there's a lot more changes to
come to make things more exciting to
make curriculum development a little
more exciting another change I think
Quinn see if you can add ben i think i
saw Ben Andy chasse I absolutely Kim's
had been then I'm going to send you the
gotomeeting request real quick i'll just
do that in git er if that's cool with
you those are you watching please don't
jump in or go to meeting you you will
see the stuff to do so please just don't
disrupt our meeting so Ben McMahon think
i have it on my clipboard somewhere i
thought i did try that then he's gonna
work
so Ben McMahon our friend from Dublin
Ireland I will just give him a quick
introduction he is a very precocious
high schooler who has contributed a ton
to our JavaScript curriculum and to our
code base in general so then should be
joining us shortly yeah and he'll be
talking about one other really cool
feature will work on especially Ben Ben
spends main spearhead be behind this
project called the challenge o matic
1000 so hopefully we can get him on soon
yeah keep man just a 30-second delay I
think something like that for whenever
we sister hey Ben's joining yeah awesome
this guy is capable hello hey man how
are we doing folks we're doing oh yeah
everything's better when I'm involved I
taught my craft I've exercised feedback
well welcome in are you ready to share
your screen and give us the beauty that
is the challenge o matic what you built
a bit so far sure let me just start up
web stop but updated today having looks
very nice house awesome berkeley can you
pass presenter ship to been in go to
meetings done perfect and while we're
doing all that i'm going to op a couple
users I'm sorry I totally forgot we want
to make some people mods so I'm at jeffs
torbeck you're now a mod um I think
recode existence I see you all the time
here let's see don't take offense we
found that bonding the st. Peter should
definitely be a mod if he isn't already
code no profit you're a mod now thanks
that's a Michael Johnson he normally
he's almost always on the stream he this
time he was like well I don't have
anything in particular let's let's focus
on other things so he's a hanging out
taking questions and asking questions in
the
okay room today instead of being on the
screen I'll be sick you're a mod now I
think I think that's everybody damik hit
a great great a funny medium post their
den and yeah I think I've wanted most
people that need to be modded so let's
turn back to spend here if it they're
working we can see your screen now yes
we can see your ridiculously large
resolution so keep in mind that um
gotomeeting like scales everything down
significantly so it's like we're looking
down from an airplane at your screen
okay i was even once I open my coaching
great just window by the way everyone
who's tuning in we're almost certainly
gonna go over um due to mostly to me
just having to sort out those sound
flower issues and get the audio working
properly so just uh please note that in
advance we're saving the best stuff for
last Mike and Christian are going to be
demoing some some pretty awesome stuff
so you'll definitely want to stick
around just don't expect like if you've
got something and you need to run also
we're we're kicking all this over to
youtube as soon as we're done screaming
so you can always catch it later then
but we won't run to too far over we
budgeted for an hour we will probably be
about an hour 20 minutes I've been take
it away and make it bigger mega tow
office just called oh oh I remember 60
to 80 GS fantastic so here is the
opening screen cover the worst opening
screens I've ever seen their life for
what is technically an enterprise-class
to electric car and so when it opens up
I have no idea what it's like she go it
might be like your desktop from windows
or your home directory if your Mac Linux
present so you'll go through that you'll
adjust it is
free coke campaign stuff you're going to
seed your gift is Jason I hear what you
want that's cool but mostly challenges
and let's pics advanced bunch right
because the first one I life is too
short and you link it to this screen
this screen is where all the magic
happens Kings you will know to start on
a new challenge second one second Quincy
can you zoom into Ben's screen on
gotomeeting oh it doesn't seem to give
me that functionality unfortunately okay
sorry guys wait I can do this this is as
big as Raticate it's a little bit bigger
okay sorry to interrupt the club and
okay unless you can get a better thing
set up adobe after we don't talk to save
counts how to go to anyway that's right
on top what you actually do is the
moment this is purely for adding
challenges you can't really make stuff
yet but that's common hope this weekend
what we've done is if we look at the
actress see for this file yum yum you
know which bill do this alone approached
again a flash oh this is ting hello open
free coke a new window and let us take a
look at this so what you're getting is
you're getting the name you're going to
be ID which is it disappears girl and we
aren't giving the order we are given
time you're getting the challenge seed
the test what the hell let's saloon
description yeah this is where we were
this blog description so below that the
nested object is the actual challenge
okay okay so you're getting your ideas
on what a hell ID which ideas I
subscription your tests and the
challenge did I saw this with you I like
that and MDM likes him and solutions are
here all this kind of stuff in here so
you're only getting stuff actually
need to and in Stoke and he does don't
think indeed and you only get what you
need this will actually be taken out for
it to just be like today is like an
editable fields because really you don't
need to change the seeds and they'll
just be like when you crane your chance
general angle ID so it'll be handled and
the title fair description there and you
you get most eco highlighting I think
this is still going in JavaScript so
this makes this a text and HTML who bit
the code so JavaScript looks nice I
might change HTML to make it like the
old attacking so for you um you'll
notice for anyone's ever done tests
before there's no escaping strings it's
all done which is just like 20 hours off
your day forever try to make challenges
but that alone is an improvement your
challenge seed which is what you'll get
if we go to you should be sliced male I
hope or take 20 minutes who knows go to
map will go to so you can pop it enough
to do valle de yeah you'll notice
eventually that this correspond exactly
what you ever hear and and then you have
the type which is this is more reviews
95 stuffy for making challenges will be
waypoints and the challenge type will
either be no your bonfire earlier your
pic juanitas execute the HTML waypoints
the GLA points and so what this will
allow you to do is it saves you at this
current station by 10 20 minutes are
such enormous men doing the end go is
that it'll be like a one-stop shop we
don't have even well you will have
broken free coke embassy they look good
you can make a whole challenge you can
make sure the tests are good now kind of
stuff would either of me free coal camp
and doing if you're familiar with the
development process is that Mongo
filming work but all the challenges to
ever need to be put in there and do npm
install bear instyle golden star Eric
Cooper on go from this other hundred
things so
via Tennessee just to do this is the
last innovation and debilitated is to
save you a lot of time hope that is the
end go and when you've totally make your
changes so let's add a word like quirky
I think my brother this last day and I
fixed it but you know we're gonna do one
of their life is your hands this could
look terrible who didn't have all right
um so what we should see is it didn't
change cool I need to make a lorry to me
and what it is in export the Jake's
aren't as important but with the changes
you've made I'm gonna watch it worth
their be doing it on purpose make me
look bad this is the first move and nip
never do it life I should pre / petr
korda next time when it works like yeah
just near the video playing america-
every day um but she had that's just
that's a better starting as a guess I am
we have I'm very proud of this there's
multi file mode we can open up you know
your advanced and you can open up your
angular and you can have you can do both
are you hit export export all of them
that works really well and I think about
accidentally open ass it's gonna be
great I'm that is it for now I'm way
what a mistake did you do okay okay
we're back so is this their search box
test new challenges there is a solution
in the seed and I'm having trouble
getting the editing the solutions to
work because it's taking off from the
width of his exporting it and she all 64
again and show you what it does it
actually pasts new lines which really
just wrecked my head and Boop EEE ooh I
got srl you sleep not have a chaos I
mean apparently
okay then ramesh kishore ever push their
isolation fields in most stuff all the
time you have other considerations all
right reload choose file event explore
here we go so angular challenges don't
have any clip external but internal
challenges do so you'll see here it's
doing is zooming when your clams and
there's my place today's your solutions
array that's remix line fix that but if
you see it's breaking the string so that
is the penalty genius let's fix that and
you'll be officially patterning fan club
if you can serve today and if you can't
no worries but the whole idea behind it
that will improve the workflow and
hopefully make it to let any old
pressing common law and create
challenges for the site obviously have
to get them submitted that kind of stuff
but yeah if it's got it good and to
reiterate work berkeley we're saying a
moment ago our goal is to make it really
easy to submit challenges because we
want our way points to grow
significantly because javascript is very
complicated i think it's way beyond the
scope of what we teach i think it's way
beyond the scope of what anybody teaches
we really want to have a truly
comprehensive kind of almost
encyclopedic assortment of waypoints
that that walk you through javascript
not just like showing you how to do
stuff but like taking through iterations
and really getting you a lot of practice
with javascript concepts so that you'll
be able to just fly through the bonfires
and then be confident when you go into
the zip lines of the base jones thank
you very much man no ways would you make
mike the presenter please plan Matt
musical presenters musical chairs make
presenter then presented an appt request
cool and I don't use to gotomeeting
installs but if I ask you to do it's an
extension now I have to
CF actually if Septimus Knockaround not
going to take a look at that and cuz
figure edge area doing screen chang with
an extension Jim second JavaScript yeah
so very quickly on this subject of
making it easier to contribute one key
thing that you really need to do in
order to be able to effectively
contribute to free code camps open
source project is to get free code camp
established locally on your on your
computer and and Mike's going to talk a
little about that take it away Mike it
would help if I was Anita there we go I
forgot to be myself okay uh okay um so
I'm currently working on any project and
is utilizing a tool called vagrant and
the big ern is basically a rapper that
goes around virtual machine tools so
like virtual box on VMware and basically
that virtual machine or that vagrant
tool and spin up a machine for you and
put everything that you need inside of
it so that you can just hop into the
Machine and start developing and it's
pretty nifty um ideally it's gonna look
like magic but currently there's a
little bit of mine would take to time
but there are a few steps to take
anyways um I'm not sure how large I need
to make my opponents that everyone can
see it your buddy what actually my
comfy okay son that consoles pretty good
hump like the other side with the group
okay so i was trying to run this while
everyone else is talking cuz it takes
quite some time I wouldn't do that well
I think cuz i have this stream open and
gotomeeting my event but anyway so
i'll just talk up on it so this screen
on the right which no one should be able
to see so we make it a little bit grim
is basically the free coke and website
or github repository so basically we hop
on here it's basically the frico camp to
have all the substance here is this nice
little bit at the bottom
where they talk about getting started
and essentially when you're getting
started with development on the
repository you have to you know pull in
the repo and then do some things to make
the repository work appropriately but
you need to be doing this inside of a
development machine and there's fair
amount of people I would suppose that
have trouble setting up a developer
machine and construe that it was working
not necessarily developing locally so I
mean one thing to say that this
prerequisites for this project I
remember to be an obvious but to have
those book resolve an intra sheen isn't
really a development environment it just
means that you have those tools on your
machine so the idea is we want to really
give ourselves an environment to work in
point of the posture that I'm creating
and so essentially it all and install
these tools for you and a few many more
and get you started and really try to
have time so that this npm install
finches but we can talk about what the
project actually does um should i use
this vagrant and a little bit of a tool
at quincy search just bought in guys put
em it's a hashtag the relevant to go to
town the last this is thuy hashtag big
campfire i think what's not you only
take any questions mash egg mine yeah
just ask your questions right here on
free coke can't let me just go and
modify i can turn it off if you want
anyway sorry that's just sure um and let
me just edit the title real quick to our
november summit let's throw an
exclamation point in there can't have
too many of those right okay thanks
correctly okay so the question again
from this littles bandwidth as possible
um so basically vagrant is like i said a
rapper it has lots of cool features just
like a getting started guide the
documentation it's pretty it's pretty
good for just getting started it starts
to lack when you get
to like the intermediate / advanced
areas and need to like really do some
interesting things with them it's really
terrible but for like someone who's
super new and just wants to like learn
how to use vagrant it's the degradation
is amazing now you just literally just
go through one by one you'll figure
everything out it's pretty great
basically what happens is you spin up
and I'll show you what agent Robinson p
spent of a machine in this case we
happen to be using smaller size and I
want there we go large tennis but that
should be igniter onesie and we're using
my trusty 64 which is the 1404 version
of ubuntu which is a long-term support
version which means that it'll never go
anywhere and it will be forever and the
virtual machine by default has two gigs
of ram so it'll be a section that read
me for my repo that basically says how
to edit some small things so for
instance if you're using like a budget
macbook air than Lance I Katie cobram
something you can tone this down so that
doesn't utilize too much same with the
CPU cap this thing's just gets the
virtual machine can I use as much
resources as it chooses to on this
particular instance so I have a lot all
right I'll I get to use items and I'm
going just kind nice scale this physics
so I can see I'm good um so basically we
have to do is a hop over to the three
cocaine to them and on their page slope
you'll see a list of repositories that
everybody's working on and much stuff
that gone or lovely cocaine and the one
you're looking for it just happens to be
the third one from the top which is kind
of lettering so if you click on that and
it'll bring you to this repo which
currently is a little out of date
because I have been published the
changes i'm encouraged me to it yeah
that's fine
and basically what's going to happen is
you'll clone this repository with a jit
clumsily and and then you'll run two
commands in the console essentially and
and everything will work really well so
what I can shoot is the commands in
action and i'll just show you on a
really simple this is beautiful so
basically the screen that you're looking
at this is just a simple favorite
machine that i used for development they
tie all my projects into it it's really
simplistic there's nothing super huge
about it but essentially I have bigger
it installed Oh a spell version really
feel like I do this yes yeah this I'm of
trouble come to come on focus on class
jolly like week good yeah so I have a
vagrant insults and basically if you run
the command bacon status it'll tell you
what's going on in this current
directory if there is even vagrant in
this current directory and then this
decides to finish something I've noticed
this is like complete aside in a
developer note that I just noted in my
head the vagrant commands don't run
dates aggressive a like tie up processes
really well which is not necessarily
there anyways this mega machine is not
currently we drive but it's harder to
run a command you can bigger it up and
it'll spin up this box in and do some
really really interesting things and
however I'm gonna cancel I'm not let it
do it because it's going to heat up
processing power that's being taken by
the other bigger machine currently um
and basically what happens is when this
index
basically what happens is it'll spin up
a box and you ssh into that virtual
machine using the command bacon ssh go
figure and it'll bring you into the
command line for the machine and you can
exceed you into the directory that you
need and basically end goal you get
something like this so you'll have this
project open so you don't know how to
make the holders on the side bigger so
hopefully everyone's used some sort of
editor or ide that has the tree view of
the project you're working on and so in
my tree view here this is basically just
the repository for FCC's vagrant you'll
note that there's also this free code
camp directory that's here so basically
what happens is when you run a vagrant
up it'll do all the nifty provisioning
things which are listed off over here
for you and and essentially when those
interesting things happen you'll be able
to figure it into their SSH into the
vagrant machine and do something like
the environment variable in the bower
install well that's kind of a
complicated scenario and it's just
easier if we can just work in our own
editor right so the idea is that it
symlinks the folder in your project
directory to the project folder inside
the virtual machine so this folder here
is actually residing inside my virtual
machine currently and so like this node
directory no more trees actually getting
updated right now because that's what's
happening on the screen but I'll notice
I have this like nifty environment
variable that they talk about in the
free cooking directories um we have to
set up our and variable so instead of
having to do all this stuff it's kind of
just here for you so you can put in your
manual user name password do your
session secret stuff if you need it if
you choose to use the Facebook
integration or jumper trauma or Google
or Twitter you can add things to it
otherwise it's pretty much set up as is
and basically what this does is allow
you to run the Gulf command instead of
the virtual machine and then you have a
working copy of freako camp instead of
regime
and I really would like to demonstrate
that but as I mentioned before the NPM
install command is really bad it is
really unreliable and so right now it's
just hugging thing with them and taking
a long time to build things hashtag
never works like oh yeah I it was really
struggling it built like three times
before it got to me and then I was
making changes and I was like okay I'll
just built this last time I'll be ready
to go and then that last time took
forever there's a flag recognized at
that it's like China cake sandwich
parekh champion takes but it slows down
enough uh yeah he told me when it's
actually in the project it's um set her
and Kim configset jobs space one good
one job at a time yeah so it's currently
that's the flag that's set in the
provisioner because I was having a lot
of issues where when you try and RAM the
MPN commands the provisioner didn't like
how many things are happening at once
and depending on what kind of system
resources you have the system would like
chug as NP i'm trying to do everything
inside the virtual machine and
originally I had my virtual machine only
allowed to use fifty percent of my cpu
usage so it would like cap out at fifty
percent and just utilize that trying to
install everything and then just bought
mike and then things started to fail cuz
it didn't have enough cpu readers so end
up at a hundred percent in this
particular case but doing that job space
one thing that's really helpful so Mike
yeah if this were a like hypothetically
NPM were to finish installing is that
like one of the last steps before we
what would you do after that okay so
after you ran or ideally the provisioner
will do the NP i'm running except for
you but currently i have it a little bit
separate so that you can do it yourself
so it's basically run the npm step into
the list of steps is here so the puppet
/ visionary will run up until about here
um and then everything below that that's
a lie
here and then everything below that is
something that you're gonna have to jump
into the console do which is pretty
simple so you basically jump in you run
the NPM install command so you're on the
NPM install command which is currently
the Corinne that's running now and then
you would installed globally so that you
can utilize it and even stop Bauer
globally so that you can utilize it
because power installs some defenses
with the character pieces then you'd run
the bower install command which is
really simple asleep also super speedy
than happens with maclee and then you
would if you haven't already deal with
your environment variable and so that
was the theme in sure if you have left
here which is you know the mandrel and
all in fun stuff and then once that's
finished you just run the sea in command
um which is really super simple it's
listed on the free cooking repository
which is here so you ran on MP on run
per stem and then it's the virion
environment or those islands okay thanks
it's finish up the free cocaine
repository percent so let's leave it to
see the database and set everything up
for you and then you run Gulf and the
projects running and then if you were to
visit so this isn't gonna work right now
but if you were to visit I think it's
when I have it set to double check that
information interesting yes I know
people who want to do this but you still
be careful of what you have on your
machine and I was like a web summit on
terrorists a felling the talk of mm
performance phantoms and what it was
that he were hyper I they were to
machine valid which is effectively p.m.
is your machine the hypervisor and then
to be answered on topper hypervisors
just what like to DM talk to the machine
anyway doesn't know and what he was
saying that people were seeing blocks on
one of the apps because the other app
was doing through my garbage collection
I'm blocking everything everything
sitting there waiting for the i/o to
conclude up
to actually top tips put a plaque
computer he's firefox not chrome you
doing development and i still like
perfect for a chrome believe the low
sources and if you are going to use any
browser less windows is more and close
anything you don't need a victory yeah
because as you can see there's a lot of
she bless you she's going on right now
yeah I chrome beats of all I have right
um sorry miss you be able to go after
yeah after you run the golf committee be
able to do a dead battery good and bad f
dash V cocaine going three that's the
port I think I don't know if you're not
a you Steve Hansen to be honest and and
then ah I don't think any of the what's
on the local machine industry Lance
anyways you'd go to this and just clear
that mortar now in a bring into a
version of Rico camp that's residing on
your local machine dodge so that's as
basically as far as you'd have to go and
then start contributing so strengthens
me find a typo on some page you'd be
able to go that Beach inside your tree
directory and by the typos and edit it
and never actually contributed to the
freakin games i'm not actually sure
berkeley will know this probably where
is if I wanted to change for instance
the world holds question okay so say I
wanted to add a picture of myself to
this page for the out rich where would I
find this index file superview server
resources on so reviews resources home
services oh look it's called are you
talking about the enemy page Asia yeah I
mean I would on the second word is
exactly oh I'm that Jay Penick isn't
matter is home budget yeah so then I
could jump inside the Jade file so I
could jump in and not do some
modifications here and then the
modifications that I do here will show
up on my version of free cookie box
right and if I was satisfied that i
could crimp or questions my version of
free cooking it once you do anymore if I
found a typo for instance perhaps spill
wrong and I need to fix that I can jump
in and find where the word notice on
this page and say like this stinking
smell with no do you really want that to
be yes just kidding but if you wanted to
change that that meeting be such a thing
check in a Glee iOS lowercase uh yeah
and it's also not really a thing anymore
then yea truly useless Reddick's yeah
yeah and then you'd be able to submit so
the workflow is actually speaking with
Berkeley about this generally on the eco
camps say there's around the repo is a
folder called contributing and and so
the idea is to fork the free coke and
repository to your own personal checking
account and then work on your stuff
there and then create a pull request
with the feature that you are starting
to create a push your changes to a
branch of your fork which is called
feature or something a feature request
sir I grabbing your grandma your tears
with better graphics Oh is there a
grammatical error there another's not
that I hope this ain't good yeah and
then you could once you've done that
then you would create a pull request to
bring everything from your fork for your
branch of a fork into the free coke am
when I say that i'll add that sounds
really complicated that's really not
essentially your forking the repo which
is
super simple it's a button on here at
the top music let's see it oh it's up
here so you just leave a click fork and
then you create a when you create a fork
ecosphere to tell paige and i should
i'll just do right now in our then you
get a screen like this senator says
forking the frequent camp copy and paste
everything which is pretty fantastic so
this is my github account notably at the
top but I now have a version of fruit Co
camp I would create a new branch and
call it iphone 6 20 and then on this new
branch I would make the changes that I
wanna change so that would be done by
cloning so this step that happens in
here where I said so the step instead of
just the parishioner cloning the
standard freako camp I will just clone
my branch and then I'd have a list of
all the things here I would have the
exact same setup i'd have this freako
camp directory up here the service and
such i would go to the home layout page
and I would change note too I odious and
then I will take my changes and then I
would create a poll requests and which i
think i can do here and the polar press
is going to go to freaking every cocaine
can just staging of libre does really
wanting my berkeley okay yeah and then I
would pull from my my own branch his
holds does it tickle
for people who aren't Donna Reed access
it's going to be and if you have
compared across forks it'll give you the
year it's like into from so that means
the thing on the left are such a
chocolaty nothing on the writers are
taking from so yeah you would want to
know is you want to spoil the way around
yeah and it's gonna ditch there even a
cute Oh what didn't well when I did a
ditch is DVD to give you this if you get
out there on the right to your one it
should do the yeah yes there we go so I
would change my typos fix in the staging
and I would see the first chorus and so
on and so forth yes so note that here
he's uh this is totally hypothetical arm
we are going to create a lot more
documentation about how to go through
this process but what mike has been
working on essentially will make
creating your development environment a
piece of cake relative to how it used to
be like it's so much easier to get set
up locally and one of the things that
free code camp emphasizes is actually
spending time coding and not spending a
whole lot of time trying to configure
and tweaked out your dev environment
because honestly like you can quickly
Google a lot of that stuff and that
stuff changes a lot but actually coding
skills take a lot of time to build up so
we think you should spend as much time
actually coding as possible and so this
is definitely a step in the right
direction making it easier to get your
dev environment setup so you can start
contributing and submitting pull request
open source projects on github right
well thank you very much Mike for this
walkthrough as soon as everything's done
we would love to announce this with a
big medium post and give up the hard
work on it and thank you again for the
demo so when words we'd like to close
with a demo from Christian so like if
you can make
Christian presenter and she can go mmm
should I see what screen after sure if I
can share this one smoking you will see
the screen with yep you know so around
one or two months ago me akira lane and
urine started working on this project
it's a music app where you have
different stations all of them have one
playlist in them that everyone can
contribute to its completely open source
it's written in media and yeah so i'm
now going to go to showcase it so on the
homepage you just get display of all the
stations with the what song is playing
right now and by whom of course you can
login logout you can make an account
yourself and you can login with github
so i would personally suggest logging in
with github rather than making account
yourself but it's all to you um yeah so
when you go to the green real quick cuz
we just see your desktop with the cool
fox on it oh it has a kazakh does the
fox say that there should be a song be
pre-populated
junk running tomorrow frame about this
video clip showing my second screen as
Monta one okay can you guys she'd
website oh yes oh I like home free
awesome so the domain everyone who's
watching is we sorry calm yeah yeah yeah
yeah okay is that show on something in a
foreign language uh doesn't mean
something in foreign language but it's
basically a mix of music and share so
you sir yeah um what's giving you can
sign up login you can make your own
account and you can also sign up get up
and look at it later so once you're
logged in you don't have to login to use
the website but it does give you some
more features so you can go to a room
I'm gonna so if a volume slider here it
will display either to youth video or a
SoundCloud image we have the preview
like a thumbnail of the song including
the title the person who made the song
and where the song set right now and how
long last the seeker boy here we have
the whole playlist including where it is
at right now you can if you logged in
you can add songs from youtube and from
soundcloud so if I just quickly do this
it will give you you would if you click
on them if we'll try to autofill these
things in by retrieving it from the
Spotify API and if it doesn't do that
you can do it yourself or there's also
two other moments were asking edit from
Spotify API so once you do that you can
just click add some and now it will get
added to a queue for admins to review
and I under you can also hide the video
if you don't want to show the video for
some reason
if you are logged in you can I don't you
can like the song you can dislike the
song and you can also do your like or
dislike this is completely permanent so
this will always stay on your profile
we're not sure if we click on this
display where which songs you've liked
or not but you can always undo your
dislike were like then you can also
report the song this is variously from
if it's not playing or if it doesn't
exist the title for being incorrectly
inappropriate all the same thing the
duration for being too long or too short
the audio for being appropriate when
you're playing open wide for or
basically same things and disorder then
admins also have some other nice
features happens can pass the whole room
for everyone and I should also mention
that the same song place at the same
like location that song at the same time
so happens can pass the room and display
the room again we can skip songs and we
can also show for the whole playlist so
if I show for it then you can see that
the whole playlist is shuffling so then
i also want to show the app input so
this will display how many users oregon
it and the queue is basically it's the
queue of all songs we can preview the
image we can preview the song themselves
we can edit the song over here and
retrieve the spotify data and then after
we've done that we can decide if we put
it in the playlist or if we just remove
it
then here we have to the playlist
themselves basically the same thing you
can remove the songs you can edit them
preview them briefly with images and
here will display the info of them and
then at last at the bottom you can add
rooms so as yeah this is a mod only
action like oh maybe man happen only for
now but we might make it a motherly like
right now we've only worked with
administrators not really with ranks
okay and so one thing I should mention
so around 16 17 I scouting go chromates
a change that is pretty bad for the app
if you go to a station and you then go
to a a new room and this song ends then
it won't play next song so Google Chrome
this Lee disabled it so that it doesn't
play new music new audio if you're not
in the top so you would have to go back
to the tab and then saw splitting so
yeah we hope to hear from you yeah so we
hope from it makes an option for us to
enable or disable it or just reverts it
so yeah that's about it at this point I
think we can go ahead and start taking
questions from all the campers watching
and everybody can feel free to jump in
you can ask questions to anybody here
including of course christian and mike
who download their apps and Bend who
hope the Challenger matic so I'm gonna
I'm gonna jump over into the chat room
and I think we have some mods in there
that are already taking a look at at
some of the questions coming through it
looks like Mike is no longer on a call
um italy's work okay but we will we will
all be happy to answer your questions
all those questions the home line up how
do I feel about LEM tanked well let me
tell you something you know hang on
Nathan you can ask the question directly
on the audio feed you don't have to type
it in the twitch cuz you're on the call
so let me tell you a little thing let's
play about oh I know I know oh here we
go here he is you have ten black photos
limping so I made the whole challenge
I'm attic and we were taking a look at
it one like very like let's go practice
into another's can make it better and so
we put it in but of course nathan has
this ridiculous like totalitarian es
lint config file but if there's a space
of a place it goes absolutely look them
up on your app and so after spending
half an hour moving spaces around we
gave up and I wrestles damn he's been
giving me the FAFSA levell anything I
might be looking at like this this is a
team its charm together in like an
evening it's just been six of other
times on a bit continue writing the
whole thing because I'm sensitive my
mind turns fixes and it's kind of like
firefighting so if you are looking at
the card now it probably will be gone in
a week but anyway so the total the
totalitarian linting file that we're
using is actually a frico camps eous
lint config file what s yes it's too hot
well you know I mean it's hard it's hard
to obey all the rules when you're
playing a game with chess or something
but well it's easy to fade when she
start from the stash I've done the whole
thing where they following them 100 he
turned around like oh great I've never
seen so much red in my life yeah it was
like I program in java script and put it
csharp ID and it just went
so that if that was my trucks be
incidental great well we've got some
great questions coming in from the
audience one question and I saw are we
still moving forward with moving
everything to flux and react and
Berkeley would you like to tackle that
one sure the answer is yes that's good
aspect do you want to like lay out like
at online or some of the things that
were that are we need to do in order to
move to flux and react sure so one of
the biggest challenges there's a there
is a trade-off with moving to react and
that is the bads these there's an
increased size in the amount of
JavaScript needed to load before you can
do anything on a page so with that trade
up in mind with that trade-off dictates
what pages can be much we act first and
and how fast when you do that so since
most people spend their time on fecal
camp doing challenges that's what we
that's where we will see the most
benefit and moving to react and flux
that is also the most neglected well not
neglected but a lot of the code that
goes into challenges it's very it's
what's called spaghetti code like
there's so many things going on so many
places so one of this one of the main
holdbacks right now is refactoring the
challenges framework to you know just
make the code a little cleaner and make
it a little more modular and just that
involves a whole lot of refactoring so
that's going to be one major step is
before we see large sections of the site
come in to react but there are other
places where we can move to react faster
so for instance news camper news can be
react at pretty soon since if you open
up camp renews it it opens up in a new
tab anyways and
you can either leave it open most people
just leave it open so that's one space
where we can see we act ought to hear
their other sections of the site there
are react but we haven't actually
publicly released them yet but they will
be soon and you should hear an
announcement from us but yeah the first
place most people will see react well
most people will be using react will be
the challenges but balaji no one that
happens you're just for people not learn
our like the challenge framework which
the thing that like loads month other's
hands Nathan ritas redness once or twice
and I rewrote the whole things were
mostly from scratch and then / keys were
in a twice from scratch and it to do
this if two new features that have been
brought in overall and react and both
does require an inflammatory right thing
um so it's like this evil in the cube
comical ah it's worth pointing out that
it's it's hard to do correctly but is it
really a lot of people have difficulty
with this like like Codecademy has a lot
of bugs and they have millions of
dollars and dozens of employees working
on the sort of stuff so I'm happy that
show me as it does but we definitely
have a long way to go in terms of making
the challenge kind of work even better
and and daddies I mean berkeley in my
quick that's the main obstacle to react
to find free code camp is just dealing
with the challenge like yeah it's just
yeah it's just so many people have
touched it and and a lot of the code was
just I say this it it's just a lot of
things were added that it was built to
suit the time at work everything around
to change so we'd have to be change
every mob grandal's everything works
great except Dooley it doesn't scale so
we need him out so tired Gail and change
it easily without having to do major
rewrites we have some questions for
Christian a tee-time girl asks Christian
how long did this take and another
camper asked a little bit more about the
tech stack that
you used to create a Christian and and
of course Johan and Akira may also be in
the the chat room answering questions as
well but Christian you want to take that
uh yeah ok so the development itself
okay I'm just gonna look at this so we
not sure when exactly we started i think
it was back at the end of sep tember i
think the 29th of september's when we
started and since then a carer has been
working on it for a few hours every day
i have as well a few hours every day and
like 5-6 hours in the weekends and yond
has been active more like eating and
more i like the last week or two so i
would say it took around one tumbles let
me see i'm bad at times yeah two months
around two months okay what's the use
meteor to make it can you talk a little
bit more about that yeah okay so meteor
is a full stack javascript library it
basically takes care of everything it's
a it's good for client-side and it's
good for surface I'd it's I can actually
show it over here so off the drop script
for the whole website is on this one
file so we yeah so here at this is all
the show fur coat from done here and
everything up there is just all the
client code it works a little bit like
angular with just templates like this I
it also has the ability to add user
packages that people make and it's just
you know for a really good performance
in connects good we can go client side
swept aside just really good
great um Jeff sorbic asks hey are you
going to talk about the seasonal zip
lines and sure enough we are um thank
you for mining me Jeff so free coke camp
is going is creating some some seasonal
or rather Jeff store buck has created a
seasonal challenge that everybody can
tackle if you feel like getting some
extra front-end development practice and
it is this beautiful recipe list it's
basically a recipe box and this is our
holiday challenge if you feel like
tackling it you probably don't want to
tackle this is your first zip line but
it could be done you know probably after
the basic zip lines if you felt like
tackling it basically as a user I can
add zip line I can add recipes so we'll
say oh wait so that's not this is
searching so right now we just have
pumpkin pie right here we can click it
and we can view it's pumpkin and it's
pie and I think this is storing at my
local storage or something because this
is a static file I don't even know how
it's doing it but it's probably doing it
in the local storage I could take you
look at the code but I'm pretty sure
that's how it's working let's say I want
to add one right so I want to add
stuffing now we're going to say bread
you know what else do you had to
stuffing like onions maybe garlic and
then let's say like maybe I I could be
more specific like two pounds of bread
and like two onions and five cloves of
garlic you know like a real recipe thank
you tell I don't do much cooking and
then i click ok and you can see that uh
I think should show up oh wait this is
for pumpkin pie so I have to navigate
back but you can see stuffing is now
here and it's got full text search so if
i type I everything is there but if i
type in
jus than just stuffing but pumpkin has
iron as well so this has full text you
know real-time search as well which is
awesome so basically you would want to
reverse engineer something like this and
this could be something pretty cool but
you can show your friends and there are
a lot of different directions and visual
styles you could apply to it and we're
hoping to have a lot more of the
seasonal completely optional zip lines
and BASE jumps that you can tackle so
big thanks to Jeff for creating that i
believe jeff has created a chat room
just for a seasonal ah store beck events
so in here he's got his some people have
come in to talk about this basically i
think this is where he introduced the
recipe box if anybody else wants to
create holiday-themed you know there are
a lot of holidays both secular and from
various religions in this time period
including New Year's Day for example
Chinese New Year stuff like that if you
want to create some challenges like that
we plan to exhibit them probably in the
same place we exhibit everything else
which is free code camp labs which is
where we're currently showing some
things that campers have built and we'll
add some additional things to here as
well such as of course lusair where you
were to get that in here and I'm eager
to to check that out after this stream
ends as well myself because that just
went live I think this morning so some
other questions if anybody saw any
questions that jumped out at them yes in
Jeff's torbeck confirmed its stores in
local storage and it has a delete and
undo delete why it even has undo delete
very nice all right so if anybody else
has any further questions um please let
us know otherwise
I don't think Wesley is going to be able
to stream but if nobody from our
audience or anybody on the stream would
like to stream Nathan been if either you
guys want to stream you're welcome to
take over the stream and what I plan to
do is export this as quickly as possible
to youtube so that our audience which we
actually have like usually five or six
times as many people watch it on YouTube
is watch it live apparently we have some
questions on the Twitter according to
Johanna Oh ring click campfire take a
look at those so is just people tweeted
with the hashtag Riku campfire or just a
change to their dear auntie like my
right okay great so thank you everybody
for tweeting these let's just answer
them real quick yeah we can make daily
weekly or even monthly coding challenges
that's what a Ellis spec asked I think
the seasonal challenges are going to be
a fun thing we can do in that direction
keep in mind even though about like
eighty percent of our campers are coming
to coding fresh a lot of more
experienced developers also use free
code camp just to practice building
projects and learn new technologies and
generally just keep their skills sharp
and explain their portfolio so I think
the seasonal challenges are great
offering for them because they can just
jump right in start building something
fun right off the bat so yeah we would
love to create more of the seasonal
challenges we talked a while back about
creating like a an email where you got
an email and you would open up your
javascript editor and just like solve
some JavaScript that's in that email
right there and then I'm in the
JavaScript console on your browser we
decided not to do that just because it
was extremely limiting and I mean that
was the main reason we haven't
completely dismissed it but it's not
we're planning to do at this point let's
see 47 minutes it could you add a link
to this we add this like to do with me
ah something about a security and cross
site so this would be a great um if
you'd like a full stack web design if
you would like to create a wiki article
around this currently our wiki was
vandalized heavily Berkeley you want to
talk a little bit with that real quick
yeah definitely so yeah as Quincy said
just we have a huge issue with spammers
on every one of our wikis on every one
of our repos so unfortunately that means
we we just can't have nice things so so
Wikipedia is now so the contribute the
way to contribute to the Wikipedia arm
sorry the wiki is we created a separate
repo of Quincy you can if you want to
navigate to the fat repo at pre code
camp oh I'm sorry github.com / free code
camp / wiki so now it's it's own
repository and you would contribute to
it the same way you contribute to free
code camp the weekend that was
ironically also vandalised what does it
do it yeah everything was challenged
America had millions laughs they all did
at some point yeah but family came to
the faction yeah yeah so I went through
it and we did all the wiki's and besides
that one so to contribute to it you
would just fork the Wikipedia or the
wiki repo edit the files and github and
then create pull requests so it's a
little more cumbersome and definitely
will probably see a reduction in the
amount of people that are willing to
contribute but if you can it's not too
difficult then we really appreciate it
the other thing to announce with the
wiki is will be moving it to be directly
on free code
calm so you'll still have to edit it on
github but the result will be shown as a
separate at website or is a separate
page on fecal chem calm and that that
task is being spearheaded by let's see
if I can pull up his username what
that's not where I'm an SSD while he's
doing that on the road point out one
thing that's good about this new wiki
thing is now contributions the wiki will
show up in your github activity as
contributions to an open source project
previously for whatever really don't
know why but github chose not to
consider contributions to github wiki's
to be considered like they're open
source contributions for the sake of
like the total contributions in the heat
map however with this um you will now
get a contribution whenever you commit
to the wiki and another convenient thing
you could already do this but you can
just pull down the wiki and edit it
locally instead of having to edit a code
pens or in a github graphic user
interface so we you were looking up the
person who is spearheading the velocity
awesome and a root yeah so he is
spearheading that we're gonna be moving
it to a static dynamic framework called
that's being a chick yeah it's it's kind
of weird it generates static pages for
you so you can use it with github pages
but it's also react app so you load the
initial page it'll actually give you the
static page and then it will load react
and so any page transition from there on
its single page so it's too weird hybrid
but it's really cool and it allow us to
do really cool stuff with the wiki so
it's named after the great gatsby plenty
of
plenty of fun puns there so the other
question yeah gasps Vijay is flash
Gatsby the other question people were
asking a do we plan to introduce it
capture the flag on preco camp so info
information security AKA InfoSec the
kind of stuff you talk about if you went
to like Def Con and places like that
cryptography that's really important but
that's that's a very specialized field I
think the average web developer doesn't
need to have a deep knowledge of that
ideally you would be like t-shaped you
would have a variety of basic skills
like you know doing some basic dev ops
stuff knowing some computer science and
have a you know designer scheme and
everything later that but the main thing
you would be really deep on is just
actual coding skills and building apps
which is what we focus on but we would
be interested in having a capture the
flag event like stripe i think has some
amazing capture the flag events some
other companies have them too it's just
that it we we don't want to focus our
own personal time on building that so if
you come up with some capture the flag
type challenges and you want to promote
them through freako camp we're total
week's games like we would love to have
our campers practice that stuff as long
as it's not too big of a distraction
from actual coding as I said repeatedly
ad nauseam I really think people need to
focus on just coding as much as possible
and not get distracted with all the
other millions of things that they could
also learn that would be good butter my
opinion less important than cody and
quench people for asking abish a few
times that how does he make money oh yes
yes people keep asking that so one thing
that we're getting ready to launch soon
is a job board and employers some of
them have already hired our campers are
interested in posting jobs that are in
these jobs I mean I can show you the job
board should I show them the job where
does it
not totally trashed I don't think there
are any jobs on there currently but
basically they'll be here soon we've
already we just finished setting all
this up and whether it's not well
looting we have all my followers and
that on there but basically this will be
a place where employers can post jobs
and once they post jobs campers who have
the front-end development certification
in the full stack development
certification will be able to apply for
those jobs so they can eat the employer
can either require a front-end
development certification or a
full-stack development certification for
the employers it's a really good deal
because they are basically guaranteed to
get somebody who has strong skills
because there just aren't people that
complete free code camp that aren't good
at coding I mean it's like way too much
work it would be extremely hard unless
you plagiarized of course which any way
to complete your eyes and you sign an
academic honesty promising you don't and
we randomly sample and reserve the right
to strip away your certification if we
find out that you plagiarize so don't
blade rise but I mean if you're not
plagiarizing like you are really really
strong after you complete the prime
development certification but you're
really really strong after you click the
full stack certification and then if you
go and complete those additional
nonprofit projects you're going to be so
strong that like I mean it's pretty much
inconceivable that you wouldn't be able
to get a job unless you were just a
total douche bag or something I think
you would have to have some really bad
people skills to offset the amount of
development experience and coding
ability that you have from completing
all that stuff and so far we haven't
added any problems as you probably know
people nobody's actually completed all
for non-profit projects we have tons of
nonprofit projects that are waiting
we're ready to start those as soon as we
have campers that are able to tackle
them but in order to be able to tackle
them you have to complete the full stack
development certification so generally
what happens is people complete the
certification they go get a job they
complete one of the projects they go get
a job we would like for people to
actually stick around and click the
other ones but
you're eager to get a job go ahead and
go get a job now this is going to
provide a way that free code camp can
essentially get some small amount of
money that like maintain operations and
servers and everything make sure that
like some of our core contributors have
burritos to eat and things like that and
are able to pay their rent and also it
will it'll help campers in terms of just
giving them a clear place they can go
where employers have basically signed on
to higher freq o camp graduates people
that have completed our programs oh so I
hope that answered that question
exhaustively enough it also have to take
chest as well oh yes we did sell some
t-shirts we didn't put a huge boost
behind the teachers were just like here
are the t-shirts um and I think we sold
like 300 of them so if you haven't
gotten your t-shirt in the veil you
should get it soon if you want a t-shirt
we're going to do some other t-shirts
they won't be quite like a one thing
people said was the t-shirts were a
little expensive they were twenty five
dollars plus tax and shipping I think
they were a little cheaper in Europe but
if we do another t-shirt campaign in the
future which we're not planning to do at
this point but one of the lessons I
think is that they should have been
cheaper and that even if it's not like
incredibly high quality made in America
t-shirt from american apparel people
will still get it if it's if it's a lot
of cheaper so we're hoping to basically
make the next campaign as cheap as
possible but the shirts that we sold
that's essentially like a limited
edition if you did get one of those
congratulations you've got the early
adopter shirt and we're never going to
make a shirt exactly like that again so
props all rights million indeed do we
have any other questions from the
audience some
they would like to see a hoodie and
grain stocks green swords or they wanted
I just quick we got great grain thought
they just want to be modded I nice
except eerie 74 awesome for a form my
fakes got one okay and yeah cafepress
it's not that great like we found
another place that we will probably sell
it through instead of teespring will see
teespring had some problems sorry if you
had any problems with teespring this is
just a cheap cheap t-shirts I didn't
know that um okay so i think i'm seeing
a good place to wind down unless anybody
else has any comments or closing
questions Nathan if you want to say
anything witty to montreat have anyone
sesh for the after shame so Frankie
promo questions enough to on your act
over yeah what we might do is there's
this thing we can do on twitch so we use
this watch pupil code sometimes watch
people code calm and I forgot to list us
I guess technically we were coding oh
wait somebody listed us thanks thanks
Nathan so we're going to go down here
and we can see a twitch installs arch
linux we could broadcast that I don't
know to with topia live twitch game what
is this guy doing live switch game that
doesn't seem like programming oh I think
what we'll do is we'll stream twitch
installs arch linux unless anybody else
wants to stream so i think i can do that
by doing the host mechanisms which I'll
do as soon as I get off so just to be
very clear does anybody want to stream
after this anti-gay ah ah one real quick
question from scoffs j leave
love to have thousands of waypoints
currently we have about 400 and we we
really do think that there's room for
thousands like there's that much stuff
to be covered and st. Peter is really
leaving leaving the charge on this and
of course me Ben Nathan a whole bunch of
people are going to continue
contributing to the waypoints because we
don't want to have that huge drop like
that you're all familiar I think
everybody's seen this oh yeah why
learning to code is so damn hard my
friend who founded the Odin project and
is now doing a boot camp called Viking
code school he wrote this blog post um
and he talks about in it he talks about
how like these tutorials like Codecademy
and you could argue that the frico can't
wait points kind of give you this
hand-holding confidence boost and then
suddenly you're faced with the blank
page and you go down this cliff and
you're like oh my gosh so hard to code I
thought I was so good at coding and
suddenly I had to actually code for real
and so so basically what we want to do
is we want to taper that off as much as
possible so that we can eliminate as
much of this cliff of confusion and
desert of despair as possible we it'll
probably be impossible to completely
eliminate that but we want to do what we
can to ameliorate it and that's the
purpose of us expanding our our way
points I'll go and post this a new chat
can I can I say something on that note
Quincy sure and guys um that that
confusion that you might feel don't be
afraid of it it's not necessarily a bad
thing um you know a lot of times like
through school through a lot of school
and things like that like we're given
things to help us and we're given a lot
of resources learning to code is pretty
damn hard um but you know if everything
was easy it would be as rewarding you
know you can't be
in a position to true succeed unless
you're also in the same position where
you can truly fail um and by family I
mean not not learning to code it's more
you're going to get errors and you're
going to get frustrated um you know
cherish those moments take time to
actually study the errors and take time
to maybe analyze and see where it's gone
wrong when you overcome that hurdle
you're going to feel a lot better about
it but going into the future those
errors that you can that you know those
problems that you buttered your head
against for a long time it's going to
make you a more efficient coder in the
long run simply because you have
experienced that and you'll be able to
either avoid it or if you do get that
error you're going to be able to just
hammer it down real quick and and drive
right past I'll so don't be afraid to
skip things and come back to know if
you're stuck like some of the bonfires a
bit mathy require you to if you've done
50 bonfire and you get to like you over
one and you actually can't get your
brain to think it's actually working I'm
not fine just just keep it come after em
cuz like the hard go outside get your
fresh air oh this yeah come over does
apple ash okay I'm being handed a baby
jocelyn say hi everybody so i'm going to
i'm going to go ahead and end the stream
now and we're gonna we're going to be
posting twitch installs Arch Linux which
should be a lot of fun it's a
collaborative you know everybody enters
commands and try not to enter you know
our mrf star basically we really
appreciate everyone joining us and I
think the message from all of this this
this article that i pasted it into the
chat just don't get discouraged and just
keep going long as you keep coding
eventually you'll get good I mean it's
just a matter of practice really and and
we want to do everything we can to make
your make this as time and efficient as
possible we would love for you to go
through this as quickly as possible so
you can go get a job as quickly as
possible but we're never going to like
pretend that earning the code is easy
we're never going to tell you you can
learn to code in like 12 weeks because I
simply don't think that that's viable
and I don't think very many people that
have learned to code on their own or
with an open source community like ours
have done so in 12 weeks I think it's
much more like six months or nine weeks
or nine months at the very least and
many people including the famous there's
an article learn to code in 10,000 hours
it's like learn c plus plus in 10,000
hours i'm going to paste that in real
quick like that it's a great article as
well and it just underscores how like
this is a complex profession yeah teach
yourself programming in 10 years because
there's this there are all these people
that are saying like oh you can learn to
code in a month or whatever and it's
just complete completely over-promising
and under-delivering and i think they're
setting a lot of people up for
disappointment so just just keep at it
everyone and I completely agree with
what Nathan said you're going to fail
and failing is part of the process of
getting good down a good thing come I
can stand with them I'm just like chat
and I have to go to school work so I
can't taste it less F someone stay on I
can hang around also all right well um
my baby's kind of heating up to go start
crying so everyone thank you so much for
joining and have a beautiful weekend
happy coding and thank you again for all
your questions and for contributing to
free cocaine Cheers hey guys
care folks hi everyone beat a little
