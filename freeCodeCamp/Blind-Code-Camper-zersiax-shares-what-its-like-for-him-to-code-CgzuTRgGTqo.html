leave it up there we go I go back okay
so yeah we're we're back in now we are
where were we oh we were just going to
just start from scratch with a hero site
yeah well gee you go things because that
was actually nuking the yoga folder
today head going and I was about to ask
you yeah yeah it's done hey go perfect
okay um VW year is like the completely
bowled completely empty directory so
what would I do next so now what we're
going but we are going ok so what I
guessing that has changes there's a
there's a pack of me get back of me oh
it can be able to turn that turn that
off without trimming up I now ok I don't
hear it can you hear i don't hear oh no
I oh it's like just enough delay that's
like tripping my mind and I can you mine
yes it's sort of the thing that I don't
know you either china ok so let's see i
mean it's it's lower i can if other
people are king
over the echo I think I should be able
to it's just when it's loud i don't know
i think there's like actually something
about that like I've heard there's even
like a like a audio weapon that you can
use to like if someone's giving a speech
or something or something send their
voice back to them just right and it's
just like bottles the brain and they
kept it so we're close to that but yeah
when you get like when you get this a
slowed down version of what you're
saying you immediately slow down
yourself until I go crazy and triple
yeah exactly i keep trying to match up
with it so anyway we're gonna go to the
layouts folder because that's where we
can select a pedagogue folder it's
completely empty right now so we can
replace this with an index file and so
we might as well just take it from the
index file that's in the hide x we might
as well take that first oh I haven't ink
evident board the themes yet oh yeah I
mean let me get the command line quick
start okay what I did there by the way
was you move to the next visited link
with a screen reader hotkey okay so
that's how you go around most the time
so if you've already been somewhere and
you know where you need to go that's a
lot quicker than listening to it just
just go scroll through every single what
a lot of three were users do as a reflex
is hit the H key whenever the page loads
and that moves to the first available
heading that's something ingrained into
every screen reader user because it's
just usually the important content on
the page is preceded by a heading so
hitting h remember to shut up to get to
a to get to a blog post for example is
the preferred way to quickly jump to the
important stuff that's why I heading so
are so important for accessibility and
if people lace cutout I if I if I
Shh here I'm at the top of the page and
about hit H it gives me the you go quick
quick start guide doing that again one
themes that's what I need it to so
that's what I'll do here this command
line here look where I am i'm at the-- f
ed w prom so that's good i can just do
this company and its weight that's just
a little bit too spammy sweater and
speech off there because it would read
out the percentage marks and it's very
annoying okay do you do you normally
just turn that off whatever that happens
usually I'll tap out of the window and
just check on it when it's done or I can
just look quickly so it's clothing all
these themes right now so I I have them
all that's good and it takes a few
minutes for that the catch because it's
there's like 20 themes by now nothing
Jekyll have more yeah I mean a lot of
inner there ported from Jekyll yeah and
this height x 1 is it it's if it was
ported from Jekyll but then someone else
took it even though even farther oh that
was actually one question while that's
loading I noticed that this height X
also has also has the delayed echo my
voice is still kind of crazy but um okay
so okay okay so with the discuss
comments it has discussed comments in
there is that something that that you
can even access the JavaScript embedded
comments that are on blogs sex and yeah
usually I can okay because i use a
Chrome extension vimeo so I have my
pretty much in a sense my venom shirt
keys for my key bindings for for
scrolling through websites and selecting
links and different things like that and
discuss is one thing I can't access
visits it's it's not accessible to vimeo
so i didn't but it is accessible to
screen I think it is I see discuss
frames popping up
on regular blog site so i think it can
at least can be made to be accessible
what it may do is only show up when you
arrow across it like that contact form
that i have on my wordpress site right
now so if that's the case I might just
take that out but that's always
something I can test that later I don't
even have a discuss profile at this
point so yeah that's one thing I notice
on there we might as well we can just
take that off temporarily and always add
it back in yeah that works see you soon
this thing done yet it's done oh cool so
now i can hear hi unix and copy then go
out of their face that in their function
going to vidya all right yep that's
exactly so now we have the index as is
and so we can just open that up because
what you but the main thing that we're
trying to do right now is make it so
that you don't have a list of blog posts
yeah because i want to sort of want to
separate that blog post from the from
the main website it has to be a section
rather than the main content i want the
main content to be more static um so
then i cleaned out statistics i asked
that will have to do are the sidebar
will need to add a blog link to that and
then edit the index SI however you want
and then you'll pretty much have it
ready to go ok so what do we do here we
open the an exploration awful here yep
did you just copy the opening oh well i
was thinking with like that's good to
reload it but it didn't find this is the
actual page that uh Hayek's gives us to
start with we have this content because
we have the posts live here and it this
is code i've never seen before i have no
idea what it does but i think it loads
all the posts i mean maybe that's just
the templating language that there or
the template hugo templates that they're
using
so catch that whole thing that whole div
class posts we can just remove that
entire part then we can always just copy
later yeah i'll copy into a new file so
I can i yeah i use it somewhere else
later we gotta be like the the / blogs /
indexed do we take the end tag there as
well the this one yelp i'm not that day
of one right I'm that div is connecting
with the poster yeah you can take that
off okay so that's be held the whole
thing right there copy that Oh cut that
actually and move it there and then go
back this is out here to discuss thing
that I'll leave it there for now it's
not harming anything so yeah and then
right there below that you have no just
a sec phones ring hollow old even a game
just realized until haven't met in a
video any clever scaring these dumb it
kind of all the show nach Osten US
attorney will do okay yeah touch 101 for
you guys yes thank you you're welcome
okay so and so we have the footer but we
don't have the sidebar in here so that's
old um yeah that is actually ok so let's
check out the partials head it might
just be in it might just be in that be
interesting but also any themes
directory right so we want too far
and party there's a psycho right there I
see it and being pulled in there
someone's Twitter chili the last one of
the head is pulling that in so listen
tourism that's why I saw someone from
the chat room is curious as the do you
know roughly how many words per minute
your screen fortunately 530 words per
minute 530 all right hey that's us
that's faster than I generally read so
that's that's pretty good mmm I can't
right here so yeah so okay so we got the
we got the sidebar we've got the so we
don't need to worry about that we just
need to go to the sidebar and add a blog
link to that yep so let me get the cyber
partial should put something useful
there at some point tagline fine oh
there's your navigation that only has a
blog where is that point okay that's
wrong that's born into the home page
okay so this is actually pointing to the
base URL which is home at this point so
okay where would I why would I change in
this little coal to make it go to blog
how does this template think all work Oh
so we have sight base URL let's see
below it's a site site params but you
can store all the sorry I'm still like
the echo of my voice is still 12 make it
kinda crazy yes I don't know what the
actual URL structure is for for this
maybe we can find it on a different page
page in the meat well actually you could
probably just do oh oh yeah I see what
you got your you can just put blog there
for right now I mean if you don't need
to make it dynamic so if you just do you
see the the back sledge there so dis dis
dick right so you got base URL then you
have two curly brackets and then you
have a slash and then you could put
because it's just filling in the first
part of the base URL but you can just
pop right right slanty wonder he just
kept right there / long is it does
pretty links or pretty where else
already so it's going to take it from
the directory blog and index but it will
displayed us is blog what alright well I
know this shows blog so oh oh yeah we'll
see what this does when it runs but ok
so this range thing let's see where it
poses data from originally that's
grilling site menu epic mine where is
menu male yeah I think you can set like
keys for 4 in 4 menu options that way
yeah and it pulls everything from that
ok this is just the end of the
navigation ok so that's not okay good
linkedin oh oh oh that's a social bug
yes those are your
social in there just text links right
now I only does linkedin from that album
I can get the exact syntax for that from
the well it has a github linkedin
google+ facebook and twitter yeah you
can see for to get it run or eat meat or
md i saw that's something like that so
what would we do here from now what
would be advisable change that that bit
of code we copied out do we put that in
the blog / index or four okay so if we
went back to the index then we can just
change it however was changing oh you're
talking about yeah blog index that's
where we could get back to the layout oh
okay so so you just make a directory
fruit just directors your blog and then
put it into an index that issue wait
Ryan company yes but I thought I so I go
up in here I make a blog like folder
here right yep you're in layouts and
then you're in the blog that's what I
did yeah a visual on the screen made it
look like it went to a different
directory by up that looks right so then
we just put an index dot HTML file there
we didn't change anything there so oh
yeah actually did so yes I'm gonna go
away kevin was this very next thing so
actually you know what we should
actually just copy the because we
actually want it to be exactly like the
themes index page right so we can just
just tell me the whole index page go be
done don't write back you fight it
then lay out always oh there we go
people want to know where they can hear
your music is there anywhere public
there's some stuff on YouTube
for my for my real name florian buyers
you'll find me here's a cup there's like
two or three songs in of me just that I
made if you need more to come talk to me
have them on dropbox so all right there
you go that answers that question so
that ok so we just copied that in so
then that's exactly what we want there
so we sure that understanding the 13th
routine oh that's not good um okay so
what do you get on them on the main page
hmm ok so the blog link is there but
then why don't we have I wonder if it's
something to do more so see what the
email is actually trying to really
trying to go is there something
different that you liked better about
the hide x verse I'd um I just like the
X thing I thought it was perhaps better
visual looking because it's like
extended yeah the extension difference
visually it looks the same except that
you can more easily change a few colors
but and then it's extended on a few
extras like discuss comments yeah I want
to look at this Oh see the problem ok I
just looking for / blog but I see
there's a problem Oh corals quote
actually it might let me kill the server
oh it's also not going to we need
actually put some content in their first
so we need to put a blog section in the
content folder so if we make a directory
inside content called blog couple is
dead whines barat working see these are
things i don't know so well ya bees is
probably it this will at least tell us
if it's something else that's going on
so we have the directory blog so i have
put something in here just make a new
markdown file or what yeah so we'll put
some Oh actually we can do that just
yeah we can do it directly from the yeah
and then you just do blog terracina
yes didn't I think or what was in case I
still with you right yeah it didn't
quite go to way it should've ok let's
try let's although it doesn't make sense
um what about blog / hello does that go
somewhere do no no so again this is my
first time really working with Hugo so I
don't know exactly why that would be
happening
here let's can you try just running it
in hide as opposed to hide x just change
the when you start the server start it
with hide yeah of course I guess that
partials are named differently and hide
so Oh CY but it's actually good you can
see me debug now yeah that's that this
one like not actually talking that much
because I assume that I'm talking right
over what you're in essence e-ink then
right well especially you're being
drowned out when I my family stuff so
yes see so my silence isn't may not
being exactly there's not a foot Oh
which I guess makes sense there's really
not a footer on this style okay so if I
just kill that footer line it should
work there's nothing else that I really
changed so i use oh it might actually
have troubles with some of those other
things too what about if we just do it i
just want to see if it's the height x
because I actually pulled up the
high-techs on my side too and I was
getting the same kind of blank screen
kind of things so I'm almost wondering
if there's something with the height x
maybe if we just do just did a new one
real quick just to see if it comes up
okay with hide and again okay okay okay
honey he he he he picked me okay just
load it without any modifications yeah
yeah did you
oh that's interesting it actually gives
me xml files for these well there's not
actually anything on it's a blank blank
page with just those three links so did
we not get the themes loaded in didn't
it not by what it's showing here why
cant its fine because I moved it to the
wrong thing I see hold on there and that
should do it Angela come from stop I
don't believe me not as a matter doesn't
matter okay that's fine okay uh this
place it though
I said oh ok so so now we have that that
we have your ear hello post yeah I see
my hellos and that's not what it should
be so yeah because we don't want it on
the index but since we just started
fresh we at least have what happens if
you go to that does it go to blog /
hello so we yeah blog alone oh not get
realized yeah let's let's just try
changing the front page on this one and
we can always tweak it later this one
yeah I think there's something just
wrong with the possibly with the other
one we might have also had a typo in
there too we could go back if you want
to we could probably go back someone was
saying that it said Boggs somewhere as
opposed to blog oh that could actually
be so either way you can make Jesus
contain your right so doesn't need to be
in here I long here I'm just copy of the
real talk there's my blinders my bog oh
that's big I don't think it matters much
because well that's your that's your
content so it might actually make a
difference let's see you try that deal
deal deal deal deal let's player hey you
pointing out what i'm doing wrong here
okay good now let's see words yep you
have your mr. blog and it shows you a
little yeah but it's below the footer
for me
oh really so you okay so because it's
good to split like the first get like
blog link which is the sidebar yeah then
I get the copyright thing that's the
footer and then I get the blogs see
that's what that's it I wonder why they
chose to do that because again that's
the height x because the other one
doesn't actually have a footer okay
alright so do you want to you want to go
this one doesn't if it doesn't if it
doesn't matter at all I mean I might as
well just use hide because it's like
more recognized and easier to fix yeah I
mean it's again all of this stuff is
that's the great thing about these
static site generators and hugo included
even though we're kind of fumbling
through it but like part of this is made
listening to a screener and getting used
to that too so the nice thing is is you
can change the the skin there's a theme
immediately I mean it's pretty it's
pretty easy the main thing that's nice
about a static site generator is because
all your blog posts everything that you
write is going to be in markdown so then
you can Tran you could even take it out
of Hugo and put it into something else
sure you'd have to refit or create a new
style for it and everything but you have
all of your your information sure you
can export things out of other things
but so yeah so if you want to do if we
if you want to focus on just the hide
without the X we can try to get that
index page fixed up yeah we'll we'll
stay with the with the I for now the
system this has some strange footer
weird order issues for it actually steam
Elsa manic so we'll just not go with
this Gil this sat down again and you can
go back to my other thing that I could
do you back here we go I'll just I
should learn this command by heart Hugo
Suresh hi
good boy okay that's running now go away
because if I renewed as it should new
there we go there we go so now we just
need a move they uh the list to a
separate file hello thing is still there
that's interesting Oh me check something
this is gone oh I didn't actually make a
potion this yet so it's not actually
showing any content yes I guess so are
you in the same directory you just
change the theme as opposed to the one
that we had started fresh I mean you
start a fresh one right now are you are
ok well we had the I thought we had made
that but I guess we can always do it
again the I can just wait I know because
we couldn't change the other one because
it had all sorts of markup issues so
yeah what's actually in the Jose how
loaded at me but then there's no content
in there so oh yeah I know it's there
and I loaded I said oh no I actually
don't see the content I'm Canadian
that's interesting on that is where
visitors save you it's there oh is it
because you didn't put a header yeah
maybe that's interesting is not running
it where is it just not watching a
proper oh
here so all that you see is the
rendering all you see there is the blah
blah blah is that yeah visit it shows
the the post title which is the hello
and then it has the date right below it
and then blah blah blah yeah ok ok so
then so that's at the home that's
showing so these would be the links to
go to these different things um so now
what's that there's only one link now
the whole one so yeah so that way you
just need to add a blog link on the side
and then we can keep the home button so
that it'll just be the partial sidebars
partials so I guess I see partial
shooting a come on now oh wait there's
nothing in here so I guess I copy the
partials and the index out get off the
teams and into here and then just modify
the index one and make a blog section
and the whole shebang it we just did
earlier yeah little will sirs do yeah
I'm making two windows your quizzes
mates hey
hey I'm very fast on the keyboard so
it's giving me a side menus one here but
how am I making use of that so that one
there that's going to be the
you're so you have your home link and
then that one is oh that's just listing
all of your Oh what is that noise so
it's going to give you a list on site
where is the side menu main how do i
find it see this is where I don't know
enough about Hugo steaming yet so those
are all parameters that you have so site
menus main it's going to pick up
anything that you have which I would
have picked up blog yeah oh so just add
that to your menu from in front matter
of what uh that would be of your blog
index page okay so uh so in content um
not content in layouts I don't yeah add
some front matter to that one coming
what is the front matter of so if you do
the it just above on line one just if we
do the topple front matter so the plus
plus plus and then if you just add that
whatever it was that we just saw the the
menu main and then title okay so by
citing menu equals medicated so by
assigning menu equals main but what is
menu equals main menu no that isn't
looking at one here let me
see if there's the working the site of
the wedding picky picky i jested quotes
don't have to be there right no that
they don't in the guitar front matter
I've never written topple either so I
don't know what the proper yeah
assigning mini-league of the main but
where is it pulling the room unless
unless we can just do an amendment
equals and then blog I know what a menu
okay that's interesting I'll just add
another bus to close to topple know what
do i do like main coal and blogger I
wouldn't know where to get that's what
I'm trying to look up right now in the
just a hugo docs can let me just see if
maybe this actually already fixed it up
oh it's uh if you just I think I just
found it but I found it for ya moul
front matter so yeah you just do menu
well yeah yeah Mel's different so yamel
its menu call in Maine and parentheses
so it may very well just be that so I
think you just oh I try just doing that
what do we have it actually show up I
think you just tell it that you want it
to be a main menu and then it's going to
pull it in as the link and the name of
that link and pull it in from where from
you Compton directory based on the the
content layout and the content folder
and the layout folder are going to
dictate the the hierarchy structure of
the directory so if that way we just put
this in the blog thing wouldn't
need to go and away it's not picking it
up blood mmm showcase we'll be good to
go well oh no it's not you're still
there huh yeah I'm still I'm sorry I'm
just looking okay sign up maybe no I'm
that's just me reading um so I'm trying
to go through the a single menu I'm
thinking maybe you need to set it up in
the conflict somewhere I don't know me
well okay so it's an interesting thing
actually is is that it's still showing
the blog post well we well we took out
the index 0 y 0 but this is where we're
on a slash blog / hello yeah we are now
testing so it's not there on the main
page and if you go to slash blog that's
good if you go to slash blog do we have
the list then ok so it's listing it
correctly this is good so I'd say just
hard code at this point I mean once you
understand better once I have a chance
to dig in more to figuring out how to
dynamically enter that I mean you can
just hard coat it okay I mean just so
that you have in your sidebar partial
just put a link to base 32 just um li
yeah exactly so well actually no you can
just do
the base URL so do the double double
curly brackets with a dot URL okay not
you but not base your oh this one's
actually laid up differently so it could
be the theme if you if you just go down
the line 14 just two lines down you'll
see what instead of making it i mean you
can just copy that a min just pull it
like okay you could just copy that whole
line and then we just remove the dynamic
content for the name part i thought URL
little slip yeah / erase yeah what's guy
named i would just change that and i
take out the double double curly braces
and everything and just put really title
that's just really quickly hey i do it
without those those spaces though hey
already let me let me be saving that oh
so this is their down oh wait okay well
I guess we don't why does it it's trying
to go to HTTP colon slash slash blog huh
do but we kept the URL thing in there I
guess we could try the base URL okay why
is this one even working it's not it's
not going anywhere oh well that was just
going to the maze oh it's going to slash
ok right it's going to slash just needs
to go 20 what can't I just do this wait
a second here
yeah you can just go / blog put on my
thinking so then the question is do you
want this to be a markdown file that you
grabbed the content from or do you just
want a hard coated onto the page which
onesies mean the whole thing yeah it'd
probably be easier to put it into a
markdown file for whatever yet included
somehow yeah um so if you just like
rights if you if you just start the like
writing a little bit of info i'll keep
looking here for to make sure we include
that correctly in the template i'll just
write something funny let me check if
there's like people if you've got
questions direct them to these ursa to
my to me on Gator in a brighter in a
personal message because I don't really
have a chance to look through D the din
in the actual main channel right now so
that'd be good alright so you're still
just out of curiosity you're still
tracking because I can't really hear
what your screen readers saying boss the
time you're still looking to see if
you're getting messages on on on get her
in everything no I didn't actually look
at last I'll bring up a page and if I
actually have any notifies people be
there oh I'll answer them verbally so
I'll call you by name and see radius is
your question yeah you can also put it
just in a twitch chat room 2 and I can
always get a final scene well I won't
see it there have a brand new movie so
for people who just tuned and that's
that's how you get how you contact me
Twitter works to ever you like but don't
throw it in the main now because I
really have time to scroll through all
that
keeps on twitter I'll look through your
stuff later this particular mentioning
me there oh so yeah that's favorite
thing I'm going to see if I can get this
so I'll just die oh wait I'll make it
i'll make one in the command line yeah
you'll see that i open a lot of
extraneous windows because i really
don't see them and i don't care about
them and i forget i have them so i open
a new one whenever I need a new one on
occasion I'm very slow at garbage
collecting sometimes I have like 80
windows open em officials down to the
crawl and that's when I closed is not
that much different for me just as
opposed to slowing down my computer it's
when it starts to finally annoy me but
as long as I can keep it all hidden it's
yeah okay um so I guess we would just do
well oh yeah because i well know you
where would that go oh you mean you can
just call it yeah I mean that works
these that's just gonna go directly yeah
that's good so can you to go to the
content for a directory just so I can
see where that to make sure it placed at
the top yeah okay yeah so that makes
sense so that should that should be just
that should be accessible to the index
yeah so yeah if you just enter stuff
alpha see that renders it by default if
I well I think you're gonna need
something in there just to uh to grab it
saving that okay I guess I mean I needed
to tell that it needs to load that
particular markdown pitch but I don't
know the templating language all that
well yet so it looks like it's just
double curly braces dot content so dot
content so if we go to the index
lay out in next 40 home one yeah for the
so like layouts and then index so right
there in between those divs just put a
double curly brace again it's a capital
C yeah and then just close it off with
the space into more curly braces how
does it know that it needs that one
though it should match up based on the
content mirrors the the content
directory mirrors the layout yeah sure
but if I put two and these in there I
wouldn't know which one to get example
if I'm making about that page here as
well in the same territory I wouldn't
know to get home another about well the
way you'd lay that out is you would do a
a new hugo knew about / index dot md we
might actually want to change that back
to a index md just so it matches to but
but you could just the way that you
would but you're not going to be making
them as your site URL / about dot HTML
it'll be / about / index so they'll be
in separate folders okay does that make
sense it does i didn't know that but
that's good to know so if technically
and if i wanted to come to hit that I
would do content / about or something or
what well you would do it differently
based on oh we need to actually tell it
to get we need to tell your the markdown
file we need to tell it which which lay
out to use I it will use the default by
default so now that should be fine yeah
so with if you're going to do something
on the about page it's going to use the
default template unless you specify it
in the topple a front matter and then
sorry it's like a
here let me just turn down I should just
turn down my volume whenever I'm trying
to talk me it's crazy how like it still
is messing with me okay all right so
when you're when you're creating like
the about page you put in the top front
matter you put the the what you need the
default template to be or it will
default template or you use one specific
like if you have an about page template
that you want you can you can have that
because your about page might have
something you might just not put a
header at the top you might also want
the maybe in if you wanted to put it
like an image or something else or maybe
you want to put the the main header for
the about page on the actual template
and then just pull in the content and
the content should if I'm understanding
this correctly which is very similar to
how other ones work it should mirror the
content so if you have an about page and
and you have an index md in there it's
going to render that as an index dot
HTML based on either the default
template or if you use and specify one
in the top will front matter it will use
that so if you use an about template in
the top of front matter then it will use
that otherwise it's going to it's going
to pull from the default main HTML is
that different can you say that good at
first like what we drew at the homepage
why does it dude why doesn't it use the
same philosophy well i think if i change
it try changing it to index or md file
in here would that work uh well content
is just going to so this is what is this
actually we need to call this in the
front matter to tell it to use this this
template and so that should just be
using a template this is my kml file
line well but that content is what's
created making it a template and the
partial and the the partials is taking
at the top that's why this is a template
and so if we just tell the the file the
the about md to use that and I think we
should change it to index m DBS then it
will switch it to an index.html then we
can tell it to use this specific
template and then whatever is in the
markdown file below the front matter is
going to be populated into the the
content section there I don't get it but
I think I need to see it didn't make it
the understand it let's see if this
actually works yeah that might just work
ok nothing there that's good here yet so
ok so i would say change it to an index
md and then let's actually temporarily
remove acne index from the because well
then we don't have any doubt that should
be our default and we also have these
archetypes the archetypes are are for
what's going to show up in the top full
front matter as far as i know so like if
you have like certain metadata that you
want for a blog post you might one you
might one end of the date i can make
this not seem to do anything just this
templating engine is a little different
later during me up again august i know
this here dutch 101 part too low nah
pahala fondos de menthe comida
yeah that's what this video yeah
mother's egg nog niks over a picture of

Velma McNeil fears you counted on home
okay it's good okay bye yeah are you
done with water minha coleÃ§Ã£o sauna
Dutch 1101 a concluded that was the
monster now um how do we fix this
because it's broken okay so i think to
give you a better understanding of what
Hugo's doing in general I'm just reading
now the the front page is a little it
treats it a little different you might
actually have to I mean there is sure a
way to do it but you might have to just
write that one up as an HTML page okay
but to give you an example of what it's
doing in general I think if you made an
about page again so if you just did the
about /
her bow head got me here like I can
making about markdown page because I
think that's gonna give you a better
understanding of like what it's actually
doing with the template yeah we're
learning both from this and you're gonna
write up about this oh yeah okay so i
opened up my working on this video file
too many series
playing with cool here ok finally all
right so essentially who else going up
here okay actually I was just looking at
a guess so the way that it's going to do
it it's actually if you want just a
about page like at your base URL slash
about hmm you want to do about md so
Hugo knew about md not about / oh well
you said I know I know I said I was just
reassure all right this would just be a
little silly because another page does
is not a jobber it's just so okay i'll
make a draft and its final plan right
okay so now how do i render that just so
are we sure we still watch it do I
station if we're ever still watching we
wish if we're still watching the server
um we should spend a little sweetie oh
no we're not words why is your date
there it's because it's just drawing
from your default template with your
default template looks like this so
that's that's all I was trying to show
you is that if you if you think of it
like this it's it's just going to use
your default template unless in the top
full front matter you
it something else to do and oh and or if
you just want to change the default page
and make it look different because
otherwise since this theme is
specifically used for blogging mainly
the specific theme is not that Hugo has
to be it it's making the default page be
a blog post okay so do I have different
templates in this thing already um well
this is the default single template and
so if you want to do it differently let
me look at the I'm just on my github
page right now with the the default
single if you if you actually go into
the Hyde layouts folder I can show you
what it's pulling from right now okay if
you go in the default folder see that's
where you're getting your day that's
fine but how would I make a new content
type as it were a new single template
would be that we just go to the the
layouts folder we create a template and
we use the the content double pretty
much like what we were trying to do with
the index HTML which I'm pretty sure we
could still actually use we just have to
call it correctly and I just that's the
one last thing I need to figure out is
how we call it if you go to the about md
we should be able to actually tell it
which one to use so what I do for
example I have a coupon see this is
default so before let's just say default
is blog but how would I make a sequel
make a new folder called I don't know
page here and put the single HTML in
there and then just all modify it like I
think if you put like an about HTML like
or or a single dot HTML there yeah
that's that's our well you probably want
to name it single because you do want
your blog post to still be
made that way so I think I think I read
something about to do this you make like
a new folder that's like your content
type name and there has to be a single
dot HTML file in there okay let me look
at this again so this is the like right
now in this folder you're in right now
this is the last place it's going to
look for any of these things so if you
replace the default folder it would in
your own layouts folder it would go
there instead but again we don't really
want to replace the default so should
just be about it right fine like if I
let's see sorry I'm trying to sell me
thing I don't read I don't necessarily
need to override the default defaults
are fine for the most part i just won
the second content type and i can use
yeah we just we just need to put it in
the in the top of front matter i just
cannot figure out how to call which be a
second Jekyll it's really easy just put
in the yellow front matter you just put
the which team or not which template you
want to use and so that's all we need to
do here to I just don't know if it's
just template equals I don't know if
that's that's what I'm trying to figure
out
Dawson's is so sparse um if you go to
the of year in the ovary right now if
you go in the same header that you're in
right great news simply creating a
template of each chord if not a content
provider directories but what are my
content I directory that's the one thing
I'm trying to figure out is what it
means by you put it into layouts / type
HTML and that's the one thing I'm not
quite sure how they're doing leave you
Oh confusing so it makes like a content
type in routes goalposts it makes sense
for for actual folders of category
folders it makes sense because if all of
your posts you could put a separate view
based in your layouts you just put
layouts and then posts and then you put
a file for your list of posts a template
for your list of posts a template for
your single post in a 14 summary like a
summer marshal but then it's the same
way like if you have posts and projects
that makes sense but the one thing I
don't know how to do is how to get acts
like how to correctly line up the one
for the about empty is it as simple as
just doing about dot HTML in the layouts
folder in the root director of the
lantern I think we think what you do is
make an about folder in the layout
folder that contains single and that you
don't maintain single or HTML yeah but
then you have to somehow call that about
view but it looks like it's doing it all
it like it's taking it a bit in other
static site generators you do you call
all that stuff in the front matter but
it doesn't look like they're doing
that's why it's confusing it looks like
they're doing it all based on they read
it just based on the site structure the
directory structure that's weird let's
see I remembered as necessary so far
isn't power is next it's what file isn't
present but then another phone in the
list will be just is a native craft
Pacific fun you want to do without any
no tempest necessary so it's all my gold
foil at the end of the list will be
needed
/ laying its nice up tight sledge
viewer HTML here's that here's that
range again sweet dog render not render
there we go here's your problem heart
that render single but that's HTML code
though that's not worry where where is
the example using views yeah look at
that I think that makes it clear most
funny hun I'm top free go back in all
right hey wait hey don't do that
seriously yeah I was afraid that would
happen I still go away thank you where
did you have that one what what view or
was that under templates o our number
might I found it quickly it's rendering
single from somewhere I don't know how
its determining what a single of HTML I
think every effing every be every
content type needs or can have a single
not HTML that sort of capsule eights the
content you're trying to render but I'm
not sure how that works on there the
hood I don't speak go so I can't really
look it up either yeah I know that's the
the benefit of this is that it's the
fastest static site generator out there
but that that's the one reason that's
kept me away from it is because I can
work with the JavaScript ones I can sort
of work with the the Jekyll one and ruby
but this one I just pretty much have to
look at the documentation and just
that's about all I could do yeah there's
not all that much of that around really
no there is there is more they are
growing they'd have a
to it disgusts dot go Hugo dot yeah
actually put a um a call for help on
there as well yesterday and this Michael
something Henderson nothing believe he
came back to me and said can you show me
your layout and I did and he hasn't
responded to me since but if anyone else
knows how this works and like to give us
a hint that would be great job is where
uh literally just anyone going blind on
this one yeah me too so um so yeah
everything is what's interesting yeah
they're not render Rendell's Rembert the
single and range is just a little loop
that doesn't really matter for about
pages so we can leave that one out so we
have to do a render with Indy uh where
is that oh this is okay so so for a let
me know what file is this section equals
main main of what why are they combining
markdown and HTML like this all of them
I want to see where I am this at least
give me a comment on what phylum looking
at it's rendering the summary view okay
so what I would do here is I really
think it's it's mostly in the layout I
think that that's that can be helpful if
the dot render summary is if you're
making a list view but we just need a we
don't need a list view um so the I think
it might be if you just put just in the
layouts folder if you put a single dot
HTML that might give it since the about
md is in that mirrored content folder
like it's the ride that and so i would
say try that and then the next thing i
would say try is doing a single dot HTML
in a
uh about folder oh ok so let's do that
let's let's let's let's see if we can
get this magic to wizard up some good
stuff to Congress so am i I'm Athene so
actually just copy this actually don't
just copy your index file in the main in
rename it to know what soon okay so then
let's that one already has the content
brackets in it that the double race dot
content and that's kind of what the
template needs so that about md is in
the the equivalent like say the of the
content folder the layout and the
content authors recently match yeah but
it doesn't so it's not working there so
then i would try at making a directory
for about anybody not single anymore no
no oh my god Adrian
oh oh oh oh I'm knocking absolutely yeah
whatever um almost 11 okay okay let's
see um ok so just a directory called
about what's that just a directory
called about if you just create a
directory and then motivate oh I would
say probably the first thing to do would
be to these all have this figured out a
lot better soon and I think right now
we're just kind of struggling with not
knowing the exact syntax once we have
that they'll be fine so I would say for
your website at this point I would just
say work on the content that you want
like do the markdown files for the about
page or any other page you want ok um
and then it's probably because it's
going to be probably really quick to to
actually tweak and make it work for the
actual pages you want I so I'd say at
this point it's kind of like we're just
like fumbling and it's going to make a
lot more sense if both of us just look
at the documentation and try and try a
few different things ok because I think
we're kind of hitting a wall with this
this one aspect but if you just work on
getting your your content that you want
for those other pages and then obviously
if you're going to be writing blog posts
you could even start writing a blog
posts and then the actual adjusting the
template is a little bit more
challenging than I expected it to be not
challenging it's just I don't it's
different than I expected sure so I'll
describe the content i mean i can plug
that in whenever the stuff is working
properly yeah and we can either maybe I
can accept someone on the shoulder about
how this rendering exactly works yeah
and i think i'm going to just check out
the i'm going to see if there are any
tutorials or whatnot online so far i
know that they have a few in the
in the docs section but not there's one
on actually creating a theme so I that
might actually be helpful I haven't
looked into that one so if from your
drill that it's under the tutorial
section and then creating a new theme
okay so okay well I guess for now then
little stopped because we've been going
at this for like two hours yeah I mean
look the first part was was mainly about
the accessibility stuff so i think i
think was still a beneficial pairing
even though we didn't get very far on
the actual project we're playing on yeah
sure but that's fine i mean i learned a
lot and we'll have to figure out the
rest on their own and little can look at
the tutorials see if I can figure out
what the hell is going on but from there
I think we did get somewhere yeah
exactly and if nothing else people got
two people that we're watching got a
chance to see or listen to your your
screen reader because I think even
though it was well coding I did mostly
bugging look but Hannah is still the
moving around is I think very intriguing
and you know it's like for myself like
it's a little bit of adjustment like
trying to like like I find myself
probably just more trying to nor the
screen reader but like with it
constantly going it is definitely like a
different kind of kind of like I in just
a distraction and different kind of way
so it's it's going well plus this
echoing up my voice so it's been an
interesting auditory experience I can't
imagine but but thanks for doing this
actually there was a mention of getting
this at like maybe a I know with our
different time zones but maybe a
different time that might be more
accessible to people that like I don't
well I guess that's how late are you up
i guess would be the thing if you're
ever willing to do one stay up late in
do one that's more evening time in the
united states is where we have most of
our users at this point still i mean
they're spread all over but if we could
do this at some point where we could go
over accessibility with like a after
people are off work or school or
different stuff might be really
beneficial i think people would be
interested in kind of going over this
and maybe we could think about it a
little bit more as to like how we could
best demonstrate like what it is that
like like simple things that people
could do as like a beginning developer
especially like what can they do
make their just the easy things they can
do like using the button that's tags
using proper tags what they can do to
make it so it's easily accessible for
you does that make sense yeah it does
make sense I like make some some ground
rules that you can follow to make sure
your application of this is usable yeah
be a good thing yeah I put you on a
phone so the year also the echoing
should be on we should be off now that's
weird i still hear it then steam viewer
actually wiping your own audio back to
you but this week it's not picking up
the screen reader so that's what so it's
been 3 b's that's what that was so
that's the reason why i'm still talking
so slow and stuttered I feel like it's
that's why it wasn't happening with
screen hero yes it's actually just
piping Ewing audio right back at you and
if the screamer was using the same sound
card and it's currently not I think you
don't hear that as well in your speakers
which would have been even more
distracting I think so I guess this is
all good yeah okay well maybe next time
we can still try and get maybe we can
well it doesn't see if we're just going
to go over things like that we don't
necessarily have to we could probably
even do the screen sharing on skype
Jerry that's right oh yeah since since
I'm if we're just going to go over
something like that we could just do
that with just seeing the visual of your
screen mm-hmm so yeah that's good well
uh think about it at least if you're
willing to I mean even if we can't do it
like a prime-time us time at least you
don't record it r and sasha people like
what we did it now and like 130 in the
afternoon that's a little early yeah i
believe the stuff that Nathan always
does is around nine that would be a
little bit on the late side but if we
would start right at this hour where
it's like it's what's what's now for
yeah yeah 30 or depending we can
possibly do a weekend or something to it
sometime just Italy just at least think
about i think i think people would
benefit from i mean i think people are
liking just being able to even hear the
screen reader at least the comments or
what not have seemed that way so i think
i think people are interested and
intrigued to see the
stuff so if you're willing to share I
think people would definitely tune in
yes that would be fun sure um and and
and at some point soon we will get this
this whole thing settled with your your
hugo stuff and i will figure it out too
so good luck with creating the content
on that i'll keep you all keep playing
with it maybe you can give me hints in
to check and see if i can get those
working so we'll see how far we can get
with that yeah when they're with the
chat will be a lot nicer as opposed to
the the echoing voice yes I can imagine
all right well right for now let's just
let's us and this one because it's been
going for two and a half hours and I
think YouTube will complain as much
longer yeah alright well excellent well
happen to have a good day yeah shinu
alright bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
