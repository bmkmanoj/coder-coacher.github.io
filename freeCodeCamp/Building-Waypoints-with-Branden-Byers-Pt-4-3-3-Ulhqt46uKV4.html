type should be in scope here but it
doesn't seem to be let me double check
down here so we look here challenge type
is for ok so challenge type is for
corporate info challenge type for I am I
guess I missed it I guess it is there oh
you know what it's a freakin string
that's the problem I can't believe it
this the fact that this you use the
triple equal instead of the double equal
is why we're having all this trouble but
actually it's good practice ease Tripoli
pool but we can I can show you right
here for equals equals 4 true 4 equals
equals equals equals 4 false we just
tweeted about this a couple days ago and
you guys should check it out Oh teal
birds welcome back man yeah it's a
bummer of the twitch got hacked or
whatever so if you guys are interested
in seeing a cool explanation of what the
hell was just going on and why we were
having difficulty which I'm almost
certain I've solved it let's just go
ahead and I'm going to revert everything
here is the original code actually
worked fine it's just that the needed to
wrap this in single quotes
so see I tweeted something out recently
and it was actually somebody on here i
think it was like Danny fritz or
somebody gave me the idea for the actual
the actual thing that I said in there
but it here yeah you guys check this out
and of course retweets are always
welcome this is a cool chart though
alright so let's try this again no we've
updated the logic
all right let's you like it here that's
what I'm talking about github link it's
pulling it so we fixed it
congratulations guys we did it together
I really appreciate you guys looking
over my shoulder and like giving me
pointers and stuff throughout the course
of the session so you guys are an
awesome audience and I'm really glad
that so many people participate in our
tabs versus spaces poll hopefully there
won't be like some you know silent war
going on between the two of you and
hopefully nobody was taking notes as to
who answered what oh I see michalak said
tabs equals negative 1 space that would
be really confusing that would get
people to click using tab though okay so
I'm going to status get at a
what did I touch let's a step back and
make sure that I didn't touch anything
weird here so I exploit it an extra line
in here I fixed this I hate it when this
happens and then this is where I fixed
out of that and that
yeah it's good so good so I'm gonna be
carriers ok so we commit and we'll say
make BASE jumps work and get there
github routes persisting in the database
minor
improvement on at terra kilobyte okay so
let's just all so base jumps are single
word
all right and as for the outstanding
things that I need to do stupid
nonprofit multi-step I've been putting
that off and I want to keep putting me
off because I need to go out and run
because my wife will freak out if I
don't eat dinner at a certain time and
understandably you know she likes to eat
on time so I'm gonna go ahead and kill
the stream guys and I'll maybe pop back
up after dinner I mean most likely i'm
going to kind of unplug and maybe just
read for a little bit after I get back
from my run I'm a tune into some other
people's dreams I may see what this
twitch ultra is all about that you guys
were mentioning earlier but as always I
really appreciate you guys watching if
you haven't already followed us please
follow us then you'll get a notification
every time we come online every time we
start streaming and the other thing I
want to say is if you if you haven't
checked out free code camp please do and
please give us feedback and please make
free code camp better by contributing to
our library as so many of you have
already done it means so much to us it's
like Christmas every day when I open it
up and there are a bunch of me pull
request even if we turn those pull
request down it's huge that you guys
made the effort and we can give you an
active free code review basically and
like look at your code and give you
feedback so don't make you a better
programmer and the other thing I would
say is don't take a day off resist the
urge to take a day off code every single
day I'm just going to share this article
very quickly in closing that the creator
of jQuery John rising wrote code every
day actually I tweeted it out so i'll
share the tweet to it and then you can
reach with if you find interesting
actually no Zack or post it's a core
answer sorry I use a lot of social media
yeah it's gonna take me forever to find
it but it's worth really trust me it's
worth the wait I know you guys are like
oh this guy's signing off he's not gonna
quit be more let's get out of here
that's totally cool i understand and
respect that but if you have a second to
stick around i'll get you this line yeah
here it is
oh yeah here if you guys use Korra I
enjoy that article please do give me an
upvote because I'm always trying to get
up both some Korra also if you follow me
on Korra I won't disappoint you I only
answer questions and I both questions
related to learn to code I'm extremely
focused in what I do what I do is help
people learn how to code so you'll
probably get that very consistent
messaging through everything that you
see on there and if it's not helpful if
I don't think it'll be helpful for you
guys I just don't tweet it out or share
it because frankly there's too much
noise already we need to stay focused in
this world so check out that article
code every single day and have a
beautiful sunday evening / monday
morning wherever you are cheers guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
