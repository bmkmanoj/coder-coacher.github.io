guys I think we should work on the tabs
spacing first yes definitely um see
there's the user oh you know what I bet
it was I upgraded to sublime three since
we started that project and I think that
might have been the difference yeah it
probably got rid of your user
preferences so okay tap sighs what I
don't what's Martin for I'm not
translate tabs two spaces true just take
off margin
so translate tabs to spaces does exactly
what it says I'm guessing yeah then
let's just do this true or false hello
well it's up to you like that will read
what the file is art be using and try to
use the same which I guess could be fine
so that way you're not making huge
changes like it off file has four spaces
then you only use four spaces okay but
it's not it will use whatever so if I'm
I guess if I'm fixing a file that's
wrong like if I go back to this pull
request to fix stuff it'll read what i
had in there before but i can change it
back would that be correct assumption
yeah i think so hello it might be better
just a bit off since they're wanting to
change over to two spaces anyway then
might as well do I'm dead to bracket
just has a little bit better but I went
denting so let's open up the file that
you change and then we can fix that all
right guess I'll have the pull request
that might be the best place to look and
see and we're back yes thanks for
hanging out guys I appreciate that
yes so you can see it here so this is a
resources controller and like I
literally didn't touch any of that stuff
so it does seem to be an automatic thing
yeah but in here it looks normal so what
what what's going on do you think well
it's yeah ok so like et the lines that
means that their tabs otherwise they
would be dots so you need to turn these
back into its paces okay which I think
there is a tool for LA you can do it on
the bottom because that's what I did
before where it says smells yum do
convert to space oh yeah yeah you're
right sorry perfect so yeah these are
all spaces not which actually they're
also i'm not using two spaces yeah it
looks perfect now so it's funny because
it looks the same but i guess because it
it registers like this is a tab instead
of this is a space when i get supported
over is that when all the funky stuff is
happening yeah exactly oh ok that's kind
of the problem with tabs is like what
you're really setting is you're going to
say like ok one tab was going to show us
two spaces but really it's still a tab
so it's going to depend on whoever is
doing it their size of the tab gotcha ok
that makes a lot more sense so now they
give you save this it should probably
actually if you commit it you should
show up I think just one else to see if
it works with this one file basically
yeah ok
alright
branch of my own that's probably Twitter
zip line so let's I learned this trick
from oh yeah it's all Nathan doing
anything super helpful thank you very
much so this is pure code and so then
you do oh how do you get them out it's
show stash so I they use done multi
mustache mustache I can't do that
gets a shoeless and then you do get
Sasha fly okay there it is git stash up
LA and there's conflict first off with
controllers API in a nap okay well it
looks it's spaces so that's good that's
kind of the idea yeah I'm just curious
updated upstream oh boy oh you said the
audio is low man when I just turned up a
little bit I don't know how low he said
it is yeah it's a little low
perfect all right humanoid ism let me
know how that works it's not gonna let
me do this with conflicts so looks like
a pretty small conflict though just like
right there well this whole yeah this
whole file was deleted so all this stuff
is just random stuff that I was working
on trying to get this twitter thing
working which is driving he does I'll
just comment the whole thing out
actually and not worry about it the best
way to solve problems ignore them
exactly it's a life skill wrong oh it's
got these here we go you have that end
up on the wrong way though and when it's
the start oh yeah idea thanks there we
go in a nap
this one still have abs too oh yeah
these have spaces oh good oh good it was
a small
alright
and I think this was on mr. renters
branch I'm just going to check that
yeah four days ago okay so get push mr.
renter here that should update the pull
request as well remote contains work you
do not have locally this is caused okay
let's see what this does that's funny
because I just pushed to it the other
day so I'm not sure what the conflicts
would be headline like characters that's
weird
already up to date yeah that's weird
okay whatever um I just do it it tells
me so this is the one that they were
just trying to merge right or isn't Iran
yes this is the one that they were
looking at and horrified by hopefully
that's good now let's see that
definitely looks better yeah well the
the one that was causing problems is up
near the top and then I'll see it so
that hopefully means that it's better
yeah perfect awesome thank you so much
so we could keep going with that but
frankly that would be kind of boring um
the other option would be some bonfires
or yeah do you want to do some bonfires
sure I don't think I've done does five
new ones actually oh um well it might be
all kinda cheating if I don't because I
wrote him so oh that's right I forgot
and I do have the solution st. in case
we get totally stuck that could be
helpful let's see which ones that
they've done
so we could start with boohoo I don't
think your new ones have been added here
oh you remembered be new I don't either
so let's do that I guess I should sign
in or does it prod any matter just won't
save it yeah this is one of the new ones
oh yeah it's awesome boo hoo check my
value is classifying oh okay yeah oh my
god this one I did like way wrong I mean
I didn't write but I did it this super
long way like it can be solved in like a
couple characters really how'd you do it
the long way I'm just curious I'd like
you did a bunch of if statements and
then like it's yeah it was mostly just a
ton of different statements to check
what it was and then return the right
thing gotcha so you checked like all the
different what were you checking I'm
curious I guess I would check like if it
was null and then I'll return false or
true I looked up what any kind of faulty
value would be and then there's return
false if that was it I didn't do it the
wrong way I just did the long way which
I guess is kind of the wrong way it's
probably easier to read well kinda like
I think this should work
you
oh no it totally doesn't work
boss oh so I decided backwards true to
false true false true the falls to the
fall street yeah okay it does are right
well so it's asking you to check to type
correct like um not the value I wanted
to value okay so tight long trip you see
I think there's a it's a global object
method for that o is type of a word like
a reserved word yeah oh I didn't know
that in objects
you just try to turn
no okay so maybe I didn't do it the
wrong way I thought this would work what
ok good time
string nonmember object
time
we probably want to return whether or
not x equals 0 yeah yeah I'm actually
I'm thinking of a completely different
bonfire I'm thinking of like the full C
value one oh yeah yeah yeah what you're
saying makes more sense yeah I actually
thought of that when you said all that
if statements because I think that's how
I approached it as well
there we go okay okay yeah that makes
more sense um we get these precious
points oh wait that's like hell George
perfect I think everyone should call you
George now yeah I've heard that many
times throughout I've heard everything
including the infamous Joffrey from Game
of Thrones Joffrey oh my gosh it's kind
of funny like all like you're out
growing up it was referenced as like
Jeffrey to draw from toys r us yeah and
then as soon as game atheros came out no
more of that now it's always Joffrey
that smelled like g 0 FF right yuh I
don't know I think so I read the book
this summer and I don't remember you
know when you read things you pronounce
them however you want in your head yes
yes Jo so is the audio trouble just to
me are we still having audio trouble I
have not oh yeah they're all still
saying it's still low I think maybe just
turn it up all the way it up turn it up
to eleven okay
you just turn my neck all the way
wonder too if I just have you really low
in my headphones like it sounds loud to
me some wearing headphones but oh yeah
what's actually coming through you know
what I mean so I'll just look cranky up
a little more um I think my microphone
is up all the way um okay yeah now
you're talking about the same volume as
me so that should be better yeah that
looks good hopefully that fixed the
problem but at least people can hear me
now so that problem solved that would be
boring I would feel bad for anyone just
listening to me Yammer to no one um okay
oh it's spitting me back out of the new
one yeah I'll get it a shot he then
arguments optional create a function
that sounds two arguments together if
only one argument is provided return a
function that expects one additional
argument and will return the sum oh boy
okay for example add two and three
should return five and add two should
return a function that is waiting for an
argument so that far some to end equals
add to return some two and three
ok
oh I say this answer what I've been with
so some to end is either going to equal
a number if you pass into arguments or
it's going to equal function if you only
passing one yeah he's on with this he's
trying to teach curry or at least point
you in that direction interesting I have
not seen that before which probably
explains why I'm know yet it approached
this so like say you have the add 23
right that's pretty normal but you can
also like sometimes you'll get something
like add two and then three so that's
kind of what he's trying to solve here
okay good if you just do like we do this
then it's only gonna have one argument
well ready not at all me and I more than
one but you can't pull it out the same
so yeah yes nothing good I think you've
got that like from so many of you
questions because it is actually like
totally a real interview question that
I've seen before and it's pretty
important is that like using apply um or
um wow no no okay now hey drink and
derive thanks for joining us the project
is our free code can't bonfires which
are basically like algorithm challenges
and just like Jeff said often very
similar to job interview questions which
is handy
so you okay you link to the global
function object so I'll go look here
creates a new function object so that's
will have to use that to make a new
function
plus the method of another object in the
context of a different object what do
you drink and derive what do you when
it's going to be done like this
challenge hopefully hopefully she'll get
it down like in the next ten seconds
yeah definitely everyone close your eyes
yeah if this gets tedious obviously we
can figure something else out well so
like um okay so you will get like more
than one argument well if you have to I
guess you'll have two arguments but he's
also wanting to check like he'll only
give you one argument sometimes so for
the second argument you're not um you
wouldn't really do it the same way cuz
the second of like like going back to
how I had it like okay so say you have
this right the two would be you know
just a regular old argument you can do
but the third is going to be like passed
in so you would do something like I'm
gonna lie these out here let's say you
have like function a and B and if
argument is a one then you're just going
to do you know you're just kind of a
turn hey or something but if there's two
didn't you return the function okay oh
well then you need 70 time like return
function see
the time a plus B something like that
like you need to run another function to
grab out this okay is this kind of like
if you're on the command line basically
it's waiting for the second argument
once you hit enter and that's just kind
of how I'm thinking of it I know it's
not exactly the same kinda yeah but just
the idea of it well this sounds like a
good conditional so I could at least I
can at least handle the first case right
like if there's one argument just or if
there's two arguments rather just some
them that's pretty easy to do so i'll
comment ears out for now so I can return
to it later okay so arguments stop links
is too
um interesting so let's just say instead
of trying to refigure it out i'm just
gonna find my solution that would be
great well do you remember the API for
and I have actually never seen it oh
well no not gonna work hey for busy 1888
thanks for following decide a function
on know it's here somewhere actually I
wonder it would be on the data site
because I know that one does show your
solutions I think any way it used to
hair afro line or hey hey hey okay
there's more argument yes there okay
okay so actually well you would want to
call like a slice and call oh that's
right
make a variable
I tried to memorize this the other day
let's see if I remember it right oh wait
i might be telling you their own thing i
think i might have pulled out a
difference this well you're probably
right as far as grabbing arguments this
will at least wow I do here Oh race lace
was close
hmm
well okay Tanana my ID yeah I got the
right thing that's always the best like
when you look like you're tired as I oh
what the hell did I do hear everything
remember where I wrote and then you
realize just how genius it was yeah
that's how you do that
declaration
yes this is real life noodle fish this
is not Python but it is for life this is
JavaScript or is this just fantasy
graceless yes it's the function what are
you talking about you know you need I
Renee that prototype that slice
undefined
my mom what I know how to do this yeah
I'm glad after a lion cut back because I
don't think anybody else did Oh what do
you catch the Sun no I took me like five
seconds to realize what you're saying
and I was so sad that it took you that
long that it I just chose not to okay so
I need to return a function that's
expecting an extra argument so this is
the tricky part where this like extra
perimeter space is throwing me off when
I literally write it like this
well no you would just use like a
variable like you'd from the function
and then use your own variable inside of
this like you would just like let me see
what you have you already that prototype
size call our arguments if arguments is
to return 0 plus one else so okay you're
calling this okay so now you would just
need like one and then you would do this
is what I couldn't figure out where does
it get the a from because scope wise I
could say that it's arg0 right well so
like if you run it like add 23 so like
right here you're running the second so
that would be this right so for this you
would just put in a variable like up
here so that would be a yeah okay
so I think they should work
plus I'm just a lawyer Oh extra function
is not a function extra function
why
maybe you need to work extra fine extra
functions maybe you just needed to find
it first I mean are you could just put
it in there too if you want to vote
no okay so yeah let's just do this thing
and right here oh wait okay function be
returned whoa what is going on with that
oh that the bracket holds be dismissing
here we'll just take this out
so if Ray that likes to okay so
okay so it weren't for the monthly plan
oh yeah you do long right on that yeah
cuz that worked for the one with the but
you also like want to check if there's a
number all the lies is going to be
trying to do stuff like that okay all
right and then this one I think that's
just a regular one knows that would be
handled by this uh yeah maybe I should
do greater than one and said because
that should have worked
I don't know why it returned the
function I owe you I don't know is my
work but I always you talk all good
chart none zero that did work oh yeah
okay so he's gonna be checking with
actually a number first yeah oh I guess
this is a lazy way to do it okay
eric says here
ah
you can always just check with a 2
instead of args oh that's true
see the type of that's what I'm looking
for and hello CBP human autism all right
this is same version yeah he likes to
change it up and try and stay anonymous
but I'm onto I like the humanoid ism
what does CBP stand for that's what I
want to know let me get just those
initials Christian something new Pearson
I think her purse yeah i think its
garrison and found out oh you just did
this ok type of
after that I can show you another kind
of like Flickr way out of a hacky way
but boy
yay awesome yeah so we need to show you
one other way I'm gonna have to go back
and read up on that because i'm still
not oh yeah it's kind of standing so
like I mean you could that idea that's
probably an easier way well I did it
like the super cheap way oh if a plus 20
equals equals a I mean it's like a
string then i will add in andover to it
otherwise it would be the same exact
number ah ok got in their soyuz type
coercion to see if it does anything nice
thank you well I always do that holy
perfect
codeblocks project I'd like that I just
have no good pictures of me yeah I
realized that I was trying to find a
profile picture and like all my pictures
I have sunglasses on so no one actually
knows what I look like it's okay that's
weird I thought there were more bonfires
well you probably completed them all
right so well I did and then they I
thought they added five and so I thought
there were five I hadn't done that may
be the only other one uh they had it in
better beta but not in this okay cuz I i
added on the UX improvements branch
which hasn't quite made its way over
here yet gotcha so we can still do if
you are sure is there one in particular
um yeah well I have to look at him again
actually mark yeah I Roman numeral
converter that's could be kind of fun
yeah that's the one I saw in the pull
request and I was like ooh could I get a
hard one to that can be fun
yeah if you guys haven't seen the beta
version I just saw it the other day it
was exciting I don't even know the
bonfires are they're all in matte
actually everything is in that so it's
kind of nice you just go all the way to
the bottom we can do the hard ones the
DNA fairy or the art it's like the
Marriott yeah friendly date ranges dates
for flames implement a way of converting
two dates into a more friendly date
range that could be presented to a user
I believe the answer to this is NPM
install dash dash save moment yeah I
should not show any redundant
information in the date range for
example if the year and month are the
same oh that is tough secondly if the
starting year as the current year and
the ending year can be inferred by the
reader the year should be omitted
inferred interesting
alright so okay i tested to see what the
results are in it we might want to skip
it it's a little long I feel like it
should be easy if you do if you use date
objects correct okay well if he's date
objects correctly this is he oh yeah i
mean its key you know how i don't know i
know i do i just did it like a really
long way I didn't really do all that but
they're definitely might be a quicker
way which if there is a want to know
about it I know you can pass in a date
string and make a date object so that's
what I'm thinking because it's someone
look a lot like this um and then you can
use like getters like get the day get
the year get the hours yeah so we should
be able to get at least halfway there I
think so let's at least let's just do
for one of them okay so str is actually
in a race i'm going to change that are
start
if we can get it I can't always paste in
my solution then just to make sure the
challenge is working because I all the
guys test to this as they put it up on
here it sounds good to me yeah let's do
this you date and just pass it in but
I'm not sure it's in the right format so
i need to change it so year month day
your month day month is zero based so
that might need to be changed but you
can do that
guess we need a console if we're going
to love anything to it
alright so it made a date that made one
okay I made two good so they are day
objects which is great so should equal
start date let's see how this works
let's see what they want for I go crazy
okay a word name for the month so months
date here so let's do month first get
UTC months or just normalement that's
probably good enough date object out get
month it's just a method
five
it's not the month interesting so this
is doing jun this says July and this is
saying five I guess a hacky way would be
to just assume that they'll all be two
different but that's not very
interesting
see oh it just returns an integer that's
why I think there's some string methods
time
date string yeah you're with my people
way faster because I actually don't even
use tape which I probably should have
um okay so it's giving us it's giving us
an integer one way that would be way too
long is would be to create an array of
all the month names
and just like call you know like return
months at seven or whatever but you know
that seems unnecessary we don't want to
parse it
yeah we're using dates in the time
coordinator app um and it was sort of
like a couple week long struggle oh yeah
trying to figure actually you guys
working on that but I didn't really look
into the project about what it was
everything was he like a calendar to
match up different kind of it some it
was a code nonprofit um it's late I
can't think of people's real names sorry
uh Michael right yeah not her I'm sorry
I know his dicking he needed something
to help them coordinate with nonprofit
stakeholders who arm different time
zones so you can say there's lots of
apps to like set meeting times but there
are not very many that take into account
time zone differences or there aren't
any so he threw it out there is a camper
practice project okay so yeah it's
pretty cool
this is ridiculous got it i can paste
that in if you want go for it cuz i
already have it actually no I typing
skills are deteriorated well might be
done by the time I put it in I'll race
you know one letter not too bad I have
anything this will take like two longer
let's get too long oh sure I think I'm i
think Quincy and Nathan wanted to get
back on this dream oh we're done to so
I'm gonna pace in the solution just see
if it works all right yeah go for it mom
okay after line what do all the
constructors look like what are you
talking about the date constructors
ashley is correct LOL NP a moment please
yeah this is like I needed the really
long way but oh dear okay i work at
least
perfect
we're just that fast oh man wait let's
go back and can we go back and see how
you did it because that can be
educational um that's not that long you
know okay so basically you split out you
may variables and just use string dot
split to get all the different integers
mmm that makes sense convert day from to
first second third so you made the
ordinals this ordinals are cardinal
ordinal Cesaro yeah don't know parse int
the tricky part is like say your see
you're given a date like on the same
month of your app and you wouldn't
really want to show you that month but
if the next month is like another month
later on if it's one month more but like
it's kind of hard to explain it's easier
with like year so say you're given like
Jenny where your first 2015 and then
January 22nd 2015 you would only want to
show like the first to the 22nd nervous
I know that if it's different month then
you show and if it's on the current
month and you'd only show like the date
and then the date and the month for the
second one or for the year say it's like
like what would a person right in other
words because I wouldn't write 2 2015
twice is that kind of what using you
right so like say you're given um like
un November 15 2015 and you're also
given 3 10 or for whatever it cited
right 2016 so you can kind of like infer
that if you don't include the 2015 it's
going to be the current here which
actually now that I realize that that's
I probably should have hard-coded that
goes next year that's going to be
different but I have you here to fix I
guess so you would give like 11 or on
yeah Oh think it's a lemon dash 15 and
then you would give for 10 2016 or if
you're given 09 04 2016 and boot 1104
2016 you can do you like 09 3 2016 to
1104
before like it's supposed to be like
friendly date ranges so maybe if you
were given two days how would you want
to display it and easiest way possible
to the user to not overcomplicate it or
like it was like on the current monk
like say you have like some sort of
event this month from the 5th to the six
instead of showing any months that's
just the current month we just show like
 six which is a good real life
Hughes case right because that's what
people would put in yeah you could
probably use like an or operator like do
something like month equals like either
what was passed in the second date or
just assume the first date like set this
kind of as the default in case there's
not one there yeah and I think that's
what I do down here so yeah here you're
setting out the first second third lever
and then pat it if it needs padding
because you don't want like you want
everything to uniform and then if you
have days month and year all the same
then you're only going to print the days
right otherwise right that like it just
kind of have a bunch of if statements
about what you want to actually print
out yeah the ordinals are are tough yeah
like the logic really isn't all that
hard it's just kind of a lot of thinking
about okay how am I going display this
which there probably is much faster ways
but my goal was just to make more
bonfires one at least for your current
year there's one thing yours timeout not
hard coding it you could do if you do um
new date that defaults to today and then
you can call like get your on it oh yeah
you can do that it had probably should
put in a full request for at some point
but as long as I do it within look on
x86 seven eight months you've had time
yeah time so great oh come back and we
are about curry stuff for sure yeah how
long did you want to do this shameful
i'm gonna use sometimes you need a 10
yeah that's kind of my my upper limit um
