when learning the code is to hang out
with other campers slacking camper news
are great ways to communicate with other
campers but there's no substitute for
meeting people in person so we set up
facebook groups and these are a
convenient way for you to keep track of
other people in your city so if you
click the link we have a list of
different cities here it's a rapidly
growing list and you can click through
and you can click join the group so I'm
going to join free code camp Atlanta and
you'll either immediately be admitted to
the group or your status will be pending
and they'll have to approve you but you
can see that this is a great way to
discuss different things you can view
the other members and you can see the
photos and once you join the group
successfully here I'll go to free code
camp San Francisco you can also set up
events and even share files if
some reason you don't see your city on
this list you can follow these steps to
create it and if you don't have a
Facebook account we strongly recommend
you create one if for some reason
facebook is blocked in your country
there are a lot of great social networks
that probably have group functionality
in your country and you can use those
instead so using these groups is great
to coordinate study groups pair
programming at your local library going
to guest lectures if you have a famous
computer scientist or engineer visiting
your local university and you want to go
with some friends or even coordinating
weekend hackathons and our humble advice
to you is to get out and meet as many
other campers and other coders in
general as possible enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
