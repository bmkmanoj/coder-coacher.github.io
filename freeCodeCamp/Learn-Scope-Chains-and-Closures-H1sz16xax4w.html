closures in JavaScript for this
challenge we're going to use a service
called cloud nine which provides us with
a full Ubuntu Linux workspace all
running in the cloud so we can do this
right here in our browser with a virtual
linux environment so if you don't
already have an account on cloud nine
you can click here and we'll create one
so first thing is going to do is ask for
you to sign in with github so i'll just
create a github account real quick okay
and now that I've created this account I
should be able to sign in the cloud nine
so I'll go back and I'll click the
github button since I have an active
session with github I just need to click
this green authorized application button
all right now it's going to ask for my
email address which ideally you give
them a real email address I'm just going
to make one up real quick so whatever
your email address you use it would be
good for you to be able to check it so
now we're going to go ahead and just
give our workspace the name scope chain
so we're creating a new workspace and
its public by default doesn't really
matter and we'll just click no GS which
will use a nodejs template for creating
this workspace then click create
workspace
now some things about nodejs and cloud
nine ten IDE this already has Mongo
running it already has no jazz running
it even has get party rental and I can
close this guy that pops up over here
and here i am so first things first we
will want to go ahead and install the
node school module so we're using node
school they have some excellent
javascript and nodejs related modules
that are open source anybody can improve
them and we are going to be using a few
of these in future challenges in order
to install this in cloud nine all we
need to do is run this npm install
command
waiting for word to load you'll notice
that you can just grab parts of cloud
nine and resize them it's quite
convenient so you'll see that this
little dash / is spinning and that means
it's installing everything once it
installs in order to start the note
school module all we'll need to do is
run this command so this is using node
package manager or NPM to install it
you'll learn more about this later the
important thing is you're going to be
able to go ahead and start learning how
scope chains and closures work in
JavaScript so we'll run this and here we
go we're in the note school module so we
can just choose which step we want to do
but you should do these in order so
let's do the first one together so we'll
just select it and hit enter and you'll
want to scroll up and read through the
directions basically this wants us to
create a file and then put a function
declaration inside of it and inside that
function declaration it wants us to
declare a variable so that it can use
that as an example of lexical scoping so
let's go ahead and do this real quick
I'm going to choose the top level folder
in the workspace right click and click
new file now i will call this program
jeaious j/s is the javascript file
extension now I can just double-click it
and I'll open up a text editor where I
can modify program Jas and I will just
do function foo
and then within the function foo I will
declare a variable of bar now foo and
bar are common place holder terms that
developers use for functions and
variables so they don't mean anything by
themselves it's just a convention with
in software development so now that
we've done that we can save the file
which there are shortcuts as well but
just make sure you save it and then what
we can do is we can run this command
which is giving us right here scope
chain closures verify and then the name
of the file program jas and it'll go and
run a test and you can see that success
we had the right code inside of program
jas and now that we've done that we can
move on to the next lesson which is
scope chains and the way we do that is
we just run the scope chains closures
command again and it will take us right
in here and you can see that it's marked
complete so keep working through these
and enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
