base jump challenges for these base jump
challenges we're going to build full
stack JavaScript applications right in
the browser and deploy them to the
internet using Heroku first things first
let's sign on in to our browser editor
cloud nine if you don't already have an
account create it and then click
dashboard and we can create a new
workspace we'll call it base jump and
set it up as a note GS app and click
create and then we just need to wait for
the base jump to process for a moment
then we can click it and click start
editing so first things first we want to
get rid of all this cruft and install
the stuff that will need in order to be
able to set up the app and we have a
command right here that'll do all of
that so this command the first thing it
does is it literally deletes everything
on the hard drive so be sure not to run
this on your local machine be sure to
only run it in cloud nine and you can
see these double ampersands mean that
it's connecting another command on there
so this is actually several different
commands don't worry too much about
exactly what this does just run it and
it'll get everything set up for you
we can see that spinning slash right
there that indicates that it's still
loading everything in
and it's going to start asking us some
questions so first of all we can always
give yeoman which is an open source
project anonymous usage statistics so
they can improve their tool and then
it's going to ask what would we like to
write our scripts with so we'll choose
JavaScript and for our markup we'll use
HTML and then for this one it really
doesn't matter so we'll just go up to
raw CSS for now and we're going to use n
0 and we do want to include bootstrap we
do also want to include you i would
strap and we do want to use mongoose
with MongoDB for our data modeling and
yes we would like to scaffold out the
authentication boilerplate this will
save us a ton of time and energy later
and for an initial authentication
strategy we find that Twitter is the
easiest to set up and the most flexible
so we'll just go with that and we do not
currently need socket i/o although you
may need it on future BASE jumps but
let's not let's not install it because
it adds a lot of complexity to the
application all right and again we can
give it permission to report usage
statistics so we can see over here that
it's installing all of this stuff
okay and sometimes we may run into
errors like this and if we do we just
need to rerun specific command
we're just going to rerun yo angular
full stag and it should be able to push
through that sometimes on the default
version of cloud nine it doesn't have
enough memory necessarily to run all
these things in serious but if you just
run the second time it'll it'll work and
again you shouldn't need to actually
update the memory or anything on cloud
nine you should be able to do everything
with the free tier so it's going to ask
do you there's an existing yo RC
configuration file would you like to use
it yes and then would you like to
overwrite favicon.ico and you can also
type yes to that all right and it's
saying right here that if we just run
this command it will install all the
dependencies so you can either grab that
right here from the terminal output or
we also have a command over here
you
alright and it's done so even if you see
that little spinner things stop for a
moment that doesn't necessarily mean
that it's not going to work next we can
go ahead and run that command that we
copy Bower install and NPM install these
two different package managers and this
will take a moment it as well but it
will basically install all the packages
and dependencies that we need for both
our server side stuff npm and our client
side stuff power
and now we can start MongoDB with this
command right here and mongodb is
running so MongoDB takes up its own tab
will just create a new tab by clicking
this plus and now we can actually start
the application by clicking grunts serve
by end I'm sorry by entering grunt serve
into the terminal so let's verify no I
didn't mean to create a new file I meant
to create a new terminal here we go so
let's run grunt serve and we can see
it's running all its basic setup tasks
okay and you're going to see this error
but don't worry about it all you need to
do is click this preview button and
click preview running application then
it will open up a new view in this
browser and once it connects it should
render everything from our sample
application that we just created with
yeoman
so it's just taking longer to get
everything going
you
and here it is so you can see this is
actually a fully functional application
we can log in for example create an
email and the password let's go ahead
and do that test it example calm and our
password and we need to register and
then it's going to ask us to go through
this process so we'll just do test test
at example.com and click sign up and we
can see it says hello test we're logged
in and we can go to the options and
change our password and go back home and
these are all functional links that it's
kind of a built-in tutorial it's pretty
pretty cool so you can follow these
links and play around with them but the
important thing is that we've got an
application that's running using the
full mean stack meaning MongoDB express
jas angularjs and nodejs so at this
point now that we verified that
everything runs we can go ahead and stop
everything and i'll just hit ctrl-c to
stop it and then i'm going to grab this
command will copy it and we'll paste it
in here and it's initializing the git
repository and it created our commit so
basically our commit added every single
file that yeoman generator created and
now if we go to github
up here in the upper right-hand corner
there's a plus and we'll just click new
repository and we'll just call this
yeoman generator and it can be a public
repository I think if it's a private you
have to pay so then they have these
fancy commands right here that we can
basically just follow but basically the
command we want is this one get remote
add origin and it's going to add this
repository as its remote origin so we
can just paste that into the terminal
and generally in the terminal if it
doesn't say anything back that means
everything's fine no news is good news
and then we'll go ahead and push our
repository to github and we just need to
enter our username and password and it's
pushing everything up
all right and it looks like it's
successfully pushed so let's go here and
we should be able to take a look at the
repository and we can see that
everything we've done is pushed and the
most recent commit was two minutes ago
that's when we actually created the
commit so this is a timestamp run we
actually did get commit not when we
pushed it which was just a few seconds
ago alright now that we've pushed it to
github the last thing that we need to do
is actually deploy it to Heroku so first
things first let's go ahead and create
our Roku account so we'll just click
this link it will take us to Heroku and
we'll sign up and it needs to be a real
email address I actually do have a gmail
address for this account so it wants me
to go ahead and check my gmail and
verify
and it will just refresh may take a
moment here it is confirm your Heroku
account so we can click this and now we
consider our password
and we can go ahead and click this
button to proceed and now we have a Roku
account it's actually over here under
accounts managed accounts and there's a
billing tab and again you will not be
charged anything but Roku does require
that they have some kind of credit card
on file before you can add add-ons like
MongoDB I'm going to hide the screen for
a moment so you can't see it and type in
my credit card information after yo
angular full-stack Heroku finishes
running we can just run this command and
it will go ahead and set all the
environmental variables on Heroku and it
will also add mongolab for us after
we've done this we can go ahead and go
directly to our app name base jump setup
karoku app com and see our app live in
production Wow we can verify that
MongoDB is running just by signing up
and
can see that it has saved me as a user
hello test so this is working</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
