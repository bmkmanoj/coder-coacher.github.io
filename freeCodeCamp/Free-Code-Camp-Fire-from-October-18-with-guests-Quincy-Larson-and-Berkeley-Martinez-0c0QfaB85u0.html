wouldn't fit with it because when you
add an image in it brings down the
amount of care tricks you can do hey
guys just read you need to refactor your
tweet your life I'm not a pro like
Quincy well I've get too used to stream
key on the stream I'll be almost it I
almost did it was really course I was
like oh and then cut it off I cannot you
like it thanks to our voices again oh
this isn't quince in the stream and a
fancy key the radio DJ that's good
that's a good sound I don't have like a
super bass voice I've always wanted one
channel your inner Barry White following
oh okay well today is really small yeah
cuz I have the experiment Oh God does
cause this you sometimes though okay I
think I think we're good to go right fo
PS is ready so I think we're good your
life ok cool ah yeah we're life I said I
guess what are you doing with the
cameras what do you mean i'm watching
this dream and it's like my non-existent
head and we just had quinsy then
berkeley and that's Brianna I think
whoever thought however is yeah its head
out on top oh yeah I've got the turn
something grid if you click the head
they bought a grid yeah okay so um you
can also click on one individual one
just to show their face weird oh thank
you can ok so i guess to to get it
started we'll just kind of explain we're
going to do today we're just going to
talk about free code camp because we had
our birthday what what was it thursday
quincy yep thursday so service there was
the year birthday of a free code camp
and we're just going to kind of talk
with quincy and berkeley one of the
starters of it and are one of the people
who started it and then we're going to
kind of talk about the past year and
anything in the future kind of going on
so i guess to kind of start off
introductions here i'm going to
introduce the three three of us me
brianna and ben and then we'll talk
about quincy and berkeley in a second so
I'm Septimus or Wesley extreme
out on free code camp if you guys don't
know me already and I'm just going to
basically be doing hopefully the talk
shows quite a bit more streaming on that
the twitch channel and then i'll let go
ahead and let brie introduce her feel
free yeah I'm Brianna I have been
involved with free code camp ads like a
camper student since about november
december of last year I'm a full-time
music teacher so any time that I'm
spending on pre code camp is I just fit
it in whenever I can I'm working on some
of the short videos for hikes and you'll
see me on twitch but yeah my favorite
thing about free code camp so far as the
community like I think a lot of people
here and I'm really excited to see where
it's gonna go in the next couple years
all right Ben thank ya uh I've been I've
no camera and i already prepared a blurb
if you like i do a lot of the quicks
well i did someone a quick i'm stuff a
free code camp and damn i've been on a
couple of dreams and last well yeah i
really have a pair like a better like in
shock it's alright then it's all right
we're get to know me plenty of times the
key figure share code Z of breakfast
they'll definitely all right yeah um so
well I guess we'll start off at Berkeley
here cuz i have him on the big big face
here so berkeley if you guys don't know
CTO for free code camp he does all of
the the technical aspect of it makes
rico camp work and look look good and
what the way it does now so he's
definitely a very big important part of
all this so it kind of let let him do a
little bit more about himself because i
don't know too much about Berkeley um
awesome that was pretty good intro know
what else out of that yeah I'm the
developer guy I'm 18 anything that has
to do with the site that's code wise for
technical wise yeah awesome
I will throw a Quincy up here hold on
how do I make it there we go what both
of them I um do you want to go ahead and
get this one Bri yeah Quincy I think if
you're on freak Oh camp and you haven't
figured out who Quincy is you should
definitely get to know a little bit more
he's the founder of free code camp and
he's very active in the community so
it's not like he founded it and you
never see him around you don't really
know who he is he's in the chat he's on
Twitter he's on twitch really easy to
get a hold of um yeah Quincy is behind
the scenes for every part of free code
camp and and part of this you know a
little she'll show thing I'm really
looking forward to finding out what hats
he does we're in that because I think he
did a lot more than most of us realize
he wears all the hats yeah where many
anything else you want to add to that
Quincy uh I mean just some basic
information about me I am a career
school director and teacher and now I'm
directing a really large school that's
how I look at it it's just like a
natural kind of extension of what I've
been doing except now everything's
remote and it's like open admission and
it's like pure meritocracy people don't
move on unless they move themselves on
so it's it's great i love it I'm a
little facts about where we all are
because we're all over the all over the
globe I Quincy in berkeley we're here in
the Bay Area the San Francisco Bay Area
and brianna is ensure paint
champaign-urbana am i pronouncing that
quickly yeah champaign-urbana it's where
the u of i is an Illinois alright
champaign urbana urbana hey guys are
okay and then uh uh uh of course um Ben
is in are you in Dublin yeah doping
Dublin proper I like yeah and and Wesley
is God knows where he's biking crossing
at states right now I've been Ohio right
now yeah Ohio yeah all right
that's where this one was lighting
chillin out here one thing I want to
throw in really quick Quincy I don't
know if you're watching the chat but
somebody said that Quincy is to freak Oh
campus Craig is the craigslist about you
duh Craig's Craig Newmark the founder of
craigslist is like my power animal he's
definitely like a big inspiration for me
I love the guy I'm hoping to meet him at
some point he's he's in the Bay Area I
could add theory like bump into him with
a grocery store or something so if that
happens I will definitely be giving
high-fives and asking for his autograph
perfect that's how good um breed you
want to go ahead and start off with with
one of the one of their questions that
we had for for them yeah so there's
questions for Quincy um where were you
when you first got the idea for free
code camp I'm sure you'd heard of a lot
of things like Codecademy and you
yourself had taught yourself some
programming how where were you when you
first had this realization like wow
there's an opportunity for something
really great here right well it was I'll
tell you it was not like some big flash
of insight it wasn't the proverbial
Eureka displacement moment it was very
much a like a progression i can give you
very quick context on what I was working
on before free coke camp me and three
other people um we're working on a
project called course forward which was
a MOOC recommendation engine and
essentially we pulled in your LinkedIn
profile so we could understand your
current skills and we had like six or
seven hundred different skills in our
database they're all like technical
skills then we took your your
representation of your current skills
and we looked at all the different
careers out there we had like 30
different careers you could choose from
and we had mined millions of job
postings to understand what a typical
job in a career what skills were
involved and then we had also pulled
down about 30,000 MOOCs and other online
courses and analyze them all to see what
skills
it covered and then we built up this
dependency tree of the different skills
like what skills need to be learned in
what sequence what are the prerequisite
for some skills like you're not going to
learn algebra before you know arithmetic
for example and then we could basically
construct this nice path it's nice
smooth sequence of MOOCs that you could
take in order to transition from your
current career to whichever career you
want to move into unfortunately after we
built all that we realized hey people
don't want to trust major career
decisions to an algorithm so that was
about two years of work in the wrong
direction oh I mean it's not like we
just gave up I mean we tried everything
to get people to use this thing um but a
quick you guys interrupt but st. Peters
only would you take the laptop after lap
because to make MCC sorry I'm gonna like
well how can I sit where it's not
terrible lighting I'll sit over here
hashtag been back to carpet I really
want to go back I bring back the closet
so uh I guess what I was gonna say is um
preÃ§o camp was basically a process of
removing functionality from that
original idea taking away the notion of
like data science careers and dated you
know database administration tab careers
and networking engineering and all these
other technical fields and just focusing
on one field and one core skill which is
web development so about almost exactly
a year ago I put a basic nodejs express
a pup I used the hackathon starter it
was my first Evernote jsf and it was
basically just a list of challenges
there were like 14 challenges ranging
from deploy a website to the internet to
reverse engineer Pinterest some of some
of these are still in the curriculum
right now and we had a simple hip chat
room and that was free code camp it was
like hey we can chat about these
challenges while we work
so there wasn't a discrete moment where
I had the idea it was just a matter of
me like sitting down over the course of
days and stripping out all the ideas
from this much larger more ambitious
project listen Bert offers a much bigger
tool that you kind of figured out
exactly what functionality was gonna be
most useful for people that's awesome
and then stripped it down to a small
tool and now it's a big tool again very
perfect or it's a big focus tool yeah it
was a big unfocused tool yeah it wasn't
used to anyone in particular that's cool
yeah I don't think a lot of people
really know where free code camp came
from it just kind of appeared and at
least now we don't know it that that's
what it happens so it's cool cool to see
that so I guess to kind of tail off of
that how did how did you come around to
help in quincy out berkeley yeah so yeah
at the time when Quincy was starting
free cooking I think we were both
working out of the Wix co-working spaces
I yeah and so I was working on starting
a consultancy and me and Quincy which is
kind of just code next to each other it
was pretty awesome I think one thing he
left out of the story is free code camp
originally started out as a real zap and
it was a real zap but the curriculum was
touting the mean stack and you know I
was just bringing up the point that you
know you're real zap you want people to
learn the mean stack I think it's kind
of hypocritical you should really think
about switching over it to using a least
express a note and I think you did that
eventually um yeah so while we were
working together in the co-working space
every once awhile he would come up to me
and ask questions because I am kind of
the typical camper right like I started
out just learning from the inner
and I would go on codecademy ankle
school and all these other different
sites tutorials and I just dove into it
at first and so I would give them advice
from campers for a future campers
perspective okay so um basically you
were you just helped in quincy out for a
long time like when did you kind of make
this full time berkeley so it started
out a couple months ago well actually
probably more than half a year ago I
hadn't an ambitious idea to help out
with Rico chems code base which is to
move over what was once an express and
Mongoose app which is basically the
hackathon starter kit over to a new
framework called loopback which is an
API framework and the way i sold it is
if we make it all an API and just make
it a restful api it's really easy to
then move to a web app and at the time i
was thinking about doing it it could be
done an angular since we were still
really pushing angular but now it'll be
react but yeah that was the idea i'd
come up with I pitched it to Quincy as a
project I could do with my consultancy
and you know eventually that would
completed that and we transferred
everything over and then the time I
realized my consultancy he wasn't really
doing very well so I came I came up to
Quincy until um you know I'm gonna
probably go look for a job and Quincy is
like how he should just come work for me
and that's basically add up an awesome
that's cool that's really cool happy
you're still here Berkeley making
everything look good and work work right
so definitely a plus um let's see what
whales do we want to go with that I have
a question fancy um so Quincy you've
mentioned before that when you learned
web development it was a little
non-traditional how did you get involved
like what made you think I want to learn
how to make web websites and web apps
and how did
start learning for yourself Thank You
excellent question um I was working as a
school director and I was automating a
lot of life work flows like immigration
workflows if you deal with international
students you there's this thing called
cedis it's like the government has this
big complicated website for dealing with
administrative records of international
students and H naught h-1b visas but uh
I 20s and F F pieces so I wanted to
automate a lot of that workflow so I
could free up some of my administrators
to be more efficient and focus on
dealing with students instead of working
through web forms over and over so I
started writing scripts to automate
those workflows and automate like a lot
of the grading process and all these
other things and and I just realized
like man this school has so many
administrators that are so busy staring
at their computers and they really
should be talking with students and if
we simply take some time to automate
some of these processes we can make it
to where our administrators can spend a
lot more time helping students instead
of just dealing with compliance and all
these kind of blue plate overhead things
so I just gradually started learning
little skills like becoming kind of a
super user which basically is somebody
who uses technology more in a more
effective way than just a typical person
that would use a computer and then
gradually that turn into coding and
that's when I decided like hey like I'm
running this school but I can only help
this school i can't help people beyond
this school unless i actually learned to
code and scale my efforts so that's when
i decided to leave my job and focus on
really learning to code awesome that's
really awesome Oh firstly what you
learned um I learned Python first a
python is actually a really good
beginners language is really easy to
learn they have these mechanisms to
force you to basically we have clean
code
good indentation and everything it's
white space sensitive after I learned
some Python I learned some Ruby and
JavaScript was the thing that everybody
told me from day one you just need to
focus on JavaScript don't learn these
other ones but of course I kept
switching between languages so I mean I
retrospect that time would have been
much better spent just learning
JavaScript and learning Python and Ruby
wasn't all that helpful for learning
JavaScript because the syntax was so
different and javascript is quite a bit
different two languages I guess it did
help to some extent but I would have
definitely been better off if I just
focus on learning JavaScript because
that's really all you need to know these
days if you want to do web development
don't let anybody tell you otherwise
like the only reason you need to learn
python is if you're doing like
mathematical or scientific stuff there
are a lot of great libraries for doing
like statistical stuff with Python I
can't really think of a good reason to
learn ruby ruby has some good screen
scraping type tools and rails is
obviously popular even if it's
substantially slower than nodejs and has
like far fewer libraries but but yeah
python was a reasonable choice I think
python is a much better language to
start off with and say Java which is
what computer science burgers were using
prior to two or three years ago when
majority of of switched over the Python
so I think that python is better than
then what they were learning which was
like Pascal's what I learned in high
school I took like one Pascal of course
and I was like coding is not for me but
I definitely think javascript is the
right thing to start with which is why
we focus exclusively on JavaScript I
don't think there's a need to learn
additional languages a lot of people say
you're not a real coder unless you know
and languages well I disagree you can
get everything done with one language I
mean they all accomplished practically
the same thing it just is a matter of
implementation what has marginal
benefits over the other in terms of
carrying out what specific task
absolutely so one of the questions
that's been asked in twitch and it was
one that I had as well have you thought
out in the future like five years for
free coke am and what you know in a
dream world ideal what would free code
can't be to you and to the users in five
years absolutely I mean like there's so
many I I dream about it at night I dream
about the possibilities it would be
wonderful for free code camp to
essentially just be a reliable path for
anybody who wants to learn web
development well enough to get a job and
I think it already is to some extent but
it's a lot harder than it needs to be
we're working on improving the
curriculum to make it just a more steady
slope right now they're like these jumps
and difficulty and we're aware of them
people constantly talk about them and
and thank you for reminding us that we
have these jumps but we're definitely
working hard to address and smooth out
the learning curve but I would imagine
that like an insanely good web app that
makes it extremely easy to pair program
with people extremely easy to get help
which we push the big innovation on
Friday which is we we haven't announced
it formally but basically now you can
chat right on preco camp calm you can
like open up the chat window and it will
open up the right chat window for the
specific challenges you're doing well
and we're gonna build in hopefully
building messaging and some other tools
for you to communicate with other people
and to pair more seamlessly so I would
say the future free code camp as a
website would be just making it
extremely easy to pair program and
making the challenges like super smooth
and work on a mobile phone would be
great if we can technically it's more
responsive but it's not like coding on a
mobile phone is really painful still I
don't know if there's a way around that
but we're gonna keep experimenting with
it um as but as far as a community which
is much greater than free code camp calm
the community these coffee and codes are
taking off we have won almost every day
now um I'd love for free coke camps
community to just be million
the people getting together in coding
and I'd love for people to not feel that
they have to go out and spend a whole
bunch of money to buy resources to learn
to code because there are so many great
free resources out there we're just one
of many but I think we can be the main
one the main resource of people used and
then they use these other ones to learn
more specific details and learn other
facets kind of like they use us is the
core curriculum and then they use
everything else is the game that suit
that's that's kind of my vision and and
really we just want to be the best place
to learn web development in the world
just on the chatting before you hop on
this isn't a platform change we aren't
leaving Gator like we left slack Jeter
just real if they were confused all
right i think i think if i understand
correctly in quincy the the chat feature
that you have just implements probably
Gator api straight into the website
where just pops up to get a room yeah
berkeley can talk more about it he helps
integrate perfect indefinitely it's
still good ER and you still use the same
login information you still have to be
logged into github it's just now you
don't have to open up a new window or
you don't have to open an app it's just
right there in the browser for you
perfect and a future it'll become a lot
more helpful once we integrate other
features yeah i think that's really cool
it seems like a lot of people get stuck
on on things especially on the bonfires
of what i hear a lot miss i think does a
really helpful feature so i guess one of
the other kind of big questions for both
of you guys and with god and go with
that berkeley first on this one is that
when you were getting started with free
code camp at least for you berkeley what
was like one of the biggest slight
challenges or like juggles that you have
between doing free code camp while also
having like a job and kind of just doing
back and forth kind of stuff or whatever
you needed to do to start so as a
consultant running you get to choose
your clients at a time I was only doing
kriko camp
and ask Quincy as a client I don't know
what's the best approach if you are in a
full-time job and you all are to cook or
you want to contribute your eco camp it
is a matter of having the energy to do
it um and it's one of those things where
you can just find the energy within
yourself it's not like something you
have to go out and find um yeah it's
just it it's just that it's a struggle
when you do have a full-time job but I
think anyone can do it it's just a
matter of how much time you want to vote
to it catcher and then what about for
you that weren't necessarily a like
balancing time but when you first got
involved with free code camp what were
some things that for you you know proved
to be a little bit difficult well the
biggest thing that I that I was running
to is because there's so many people
have touched freako camps code base it's
really difficult to tell what is
removable and what has a specific
purpose a good example is there's an
issue on github right now with the
comments so apparently there's some code
and the the process that runs your
personal code and taxes it that removes
the comments I'm not really sure why
it's there it's been there since the
whole thing was written so like one
suggestion was just to remove that bit
the problem is because we don't really
know why it was put in removing it might
cause other issues to arise so we have
to be really careful about changing
things that we think is just unnecessary
that's one of the challenges like one
can i change this thing and is it gonna
affect other things that i'm not even
thinking about its have been more than
it should have yeah that I imagine is
really a difficult I have to try and
find especially as it gets larger and as
it grows trying to keep track of
everything has to be overwhelming
another interesting issue was as one on
github about em
the challenge something of now it's a
removing comments from code and their
people keep saying oh if I remove what
the bottom comment to keep on the
background deflector and actually maybe
one put up the issuer follow tradition
actually cares about I tell if you say
to people the reason why that was put
there was to actually fix another issue
where the tests wouldn't show if your
code has another complete a comment on
us and people were complaining about
that so there's a lot of you fix one
thing and it causes it doesn't
necessarily break something else but a
cause behavior that somebody else
doesn't quite like and there is kind of
like a balancing act between making
people happy and another example that
was the bonfire situations where a huge
number of people said I don't want them
I don't want them I don't want them
they're taken away and then an equally
huge number of people came back and said
whether they go so there's there's a bit
of a balancing act wit you can't please
everybody but trying to aim for the best
happy medium yeah all it reminds me have
you guys seen that that like Cody car
maker or like same thing that it goes it
talks about like you know that song 99
bottles of beer on the wall but they
have it with code and it says a take one
gal and patched up whatever and it's
like 200 bugs instead of like you fix
you know you only have 99 before but you
fix one you have like 200 200 again so
that's definitely true true that stuff
so I guess Quincy same question for you
I could imagine getting started with
Rico camp had some challenges most of
the challenges um were just me doing
like things naively in the wrong
direction um we we have experimented a
lot and I definitely want to keep a
spirit of experimentation in trying new
things some experiments have worked out
better than others initially I wanted to
actually do coding locally in a local
dev environment and I was like hey just
download Adam and do this in this and
like great and and the reality is when
you try to configure a dev
like you encounter all these kinds of
issues um your see libraries are screwed
up because Xcode didn't install properly
or you're on Windows and you have to
install putty or something like that so
that you can actually emulate a linux
environment and our answer was just move
everything into the browser and remove
those annoying hurdles that like our
faces be stumbling blocks for new coders
yeah so that was one thing like we were
and a lot of people to this day or like
well you're not really coding unless
you're doing it on your local machine
unless you've got them open and you've
got you know the terminal and stuff
streaming up and down and like if you
don't if it doesn't look like you're in
the matrix or like than yours you're not
a real coder right like that's that's
one of the big misconceptions people
have but but if you code it in the I
mean if you're coding in cloud nine that
is coding that is a full functional dev
environment it's got Mongo running it
takes Linux inputs I mean you're using
Ubuntu essentially and so that was a big
deal it's just trying to convince people
that like this is really coding you
don't have to spend two or three days
frustrated that you're dead environments
broken you know just so you can code so
so it took a while for me to realize
that like it was worth appeasing that
minority of people that were skeptical
about am I really coding because I'm
doing this in a browser and now I just
tell them like yeah you really are
coding and sure there will be people
let's say otherwise what they're wrong
so that was one thing and then like
we've experimented with a lot of other
things that have just proven to not bear
fruit or being more trouble than they're
worth those were things that took a lot
of time and energy to get working
properly uh but you're always gonna be
writing code in the wrong direction and
the thing I learned from spending you
know almost two years building course
forward is just really really really
focus on getting things out the door
quickly so the people can tell you
whether it's good or it's not don't
trust your own intuition that's like the
tenant of agile you're probably wrong
always like test yeah definitely yeah so
so just making stupid mistakes on my own
part and making well intentioned
experiments that didn't pan out because
a lot of what free KU camps doing is new
it's unprecedented so there's a lot of
room for making mistakes yeah it's
really one of the nice things that seems
like is the community seems very very
forgiving in that aspect or if I'm sure
you really enjoy Quincy is that you know
if something breaks especially that big
transfer over with the whole code base
and it was kind of it was a it was a big
thing and it was very important but it
had a lot of issues and I think the
community stuck stuck through it was
just like you know it'll come back it's
you know no big deal and I think I think
that's another great aspect of it too I
have another question for you Quincy so
earlier we talked about how you wear a
lot of hats like more cats than anyone
realizes what are some of your favorite
has to wear and your favorite roles to
play behind the scenes and then what are
some of your least favorite sure um well
I'll tell you that I do like I think one
hundred percent of the support for free
code camp so if you send an email to
team at free code camp calm with an
issue I'm going to be the one that
resolves that issue I'm going to go into
the database and manually update your
record sometimes if it's particularly
complicated i'll ask berkeley to help me
out but but usually i just go in and fix
database records usually i answer
general questions I also AM manning
Twitter aside from tweets about streams
which Wesley handles I deal with all the
Twitter stuff I deal with all the
facebook stuff i really enjoy
communicating directly with with campers
and i feel like it really keeps my
finger on the pulse i wrote a quarry
answer about this recently basically i
probably talked to like hundreds of
campers a day across get ur and Twitter
and Facebook and and all these other
channels email and that's what I love
doing I spent probably more than half of
my day doing that
and and by the way my day is long like I
probably work 80 or 90 hours a week but
it's not really work I mean it's just my
life I I take care of my newborn that's
a big part of my life to waking up in
the middle and changing diapers and
stuff but when I'm not doing that um
working on free coke can yeah well it
does anybody have a screenshot of
Quincy's get ur and facebook when he has
it up because I think people would
really appreciate to see that it is a
it's horrendous Quincy does a lot and I
don't know how he keeps up with it it's
that's crazy he gave me access to
twitter and i go on there to just check
every once in a while I'm was like 40
notifications at any given time and it's
just it's crazy and he also he added me
to be to the Facebook user like the
whole thing so like everything and I get
a bunch of notification there too and I
can see does it ayah is definitely
amazing so awesome how about you
Berkeley what kind of what roles do you
play that are your favorite and what
parts are frustrating correctly sarios
trying to find the mute button oh so
what was the question if you treat the
question for me so you do a lot of
different things for free code camp even
within the you know just managing all
the technical background what parts of
that are your favorites work on and what
parts can be frustrating definitely my
favorite is adding the new features
whenever we're rushing to get something
out and something really cool and then
once we release it you get that almost
instant feedback from the community like
the reason release of the integrated
Gator chat we didn't tell anybody about
it we gave a couple hints but the people
that did find it or a lanky oh my god
this is so cool and when you see that
like that's the best feeling definitely
the part that probably sucks the most is
all the develops it bops so like a
couple times the we have a database
issue a while back and
I woke up I was like eleven o'clock or
twelve o'clock and i didn't notice it
until it was really late and then when i
noticed it it was the weirdest thing we
were still up but you wouldn't get
anything past the main page free coke
camp and like I was tearing my hair out
and I was calling and I was calling
Quincy like over and over again trying
to get him up because it was pretty was
probably sleeping with the baby and yeah
those kind of things just it's it's a
nightmare just trying to fix those
things we don't know why something is
broken those are probably definitely the
worst feelings in the world and you
don't you don't experience that until
you have something that a lot of people
are using um yeah yeah which exist
exactly time when you don't want to
experience it isn't when there's
actually a lot of people trying to get
it and it goes down no yeah I don't envy
you there that doesn't sound like a
whole lot of fun trying to see i know i
had another another question for you
guys oh yeah basically in the last year
berkeley or quincy well it's like what's
kind of stuff that you kind of learned
like I guess bring it this is from
breanna slits but like learned about
yourself over the last year
hmm I've learned my tolerance for
staying up really really late hasn't
diminished since college he's awesome
I've learned that I love talking to
people on helping people I mean I kind
of knew that is school director because
that was what I did all day anyway help
teachers and help students but um I
genuinely like that's what I want to
spend my life doing is helping people um
I don't I mean when when somebody's like
database record is fixed and like they
they excellently they're creating a
duplicate account because they sign in
with a different single sign-on option
which are the bane of my day but may not
exactly look great it's working I'm back
to coding now and I just like yes like I
want to like clear obstacles for people
that's what I love doing I love just
removing excuses removing obstacles so
that people can you know jam forward and
keep getting things done and like I
whenever people whenever campers have
like fuller momentum I feel that it's
like it's almost like kind of like those
weird neurons firing like hiking him I
can remember what that was like when I
finally pushed through an obstacle it
was you know back on the road great yes
I yeah I know for myself like in my
journey so far and learning to code
getting the Pomodoro timer zip line for
whatever reason that one was really
difficult for me and when I finally got
that done I was like I'd broken through
a wall what were some of your
experiences when you were learning to
code that were those moments like oh I'm
finally you know getting something
Quincy yeah I'm thinking um certainly
certainly um I would say like I when I
first started out I worked through
project euler which is like a kind of a
math heavy algorithm challenge um and I
worked doing that just to get better
like scripting in general and I remember
some of those like like that's when I
truly got addicted to codeine that's
when the time just started falling off
the clock was when I was I was trying to
solve these simple problems which which
we modeled bonfires after kind of like
we made it less mathematical and we
actually created tests where his project
project euler is like the Zen master
like you're wrong try again look like it
doesn't tell you anything right anything
about wrong it's just like your number
that you gave us he's not correct um so
I would say like just getting ramped up
on on those and and feeling that that
the completing a challenge that rush and
and building on that and like see how
daunting this thing looks at initially
and then just breaking it down to
smaller bits and figuring out how to
solve it and it's solving it and seeing
that I've solved it correctly and that
was definitely the best feeling him up
that was when I really like I of course
like deploying my first website and
doing all these others things associated
with web development we're great but
just solving those simple algorithm
challenges I just felt was like a nice
cop you know well contained a boost la
marca I know we have a couple more
questions here but I also want to give a
shout outs for chat um I mean keep
throwing questions not necessarily
technical questions but any questions
that you have for Quincy or Berkeley
because we're keeping an eye on it and
same thing if anybody's on Twitter I see
some things on Twitter that are looking
a little bit more technical yeah which
will come later but if we have time I'll
definitely ask them i'm thinking i sing
reserve in like 20 20 minutes at the end
just for twitter or any other questions
there well there can be worth it um I
definitely have like two more questions
for you guys that I think campers would
really like to hear which at least
basically what's something that you see
campers really get stuck on a lot very
frequently consistent issues that they
get stuck on that uh that you that you
want to that you're working on trying to
fix or that you wish that they didn't
get stuck on or anything like that um a
TTI integrations are definitely one that
campers consistently complaining they're
not ready for and our curriculum doesn't
prepare them sufficiently for and that's
something that Ben is actually working
on ajax and json api challenges right
now and ben's kind of laying down the
scaffolding in terms of implementing
some some challenges and then what we're
hoping with our community can step in
and kind of start filling those that
scaffolding in and flushing it out even
further so that we've got this really
robust um series of challenges that
really get you ready to write API
integrations because that's such a huge
part of being a web developer is yeah
consuming other people's services and
data um that's definitely a weakness
that the people get stuck on and it's
it's largely our fault we just haven't
had time to build out all those
resources like you think about what free
coke cans curriculum is doing is trying
to literally be an end to end web
development curriculum and there's just
so much there and we had to like choose
what to focus on first and there are
still big outstanding issues that we
know kind of sucks so thanks for bearing
with this fully bang them out yeah and
i'm dash' in case just in case people
are curious the kind of workflows and
relatives exam the object when the folks
at programming section needs to be
expanded its only 11 challenges and all
they really are i just had a little
methods you can use before the bonfire
and that was the purpose of them
initially was to get them and say these
are really handy thing they will change
your life they circle changed my when i
figure out how they worked and i think
most people the same Eureka moment when
they figure it the dot map exists and
what else the plan after that I think is
nice to look at my file I actually have
a file fair and why plan after that I
think he is react or I might go back it
depends on what happened so if there's a
lot of people and actually another point
that anyone's give me feedback on the
JSON or a jacked off please do feel free
to share at me because I would like to
know and if that's okay I'm gonna move
on to react because react to indirectly
also force people to learn how to
consume api's because we can just throw
up like I don't know 10 react challenges
which should be like build of you for
consuming whatever twitter is a few like
doing the DM twitch base jump with
reacting and teaching his mate that we
react and so because of that you learn
react components how they work and I'll
so you'll be forced to consume an API so
hopefully that'll be an interesting
comprehensive here's how I make a ting
type of challenge I'm coming behind me
to fill up that gaps and there was a
gent I was talking to you the day who's
looking to do if you like the best i can
describe them our easy bonfires bit
algorithm practice to get people up to
scratch I believe st. Peter is going and
correcting all my horrible grammar and
spelling mistakes and suggestion I kind
of stuff which is really appreciated
because I am sayin if i can make
challenges but i'm not going to do this
stuff after that it's kinda it's loose
so d3 would like to be them at some
point and GAE does something else I've
written down they won't have to see in
there that we haven't touched on and
freako camp uses other Jade and both the
hackathons better and actually if you
use an express if you generated express
app and it defaults you enter this Jade
so I think Jade is a relevant and
obviously stuff like reactors kind of
taken over that kind of whole sector
things but jail is a relevant again some
of these things that you start using
your life it's brilliant because it
really saves you a lot of time so i
kinda that's my rambles the whole thing
if you like it's just kind of like
please fulfill to share to me if you
feel this hole in the curriculum because
I'm most likely gonna be able to fix
them and if their chance to exist Gina
Phillip scratch where you'd like to see
the creek and go a certain direction and
I'm a good man to poke and there is
definitely work that needs to be done we
had a meeting with st. Pierre and a
couple other campers as well yesterday
after our birthday party it a lot of
feedback is like people were just not
prepared for bonfires like it go see it
goes from being very like simple things
in the JavaScript curriculum and then to
having a blank piece of paper in front
of you once you hit bonfires so like we
brainstormed we have a bunch of ideas
how to fill that I think Saint Peter is
gonna be like infinitely resourceful and
fixing this issue but we're also open to
having other campers to help as well a
treatment to get people who are actively
helping in the community like st. Peter
and eating to be offering help because
the problem that I now have is I used to
spend all that time the chat I don't get
to do anymore so I'm almost I feel like
I'm on at a touch what's going on and so
it's nice to have people to come up and
remind you of what they're not working
because the Christian and I used to be
in the chat is hugely different to
curriculum now and half out of my own
fault um like I don't know we publish I
wish I'd taken a snap shot but like um
we used to have the bonfires you'd be
much bigger blocks they were much harder
if you take this death and difficulties
bad near step up then was like running
into a rare the Eiffel Tower it was
horrendous but we are working on unlike
hopefully if people need to we'll just
lay out I think this bonfires particular
heart because you didn't cover this
that's really helpful because that's if
I know exactly what's missing we can
easily go and say we need three
challenges on this let's make them push
the mesh and that's it um what I have
knowing that it's kind of like fumbling
around in the dark so feedback is
incredibly appreciated yeah I think
that's one of the important things that
Quincy set up with free code camp is the
transparency and the no barriers to
communication which is really cool
anybody can anybody knows what's coming
if you want to take a look at github the
with it with the with the whole open
source of the whole thing Quincy's not a
hard guy to get ahold of well he's he's
always happy to answer you sometimes he
can be hard to get a hold of but he's
definitely always have to answer you
could you could hold them so yeah I
promise you'll get a response for me I
can't promise you it'll be within 12
hours yeah instant messaging isn't is in
Quincy but definitely he will get back
to you so fortunes really which is
really awesome that you you know he's
not he's not like in the background not
doing any you know he's doing stuff but
he's not like not talking to you guys so
it's always engaging which is really
cool at least she'll know stuff's going
to get done or is it being looked at so
that's really cool and you know all
opinions are very valid I want you as
long as they put nicely and we are happy
to take them I'm happy to work on them
so even it like if you feel that you
struggle to HTML challenges just tell us
or try and fix it if we don't know we
can't do anything about it yeah very
well put for sure um I think I just had
one more question from you and this is
from Bri breeze list as well but I'd
really like to know and maybe a lot of
other people would Michael Johnson plays
a larger one FCC how did you how'd you
guys meet and and I guess exactly why is
his role absolutely I I think he'd be a
great guest on future programs so
Michael Johnson is our nonprofit guy is
what we colloquially called him a code
nonprofit in the handle right code
nonprofit yet not Ravi he's like vitally
important to all of our took these
nonprofits we have just a torrent of
nonprofits applying to have a promo code
done for them through free coke camp and
he basically manages expectations and
make sure that it's a good fit for our
campers because like we want to help
nonprofits obviously both our first
loyalty will always be to the campers
and making sure that they're working on
projects that are relevant and that are
going to be deployed in production
that's like our number one
because we don't want them to work a lot
on a project that's not going to see the
light of day yeah so Michael hint
manages those relationships with our
nonprofits he also does a lot of work
just in general on communicating with
them in terms of like new initiatives
like commit and he is like a huge vital
sounding board in terms of my wife keeps
closing the door uh huge sounding board
in terms like any kind of initiative we
have like the voice of free code camp
like how do we want people to perceive
free code camp obviously we're this
nonprofit a friendly open source like we
are an open source community first and
foremost that's it's like we're not a
coding boot camp we're not a just a like
a another resource like we define
ourselves as a community so Michael is
actively engaged with this community and
tries to understand the different issues
people are having and so yeah like I
would and he's also he also updates a
lot of our our databases with nonprofits
and things like that it's know he is
very much kind of the ethos and he's
thinking deeply about free code camp and
where we want to go in the future and
how we want the world to perceive us
yeah it sounds like he's also very
important for for campers who have
gotten past the halfway point and are
kind of kind of looking for their their
junior developing jobs or some sort of
projects to work on so you know Quincy
manages those projects directly like
yeah that's one of the things like you
may not see them as much but once you're
doing a non-profit project you're going
to be talking to them weekly we have
these weekly gotomeeting calls with the
nonprofit stakeholder with him or me or
both of us and also with the volunteer
project managers we have these agile
project managers who are keeping their
certifications
current by volunteering to any project
for us so we have kind of like adult
supervision like real project managers
make sure that things are conducted
properly so yeah he's he's very hands-on
during that process and and to all you
campers here ramping up toward
completing the certificates once you
have your full stack certification we
would love for you to do some nonprofits
and you'll be working closely with
Michael just another thrown point if you
ever have questions and I've had a
specific thing like nonprofit stuff or
technology behind the fire crackling
feel free to hit me myself and I just
said myself twice any of the kind of
attitude so I suggest me with Berkeley
and Michael Johnson with your specific
questions cuz la Quincy can answer
everything he's got a big influx of
stuff is a top tip anyone listening I've
been looking for a good quick answer
most of the time and one of us tree can
do can those kind of specific and quick
answer type questions yeah Septimus
glute which stuff as well i'm brianna is
there the queen of the hikes like yeah i
think i think anybody on this color here
can probably answer any sort of basic
technical questions or general questions
about free code camp i think we're all
pretty pretty involved in it to
understand understand what's going on
and in answer questions and then we'll
just kind of relay back up to quincy if
it's something that you know we're not
heard percent sure of what idea we can
also find out if we don't know so enough
finding out tanks sophie is redic test
we're not trying to get you away from
not answering quidsi questions but we
want to try to get you an answer quickly
so that's that way you have 56 resources
to aunt asked questions up so it's
definitely a way to look at it so I mean
I think that's all the questions I have
for you guys have more than one here on
Twitter um not sure how close we are as
far as time I think 330 is what I was
shooting for so we can go in and answer
all their Twitter questions now great
there's a couple of technical questions
but this one has asked if you've ever
gotten any feedback from employers on
the
there's a great one I'm sure we get
positive feedback from employers all the
time a lot of our campers are getting
jobs most of the whom haven't even
finished the curriculum some of whom
have the full stack certification and it
done some nonprofit like I think the
maximum a number of projects a campers
done before they've got the job is one
so I mean we get we get feedback like
one employer who hired one of our
campers said that I like the the woman
he was hiring seemed like she's encoding
professionally for two years and she'd
only been doing for cocaine for like six
months that is awesome that's awesome
yeah so we hear things like that all the
time we hear things for like th you know
professors at universities who like
computer science professors you're like
wow I'm gonna tell my students to do
this for practice outside of class and
stuff like that so it's clear that we
have a lot of buy-in from employers from
academia and we intend to continually
increase our rigor we will not become
like an easy program but at the same
time we want to make sure that free code
camp is viable if you put forth the
effort we don't want it to be we don't
want impossible jumps and difficulty
right now there are some very difficult
steps that we've already alluded to and
as we smooth those out I think it'll be
much easier for literally anybody who
has the time and energy to put in to be
able to earn those certifications and go
at me with those jobs that's awesome
that's good that's good to hear that
employers you know enjoy free code camp
so what I have one more question um so
in this past year of free code camp kind
of a journey from where it started as a
small small group of people what have
been some of the biggest surprises for
you whether curriculum based or
community basis you know what have been
some things that have really opened your
eyes that we're surprising
you want to take this one Berkeley he's
a meeting oh sure yeah you myself ah
sure one of the biggest surprises for me
it's just the amount of positive
feedback we get even why where you screw
up it's just amazing to music there are
other platforms that people could be
using but they come to us and like they
know i think sometimes will screw up but
we'll do our best to fix it and you
don't get that with a lot of other
platforms like there are still bugs that
and like i will mention the game but
they're so bugging some other platforms
that i've been there since i first need
them in january of last year so it's
amazing how slow these other guys move
with millions of dollars in funding like
it tells you that they're funding is not
going to make the creek on better their
funding is going to marketing
essentially mm-hmm another thing to
point out is we're open source and
literally anybody can submit a patch
like open source will always move faster
than clothes closed source yeah it's
just how it is like it when you when and
that was the big surprise to me because
we didn't start out as open source
because i was like embarrassed by the
code base you know is my first note jsf
but I was like I don't know Lisa's over
toward quite yet because who knows what
kind of criticism will fall upon me my
inefficient fila sorting algorithm
implementations and stuff like that but
uh we you know and another thing was I
had to purge the get history of all the
API keys and stuff that hardcore because
I didn't know what I was doing so I
figured out how to do that and then
berkeley help me and several other
developers nodejs developers from ron
san francisco that were in the
co-working spaces that are frequented
help me and we made sure everything was
solid and it was a big push and we knew
was a lot of time and energy to make
sure that we were ready to open source
but that was by far the smartest thing
we've done other than of course having a
chat from day one chat is vitally
important and I guess my intuition that
it was convenient
talking it helped and just instead of
trying to plan around all the
contingencies that people can encounter
just putting people in touch with other
people so that they can address those
like that that was you know huge
positive surprise was how well-received
chat is I mean we're by far the most
active community on get er if you look
at gators landing page it shows like
different chats popping up as they
happen and about a four drove more from
free code camp but becoming open source
and and the just the enthusiasm all the
people coming forward and you know
respecting free code camp just by virtue
of its success on github you know we're
one of the top I think we're the 21st
most starred project ever on github and
we're climbing rapidly is new new
campers come on board and they choose to
star us and people hear about as people
read our wiki which is getting pretty
good search engine traffic now all those
things like people will star us and for
car repo and play around with it so
becoming open-source definitely
surprisingly useful and I am astounded
that more platforms don't become open
source like I think like the same
platforms that Berkeley didn't want to
name names like they should consider
becoming open source definitely everyone
should be putting put out as open source
campers especially um don't be
embarrassed very coveted people in the
JavaScript community are so welcoming
and so kind and you'll see them people
on Twitter who end up bashing other
people's code people just pile onto them
and be like hey you shouldn't be doing
that Matt it's so messed up and dude get
out of here yeah because we want to
encourage people as much as possible did
you start coding yeah you know
necessarily true them onion sets us I'm
just going to say I mean you see
everybody stream on Twitch to I mean we
have a lot of different streamers
especially recently on twitch and you
know there's never ever been a time in
twitch chat I've been what how long
we've been doing this now Quincy for
four months five months I don't know
yeah well you guys been doing it much
longer I've never seen any sort of
negativity in the twitch chat ever for
anybody streaming
and it's always supportive always great
people no different ways of doing
different things that can be faster or
more proficient and so much like berkley
said it's a very very nice community
nobody should be afraid of their code I
want to jump in there since we are on
Twitch if anybody that's watching right
now are watching later on youtube if
you're interested in actually streaming
your own code well and have people give
you immediate feedback and help you in
the chat contact either myself or Leslie
the Septimus on git er i'm brianna marie
132 on twitter i mean obviously we'll
need to talk to you and figure out what
you're going to be working on but as
long as you're going to be doing
something JavaScript and you're going to
be following the you know code of
conduct for vote for free code camp it's
an awesome tool that we want you guys to
be able to utilize on the free code camp
channel yep I just want to add real
quick we're four hundred stars away from
being in the top 20 if you haven't start
us it'd be awesome if you go to github
real quick and give us that one star get
us closer to top 20 also I've been
really close to being 3,000 followers on
twitch to know it is watching this very
all of this please please do yeah what
are we like 88 down or did I see that
right know about a hundred seventy-five
75 Ben did you want to add that really
quick whatever you're going to say sorry
cut you all ah I go for that was ok
anyway I think was buu bond rate for the
points everything else master flash
gotcha well I want to get Freddie's
twitch Twitter questions so that way
everybody everybody who asked gets them
one other one that was really good is
have you thought about adding
preprocessors you can Jade sass to the
curriculum at all
yes someone says I'm Septimus freeze
there you go no did you guys hear my
question your face is frozen on the Viet
I thought I go back now you're not to do
that one again oh okay oh so messed up
all right I was going to say so the
Twitter question was have you thought
about adding preprocessors like Jade or
cast to the curriculum I think been
mentioned that earlier oh okay we we
definitely think they're useful um the
same time like learning gauge is is
really useful but if you're going to be
doing react you're going to be doing jsx
anyway so my sentiment is like focus on
learning HTML really well focus on
learning javascript really well there
are a whole lot of additional things
that you can learn that will give you a
marginal edge you can pick these up
generally like Jade isn't that hard to
learn you could probably learn it in an
afternoon it looks foreign but once you
understand how it works it's pretty
intuitive we use Jade right now in our
code base SAS and less are nice to have
I don't know that they actually do
anything that you could do with that
them but they definitely make your code
easier to read and maintain less is what
we use currently that's the JavaScript
centric one SAS is the Ruby centric one
and i believe we strapped for is
switching to saspa but that doesn't mean
we're going to necessarily cover it
because we only have like 800 hours or
so of course Rick ulam before the
nonprofit projects and we really had to
choose our battles we don't want to be
we can't be everything to everyone and
we don't intend to have a whole lot of
electives our intention is to have a
single very well done curriculum that
covers everything you need and then the
nice to have stuff you can pick up from
other resources that have like cool
one-off courses for example or maybe
campers will create courses we they
could fork free code camp and create
free code camp for sequel free code camp
for linux free code camp for
preprocess from sanh CSS stuff like that
we can certainly link to those on camper
news we can link to those on camper labs
if you just do free code camp calm /
labs you'll see some of the projects
that are our campers are building we
strongly encourage campers to buildings
and let us know about them because we'd
love the list everything you bailed on
labs and again we're trying to make the
curriculum much easier to contribute to
we're working on better documentation
for our challenge style we're gonna try
to make it easier to get free code camp
running on your local machine so you can
contribute of course you can contribute
right on cloud nine and actually I I
plan to record maybe a video of myself
just pulling up the curriculum and
changing it directly from cloud nine I
love cloud nine and I love just coding
in the browser it's so much easier to
get going and you can do it from
literally any machine any operating
systems so actually interesting thing on
that I think Berkeley was fair to me new
quincy oh I'll ago protocol whatever it
is has happened to lay its raising the
note much more efficient and actually I
noticed a while ago die free call camp
didn't use throne on earth did you c 1 c
9 for a while what was happening was
they would peg the processor and i would
actually crash occasionally and i was i
think it's specifically crashing the
globe watch it wasn't like destroying
the you can still use it for the gold
watch function i just died off but then
what happens it runs her to see even it
probably uses three quarters cpu if you
do obviously npm install its gonna peg
us but what doesn't crash um so like
things are indirectly improving all the
time and cleared man is dead handy tool
if you have you ate i want to pay for an
ide and you don't you can't afford
nighty and there if your internet really
bad and it takes too long to download 90
and there's lots of reasons why it also
is handy because i think you can use it
for a lot of other languages too i don't
think you're just restricted jr so if
you want to fill around it's a good
platform for just playing what stuff
yeah most i get sixty you can fix the
npm issue as well npm by default will
use
all the memory you can you can set it to
run only using one job job I'm not sure
with that entails but you just set a
flag max jobs one I think and it'll run
the lot slower but it will use a lot
less memory now all this bandwidth I
think we're probably about it time yeah
um unless anybody can see it yes they
were really good questions that can't
wait until next time if anybody does
think of any questions in the meantime
they would like to see answered earning
topics or think they'd like to see if
you use the hashtag free code camp fire
on twitter we'll be keeping an eye out
and looking for your ideas actually we
can pull questions till the next one as
well if you don't get them so like if
you want to get in free then it's gonna
be fresh on the next time campfire feel
like I mean go for sure yeah get
yourself in the door Ellie yep for sure
I think just so everybody knows kind of
a format that we're going to do with
this I think it went really really well
today learned a lot from Quincy and
Berkeley for sure about free clothes
campus if none of you guys knew knew
about the history history behind it or
exactly if you came in to this a little
bit late free code camp celebrated its
one-year birthday on Thursday last
Thursday that just passed and so it's
been trucking on for a year and
providing coders with the or I guess non
coders with a good way to learn how to
code and and so that's kind of what
we're here for and then basically this
kind of talk show is going to be us
three down here at the bottom Ben Briana
and me basically just kind of doing
different things so that way you guys
are talking about different web
technologies that way you guys can get a
better understanding of the advantages
and disadvantages of let's say angular
versus react or maybe any other back and
stuff like node versus the Django or
anything like that so we're basically
just going to be doing that along the
way so this kind of was a good
introduction one so that we can all
learn about freako camp
celebrate its late birthday and and then
do everything like that so I definitely
stay tuned i think we're going to try to
do these weekly at least if not a little
bit more so and if you did miss it i
think i'm going to export this to
youtube and some other platforms i'll
probably have to get SoundCloud and
stuff from you Quincy I wore a while yes
sir thing I hope you haven't sure that
okay oh yeah I'm just don't want that
saying is that next week I will be more
technophile or shipping them off
technical little a more technical
focused one yeah people are looking
forward to that may haven't got it is
coming and we will be using the straw
poll that we had going with ages in fact
it was still going that extremist got to
turn it off headed strap on all people
would like to see and effectively the
first second and tear that will be what
week or so everything will be done it's
just that was picking the order if
you're like yeah I seen wanting from men
code Danny and precalculus JavaScript
and everything that that entails for web
development and we won't be moving from
JavaScript if you feel there needs to be
a free code camp for python
acquaintances as well the times or
whatever your that you like yourself for
could make it and show it to us we'd
love to see it I'm bush at this moment
in time javascript is what we're using
it's also like if you want to look at a
statistic because some people are really
into the stack overflow survey for this
new year and had no jss tough most use
new language if it was like the most
being adopted hyper language if you like
and so you're a safe bet doing
JavaScript and the other thing is if
there's something I like to tell people
if you learn one programming language
you can transfer your knowledge quickly
enough the first one is always tired of
airing up from that point done is Lee
cheated relating what you know the
language already now to the new stuff so
like even if you learn to ask Ricky said
this is rubbish I hater I'd rather you
something else you've already got the
groundwork for your next thing and
unknowing more is never a bad thing
particularly for doing a job interview
if you say find out I know this or else
on a JavaScript it's it's a plus it's
never going to be a minus
and just to add to what then just said a
lot of our campers get jobs using
technologies other than JavaScript using
rails using high school all kinds of
stuff but they know how to use
JavaScript they know how to use nodejs
and and the employers are generally
confident they can port those skills
quite quickly to whatever the company is
using javascript lingua franca it's
definitely the best place to start and
if there was one language that was on
your resume like that's probably the one
that employers are gonna say well she
knows JavaScript she can definitely
learn XYZ so I do think if you look at
companies Netflix which is a really cool
combed every loss news no Jess for the
back end and react to the front end
Facebook of the reactor front end and
Twitter Gardens what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
