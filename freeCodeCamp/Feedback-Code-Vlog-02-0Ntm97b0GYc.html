monday and i'm looking for a portfolio
remarks that other people did about my
project about this portfolio page i
asked for the feedback on reddit
critique i also posted my project and
pickled top forum it's not easy to give
and get the feedback on designs because
it's very subjective however is really
what we're doing we're getting it makes
you better not just only it's the
designer but also the developer because
you have to find an implement all of the
new solutions I will look for some
inspiration on pinterest dribble and if
you could come from how others that they
in portfolio may eat something maybe
there will be something that will really
inspire me to resign mine portfolio I'm
not sure what should I changed exactly
because the comments are like you know
it's too big small about the same thing
it's too bright to dark so it's always
very subjective we have to be careful
with that
you
you
this Tuesday one of the co campers just
surprised me with the answer because the
person wrote that it's it's a pleasure
to work and to learn to learn something
it's better to learn from experienced
people like you and if he knew how
beginning level I am maybe human rights
and he continues as we beginners as we
beginner so i'm not i'm rather to can go
so deeply into the code thank you so it
was the response fall for my project
review so i did the code review of the
project and try to help a bit we
beginners very often underestimate
ourselves i got the same problem you
know practice makes perfect and also
practice helps you to get rid of this
imposter syndrome and whatever it's
called so everybody's starting some from
somewhere and the thing is to keep on
doing keep on learning and getting
better developers who have years of
practice but stay in the same language
and they do not develop there are also
beginners in other stuff they know more
they can connect the dots and learn the
new frameworks and languages faster but
still they are beginners so everybody is
a beginner and the other thing about
code society is that we share the
knowledge we help each other and that's
great so keep on learning practice and
we will be all experiencing something as
a result we can share all knowledge
cover ourselves and develop as a
community keep on doing
Oh
Oh
it's Wednesday yesterday I've been
revising all of the projects for
fronting certificate from free code camp
I've been changing about the colors in
some projects correcting accessibility
or changing up at the layout majority of
the changes were the results of the
feedback that I got sure in the
beginning you think of Kelly there
that's right I did a lot of work you
know everybody who's a creator loves the
work more than the audience the problem
is that we don't see many things that
other people see because they see the
project for the first time whatever it
is concerning the application is worth
asking the more you ask the better you
know the better your app can look oh you
crazy mother
ah
I gained my front end certificate the
first bigger fronting certificates in my
career joyeux picking the myosin is
really great it also brings fear and
excitement of the next steps and also
new challenges and another box that I
will probably need them my way thanks
isn'ta great
your FAFSA
it's certainly after the celebration day
comes the day where you have to focus
once again on what's next and what's
negative it's just the beginning of the
way I know that I achieved something
that was impossible 5 months ago the
more I know the more you know that you
don't know I also know how much is in
front of me and I'm more and more aware
of that which is great which is great
because you don't learn if you don't set
yourself for the challenges
Oh
to sum up a game of the story that I
want to tell starting from Who I am
going through what I do later how I do
it showing how I do it and finishing on
the option to contact me
huh
friday
I'm reading the documentation for the
new project it's friday in the afternoon
and soon i will be finishing this week
of work and I still haven't reached 500
points i mean the brownie points from
pick up camp but i don't worry about
that because still I helped other people
and I promise to reach these points
before starting react challenges today I
haven't done much on learning new stuff
I was analyzing the documentation for
that project I wanna get but it was also
kind of lesson to analyze the
documentation once again and write the
questions to a client so it's also
lessens the week is almost finished this
week I've been mostly iterating over the
project I've done before and I've been
giving and receiving feedback the
problem that I met this week was not
enough time for unexpected things
happening and the next week will be
quite busy because we had feria de
málaga in Malaga here so the whole city
will be having pourraient i also have
guests from home lands with kids so i
think that i have to plan it wisely next
week I'm going blind SAS and flexbox I'm
going to sum up my way to fronting
certificates on medium I will keep on
giving feedback and browning keep on the
way you see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
