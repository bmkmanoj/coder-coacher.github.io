designer Kim Thuy - hi so Kim is a
psychology graduate from the University
of Florida she works as a professional
photographer and she's in the process of
transitioning into products not so tell
us a little bit about your transition so
you were a psychology major you finish
school you're working day-to-day as a
photographer and you're in the process
of this massive transition which you've
documented in the story that's in the
show notes below very popular medium
article tell us a little bit about how
you started this transition alright so I
graduated from the University of Florida
last May with my sight degree and I was
planning to do a master program in
medical sciences before I apply into a
medical school and then just halfway
into the process I was just thinking
like I mean this just doesn't feel right
you know and at the time I actually met
somebody who acted like a little
catalyst in putting that idea of center
stage because I feel like the idea of
transitioning has always been in the
back of my mind but I've done a pretty
good job at just pushing it away and
saying no no no medicine it's my
medicine it's right so when I met this
person a little quick story about him he
was a finance major he graduated and I
hate the two years and you know working
for finance and then he decided he hates
it and then he went back to school for a
computer science degree another four
years so when I met him he was about to
graduate with his second degree and at
that time he found he took a developing
class and he realized wow I love coding
and then he started like just putting
endless hours into just putting in like
getting the projects done and I'm flying
for jobs and all that stuff super
ambitious and that motivated me we call
it because like I saw how
I guess the strong he was and wasting so
much time in school and everything and I
thought to myself yeah you should start
being honest with yourself right now you
know and you're lucky enough to know
what you want to do so do it
awesome so so you met somebody who had
been down the wrong road basically or
gone through a big detour and that
inspired you to evaluate the decision to
move into product design and you've been
thinking about doing product design
before that had you've done any actual
park design or visual design or UX
design or anything like that yeah so
I've always kind of had some dabble in
this was designed like fun story is that
when I was in middle school I actually
during my space days right I actually
had a layout site where I designed some
kind of like layouts for people to use
and I actually reach over 80,000 friends
on there of people who wants to use my
layout and stuff so I kind of dabble in
design just were a little bit just to
check it out just to do just for funsies
this isn't back in middle school so it
was not like legit or anything and then
in college some organizations that I was
in with like needed my help with
designing some graphics and stuff so I
did that a little bit but it was nothing
serious but so yeah so just a little bit
of dabble in it but nothing too serious
right and was so you're already been
doing design you said you already had a
successful tool that a whole lot of your
friends were using did you say 80,000
yeah that's crazy
okay that's crazy success for middle
school because I was on MySpace and I
didn't really like any of the layouts
they had you know it's not like Facebook
where everybody looks the same but
myspace you can actually like have your
own layouts so I'm like I'm gonna make
my own I'm gonna learn how to code just
a little bit in middle school and then
just let me just provide it for other
people too so eventually it got to
80,000 plus and then every day I got
like an influx of 100 plus friend
I know eventually I'm just like okay I'm
doing so I just gave the sight away to
somebody that I think would you know
benefit time Wow
so that's a that's a pretty crazy story
so does that like factor in your when
whenever you're designing things do you
you think back to that initial success
like whenever you feel like a setback or
something do you reach back there or a
positive memory yeah yeah this is
actually um part of my process in
deciding oh what do I want to do now it
is not medicine and I kind of just look
back until when I was younger and I'm
like what did I do that I really enjoyed
that was like influenced only by me that
I did it because I wanted to that I
enjoyed not because of family pressures
or social pressures or any of that and
it was designed so was it a hard
decision for you to I mean you've
already spent four years learning
psychology you're getting ready to go
into medical related field was it a hard
decision was it hard to tell your family
and convince your friends that you
weren't crazy yeah so after I met that
person right and I he inspired me in a
way I don't think he knows but he did I
that inspiration led me to have a real
talk with myself like an honest real
talk and I'm like so why do you want to
be a doctor why do you want to be a
surgeon and I'm like and of course
everybody will say yes I like to help
people and I'm like and I said the same
thing you know but I'm like maybe it's
just cuz I'm a good person and then the
other reasons start to surface and the
two big reasons was one family and two
pride
so with family my family originated in
Vietnam you know I was born there my
grandparents they had seven kids and
when my grandpa he pretty much emigrated
over to America he was able to take the
younger of the siblings of my mom's
sibling with them and being the second
else like the oldest she was left behind
so she was also the second-to-the-last
to come to America so all my aunts and
uncles came to America and was able to
get like a college education and become
successful well my family came really
late so my parents had me and my older
sister they kind of just went to the
nail industry and just did all that so I
felt it was part of my duty to you know
like move on style we're getting family
honor yeah you know by being a doctor
because there was just so much family
pressure you know like I want to prove
that even if we didn't come to America
just as soon and my parents didn't have
the education we're still just that's
great you know because within the family
culture especially Asian culture super
super competitive aunts and uncles are
always like bragging about their kids
and stuff so I wanted to like defend my
parents in a way you know so it's family
pressure they've never openly told me
you need to be a doctor I was blessed
enough to have parents that was like do
what you want you know as long as you're
happy but I can tell how like happy they
were when I chose the medical route yeah
that made it even harder to say oh
nevermind well it's interesting because
I talk to I talk to doctors who are
transitioning into software development
I I have a friend who went to medical
school and he never practice he just
immediately instead of going to
residency he started doing software
development he works at uber now as a
software engineer doing machine learning
stuff so I can imagine like if you had
gone and spent four years going to
medical school and maybe even four to
six years doing residency F word and
then you'd have so much momentum in that
direction to be very hard to transition
yeah so I had a talk with my parents you
know after this transition it was pretty
bad
but now it's great they finally finally
understand that what they want and what
I want is actually pretty similar they
want me to have a career where I can be
successful and take care of myself and
you know
and that's also what I want and I can
definitely I guess proof to the rest of
our family how great my family is
without being a doctor you know and so
we're on this high now of this openness
and no longer any of us understandings
well what advice would you have for
someone who's in a similar position
maybe they because you know doctor is a
very esteemed status within almost all
societies and it's in America it's it's
very well paid and you have access to a
whole lot of opportunity you can live
basically anywhere what advice would you
have to somebody who has maybe been like
pushed through family pressure or has
just kind of pursued that because they
think that's what success looks like but
secretly has the desire to do something
in a creative field like product design
Hey
so advice definitely first be honest you
know be honest with yourself you need to
ask yourself why do I really want to be
a doctor or whatever the profession is
like is it are you doing it because you
intrinsically want to do it or is it
because of external pressures and I
think once you start asking yourself
that question other doors start opening
then you start oh what else do I really
enjoy doing and stuff like that so be
honest with yourself but then be honest
with all the people that cares about you
because at the end of the day you guys
all want the same thing you know you
they want you to be happy they want you
to succeed and you want to succeed and
you want to be happy so common goal it's
just you just need to bridge the gap you
know talk to each other and stuff like
that because once your family members or
your friends and everybody that you care
about pretty much get on board or hear
how much you want to do whatever it is
you want to do then it's gonna help you
like it's gonna pretty much motivate you
to do more so just be honest and I'm
gonna be real working out that it's
gonna be difficult at first it's gonna
be difficult having
talk with yourself cuz you're gonna be
like but I have been wanting to do this
for the longest time I already told
hundreds of people who wanted to be a
doctor and I can't go back on my word
now you know but that doesn't matter so
just be honest with yourself and then be
honest with the people you love I know
it'd work out awesome let's talk a
little bit about your massive redesign
of Instagram for those of you who
haven't read the article again I'll link
to it below I strongly recommend you
read this article almost a hundred
thousand people have read it is an
incredible comprehensive redesign of
user experience aspects of the Instagram
mobile app how did you go about doing
such an ambitious project and like where
did you start
oh that's a hard question so this idea
came to me actually in November but this
was when I was still taking classes so
it just I just left it there to marinate
cuz I'm like you can't start anything
until you finish your classes and go out
with a bang you know finish all the
crisis caches and in that last academic
semester awesome and then you can just
you know go to your design stuff so I
started this project this year in
January so it took me it took me roughly
two months to get it done and it was a
learning process for me because I was
like okay so you made this transition
and how should you go about learning
design now and originally earlier this
year I kind of designed our a little
curriculum for myself I was like okay
this week you're gonna learn color and
grid and layout and all that stuff and
then next week you're gonna learn both
sketch and principle in Photoshop and
then next week you're gonna wrap it all
up and you know so it was gonna be like
a day today in a week and that was not
perfection inside talking and whoever is
watching right now
you know just don't do that you're gonna
psyche yourself out by trying to be so
perfect you know and honestly the
learning process is never perfect my
advice and this goes into my redesign
process is that you should just throw
your self into the water and start
learning how to swim because I think
that's the best way to learn so that's
why I said this redesign process was a
learning process for me because I wanted
to learn how to conduct user research
how to make flowcharts how to analyze
those status how to use sketch how to
use principle to enemy in auto stuff so
I want to start on beginning to end and
learn everything as I go along
so instead of just learning all about it
and then apply I wanted to learn and
apply simultaneously together so
basically just in time learning as you
need something as you need it to use
sketch to build something I think they
learn Photoshop as you need in color
theory so you can come up with a color
scheme that's yeah you could often learn
those things exactly because I feel like
when you're doing that you just remember
better rather than Oh what was that I
learned the other week that I can apply
now you know you just plus you're just
more motivated to because you need to
learn that to get your prize like your
project rolling you need to learn
whatever it is that you're trying to
learn to finish your project so for you
you're a professional photographer
you're flying around and like photo
you know photographing people's events
and yeah like that and so you found time
to kind of settle over this over the
course of this two months did you sit
down and learn things and the entire
redesign process took about two months
you said roughly two months yeah about
how many hours a week would you say you
were working on it it varies from
beginning to end because in the
beginning I kind of sat down and start
writing out questions I wanted to ask
people or a user research and then I
have to start contacting to
people today set up a video call to talk
to them and some days where I'm like
okay I just talked to five people I
can't talk anymore you know
and so some days I took it slow some
days I take it you know I'm like all
right let's just do ten people today get
it done 15 whatever and then towards the
end from when I open sketch all the way
to the end I was when I put into most
hours I'm just at my laptop probably I
wake up early around 7:00 and then
probably until like 10:00 at night I'm
just on my laptop just doing work so I
don't know how many hours that is but
roughly two months of from 7:00 to like
10 or 12 to 10 Wow yeah in beginning it
was a lot more like easy because I'm
just like just talking to people trying
to understand what they think about
Instagram and all that stuff and then
towards the end with more technical
skills so I really just have to sit at
my table and start wire framing so about
how much user research like what
percentage of the time when you say was
user research versus actually creating
the functional prototypes
oh so Alyssa it took about maybe 30% 30%
and then the rest was just analyzing the
user data then I start a da ting and
then opening sketch thing like the
design itself and then animating that
took a while and then Karina mock-ups
writing up the case study would take up
the rest of the 70% so what was the
hardest process the hardest part of this
process for you
definitely the animating part because
sketch wasn't as hard because there's
actually a lot of YouTube videos on
sketch on YouTube YouTube video on
YouTube so there's more resources for
you to learn sketch but the animating
program I use was principal and I don't
think there is as much and some of the
things I want to learn there's no video
long so I just have to keep like trying
to figure it out I was sitting at my
laptop like
why isn't this doing what I want it to
do so that was the hardest part plus
when I was um learning sketch I already
had some knowledge of Photoshop so it
wasn't as hard of a transition but using
principle was completely clean slate and
it was definitely a lot harder and then
the second hardest part was probably
making a mock-up like I didn't know how
to convert movie files into a tiff file
and then sometimes when I didn't know
that you can also do that on Photoshop
how fun fact is that you can actually
open video files on Photoshop I didn't
know that and then frame by frame yeah
and then you can bring it over to Jeff
but I don't want this one day I was at
my laptop and I was taking forever to
like optimize to load and then all of a
sudden after a long time of waiting from
converting it to my flour to chips
if I only had an error message and I'm
like what you know and then I start
googling like what is going on okay if I
what if I was too big how do I make it
smaller so I just these are the things
you learn underway Wow it's terrible
it's just terrible that was the worst
part that was the part lemonis like
sitting at my table I'm like you've got
to be kidding me at what point did you
really feel you were picking up momentum
and that you kind of saw the light at
the end of the tunnel I see there was
definitely two two times like the first
time was when I open a sketch file my
first time creating a sketch file are
the ones I created I just start I just
just picked up page and it gets all
right now in the next screen the next
screen the next idea because before that
already did like a disguting process so
I know how it looked and everything but
now I need to make it like more concrete
so that's when sketch happened more like
it just started and just kept rolling
and then I think the next part was a
couple of days before I actually
published
case study I was on Instagram and then
all of a sudden I saw Instagram just
launched a new feature you know there's
new swiping feature and I was like oh my
god no I had a heart attack cause I'm
like they just launched the feature that
I was trying to launch and I had like a
massive heart attack and I'm like no and
then I finally record that is there a
caption and it was actually not the same
feature it just had the same like
gesture the swiping so I kind of calmed
down like okay so I didn't ship too late
but after seeing that I'm like I need to
get this case study out right now before
I Instagram pull another one over me and
right after that happened I spent
ridiculous hours just sitting at my
laptop until it's done like originally I
was trying to publish it like at the end
of that week but then after seeing that
I'm just like yeah I need to get out
right now so I got it done within two
days so the loss a lot of sleepless
nights after that Wow and so what keeps
you motivated throughout this process I
mean there were you just set up to do
this did you do it would you say it was
primarily as a learning experience or
what was your general goal when you set
out on this big ambitious redesign yeah
so it was definitely a learning process
for sure I needed to add something to my
portfolio and since my part of my goal
is to work for Instagram as a product
designer I figured I need to offer them
something you know so I'm like how do I
do that and I'm like oh I can show them
how much I know about what they stand
for about what their app is all about
and here's how I can contribute you know
so the idea of maybe if Instagram see
this that I can potentially get out
there or and that to this is gonna help
me grow a lot put me through awesome as
Instagrammer as anybody reached out to
you about a possible contract work or
positions yeah so
I've been getting a lot of emails from
various startups and companies that
wants to hire me or just have a
conversation to see how I can contribute
to their company and so I've been
talking to them but I haven't heard
anything specifically from Instagram I
one of their product designer actually
messaged me through Instagram direct
message and he said that the article was
shared at Instagram and it inspired
sparked a conversation sparked an
interesting conversation and I'm like oh
tell me more
I'm waiting to hear back from him to
tell me more about what this
conversation was and I'm like how cool
is that to be in a room with all these
creative talented people and Washington
magic happens so that's my goal to be in
that room one day so hearing that from
him it was actually the most fulfilling
moment so far of this whole like this
whole I don't know borrow since this
article has been like online reaching
over a hundred thousand people but that
was the best moment just from a single
individual person working at Instagram
and I'm like maybe I have a chance
yeah well that's so amazing
so to put things in perspective for
everybody who's watching and Kim
sat down spent two months working on
this redesign grappling through all this
ambiguity associated with a massive
redesign she talked to the users figured
out ways that it could be improved she
did all this on her own volition on her
own budget and she produced this case
study she converted him to an article we
published it on free cooking it's medium
publication and publicized it heavily
and a lot of people heard about it then
she got a whole lot of interested
perspective employers and even a
conversation triggered it Instagram
itself so I mean what do you think this
says to a typical person who's
interested in breaking into product
design or really any form of design or
development well I say that this should
definitely give you hope
because something like I believe in
someone really close to me one of her
favorite quote is I can and I will and
this is exactly that you can and you
will you just need to make sure you find
a passion for it your make sure that
your motivation is genuine you know like
why you want to do it and then just do
it because earlier when you asked for
advice part of my advice was to be
honest with yourself and to the people
that you care about but a second part of
that advice is to just start and like
that I mean just if start by if you
there's an idea in the back of your mind
to maybe do something else look into it
don't don't push it back look into it
you might either discover that oh no
this is actually what I want to do or
the new idea is right you at least get
to cross it off you know so at least
look into it and then once you look into
it just do your research and start
because I've been getting a lot of
emails asking me like where do I go now
and my advice would be to throw yourself
into your project and just start
learning and the best way to do that is
YouTube YouTube is great in Google
search is great you know ask just asked
a lot of questions if you need if you're
trying to learn how to do something ask
Google read all the articles and
especially read the articles on medium
they're great you know because that's
what I did there wasn't anyone that was
really helping me at the time and I just
need to figure out a way to do it myself
so I just read all the articles on
medium and oh there's a great book that
I read called don't make me think yeah
feeling Krugman yeah yeah and that's a
great book so read into that we read a
lot of that and then just throw yourself
into your project and I did a redesign
because I really cared about this
company and I want to show them away
that I can give back and I was
passionate about it so if you want to do
a redesign we design an application
or a website or something that you care
about because that will motivate you or
you can just completely do your own idea
because that's my next project I'm gonna
do my completely own idea and let it
motivate me further so just start don't
don't go like yeah maybe I'll push it
another day or let me just weed a bunch
of stuff and then do it no just start to
start today you know at least that if
you did it and you realize you don't
want to do it you can go back to doing
whatever you want to do because the
longer you push it off it's just not
gonna go well well thank you for that
sage advice just start Thank You Kim so
much for joining us mm-hmm and everybody
who's watching check out her article
below follow her on Instagram and she
