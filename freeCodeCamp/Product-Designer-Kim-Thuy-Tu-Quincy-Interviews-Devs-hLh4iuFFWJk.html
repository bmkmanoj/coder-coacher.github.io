designer Kim 32 hi so Kim is a
psychology graduate from the University
of Florida she works as a professional
photographer and she's in the process of
transitioning into products not so tell
us a little bit about your transition so
you were a psychology major you finish
school you're working day to day as a
photographer and you're in the process
of this massive transition which you've
documented in the story that's in the
show notes below very popular medium
article tell us a little bit about how
you started this transition all right so
I graduated from University of Florida
last May with my sight degree and I was
planning to do a master program in
Medical Sciences before I apply into a
medical school and then just halfway
into the process I was just thinking
like this just doesn't feel right you
know and at the time I actually met
somebody who acted like a little
catalyst in putting that idea of center
stage because I feel like the idea of
transitioning has always been in the
back of my mind but I've done a pretty
good job at just pushing it away and
saying no no no medicine it's my
medicine is right so um when I met this
person a little quick story about him he
was a finance major he graduated and I
hate the two years and you know working
for finance and then he decided he hates
it and then he went back to school for a
computer science degree another four
years so when I met him he was about to
graduate with his second degree and at
that time he found he took a developing
class and he realized wow I love coding
and then he started like just putting
endless hours into just putting in like
getting the projects done and applying
for jobs and all that stuff super
ambitious and that motivated me we call
it because like I saw how i guess the
strong he was and wasting so much time
in school and everything and I thought
to myself yeah you should start being
honest with yourself right now you know
and you're lucky enough to know what you
want to do so do it awesome so so you
met somebody who had been down the wrong
road basically or accountant through a
big detour and that inspired you to
evaluate the decision to move into
product design you've been thinking
about doing product design before that
has you've done any actual park design
or visual design or UX design or
anything like that yeah so I've always
kind of had to dabble in this with
design like fun story is that when I was
in Middle School I actually during my
space days right I actually had a layout
site where I designed some kind of like
layouts for people to use and I actually
reach over eighty thousand friends on
there of people who want to use my
layout and stuff so I kind of dabble in
design just were a little bit just to
check it out just to do just for funsies
this isn't back in middle school so it
was not like legit or anything and then
in college some organizations that I was
in Wicca like needed my help with
designing some graphics and stuff so I
did that a little bit but was nothing
serious but um so yeah so it's just a
little bit of dabble in it but nothing
too serious right and was so you're
already been doing design you said you
already had a successful tool that a
whole lot of your friends were using did
you say 80,000 yeah that's crazy okay
that's crazy success for middle school
yeah I was it was funny cuz I why cuz I
was on MySpace and I didn't really like
any of the layouts they had you know
it's not like Facebook where everybody
looks the same but myspace you can
actually like have your own layouts so
I'm like I'm gonna make my own I'm gonna
learn how to code just a little bit in
middle school and then just let me just
provide it for other people too so
eventually it got to 80,000 plus and
then every day I got like an influx of
100-plus friend request and I went to
I'm just like okay I'm doing so I just
gave the site away to somebody that i
think would you know benefit time wow so
that's a that's a pretty crazy story so
does that like factor in your when
whenever you're designing things do you
think back to that initial success like
whenever you feel like a setback or
something you reach back there or a
positive memory yeah yeah this is
actually um part of my process and
deciding Oh what do I want to do now it
is not medicine and I can't just look
back until when I was younger and I'm
like what did i do that i really enjoyed
that was like influence only by me that
I did it because I wanted to that I
enjoyed not because of family pressures
or social pressures or any of that and
it was designed so was it a hard
decision for you too I mean you've
already spent four years learning
psychology you're getting ready to go
into medical related field was it a hard
decision uh was it hard to tell your
family and convince your friends that
you weren't crazy so um after I met that
person right and I he inspired me in a
way I don't think he knows but he did I
that inspiration led me to have a real
talk with myself like an honest real
talk I don't like so why do you want to
be a doctor why do you want to be a
surgeon and I'm like and of course
everybody will say yes I like to help
people and I'm like and I said the same
thing you know but I'm like maybe it's
just cuz I'm a good person and then the
other reasons start to surface and the
two big reasons was one family and to
pride so with family my family
originated in Vietnam you know I was
born there um my grandparents they had
seven kids and when my grandpa he pretty
much immigrated over to America he was
able to take the younger of the siblings
of my mom sibling wisdom and being the
second else like the oldest she was left
behind so she was also the sec
and um to the last to come to America so
all my aunts and uncles came to America
and was able to get like a college
education and become successful while my
family came really late so my parents
since it had me and my older sister they
kind of just went to the nail industry
and just did all that so I felt um it
was part of my duty to you know like
move on style we getting family honor
yeah you know by being a doctor because
there was just so much family pressure
you know like I want to prove that even
if we didn't come to America just as
soon and my parents didn't have the
education we're still just as great you
know because within the family culture
especially asian culture super super
competitive aunts and uncles always like
bragging about their kids and stuff so I
wanted to like defend my parents in a
way you know so his family pressure
they've never openly told me you need to
be a doctor I was blessed enough to have
parents that was like do what you want
you know as long as you're happy but I
can tell how like happy they were when I
chose the medical row yeah that made it
even harder to say oh nevermind well
it's interesting because I talked to I
talked to doctors who were transitioning
into a software development um I have a
friend who went to medical school and he
never practiced he just immediately
instead of going to residency he started
doing software development he works at
uber now as a software engineer doing
machine learning stuff so i can imagine
like if you had gone and spent four
years going to medical school and maybe
even four to six years doing residence
the f word and then you'd have so much
momentum in that direction to be very
hard to transition yeah so I kind of had
a talk with my parents own you know
after this transition it was pretty bad
but now it's great they finally finally
understand that what they want and what
I want is actually pretty similar they
want me to have a career where I can be
successful and take care of myself and
you know them
and that's also what i want and i can
definitely i guess prove to the rest of
the family how great my family is
without being a doctor you know and so
we're honest high now of this openness
and no longer any misunderstandings well
what advice would you have for someone
who's in its similar position maybe they
because you know doctor is a very
esteemed up status within almost all
societies and it's in America it's very
well-paid and you have access to a whole
lot of opportunity you can live
basically anywhere what advice would you
have to somebody who has maybe been like
pushed through family pressure or has
just kind of pursued that because they
think that's what success looks like but
secretly has the desire to do something
in a creative field like product design
hey so advice definitely first be honest
you know be honest with yourself you
need to ask yourself why do I really
want to be a doctor or whatever the
profession is like is it are you doing
it because you intrinsically want to do
it or is it because of external
pressures and I think once you start
asking yourself that question all the
doors start opening then you start Oh
what else do I really enjoy doing and
stuff like that so be honest with
yourself but then be honest with other
people that cares about you because at
the end of the day you guys all want the
same thing you know you they want you to
be happy they want you to succeed and
you want to succeed and you want to be
happy so common goal it's just you just
need to bridge the gap you know talk to
each other and stuff like that because
once your family members or your friends
and everybody that you care about um
pretty much get on board or hear how
much you want to do whatever it if you
want to do then it's going to help you
like it's going to pretty much motivate
you to do more so just be honest and I'm
going to be real right now that it's
going to be difficult at first it's
going to be difficult having to realtalk
with yourself
because you're going to be like what
I've been wanting to do this for the
longest time I already told hundreds of
people I wanted to be a doctor and I
can't go back on my word now you know
but that doesn't matter so just be
honest with yourself and then be honest
with the people you love I know it work
out awesome let's talk a little bit
about your massive redesign of Instagram
for those of you who haven't read the
article again I link to it below I
strongly recommend you read this article
almost a hundred thousand people have
read it is an incredible comprehensive
redesigned user experience aspects of
the Instagram mobile app how did you go
about doing such an ambitious project
and like where did you start oh that's a
hard question so this idea came to me
actually in November but this was when I
was still taking classes so it just I
just left it there to marinate cuz I'm
like you can't start anything until you
finish your classes and go out with a
bang you know finish all your classes
Kesha day's end it end at last I could
get mixed semester awesome and then you
can just you know go to your design
stuff so I started this project this
year in January to the tape loop it took
me roughly two months to get it done and
it was a learning process for me because
I was like okay so you made the
transition and how should you go about
learning design now and originally
earlier this year I kind of designed our
little curriculum for myself I'm like
okay this week you're going to learn
color and grid and layout and all our
self and then next week you're gonna
learn both sketch and principal in
Photoshop and then next week you're
gonna wrap it all up and you know so
it's gonna be like a.j today in a week
and that was how perfectionist side
talking and whoever is watching right
now don't do that
you know just don't do that you're going
to psych yourself out by trying to be so
perfect you know and honestly the
learning process is never perfect my
advice and this goes into my redesign
process is that you should just throw
yourself into the water and start on how
to swim because I think that's the best
way to learn so that's why i said this
redesign process was a learning process
for me because i wanted to learn how to
conduct user research how to make
flowcharts how to analyze those status
how to use sketch how to use principle
to enemy in auto stuff so I want to
start on beginning to end and learn
everything ex I go alone so instead of
just learn all about it and then apply I
wanted to learn and apply simultaneously
together so basically just in time
learning as you needed something as you
needed to use sketch to build something
they learn photoshop as you need to
learn color theory so you can come up
with a color scheme that's yeah you
could often learn those things exactly
because I feel like when you're doing
that you just remember better rather
than oh what was that I learned the
other week that I can apply now you know
you just plus you're just more motivated
to because you need to learn that to get
your paws like your project rolling you
need to learn whatever it is that you're
trying to learn to finish your project
so for you that you're a professional
photographer you're flying around and
like photo you know photographing
people's events and yeah he's like that
and so you found time to kind of settle
over this over the course of this two
months to just sit down and learn things
and the entire redesign process took
about two months you said roughly two
months yeah about how many hours a week
would you say you are working on it um
it varies from beginning to end because
in beginning I kind of sat down and
start writing out questions I wanted to
ask people or a user research and then I
have to start contacting those people
today to set up a video
all to talk to them and some days where
I'm like okay i just talked to five
people I can't talk anymore you know and
so some days I take it slow some days I
take it you know I'm like all right
let's just do 10 people today get it
done 15 whatever and then towards the
end from when I opened sketch all the
way to the end I was when I put in the
most hours I'm just at my laptop right I
wake up early around seven and then
probably until like ten at night I'm
just on my laptop is doing work so I
don't know how many hours that is with
roughly two months of from seven to like
10 or 12 to 10 Wow yeah beginning it was
a lot more like easy because I just
talking to people trying to understand
what they think about Instagram and all
that stuff and then towards the end with
more technical skills so I really just
have to sit at my table and start
wireframing so about how much user
research like what percentage of the
time when you say was user research
versus actually creating the functional
prototypes oh it's hard so Alyssa took
about maybe thirty percent thirty
percent and then the rest was just
analyzing the user data then I start a
da ting and then opening sketch starting
like the design itself and then
animating that took a while and then
create mockups writing up the case study
would take off the rest of the seventy
percent so what was the hardest process
the hardest part of this process for you
definitely the animating part because um
sketch wasn't as hard because there's
actually a lot of YouTube videos on
sketch on YouTube is that YouTube video
on youtube so there's more resources for
you to learn sketch but the animating
program i use was principal and i don't
think there's as much and some of the
things i want to learn there's no video
on so i just have to keep like trying to
figure it out i was sitting at my laptop
like why isn't this
doing what I wanted to do so that was
the hardest part cuz when I was um
learning sketch I already had some
knowledge of photoshop so it wasn't as
hard of a transition but using principle
was completely clean slate and it was
definitely a lot harder and then the
second hardest part was probably making
a mock up like I didn't know how to
convert movie files into a tiff file and
then sometimes when I didn't know that
you can also do that on Photoshop how
fun fact is that you can actually open
video files on Photoshop I didn't know
that and then you get another than frame
by frame yeah and then you can bring it
over to Jeff but I don't want this one
day I was at my laptop and I was taking
forever to like optimized to load and
then of a sudden after a long time of
waiting from converting it to Moscow to
Jeff if I had an error message and I'm
like what you know and then I start
googling like what is going on and if I
all the file was too big how do I make
it smaller so I just these are the
things you learn onda guey Wow yeah
right like an entire guide this kind way
it's terrible it's just terrible that
was the worst part I was a part where
I'm dislike sitting at my table I'm like
you've got to be kidding me at what
point did you really feel you were
picking up momentum and that you kind of
saw the light at the end of the tunnel I
see there was definitely 22 times like
the first time was when I open up the
sketch file my first time creating the
sketch file are the ones i created I
just start I just just picked up pace
and it just all right now in the next
screen the next screen the next idea
because before that already did like a
the sketching process so I know how it
looked and everything but now i need to
make it like more concrete so that's
when sketch happen more like it just
started and just kept rolling and then I
think the next part was a couple of days
before actually published the case study
on Instagram and then all of a sudden I
saw Instagram just launched a new
feature you know there's new swiping
feature and I was like oh my god no I
had a heart attack cuz I'm like they
just launched the feature that I was
trying to launch and I had like a
massive heart attack and I'm like no and
then I finally read her status their
caption and it was actually not the same
feature it just had the same like
gesture the swiping so I kind of calm
down like okay so I didn't ship too late
but after seeing that I'm like I need to
get this case study out right now before
I Instagram pull another one over me and
right after that happened I spent
ridiculous hours just sitting at my
laptop until it's done originally I was
trying to publish it like at the end of
that week but then after seeing that I'm
just like yeah I need to get out right
now so I got it done within two days so
the lost a lot of sleepless nights after
that Wow and so what keeps you motivated
throughout this process I mean there
were you just set up to do this um did
you do would you say it was primarily as
a learning experience or what was your
general goal when you set out on this
big ambitious redesign yeah so it was
definitely a learning process for sure I
need to add something to my portfolio
and since my part of my goal is to work
for Instagram as a product designer I
figured I need to offer them something
you know so I'm like how do i do that i
don't like oh I can show them how much I
know about what they stand for about
what their app is all about and here's
how I can contribute you know so the
idea of maybe if Instagram see this that
I can potentially get out there or and
that too this is going to help me grow a
lot put me through awesome as Instagram
or as anybody reach out to you about a
possible contract work or positions yes
so I've been getting a lot of emails
from various startups and companies that
wants to hire me or just have a
conversation to see how I can contribute
to their company and so I've been
talking to them but I haven't heard
anything specifically from Instagram I
one of their product designer actually
messaged me through Instagram direct
message and he said that the article was
shared at Instagram and it um it
inspired a sparked a conversation
sparked an interesting conversation and
I'm like oh tell me more yes done
waiting to hear back from him to tell me
more about what this conversation was
and I'm like how cool is that to be in a
room with all these creative talented
people and watch the magic happen so
that's my goal to be in that room one
day so hearing that from him it was
actually the most fulfilling moments so
far of this whole like this whole I
don't know borrow since this article has
been like online which is over 100,000
people but that was the best moment just
from a single individual person working
at Instagram and I'm like maybe I have a
chance yeah well that's so amazing so to
put things in perspective for everybody
who's watching Kim sat down spent two
months working on this redesign
grappling through all this ambiguity
associated with a massive redesign she
talked to the users figured out ways
that it could be improved she did all
this on her own volition on her own
budget and she produced this case study
she converted him to an article we
published it on free copious medium
publication and publicized it heavily
and a lot of people heard about it then
she got a whole lot of interested
prospective employers and even a
conversation trigger to instagram itself
so i mean what do you think this says to
a typical person who's interested in
breaking into product design or really
any form of design or development well i
say that this should definitely give you
hope
um something like I believe in someone
really close to me one of her favorite
quote as I can and I will and this is
exactly that you can and you will you
just need to make sure you find a
passion for it your make sure that your
motivation is genuine you know like why
you want to do it and then just do it
because earlier when you asked for
advice part of my advice was to be
honest with yourself and to the people
that you care about but a second part of
the advice is to just start and like
that i mean just if start by if you
there's an idea the back of your mind to
maybe do something else look into it
don't don't put your back look into it
you might either discover that oh no
this is actually what i want to do or
the new idea is right you at least get
to cross it off you know so at least
look into it and then once you look into
it just do your research and start
because i've been getting a lot of
emails asking me like where do I go now
and my advice would be to throw yourself
into your project and just start
learning and the best way to do that is
um youtube youtube is great in google
search is great you know s just asked a
lot of questions if you need if you're
trying to learn how to do something as
google read all the articles and
especially read the articles on medium
they're great you know because that's
what i did there wasn't anyone that was
really helping me at the time and I just
need to figure out a way to do it myself
so I just read all the articles on
medium and oh there's a great book that
I read called don't make me think yes
stian Krugman yeah yeah and that's a
great book so read into that we read a
lot of that and then just throw yourself
into your project and i did a redesign
because I really cared about this
company and I want to show them away
that can give back and I was passionate
about it so if you want to do a redesign
we design an application or a website or
something that you care about
because that will motivate you or you
can just completely do your own idea
because that's my next project I'm gonna
do my completely own idea and let it
motivate me further so just start don't
don't go like yeah maybe i'll push it
another day or let me just wait a bunch
of stuff and then do it no just start to
start today you know at least it if you
did it and you realize you don't want to
do it you can go back to doing whatever
you want to do because the longer you
push it off it's just not going to go
well well thank you for that sage advice
just start Thank You Kim so much for
