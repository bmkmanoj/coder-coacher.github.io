little bit about Adriana because she's a
fascinating person so Audrianna started
out she was born and raised in French
and France in Italy and she has over the
time transitioned from working in
business and entrepreneurship to
marketing for luxury and cosmetic
companies in New York City she worked at
Twitter through a startup that was
acquired by Twitter
doing advertising technology and
marketing and now she is working on
virtual reality and augmented reality
applications and she recently wrote some
articles about VR and AR that I've
linked to below if you want to read
along
she knows quite a bit about the topic
and that's going to be the focus of our
talk today so I'd Rhianna why don't you
tell us a little bit more about your
background and how you got interested in
VR and AR yes so I'm I'm Audrina hi
again everybody I am French
in Italian and my interest for VR and AR
dates from way before we're talking
about virtual reality or just I had
heard about it from when I was a kid
because I was always interested is in
making imaginary worlds and so on so
back then I would draw a lot write
stories and so on but what really
seduced me in VR is that I could
translate those ideas those worlds like
in a much more accurate way a much more
faithful way rather than a sketch or a
painting and so on so that's why I'm
into VI right now I'm working in VR and
in VR development in order to make the
our development as easy and accessible
to anyone who has ideas to just turn it
turn them into pixels great and
Audrianna you're currently working as a
consultant helping other companies build
VR and
our experiences is that that's what
you're doing right now yes I'm a
freelance spray designer I have Brandon
companies that either I can tell them on
their VR strategy when there is there in
you to this field or I help them build
their first VR experience from scrubs so
that goes from the creative side make
sure that they are these makes sense in
VR and they are technically feasible and
then it's about leading the design and
development with the Chiefs who build
the project awesome and you've been
interested in VR for a while what was
the main thing that really drew you into
VR what was the moment that you thought
oh I really want to get into this space
yeah so uh it was a few years ago I was
an exhibition organised by HBO around
Game of Thrones and at the end of the
exhibition they had oculus rifts and at
the time or Chris was not wasn't
acquired by Facebook yet so it wasn't
really well known I was curious to to to
try it but I didn't have a really high
expectations and when I tried to the
experience I keep you familiar with the
game of Thrones show so you you go on
top of the world and then the little
platform in inside which you're standing
like starts free-falling back into the
ground because there is a an invasion
from the what the what workers and when
I was doing this experience like you're
the platform you're in doesn't move
obviously but I had the feeling that I
was actually free-falling and my friend
did record me on video and I'm shaky
shaking and screaming so I was
breathtaking during the experience and
then when I saw the day of me life
forensic ly shaking as if I was holding
on to my life was like wow this is
actually really powerful where I can do
like just in 30 seconds like without any
training beforehand or like any warm-up
or preparation so
I decide that oculus rift was a bit odd
device at the time so I thought like
there's so much more we can do like in
terms of our building up certain
emotions and in developing them with
people and you've written a lot about
how a VR and AR like experiences we'll
talk specifically VR at this point how
VR is a very unique platform to develop
for you can't treat it like you treat
traditional kind of rectangular apps you
talk about treating it like you're
building an app that's a sphere you're
thinking of the spheres yes uh yeah so
it's not as simple as going from 2d from
3d because on the mobile development
there are a lot of best practices there
are a lot of things that we are used to
for instance if you want to exit a
specific screen or the application
altogether usually the exit button is on
the top left corner but in VR you don't
really have corner or like or frames and
initially I was saying that there's no
frame in VR but someone during a talk
actually corrected me and said it's not
that there's no frame it's the player is
the frame and the frame is our own
psychology and perception and
expectations even more so that VR is not
mainstream yet so we don't have best
practices and where to put the settings
menu and so on therefore one of the
challenges is on the user experience
build something that's intuitive but
when we have no past experiences to
refer to when so long and with the
ability to watch in any direction and I
do like actually interact and move
within an experience make sure that
everything is for instance easy to find
but the user is not overwhelmed with a
lot of options in settings and menu and
in one of your articles you talk about
how
even like the most simple thing that we
take for granted in and doing like a 2d
experience where you transition from one
scene to the next it's quite complicated
when people are immersed in this world
like do you just make the world go black
and then suddenly they're somewhere else
or do you create some sort of narrative
element like oh you get hit in the head
and you pass out and you wake up at a
new scene like how do you do that so
it's still a challenge today so if we
talk about cinematic VR and this cinema
was cinema so far has been designed for
a rectangular frame and directors are
have full control over what you see and
since you cannot see everything they
convert certain emotions through video
editing for instance if you move really
fast from one close-up to another you
know like it's a it's a tense atmosphere
like you we cook you have certain reflex
that you recognize but if we do this
editing like you change the perspective
and the field of the point of view in VR
and 360 video it will actually make you
nauseous because you're looking in one
direction and suddenly you haven't moved
but you're looking into another
direction and by the time your brain
adjust to then you have point of
reference then you have a very
comfortable transition therefore the the
best thing is to have like a continuous
and experienced and guide the user or
the player in the direction you want
them to look at while still respecting
the freedom like they're free to watch
in any direction so it doesn't have to
feel forced
and so with VR development you actually
build VR apps and what in your latest
tutorial shows people how they can
create a VR app in about 10 minutes with
Google cardboard and unity3d
can you talk about some of the most
common tools for building VR experiences
yes
in VR there's two main types of
experiences either it's a based on
videos 360 video and so the hardest part
is actually capturing this 360 footage
that you will be used and after like in
terms of app development you will need a
360 spherical video player I show you I
show you how to build a basic one in the
tutorial
but there's so you can either like make
your own or use one that was already
made through an SDK or like through a
partner and the other type of VR
experience are those when I
computer-generated some those like 3d
scenes uh like all like we're now using
real images it's all like maeda and like
through a 3d modeling software so the
two main tools that we would use are is
alike the Unity game engine or unreal
both are game engines like they are used
to develop mobile games console games
but then we can create the same same
that will also be used in VR and on top
of that scene will add the and will add
another layer that will be the PR layer
so in the tutorial it's the it's the
Google VR SDK that make sure it's
compatible with a headset and what this
additional layer does is it splits the
screens into two and add some fisheye
distortion effect so that when you have
this screen in we're added was the
distortion of lessons of the headsets
and your you have this illusion of
presence and perspective in
three-dimension was the the depth the
the fiber job like the perspective like
some elements are closer to you and some
very far and it's very similar than with
the 3d glasses that you can use in the
cinema and so on like your glasses they
have like there's a little difference
between the left eye and
right I in your brain calculate the
difference between those two eyes and
that's what gives you that third
dimension the perception of dips a lot
of people are probably wondering isn't
your development extremely difficult
like doesn't even involve all of the
typical skills that would normally be
associated with building like a 2d
experience but plus a whole lot more in
your pictorial you you kind of show how
just with a few tools which I think yeah
you know you had like a Google cardboard
you had an Android phone and you had a
unity 3d and you were using I believe
like C++ is the language that you use
deeply so it's C sharp so I picked those
tools because they were accessible to
anyone
unity is free um a Google cardboard that
you a lot of brands give them away and
they can cost less than $10 and Android
also like a really mainstream but also
it depends if you're building an
experience for HTC vive or eclipse
oculus rift but I've much more their
capacities are much more powerful than
Android a couple was a Google cardboard
so you have many more settings to take
into account but in terms of developing
the actual experience it's not that
different and difficult from what
already exists in terms of game
development because when you build your
3d scene ah it's small as the same scene
and the more the same assets that you
reuse you could actually build a master
project for like console gaming mobile
gaming and VR but the difference for VR
is we navigate differently we we have
different way to interact with the
environment and the elements for
instance if you if you want a console on
or on the phone then you can add like
screen overlay with your score how long
you've been playing how many enemies
you've killed and so on you can also do
that on VR but since
feels like you're inside if you have
some floating elements that give you
like all those information it can be a
little awkward and so on but technically
it's like it's a the beginning is the
same as the game development for any
other games it's just after like you
have to fine-tune certain elements like
interactions navigation input and
outputs of the player within the game so
yeah if somebody were theoretically to
just get started they had some basic
programming knowledge the tools that you
recommend in that article you think
that's a solid starting point for them
uh it's a is the the it's it's it's
basic in the sense that it allows you to
have something that you can build from
scratch from start to finish and that
you can show around to your friend
instead of like just doing step one of a
very ambitious project that will never
see the lights because it's still
difficult so I suggest like first
starting with a iteration with like
something small but that's always
achievable and it's always something
that you can show and then build
complexity as you go but if you're if
you like an experience game developer
it's actually a nice challenge to start
with a project you've already don't know
the platform like mobile or console and
then try to put it to VR so it may seems
easy at first
like for instance dropping some is the
SDKs for Google cardboard Samsung gear
VR oculus but then when you actually
test your game you will realize that
there are a lot of things that have to
be changed and something that are that
makes complete sense on a 2d environment
on the screen are uncomfortable are
difficult in VR so talking about some of
the things that are uncomfortable or
difficult in VR there are a number of
things that people speculate have kept
VR from becoming fully mainstream I mean
technically we've had BR since like that
early 90s I guess in terms of
just put on the headset being a 3d
environment
it obviously graphics have come a long
way since then a lot of other
technologies have improved but what
would you say are the main things that
are the main challenges that VR needs to
overcome who wants to be completely
mainstream like mobile phones are yes so
the first thing about the VR market is
it's driven by the hardware and today
the hardware has come a really long way
because when you put on some headsets
like HTC vive or the oculus rift you
have a real sense of presence a real
immersion into the experience
however the hardware is still limited
like for instance there's no standalone
VR headsets apart from like in for like
oculus and HTC vive therefore you have
to be connected to VR friendly computers
that doesn't work on any computer to
power the experience therefore anything
that you cannot you cannot experience
the are on any setting it has to be in a
dedicated space it's not really mobile
but those challenges are being currently
worked on and those challenges are also
limiting the software and experience now
because the software cannot go further
than that can only do what the hardware
halau allows it to but in order for VR
to be more in streams there need to be
like excellent compelling experiences
that will give like that will make
people excited about the future of VR
and for that there needs to be like a
close collaboration between content
makers creators artists and storytellers
with everyone working in tech and in
order to show to to the technology
industry what was needed to build the
stories and historically artists in
and the tech industry has not already
worked hand-in-hand so I think it's
pretty exciting because we start to seem
a great collaboration on that front yeah
and on that note so there suddenly
there's this big rush of new headsets as
you pointed out the headsets still need
to be plugged into you know a
Playstation or into a laptop or
something that actually has all the
hardware they're not completely
self-contained
but once they are self-contained and you
can just grab a headset off of off of
your dresser and put it on and lie down
and be immersed you think that that's
going to significantly increase the
adoption when everything is just a nice
uh self-contained unit yes so well we
always have a problem with the VR
headsets is like since you cut from
reality is it would be dangerous to wear
it in the street or anywhere where we
can collide with a car or someone else
but as soon as the our headsets can be
fully independent we can see some
interesting new scares emerge at for
instance watching a VR movie in the
plane or some training in certain
companies and so on so you can see like
a VR experience for 10 minutes and then
someone can teach you what's next and so
on
so making making VR headsets a fully
independent and standalone will give way
to our certain use cases that are
currently not possible with other device
with tablets phones smart phones or
laptops and that's how we can see like
adoption coming up and that brings me to
a our augmented reality or mixed reality
where people are wearing glasses that
present them with some information but
they can still walk around and do all
those things you were talking about a
second ago where you're not in danger
because you you still have a full field
of vision and you're not going to trip
over the dog in front of you things like
that and you've done some work in that
as well I know that you've built a few
Google glass applications back in the
day and you're very interested in some
of the new a
our tools that are coming out can you
talk a little bit about your feelings
about AR and do you think AR is going to
be adopted more rapidly than VR I think
I are in VR a very different instead of
different purpose so it doesn't make so
much sense to challenge one versus the
other as we see often in the media then
the VR since you cut off from the your
immediate surroundings you can be
transported somewhere somewhere else
with AR is supposed to enhance your
current experience right here right now
by adding additional informations that
could be useful or by mixing it up with
an imaginary elements to to challenge it
and make it more entertaining so AR is
very different in that sense that when
you build an AR experience you don't
fully control the environment in which
the player will use your app because and
it will be actually a better experience
its begin if you can use this elements
like to interact further with your app
whereas with VR you have full control on
like what they see you can make sure
that they use they use it indoor like
somewhere with a strong Wi-Fi connection
and so on but not with AR and therefore
with AR AR is useful if the experience
and is modified with how the the way the
user interact with it and so on by
adding contextual information like
points to directions to go somewhere or
if you get closer to a certain location
then certain elements are triggered that
are relevant to to the user so I think
in some sense that in in VR the user it
can be like very active and go for what
they want and explore words in AR in
some sense they can be more passive
towards the experience because the
experience should bring them to
contextual information at the right
place at the right moment and they can
be active towards what they're doing
outside
be up like in the activity that we're
doing whether they where I'm doing
fitness activities or exploring
somewhere new and so on so some of these
societal challenges to having a are
really catch on is a lot of people don't
feel comfortable being photographed
everywhere they go and I know that
Google glass was heavily criticized when
people started wearing it out on the
street and people were uncomfortable in
the subway when they saw somebody who
had a camera that was recording and yet
snapchat spectacles have been a huge hit
and people seem to love them can you
talk about some of the things that some
of the differences between those and and
why you think snapchat spectacles was
relatively well received yes one of the
reason Google glass doesn't find its
audience seem is from the night in 1984
fear like fear of being recorded all the
time and especially was the recent
scandals like NSA and so on it's a it's
a very prism fear and however so the
fact that there was a camera that could
record you in a very discreet way was
not well received
however we meet sometimes in the street
people with GoPro that are likely
recording or stuff such as spectacles
and that doesn't make people
uncomfortable and I believe the reason
why is because it's the GoPros or
snapshots as spectacles are associated
with things that are fun and playful um
GoPro is mostly used for
and export performances and so on
putting on a show like showing the best
version of yourself the snapshot
spectacles looks like any other
sunglasses if you're not familiar with
the device but if you are you can tell
when people are recording you because
there's the highly visible animation and
instead of having your red light that's
blinking to say that it's on it's like a
nice light that's rotating a bit like a
shooting star and so they're like the
appearance of a toy in or in most cases
or a gadget makes it to be like makes it
appear like to be harmless and just for
fun so I think in order for those
devices to be adopted there needs to be
like another purpose in that case the
fun i sharing emotions to that will come
like any like a compelling use case that
will engage people to adopt them share
what they want to rather than just give
them in their hands like this isn't your
technology you can do anything with that
and but instead package it as a as a
tool as a toy not your technology what
do you think some of the the use cases
for a are that people haven't really
discussed a lot lately like oh the
general public is still pretty new to
this idea but you're probably thinking
about the applications of AR all the
time what are some really useful things
that you think people will be able to do
what they are that they don't even
realize is possible right now or they
haven't even thought about um try again
took more about VR for the future but
with AR what I'm really hopeful is so
today whether we work on the laptop or
on a mobile phone or tablet we're still
watching a screen instead of watching in
front of us
so there's still this diarrhea between
us and the reality even though the
promise of the spot phone is the
smartphone can be anywhere with you so
you don't have to be stuck to your
computer but still when we are texting
friends we are not interacting with the
people around us and so on so I really
like I hope that AR will be able in five
10 20 years to work in a way that
doesn't it doesn't distract from reality
but it really enhance it it makes it
easier funnier to interact with but does
that doesn't add an extra layer on top
of it that I'd to do from from what
surrounded well I want to shift gears
here you are currently in Indonesia is
that correct
yeah very mother correct yeah I think a
lot of people have been wondering like
oh wow so she was in Europe and
then she was in the US and now she's in
Asia um you've traveled a lot over the
last few years and yes you work remotely
yeah I do yes
I I've always been very curious and I
always want to meet people who had like
different mindsets who approach problems
differently and so on with different
cultures and and therefore I've been
like Louis trying to go and like to
emulate going like their trouble in
different countries for that so I'm
thankful because what I'm the work I'm
doing now like mostly like I need like a
strong Wi-Fi internet connection and I
don't need so much to be in an office
therefore I am able like for like one
month couple like a couple of months to
settle down in a certain place meet the
local startup ecosystem some different
make VR players and so on and so on
and yeah so haha so it's messy like
leveraging the latest technology tools
so
in terms of communication in terms of a
video conferencing and so on I'm also
adjusting the time zone sometimes to to
make it work and this is something
getting more and more accessible today
yeah well awesome I'm thrilled that
you're able to travel around and it
doesn't seem to impede it it sounds like
it actually enhances your creativity and
your ability to get things done that
you're moving around so much in
interfacing with so many people yes
because sometimes so when you are at
this adds in the same place all the time
you go from your apartment from where
you live to the office where you work
you tend to repeat the same Sloat's
framework therefore if you have a
problem you will approach it the same
way over and over whereas sometimes
something just as simple like going
somewhere away for the weekend of some
vacations you are in another environment
therefore you're automatisms are
different like you lose your point of
references so that you lose like your
pre-made recipes and and and framework
and you think differently so I'm trying
to push it forward by trying to
understand how people work in different
places and so on and solve their
problems differently in order to try to
adapt it to a broader range of
challenges in some sense well we're all
going to be very excited to hear about
your next adventures and the projects
you work on and read some more of your
amazing tutorials of course if people
want to follow you where can they find
you on Twitter so my twitter handle is
at abramovich 8er
I am a VCC all right well thank you
again so much for joining us Adriana
it's been a pleasure thank you can see
ya have a beautiful evening yeah have a
good day bye thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
