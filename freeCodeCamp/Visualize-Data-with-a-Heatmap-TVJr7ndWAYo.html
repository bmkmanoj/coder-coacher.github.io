going to visualize data using a heat map
with d3.js first let's take a look at
what we mean by heat map one of our
campers built this graph of monthly
global land surface temperature from the
year 1753 all the way on up to 2015 now
the y-axis is the month the x axis is
the year and when we mouse over we can
see the year the month and the
temperature it was that month and how
the temperature varied from the base
temperature which was a point 66 degrees
celsius and the color is cooler or
warmer based on whether the temperature
was cooler or warmer and you can see
recently temperatures have been much
warmer for this zip line don't look at
the example projects code figure it out
for yourself fulfill the user stories
below using whichever libraries and
api's you need but give it your own
style and be sure to use the three to
build this project the user stories are
I can view a heat map with data
represented both on the y and x axis
each cell is colored based on its
relationship to other data and I can
mouse over a cell in the heat map to get
more exact information here's the data
set we use to build this as you can see
I'm using the JSON format or Chrome
extension to make this JSON pretty so
the data are year the month and the
variance from the base temperature up
here at the root you don't have to use
this data set you can use whatever data
appeals to you however you will need to
get it to conform to the heat map d3
format
remember that if you get stuck you can
use read search ask and when you're done
be sure to share your zip line with us
in our code review chat room and also on
Twitter and on your city's campsite on
facebook have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
