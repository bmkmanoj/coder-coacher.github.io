screen that we're good here alright well
we'll keep going and and people can turn
the volume up or something so yeah we've
been life they think it's getting better
okay um so go ahead to the whatever
challenge you want to work on I found a
code that works but it wasn't all me
okay figure out the code figure out
something that'll work compare with
other users to get what works for them
and then redo it enough time so that I
you know I understand what all the
little parts are and where they go and I
can replicate it okay ladder barely
audible I tried to hold on you were now
you're much quieter okay yeah well there
is a better way programmatically to do
it so let's go ahead and redo this
challenge so it's up here so redo and
and and let's talk about it so I tried
to sign up with Qatar by no verification
email yet all right turn it up more
split I'm hearing
alright guys I literally have it turned
up to it's turned up to 11 all right can
you talk again branna yeah okay just get
the sound ladder first then code okay
they want sound zoom your browser to 175
percent what is that that's 150 175
percent perfect can you guess can you
guys hear is the sound good
you hear me yeah I can hear you I'm I'm
talking to the people in stream yeah
okay desktop idea was all the way up so
what's that
ok
output audio
too okay keep keep talking and trying to
figure this out yeah right I know it's
like la la la la la okay yeah oh maybe I
need to yeah it's pretty ridiculous so
output device should be okay can keep
talking and I'll ask everyone if they
can hear you yeah oh I started out
really slow to you well and I still ran
into a lot of problems yeah you can hear
you're looking in the background because
people are texting me while I'm while
I'm streaming yeah my my text message
tone is Chewbacca so yeah well you know
nice it's better than it was five
minutes ago my system volume is all the
way up folks all the way up and my
microphone is down down down down so let
me try
we're finding out okay output volume is
all the way up oh ok output yeah that's
all the way up that's all the way up
everything is turned up so let's do that
do that
you
okay shoot me a message with your skype
name we're going to try skype people are
saying it's still not loud enough okay
how can i how can I in here yep yeah you
can just send me your your skype stuff
in there
alright
okay just one second Brianna yeah no
problem and Brianna sounds a lot better
now okay good yeah yeah is your mic
volume a hundred percent in the screen
hero settings that wasn't the right
button how do i check that um screen
heroes settings without your preferences
yeah settings preferences and audio yep
automatic gain control right now um you
may yes not seeing anywhere where I have
an option to adjust turn turn level turn
your automatic gain control our way it
says you may want to disable this so
yeah turn your gain control off okay
good okay is that helpful I don't hear a
difference but perhaps the stream does I
don't know we have to okay it's perfect
I'm getting reports it's perfect all
right ok so back to the coding area yeah
all right as am I too loud guys and my
can yer versus me pretty well
so let's talk about simple adding okay
all right so when I started programming
the what I've found is really helpful is
before you yeah I'm here can you hear me
hello can you hear me yes it was popular
it's really choppy for a second but i
think i think its back okay um so what i
found was really helpful before you
actually write any code just go ahead
and write and like some comments that
you think are the steps required in
order to solve the problem and break
each step down into the smallest unit of
work possible that you can so try and
get to the point where you're only doing
one thing ok so for here the first thing
being i have to i mean at some point I'd
want to have a loop that subtracts one
from num and returns that into another
variable so i would need to create an
empty variable enter minus 1 into the
new variable and then return that
whatever empty there that won't be empty
anymore am I on the right track um well
i would ask why you are subtracting from
num so remember is three minus two minus
one is zero right but zero plus one plus
two is three so your iterative steps in
that part whether you add or subtract
doesn't doesn't make a lot of difference
I mean you can do num- one and put it in
there but when you read that does that
make sense or would it make more sense
to say if I have a loop starting you
know with the might my iterating
variable is I and I set I to say the
first element in the array and then I
just or you know so input 12 right so I
set I 20 and then I go you know their
output equals I or plus equals I so plus
equals zero at first so it's zero then
plus equals 1 plus equals two it's kind
of a more intuitive approach to what
you're actually you're adding up the
numbers until you've added all the
numbers in some range together right
uh-huh yeah so until it gets too numb
instead of trying to subtract to get
every number and then add a whole nother
step of adding all those together right
scroll your screen up there
they use this fancy overlay and
apparently okay here we are so um so how
would you go about writing that loop out
go it go ahead and start doing it out
you knew you so we know we need to loop
right everything until I get to and
stays there because you want to say it
just yes it goes number and then oh
sorry go it go ahead and finish that I
got asked question it's not cheating and
in fact I'm going to go over that in a
later I keep keep tapping I'm talking to
the screen better and guns I'm going to
go or that because in fact if you do
this in like c or c++ the compiler will
change it in the object code to that
what you typed so um so keep going that
one more time not sure I'm following no
no no go ahead so finish your loop and
we're actually going to cover something
else I yeah we're going to cover a math
shortcut that that does this okay great
got me to go and do the next step 2 yeah
yeah yeah so you're you're in your lip
down so you're going to need some kind
of variable to increment or decrement if
you're adding up then you're going to
increment it so initialize variable 20
somewhere outside your for loop should I
set it equal to numb or equal to 0 I
would set it equal to 0 because if you
set it equal to numb whatever number you
get past it's going to start with
evaluate ok i want it to add one too
numb to every time it goes through the
loop right yes you want yeah you want to
add the value of I to numb too ok yes
there you go plus equals the value of I
so I know what that means vaguely but if
I was asked to explain it I couldn't how
do you explain that function it's
essentially num 2 equals numb t plus I
ok so that that is the same thing as
this
so because in the assignment operator is
going to evaluate the stuff on the right
side first and then go ahead and put it
into the left side so we can you can
actually shorten that down just
syntactic sugar and do plus equals I so
it saves it saves you typing alright so
maybe so then what what do we need to do
to finish this off we need to make sure
it returns what we're changing instead
of the original impact right so go ahead
and maybe test it and see okay now
before we submit this I propose that
there is a much better way to do this so
there is a little mathematical rule so
if you're summing up numbers and arrange
and this can be done even if they don't
start at even if it doesn't start at one
all right are you there yes I'm sorry
can you say that again my internet
really that was I didn't understand much
of that yeah no worries so there's a
much better way to do this so you can
actually some up any range really it
could be from 1 to you know 20 it could
be from 15 to 20 but consecutive numbers
so there's there's a better way to do
this so and the rule and I'll actually
let you type it out but if you have some
number right and you times it by the
number so if you times it by itself plus
1 right
and you divide by two it'll give you the
answer of the range okay so so I need
you can test this week it we can get rid
of the comment yeah I would like to do
that and return num dunt and this could
be factored out so and let's see if we
do get our expected output here so I and
this is what i was saying to someone in
chat if you put a loop in like that that
sums up a range of numbers and its
executive range modern compilers will
optimize your code and straight out
replace your loop with something like
this and there's a little bit more math
you can do you can actually just add
this same thing for your lower end so if
it was like some of the numbers five
through ten you know five plus six would
all the way up to ten you would do this
and then you would subtract out the
range of one through five I think it is
so yep cool I had no idea that was that
was even a thing so anyway the the court
really the core is write down some steps
first before you actually try to write
out code because as you're coding and
you're new to coding it's going to be
really difficult to remember all the
syntax and and remember you know this
structure and that structure and what is
going on here and is this a function or
an object you know which okay so if you
write the steps out then you give
yourself a checklist and then go off the
checklist yeah that makes so much sense
that's something actually I tried the
funds are the coder bite challenge after
this I just started that kind of process
because I was finding as I go through it
it's like I by the time i get to the
second step I don't even remember what
function i was trying to do in the first
step and like you said is that even a
function or you know what's the syntax
for that so yeah no I agree I think
that's a really good way to look at
these especially as a beginner yeah um
so let's move on
so that math shortcut that we just used
is there a lot are there a lot of things
like that for kind of kind of yeah that
you don't need to be good at math to be
a programmer but like the more general
and in my opinion and from what I've
seen and read the more general knowledge
base you have of maths your you'll be
able to take shortcuts that other people
just wouldn't know about but you'll pick
up those shortcuts as you keep learning
to code because like when yeah when when
you search for an answer on stack
overflow or something like that and it's
got 2,000 upvotes chances are it's got a
good a good answer just got a shortcut
if there is one and okay
so this one I started okay um like I
said I don't let me try and load I think
I tried to say what I worked on I don't
know if it makes any sense nope doesn't
look like it nope guess not okay so this
is another one that I was you know I was
trying to figure out an answer and just
looking it up because I felt like I
didn't even know where to start and so
four steps for this I would like to find
each word in the string identify the
first letter and then capitalize it and
there it's a function for that and
that's the two upper right perfect yep
so happy right right yeah it looks yeah
um so how would you find each word in
the strength I was thinking about trying
to use reg ex oh I wouldn't go with Ray
X on this one um so it's kind of a it's
kind of a taking a sledgehammer to
killing it so okay what is it so what
does our problem spec tell us um I
noticed that one of the things that
mentions is that words are separated by
only one space right so let's visit the
handy dandy mdn and let's go to string
right so you should definitely have the
mdn bookmarked and so you can see all
the other built-in methods that ECMA
gives you and there happens to be a
really awesome method right here called
split DC it uh-huh okay so let's give
that a read
okay split methods let the string to an
object string object into an array of
strings okay so that would be a good way
to split it into words yes and the
separator is optional if you don't
provide a separator it actually just
returns you the string as an array of
characters or it just returns a string
in one array object if you specify an
empty string it's going to give you each
character including spaces as each
element in the string and if you specify
a space it will separate on spaces so
let's go ahead and see how that works
alright so so let's return string dot
split and see what output we get first
right and you can see it converted it
into an array with the the string inside
right now if we if we specify the empty
string then we get including spaces
right now if we separate ansan spaces so
okay awesome so that's check yep
identify the first letter this one is I
know there's something where it's like I
can find the first position and if i
enter 0 yeah so you're you're thinking
of ray just just array syntax right so
okay one of the one of the things about
split is we have to assign it to
something so we're going to go ahead and
assign the the result of splitting the
string back to strength so now string is
an array all right so when you want to
access elements in an array remember
it's just it's the array plus the index
of the element you want so index 0
returns the first element of an array
okay gotcha so could try write something
that was like to uppercase string 0 well
what is to uppercase is that a function
or is it a method I don't know so we
have methods right and notice how notice
how these methods all have string
prepended to them oh they're so the so
if we go down in to uppercase and we can
actually sew or well I guess I clicked
on to lowercase so you can see a the mdn
is really good about giving you examples
of how to use so the string needs to get
so you need to specify the string and
then you use the operator on the string
so it would actually be more like this
okay that makes sense I didn't realize
that was the difference between function
and method I knew that's silly but that
makes more sense now yeah and it's a
minor is some minor difference they're
kind of almost the same in that you know
they're they say you know function a lot
of times and you know and they return
things and stuff like that but a
standalone function would take an
argument and then give you something a
method on an object still can take an
argument but generally it performs some
kind of function attached on the object
it's attached to ok ok that makes sense
mostly I think I get it ok so stream 02
upper case and then that want to return
that somewhere right well we want to
assign it right so because it's it does
so another thing too is when you're when
you're looking recalling stress so
returns the calling string value
converted the upper case but there it's
missing something here and I'm going to
pull up the standard object so that you
can see when you reference this in the
future so if we if we go to array and as
an example let's pull up sort all right
see these two words in place so in place
means that this will perform the
operation on the object that you called
it on so if you called string dot sort
and gave some sorting function it would
actually sort that string in place and
you wouldn't need to assign the value
back in order to retain the value if it
does not stay in place you need to
assign the value in order to retain it
so what that means is you need to do
something like this ok
okay that makes sense otherwise it would
just not know where to put it yep okay
so right now as it stands right now the
code can divide it into words and it can
take the first place of every place it
with the uppercase character of that
same right okay so will it what else do
we have to do still all right well so we
really haven't found each word in the
string it so or we have by sign into an
array so maybe we should
iterate over the array of words okay so
i would write so we just we just have a
string 0 and if you'd called string 0 to
uppercase this would uppercase the the
whole first word right so and we can and
we can test that so as you're developing
don't be afraid to just return stuff as
you're going along see what it does yep
yeah the most of the time processor
processors and memory and everything in
a computer remains unused don't be
afraid to use it you've already paid for
it that helps me see exactly like what
you know what I think it sang but what
is it actually saying right okay so we
need to still find each word
individually so are we going to do
something like split again to the each t
I would I wouldn't because you can use
array syntax to access the characters
that make up a word so and I'll show you
that in a second so let's go ahead and
iterate over the string array
all right yeah there go ahead and
iterate yeah it er I'm sorry the
connections mom it's okay it keeps
popping up i'm not sure why okay so
iterate over the stringer way over the
string array okay
okay so are you a little hesitant on how
to do this yes it just loaded for my
screen so I'm trying to pry my computer
process and now I'm trying to process it
iterate over the string array I remember
going over how to do that but i don't
remember exactly how gotcha
okay so when we're in there if we don't
need to make another f loop or anything
I make it to come while it goes through
there we just need to are we going to
try and separate the array into three
different drinks no it's already it's
already going to be separated for us
we're going to have each word now as
something okay so so string I is going
to be a word so oh I see and you can
return that and it'll it'll short
circuit the the for loop but you can you
can return that and you can see that
it's each string I represents a word
right ok ok so for string I every time
it gets to string I we want to take the
first character and capitalize it
because if we just do to uppercase of
string I it'll do the whole word right
ok so should we slice it no well yeah
slicing is probably good use here ok so
we want to now a slice a method or a
function um slices of method ok so would
slice and then I can do 0 or 1 no.02
uppercase
and then plus the rest of the string
would that work um I wouldn't slice this
here because that so when when you slice
you're making a new array essentially
you're you're you're telling you're
saying give me an array back that is a
slice of whatever ray I'm calling this
on okay and I don't want to make another
right and slice or a string sorry and
and you well you you are going to use
slice but for the first element you can
already get the first element just by
the zero index right okay how do I do
that okay so what if sring I string I is
the word to argue it right now right now
right so what is string is 0 0 is the
egg well let's find out it is yay okay
so then I can dress I didn't realize you
put the layer that was that way yeah and
that's a multi-dimensional look up so
like he do you have an array of arrays
and it can go really really deep but you
can keep looking further and further
down okay just by doing the little these
guys okay cool so I could do to upper
case here and that will return just the
a 2a wasn't uppercase
and it still should return it as a
capital a indeed good but now the rest
of the sentence is missing indeed it is
so and we don't want to return at a bar
for loop right so let's go ahead and get
rid of that and remember how I said we
need to assign the value of stuff so
let's all right and then in order to get
the rest of it then do we slice mm-hmm
good okay so slice starting at the first
character right but what is slice it's a
method so i need to say string slice
string okay and how do you give
arguments to a method right instead of
grekes so instead of brackets right and
if you don't know what to put inside of
it okay no crack right and if you don't
know what to put inside of it then the
portion of an array into a new array
object so begin and end right so begin
is the zero-based index that wish to
begin extraction and so if you omit
anything to it then it begins to zero
which would basically give you a
starting one unless you specify an end
right and if end is emitted slice of
stretch to the end of the sequence array
dot length so if you just give it right
so we want it to go to the end of the
sequence right and we want to start to
index one because index one would be
from here so slice would return
all of this yes okay does it I don't
know maybe we should let's get rid of
the to uppercase call here okay that's
probably screwed up good it did it it
did but it doesn't give us court every
word it does because we're iterating
through the word the array of words in a
loop so yeah now the only other thing is
we somehow need to extract these back
out of an array and put them in a string
so that it's nice to read right right so
there is a method and we won't we won't
look it up I'll just I'll just explain
it it's called join it's called join
okay and this this is an array method
alright and it takes and it takes an
argument based on what you wind them
with or what the separator should be so
if you don't specify a separator it
gives it a comma all right if you
specify and say that it's going to give
them that so that gives you an idea so
if you specify it with the space it
gives you your strings your string back
that was separated by a space that you
initially split off of so generally if
the split method is going to be used the
join method is usually also used on the
other side of some kind of function not
always for for a lot of the programming
challenges yeah probably but not like
don't don't always expect to call join
after split and you know further down
the road so okay so it looks it looks
good for this one maybe give it
something like
oh no yeah that's not going to work so
what what do we need to do we need to
add a method will it be after this what
no well I don't know we're going to need
to add a to lower case method I'm going
to try adding it here okay now there's
no lint yeah so make sure that they're
optional technically in JavaScript but
never never forget to close your stuff
out with semicolons um so go out and run
it and see what it does it did it it did
great okay so is it done I I don't know
is it done I mean I think it's done i'm
pretty sure anything i put here it'll
spit it out the right way okay so go
ahead and submit the code Oh what is it
going to do to it to a question mark uh
well why don't you run the code in check
oh it did it right okay good then it's
done
time period points not so great but it's
accurate so it's good it's okay do you
want do you want to say something that
you can do yes okay analyze code will
come down here and we'll grab our code
all right copy redo yep
so cheating basically this is why
everybody on here has great times for
everything they do yeah like completed
and lesson like 10 seconds yeah why did
I even add that function if everybody
just G it's it's probably it was
probably a what-if thing yeah great well
thank you for your help yeah do you want
to do one more sure yeah let's go on and
do the next one all right
okay next challenge next challenge yeah
I'm letting you drive so okay okay all
right let's take this church JavaScript
all right using a JavaScript language
have the function simple symbols which
is already in there take the string
boiler you passed and determine if it's
acceptable sequence by returning true or
false okay the string parameter will
have plus and equal symbols with several
letters between them and for the string
to be true it must each letter must have
a plus sign symbol before and after it
mm-hmm left to be false because the a
does not have a plus sign before or
after it the string will not be empty
and will have at least 1 letter that
must have plus side mom either side for
it to be true okay so I want to find
each letter character in the string I
want to search before and after it or
that which is a non letter character and
I want to be able to evaluate that as a
boolean right well you need to yep so
lame but that can really just be output
as a stream right what you're going to
return true or false true there will be
an if loop included in here there will
be an if conditional yes if conditional
ifs are not loops ifs are not loops okay
so there will be an if conditional
probably before the evaluation that's
going to be be well do an if conditional
and then if it if it has the plus signs
and it'll be true if it doesn't it false
okay am I missing any steps
hmm i don't think so i think you've got
a pretty solid idea of what you need to
do so let's put it in the code ok so for
finding each letter character am I gonna
use regex here um you could but again
it's using a sledgehammer to kill an
eight ok so a simpler way to go about it
would be so what I would do and and this
is just me all right you could do some
reg ex and you could do some fancy
matching and and build a really neat
query that that checks whether you know
a plus sign is followed by a letter and
then a plus sign and you know but or if
a letter has a plus on before or after
and you could do all that or you could
simply iterate through your string and
if you find a letter look back one
element if that element isn't a plus and
the element after it is in a plus then
return false ok so we need to so is
iterating through the string the first
step that's what i would do yeah ok so
with a for loop yeah what for loop is
generally the best way to iterate
through stuff there's you can do for in
but they're actually slower than then
straight for loops so ok ok so for we're
going to start with variable i equal to
zero for the until I is my brain is
being tired as I is less than or equal
to streamline no because string ok so
string dot length right would return it
so if we were just to look at this
string length is 1 2 3 4 5 all right
that's what that's what string length is
but this is index zero indexed one two
three four so you want
this to never go to five it javascript
won't complain at you about it but you
can get some some weird behavior and in
other languages if you go outside the
bounds of an array it'll crash to the
program so it's okay yeah because like
you said in JavaScript and what I've
done it hasn't ever said anything about
it okay and we want to go buy one okay
so that's iterating through each
character in the string yeah and I'm
getting reports that it's quiet again
okay I didn't change anything but I can
look at the setting again yeah I haven't
changed anything either preferences
audio the automatic gain controls off
okay connection what's lost okay you're
back good okay um better yeah well I
don't know ok but we'll we'll drive on
ok so in the for loop I'm entering
through each string is it time to start
the if condition it's like if it's a
letter than I need to work to do another
thing yeah ok so if now this is where
I'm not sure how do I so fine leather
character alright so here is where we
would use some rags right and i'm going
to go ahead and type just to make it a
little faster ok so to make a new reg ex
it like an on-the-fly reyes object you
do a slash and then we want to actually
look through the range a to z right and
then we'll symbol or will give it the
flag I because that means ignore case
okay now reg ex
as a test method and so it'll test that
reg ex against whatever you provide so
let's go ahead and pass it the character
that we're we're looking at and we could
go ahead and take a look there so that
will that will return true if string I
is in the range of a tizzy okay which is
string I yep so the the other thing that
I would say to do because remember how
we're going to look behind huh so what's
something we know if we're starting at
index 0 and it's a letter then it's
false right so so we could just define
that case now if wait I want to add this
so if it's the first thing and it's the
first letter how do I because right now
its string I it's just any character so
I would just take this sorry let's bump
that in okay and well we could just do
if I is equal to 0 right then you could
write what is going on here okay
okay and there's no there's really no
reason to even continue on past that
point right because right why is it
given okay 444 why is it indenting this
oh so very important to to close your
your methods so I forgot a parenthesis
on test and so the if needs to be
surrounded by its own site of
parentheses and then you have to close
the parentheses on a method yeah so okay
so so we're still in the if so we know
it's a letter yes we know it's a letter
we should look backwards right
connections lost reconnecting
you
set guys running into an issue
just one second guys I'm going to
restart the screen here out here
alright you there no yeah so I can can
you hear me yeah can you hear me oh yeah
there yeah can you hear me one second
time preferences hey oh well yeah can
you hear me can you hear me hey can you
hear me
hey can you hear me now hello yet can
you hear me now
oh you can hear me good I can't hear you
yep nope can your you but I think I know
what I need to do this problem
subtract one from I
okay Kim can you hear me yes I can okay
great now let me check in wait wait wait
don't click what I'm not like yeah what
well when you click around at all if it
steals the my mouse cursor oh I'm sorry
I didn't know that yes okay um probably
very annoying sorry alright so let's uh
let's go back and do what we need to do
okay so i want to subtract one from I
and check if that is a plus right yep
okay so if i minus 1 Earl well if i
minus 1 i minus so what does i minus 1
in this case what was that what what
does i minus 1 represent in this case um
a character in the string okay what
strength um the input stream okay how
are you referencing it so remember you
need to reference that string right oh
ok ok ok so if the string i minus 1 is
equal to now is this the right way to do
that like the plus sign yeah but give it
surrounded by a set of a single or
double quotes ok Oh apparently people
can hear you.more clearly now which is
good great ok so if that is true then I
want to check for another thing so here
could I do and string
I plus one equals the plus sign then I
will return true well what happens if
you return true what happens if i give a
string okay connection lost can you hear
me hello
okay there you are yeah your audio came
back it's okay so what happens if i give
it this string right here
if you return true and here is Cano is
going to iterate it's going to ignore
this because it's not a letter right so
it's going to move to the next one which
would be D in this case and it's going
to say okay yet this the index of D
minus 1 is equals equals 2 plus the
index of D plus 1 equals a plus so
return true but according to the problem
statement it wouldn't be true because
this doesn't have a plus behind it right
right it has to be true for every letter
not just one right so we do have a
true/false here that we can use right so
this is going to return true if this
happens right so what if we flip this
and said if this isn't true then just
return false okay yeah that would cover
it because it would look through the
whole string yes ok so the way to say
that would be no no no don't don't you
don't you don't have to change it there
I mean I mean you could you could do
that you could do does not equal does
not equal or you could do something like
this oh okay yeah that's a lot simpler
and this is so when when you're reading
this in and you're looking at code or
you know for as something so if you see
this they're basically saying if not
this statement yeah okay so then I would
return false underneath that yeah
do i need to put and does this need to
be else if no because it sits within the
it's within this if statement the
brackets are just kind of messed up let
me let me go ahead and in debt these for
you all right okay and I don't need I'm
just going to try and see it see if it
works
now it doesn't know what's a return does
it well it doesn't know what to return
you're telling it to return the string
if it is ok ok so here I should just
change string to true well give it a
shot sorry my screen is taking a long
time to load because of my slow internet
connection oh it's okay so maybe pass it
these other validation strings just to
make sure that the input is saying
and it came back is true you know you
can just double-click on on this and a
little it should highlight the string
for you and then you can just copy paste
so like or maybe not double click but
you can just highlight it real fast and
then paste it'll it'll save you like you
know a few seconds here and there adds
up two hours of your life that's very
true you're right all right so is it
ready to submit if you're happy with it
yeah I think so ok I think of any cases
awesome and I actually got more than
zero time period points oh yeah that's
good oh thank you for your help yeah no
worries um let me see if you want to
keep going and people want to keep
watching we can keep going or I mean
it's up to you I it is about my bedtime
I am a early to bed early to rise I
teach kindergarten through second grade
and I have to set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
