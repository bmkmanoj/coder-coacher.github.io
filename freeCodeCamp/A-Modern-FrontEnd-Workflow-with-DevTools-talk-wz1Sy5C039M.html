the back is the volume record perfect
and this is my talk performance
debugging with dev tools I know the the
title was a little different but potato
patata thank you very much to the
organizers of course for having me here
but also thank you to my employer Saipem
for totally supporting me and like
everything I do especially when it comes
to evangelism workshops conference talk
so long story short we're hiring let me
know if you're interested remote
friendliness lots of open source it's
all good all right I've just got the one
slide about me you can follow me on
twitter at um aar it's got two days
because someone always grabs my username
with one a so I just keep adding those
letters until it works
that's the mailing list that that was
mentioned previously it's essentially a
very full video I'm showcasing a
workflow that you can adopt into your
own dev tools workflow okay and it comes
in your inbox about once a week and also
I've got a premium course modern dev
tools comm right in terms of like making
the most out of this talk I want to
share a few points of you this talk does
use canary but that being said it's you
know been a while since I've like
prepared this so I would say most of
this isn't stable and you should have
any problems are stable and again same
with experimental most these features
are non experimental now so again there
should be no problem sir when we do
encounter an experimental feature I'll
try and make a mental note to to remind
you of it but more importantly there are
lots of live demos so just keep in mind
that you'll be looking a lot at the
screen and there'll be me no touching
the trackpad okay what we're going to
cover we're going to cover network
performance render performance and
programmatic performance and which is
just a term to essentially mean using
code to extract performance metrics okay
I think I've run out of emojis so we
should probably get into the talk and so
we'll get into it
we'll start with network performance and
again if there's all within the context
of that also we're going to stay in that
tool quite a lot and I want to talk a
little bit about fonts on Soylent comm
okay so I'm using Soylent as a case
study that of course
no significance to this website and in
case you don't know like a little side
fact Soylent is one of those products
which don't know if they officially
claim to be but they basically are a
hundred percent of your ID a your
recommended daily allowance so as creepy
as that is that is what it is all right
I'm gonna reload the page and one thing
a light Fae attention to is this text
right here that headline text yeah let
me zoom in a little
okay so that was super quick but what I
mean what you make of that text you do
you see how it kind of slightly comes in
after I mean this isn't practical right
it's not practical for me to ask you to
keep ty in this milliseconds in fact
let's go to the network panel and
there's a little thing called capture
screenshots right here and if you check
that you do get screenshots once the
page completes its loading process you
get this nice filmstrip of screenshots
and now I can finally say hey like this
is the thing I was trying to ask you to
look at if this is much more convenient
and in particular this is the thing I
wanted us to pay attention to because it
looks a little mmm like why is there
some text there
why why is the headline text not there
and because supposedly this text right
here the headline text is in the source
code is it not what there is right so
it's in the HTML source code it's not
like the browser was waiting for a
JavaScript framework to finish so does
anyone I'm going to take any guesses why
web fonts yeah is that glad yes okay so
maybe an obvious an obvious idea but I
want to use this as a case study to see
how we can explore and how we can
improve this process so let's see what
can be done about that we know it's a
web font let's inspect the element we
want to find what what font it is in
particular so we'll search for fun -
family can you see dev tools okay
is that sci-fi they can zoom in a little
more and we see it's using a phone
called a pursue I guess that's how it's
pronounced and it's possibly a fallback
to aerial if the web font fell
to download so let's take that fun and
just very quickly we'll take a quick
detour and I like a little reminder and
in case anyone doesn't know of a font
display swap so to make a long story
short front display swap will instruct
the browser hey while you're going and
downloading that word pun that which
could take like five seconds just use a
full back front in the mean time and
it's a full bath yes sorry it's a it's a
CSS property that you use in a front
face block right exactly like this okay
and what I would propose is we try to
use something like this on on Soylent
comm which I think could be kind of
interesting but on display is one of
those interest in CSS properties where
it's not like trained during a color I
can't change the color sorry um you're
not going to see the change immediately
right because you can have to reload the
page to see the effects of hunt display
so how do we achieve that
well let's first of all let's find out
the actual place in code where we would
in theory make that change so I'm going
to copy this a person reference I'm
going to use command shift P and say
sources that's a little shortcut to get
to the sources panel and then I'm
guessing yeah main dot CSS as usual and
are pretty print now and I'll do a
search in this file for a pursue okay
now here's where it's being referenced
good and if I do a search again here's
where it's being like defined so to
speak or declared all right and this is
traditionally sorry typically rather
this is where you'd put that font
display line of code but again there's a
slight problem because once we reload
the page eg if I say paragraph color red
okay so the text has gone red perfect I
reload the page and it disappears right
dev tools doesn't persist or changes
like that however what we can do this we
can open up the navigator go on over to
overrides alright and using this kind of
nifty new feature will say enable local
overrides right click on the CSS file
and we'll say save for overrides and dev
tools will immediately figure out the
mapping between the production resource
and this brining local resources just
created for you and it will dump it on
your file system and you now have the
ability to edit a local resource as if
it was a production resource and it's
all them on your machine and just to
prove that it works we'll make that
hello red reload the page and it still
persists okay
so that in itself is a pretty amazing
feature but of course the goal wasn't to
do color red and that was just to prove
that was working rather what we need to
do is search for a pursue once more I'm
going to close that sidebar and I need
multi cursor selection because I've got
a few font family a pursues here so
command D command D great multi cursor
and the fingers front display and we're
gonna choose swap swap instructs the
browser hey while you're downloading
that remote web fun don't care just
provide the user with a fallback font at
least there's no point I'm just not
showing anything that's not useful okay
so do that command s reload the page I
mean it's a little hard to see but we
can prove it we can prove that this is
working with the filmstrip okay no more
screens of like empty text and so we
have like significantly improved the
user experience we've done something
we've confirmed it we validated it
that's like a little story that we can
now I don't know email soylent calm if
you are working for the company you
could just go and show somebody and
implement it yourself and I think that's
kind of cool the workflow that you can
adopt to really quickly try that because
in the past that overrides stuff was not
possible you had to use extensions and
by the way just to prove that the font
display itself is working let's just
change the we should change the fallback
font to something a bit more noticeable
because yeah that the difference between
the web font and the fallback was way
too similar so it's hard to see okay all
right now in order to make sure I never
order Soylent I'm just going to leave
Comic Sans there and not delete that
local over 8
so you can now move on all right I know
that was a bit of a bit of a funny
workflow in the sense that we covered a
bunch of things so I do want to quickly
recap we saw screen cuts in the network
panel look at overrides and pretty
printing in front display okay now that
was the network performance segment of
the talk and now let's move on to render
performance in the past performance was
traditionally all in the network in fact
we just saw right we would that whole
time it was very much network bound and
because of the web form okay
and so for example web teams including
seams I wore on whenever the concept of
web performance came up it was always
like a network panel and let's look at
this timing and let's straight away go
to the server people the database people
because clearly that's where the
performance issues lie but not exactly
reality has now changed if you do have a
heavy front-end you need to familiarize
yourself of a concept known as render
performance because we as front-end
developers or designers or web people
now have a heap of stuff to care about
this is like a very small selection of
those things like you have to think
about CSS complexity those problems
aren't gone browsers aren't so amazing
that we don't have to worry about that
and JavaScript past times like it
doesn't matter that you're 40 kilobyte
JavaScript plug-in which is gzip is is
like I don't know half a second to
download or whatever the browser has to
underneath it that empowers this huge
huge textual content of it pause and
evaluate so these things matter and you
have to care about them and but we're
not alone because browser vendors have
worked like tireless tirelessly and it's
not just the vendors it's the community
as well they've worked really hard to
bring us tooling we have a lot of
tooling at our disposal a we'd have time
to go over each tool but we're trying
over maybe one or two hey and if you
were to ask me like why why the tools
what did the tools help on accomplish I
would say they help take a qualitative
statement into a quantitative
quantitative one and so for example it
feels slow which I think we've all heard
at some point in our career
or feel sluggish you can take that
qualitative statement alright and it's
not about ignoring it because it's true
it is very subjective but it's about
quantifying it it's about assigning like
a natural figure and then using that to
whatever justify the cost of whatever it
is you need to do okay so to recap dev
tools can help you quantify the
performance of your page all right and I
want to start with the page smoothness
and specifically the frames per second
meter and simply because it's one of the
easiest to get a start of and it's
something that you can kind of leave
there and you have to think about it
alright so you check that FPS meter and
that's in the drawer in the control
panel okay now once you do that you get
in the top right corner of your webpage
you'll get this module and a little
overlay and that simply displays the
current frames per second so that's so
it's not particularly fancy but the
point is it's simple okay and that will
very quickly highlight for you is there
something very wrong okay and by the way
the thing to watch out for is like other
lines not you know if the lines aren't
straight it means there's a kind of
inconsistency the frames per second and
sometimes being consistently slower is
better than being in consistently fast
this is a small feature small but useful
JavaScript execution cost and we'll take
a quick look at a visualization and free
dress which I found on the three days
example demo site and for this I believe
it's four months yes and we're gonna
throw all the CPU as we saw in the
previous talk incredibly useful as a
front of that CPU down to 6x start
profiling and reload the page when it
does that that tells reloads a page and
it captures all sorts of performance
metrics okay now this is pretty much a
beast to go through and that light could
totally be its own talk so we're not
going to go through that rather we'll go
through the sources panel will open up
sources disabled look overrides Network
and we'll find the source code of this
in fact I'm gonna undock and we'll find
the source
good of this thing and you might notice
in the left hand side not that side bar
I'm right here you see we've got the
some timing information and the
background color of that signify is like
how bad is that how long is it taking
not super interesting you see we're in a
for loop here the thoughts of mashed up
signs and particle dots cows yes so
that's very interesting
I challenge you to do this with your
favorite grabber script framework
because you will be horrified okay and
just to recap the way to accomplish that
is literally just record a performance
profile alright let's talk about console
violations if you go to the console
panel I'm kind of like how the frames
per second meter you get a lot of value
for doing very little work this is
another one of those features
just make sure enable ver just make sure
the bass logging is enabled and you can
start to navigate your way for a website
and you'll find in the console panel you
will frequently be told if there is some
sort of best practice violation and I
think it's like that's great again it's
information for free it's not too
distracting yeah it's useful so for
example this one here saying a handler
that was passed a set timeout took
longer than 106 milliseconds to execute
all sorry took a hundred and six
milliseconds and then you also get the
line of code and the file where that
occurred okay dev tools audits we did
cover it in the previous talk which was
super useful
thank you yeah but I've in fact the last
talk was actually a very good
introduction to this tool and so we
won't spend too long in this but it's
just a reminder that lighthouse as a
product is now very much part of the
audits panel and it it works it works
very nicely and just makes for
performance is checked it will do its
thing and as a result you will get tons
and tons of like performance metrics
human friendly recommendations and I put
some emphasis on human friendly because
in the past I don't know about you but I
always felt web performance dashboards
were like red you know dumb pretty too
big
and then is like but what's wrong with
that why is that bad
where is now what's happening is they
actually give these like kinda sensible
explanations and they give links to
other things so nice okay I hail we see
some low-level rendering events which is
kind of useful to see again the Dom tree
size that we were talking about and the
Dom depth now there for me one of the
coolest things that kind of came out of
lighthouse was the documentation because
the documentation tells you why the
order was important how to pass it and
how the order was implemented and so if
you just search for lighthouse
documentation you'll come across this
website and it's got heaps of best
practices so putting completely aside
the usage of lighthouse this is just a
general documentation resource I think
is really great and again the search
query for that it's lighthouse
documentation okay again this has
already been mentioned but I'll very
quickly show it just in case I don't
know how how clear it was did we show
the checkbox so you enter URL here right
in web page test Advanced Settings
Chrome oh is that for lighthouse report
and the result of that is what we've
shown in the preview in the screenshot
pack food it's this thing right here
lighthouse pwe score and like don't
underestimate how useful this can really
be like just think about the use cases
you could for example have a pull
request and github and then have a bot
that ones webpagetest generates a
lighthouse report and tells you if you
passed a failed if you failed that
artifact of that pull request can be a
link to this report right this one sorry
i'm so very like little maintenance and
it's all kind of free which is pretty
amazing okay this is what I like to
refer to as a two minute performance
workflow and in order to quantify the
damage that other scripts it could be
images it could be CSS and have one more
page
we're going to go to nature calm there's
no significance to this website I'm just
using at random let's see you have it in
this okay so go to the performance panel
again make sure CPU throttling I think
we'll do 6x and start profiling and
reload the page
hey exactly like what happened in the
three guys visualization it will reload
the page and I'll capture all sorts of
performance metrics but this time we're
not going to go to the sources panel to
look at like line level profiling we're
going to stay in the performance panel
but instead we're going to bring up this
thing this pin at the bottom and we're
going to pay attention to this this
figure right here over three seconds of
scripting activity alright and again as
we've learnt from the previous talk you
know
script can often block the main thread
it can prevent interactivity and if
sometimes I'll load a website and I kind
of mentally know where the content I
care about it so I'll just blindly start
scrolling and it's kind of frustrating
when you can't do that because script is
eating up the the resources are
available three seconds
okay so what do we do now let's go to
the core tree and I need to undock back
it's good a little hard to fit in okay
hmm can I do now your story oh yeah okay
it looks like one of the top ones are in
Satan and thanks to some background
knowledge I like I happen to know that
in Satan isn't critical for the
performance sorry for the core
functionality of the page so I'm gonna
maybe be a bit of a bully too insight in
here as a product and I'm going to pick
on inciting for the this experiment that
we're currently doing so we mentally at
knowledge in Slaton take that
information and we will head on over to
the network panel and at this point you
could do a search for in Satan and find
all the resources that match that but
instead I'll rely on these product
badges cuz I mean I use them all the
time now they just just stare at it and
it shows in your face it's really useful
and I'll right-click and I'll say block
this request to mean
so everything coming from whatever
inciting calm is going to be blocked on
subsequent page reloads all right and
you'll see what the eventual goal of
this is again we're trying to quantify
the damage that and Satan can have so
maybe you see where we're going with
this
all right so right now it's zero blocked
because we're still in the same page
session I'm going to go back and I'll
hit start profiling and reload the page
so we're going to do exactly the same
performance run like we just did the one
difference is we are now blocking a
certain script and just for the record
it's like six scripts and even here it
says one blocked right here
and in reality it's like six because
that one script would have eventually
downloaded others and dev tools doesn't
know about that okay so what was the
whole point of that exercise if I go to
the summary pane now see scripting
activity is a huge difference right and
the point of this is this now gives us
ammo right because I'm guilty of this
like going to why is it the design or
the product OMB like ah
it's slow he's like what slope like what
because it's third-party it's slow no we
have to you have to quantify we have to
give you no reasonable justification for
why we're potentially recommending to
like remove something that could be
potentially big to the business so this
way we can quantify it we can explain
the damage that's causing all right and
that was basically the point of the
workflow in case you ever forget what
the previous recording was dev tools now
has ability to persist your Timeline
recordings on the current session and
which is really nice so we can now look
at the previous recording verify oh yes
three seconds and then look at the
current one and then work out the
difference okay so that's a really nice
feature I think all right and to recap
on what we just saw that I did kind of I
know I've like I've done this a few
times and it might come across I'm very
rushed that's why I'm hoping to do a
quick recap and we saw that request
blocking is a natural thing you can just
arbitrarily block images CSS whatever is
very easily as well just right
and block okay to recap on the workflow
it's recording performance profile one
blocking whatever it is you choose then
recording performance profile - and it
essentially comparing the results
that's not fixing any problems for you
but it's giving the again the ammo the
knowledge required to go and take action
okay and you might write mem sorry you
might remember and when I was looking
for inciting I said I could search for
it but instead I was just looking for
that little badge well make sure that's
enabled I'm in dev tools and the result
of that is you'll get these little
badges next to every network resource
you might think like what the heck it's
a tiny little badge who cares and
actually it makes a huge difference on
my workflow and I assume many people
will feel the same after trying out
because the truth is I get like kinda
overwhelmed with noise sometimes so I'm
like Oh too much I'm just not going to
look at anything but having these little
indicators you're like are en I'd have
to care about that I only care about my
own code um I think in that sense it's
kind of it's a small feature but it's a
it has a big lasting impact and that
should also appear in the performance
panel okay and this is super cool it's
very shiny very nice but I'm not gonna
spend too long on it I'll just console
yeah let's see okay so right here in the
draw we've got something called
performance monitor there's this like
nice little visualization thing you can
do stuff on the page it doesn't really
matter what and you can like trigger
these little these waves
it's very pretty to look at now I'm
joking there there is more to it of
course there's the whole interpreting
the graphs and understanding them for me
personally I gain more value from the
performance panel however I still would
say there is value to this and cover
what that is in a sec you can toggle
stuff on and off as well
that's for why the performance monitor
well I would say at least three reasons
I could think of first of all it's a
really good introduction to performance
so if the performance panel makes you
nervous because it is very very
overwhelming
stay in there for a while get used to
what it means for the dom node count to
increase understand these concepts and
also it stays alive during your entire
usage so you can go from page to page to
page and really like understand oh the
about page spikes but the contact page
doesn't I wonder why that is
okay so the me these are some already
some of the reasons which makes it kind
of cool all right now moving into the
programmatic performance part of this
talk I'm paint indicators so this is why
I really like the previous talk because
it gave us among some good indications
some good background into this as well
and if I incognito I my family bore
experiments yes this is not a joke you
have to hit shift like six times and
then just experiments appear yeah so I
want paint timing markers and again it's
very there's a small feature it's not
like revolutionary but I still think
it's pretty cool I'm going to reload the
page sorry start profiling and reload
the page and the result is you're gonna
see these vertical dashed lines and
going across in fact I might have to
undock you cool and one of these dashed
lines is to do with first meaningful
paint and it's very nice to have that in
like again the performance panel is
great it's very heavy and very dense but
it it is great even has a network
request so you can can help correlate
why painting might have occurred and by
anyway let's try and find this paint so
tiny it was hiding behind the green
there we go that's all I wanted to show
you first meaningful paint
mm-hm and that's present in the
performance panel but what's cool is
again you can correlate that with screen
felts you can correlate that with the
net
requests yeah there was one other thing
but I guess I think we might have seen
it Wow but yeah performance stop getting
trees by type yes the API that you care
about if you want to get
programmatically get that information
okay that will give you first pain and
first content for pin if that's more of
a side note the main part of that
feature was the fact that you get these
- vertical lines so I think the other
one is one of them is like window.onload
possibly no oh my gosh okay um and if
you're curious and want to learn more
about what it means to be a meaningful
paint or content for paint and the
search query is time to first meaningful
pane you'll eventually land on this
Google Doc and it's like super cool it's
really really interesting bit of heavy
reading yeah okay let's talk about
identifying used an onion CSS in
JavaScript I'd feel more likely we'll
stick with a new CSS alright we'll go to
Smashing confocal and let's check out
the coverage panel I'll hit escape to
bring up the draw and there it is
coverage great and I'll hit start
instrumenting and reload the page so you
might have known about this you know but
dev tools can show you and your you know
a list of assets and what percentage of
those assets are being used on the
current page which is very useful and
this referred to as coverage and so
let's filter down for London 18 dot CSS
here we go ignore the fact that this two
star fees I think that's a bug for dev
tools and but yeah you can see the 64.8%
unused or what's kind of cool they
should yeah it's kind of cool if I can
use the page I could like hover over
some speakers do some of that business
yeah we got that
down to 54% that's kind of cool the way
that the coverage panel works is
actually monitors what you're doing on
the page and if it finds out you're
actively using the CSS and JavaScript
the unused bytes will go down it make
sense okay but the thing is this is a
programmatic performance part of the
talk so we're doing a lot of clicking
with the code right so I think if we
were to codify it would look a little
look little like this we would start
coverage we would use the page and we
would end coverage and of course we
console.log something i've got a little
like node script which I'll very quickly
show you okay dorri I'm not gonna do any
live coding here we go this is all using
puppeteer hey and all we do is puppeteer
dot launch and will say headless false
so that we can actually see the results
we'll make a new page and we'll call
this new API it's kind in you it's like
maybe a month or two old I'm tempted to
say we can call page coverage start CSS
coverage then we'll navigate to a
smashing font and then we'll simply will
stop the CSS coverage and then we'll
login ok that's it let's see the result
of that okay all right not super
interesting it opens up the page it logs
the unyuu CSS whatever but what makes
this a bit more compelling is the fact
that we can script stuff we can automate
stuff so if I essentially call hover
over each speakers like it's a function
which does what it sounds like it will
loop for speakers of speakers or loop of
each one and it will hover over each
speaker because remember the CSS needed
to get those images and behind each
speaker or and it over its Chloe I'm
talking about right these ones yeah the
CSS required to get that working will of
course end up using
Moe CSS as you hover over so yeah
paged over sleep okay cool now the sleep
is of course for our benefit so we can
see all right and then we browse it up
close see what that looks like okay cool
all right in the hope is because
remember we're simply console logging
the before and my console logging me
after the hope is at the console log
after the unyu CSS percent is lower and
it is nice
great okay you might have just seen that
and been like what was the point
now wouldn't blame you and I think for
me the most compelling use case is
actually monitoring your unyu CSS over
time I think is a pretty interesting
concept I don't have a particular tool
to plug or to share I think in reality
any good web performance dashboard
webpage to anything that can just a log
arbitrary value should be able to do
this wonderfully and essentially you
have a percentage or you have like bytes
like 100 bytes are unused whatever so as
long as you can be connect to something
and what you could do is like you could
do something like on every pull request
send the unused percentage and maybe
compare it if it reaches a certain
threshold like at this point fell the
bill right that's just an idea I think
that's kind of useful okay so we've
covered a bunch of things and maybe a
bit early
we'll see we'll quickly recap on what we
saw hey we started out looking at
screenshots in the network panel that
was very cool it's always nice to be
able to compare these things and you
could also do this go into your
competitors and as you compare the
screenshot side-by-side um I would say
probably the coolest feature for me in a
long time in dev tools is the ability to
look all over it okay so in case it
wasn't clear what was happening and we
were taking a remote resource dev tools
was mapping it to a local resource for
us and every time we reloaded the page
that
swapped in local resource for the remote
one and it's yeah I hadn't really been
possible before
maybe with external tools or third-party
extensions but not natively hey we saw
the line level profiling that was pretty
nice what else
the yeah essentially lighthouse being
bundled in the orders panel that's of
course very cool and as we saw that's
also now part of webpagetest
the fact that the performance panel can
assist all of your past recordings that
for me is extremely useful I use it all
the time now and definitely do it er
ative sort performance improvements this
way and I make sure I'm actually
improving not degrading the experience
okay we saw the performance monitor that
was yeah that's cool it's pretty it will
only get you so far though because you
can't get much from this apart from
looking at the spikes and whatnot
performance getting trees by type paint
very useful API definitely worth
beginning and yeah the coverage panel
but not just the coverage panel the fact
that you can now like automatically
collect this information using a tool
like puppeteer um believe it or not
puppet II actually goes over the dev
tools protocol so in the very same way
we were doing coverage stuff so was
puppeteer is using basically the same
sort of API is okay that was five
minutes earlier I don't suppose there's
anything I guess we've got time is this
a last talk is anything of dev tools you
want to see like maybe like at a live
performance audit of something yeah oh
my gosh now I have an idea
youtube.com/ question disabled under
scopolamine he said this yes
okay now actually disable polymer
because when I did this test initially
it was without polymer and then they
introduced it and then yeah um so what
could do it like I made this a quick one
it's not going to be super amazing but
hopefully you'll just get you a bit more
comfortable with the performance panel
so here right okay so you type in and it
seems to appear okay
I've always felt those a little leg but
I could never could never be sure anyway
let's open up dev tools in fact let's
not even bother ruffling the CPU either
feeling it's going to be pretty slow
anyway so oh crap sorry I didn't mean
that in a rude way alright I'm going to
use a shortcut command e I'll say hey
okay stop interesting so it's not
terrible it would be terrible if I was
frightened filling the CPU I'm sorry I
have to undock it's really hard to fit
stuff in unblocked into separate window
and maybe we'll look into this spike
because that's kind of big we'll open up
the main now ah there we go okay we see
this we see that there's a huge
recalculate style 89 milliseconds and
again I've done this before I can
confirm on things like move our devices
it's like half a second which is crazy
it's not that it's not like it's half a
second to you type in and in half a
second later you get the result it's
like half a second of stuttering on a
mobile device and which is really really
bad actually
and so what can we do let's check it out
by the way we're not going to fix it
we're going to try and identify what the
pause is so we'll click on this and
really yeah that's so bad I don't like
it when people zoom out and then now I'm
doing it to you can you see that at the
back oh cool oh my gosh was I just super
zoomed in the whole time oh gosh okay so
I'm going to click on that line of code
pretty friend a dev tools has the
ability to pretty print
right in the bottom left corner and
again we're not fixing this so don't get
your hopes up we're just gonna identify
what it's doing all right we see it's
doing this a dot classlist you don't
something got removed ah I don't know so
we'll click on the line the offending
line use a shortcut command B to set a
breakpoint trigger the action again
because all we had to do is search and
that will cause the breakpoint to
execute escape now we can like sort do
this alive inspect stuff where you can
type in letters you know that's
interesting the thing that we're setting
a class list on a is the entire HTML
document and the reason that's bad is
because Oh Jake you're like the master
of this you should be giving this to it
if we cook and it will kind of explain
it to us there we go
so recalculate style was terrible
because there were so many elements
affected thousands and it's because we
were change that changing something up
so high level changing a simple class
name whatever it is which is what caused
this problem but what would be nice is
not just to end it there like say we
were writing a little bug report it's
kind of cool to go all the way and like
really blow YouTube's minds of our
diagnosis so let's try and find out what
what are they doing exactly so the class
name is no focus outline okay so they're
possibly adding or removing this class
of no focus outline as you search for
stuff okay it makes sense from a user
perspective now and what we could even
do is search for that string in fact let
me remove that breakpoint resume script
execution command or TANF to do a
project wide search search for no focus
outline and we should find some CFS
pretty print that CSS and there we go
right so no focus outline that was
typically on the HTML element right at
the root and then they're just targeting
little child elements scattered here and
there setting you know it looks like
they desire the Bob shadow to be known
so again we haven't fixed it but we have
identified what it is now would say that
make like a super wonderful bug report
and yeah call 40 minutes perfect
Wow who here uses dev tools who left
something in that that they didn't know
about dev tools more than one thing yes
exactly I was not lying earlier on when
I said you would learn something so can
we just give one more very warm and
important for that I was amazing
not only did you get tips you've got a
live session at the end I'm still
disappointed we didn't do Jake Archibald
comm that's a tomorrow Emma would you
like to please come and sit in my lovely
lounge that I have prepared for you so I
just don't even know where to begin like
even just small things like command
shift P you're just constantly acting as
if you're inside an IDE and you just
feel so comfortable and fluid I wish
that I could you've dev tools as
smoothly as you do and I think one of
the things I really liked about the
session was not only how practical it
was and how we all learnt something from
it that a lot of the things that you
chose to talk about have resonated and
really connected the day I don't think
everyone else would probably agree you
probably agree with me things like
talking about display property we had
Zak today talking about font we now know
how to practically do that in dev tools
we had packed talking about the
lighthouse orders and the performance
timing API we now have been shown by you
how we can actually do that just using
dev tools and not even having to leave
our browser Andy Davis earlier on showed
us how we could block third-party
scripts using web page test them out
you've now taken it one step further and
how we can just do it inside our network
panel and the browser will never have to
leave I think it was a great I don't
know if Italy's done this intentionally
but it's they're very lovely end to the
day and recapping all the talk so thank
you mmm so let's start with some
questions I have too many that I think
we could just be here for ages but I
don't want to bore everyone but we're
not going to be busy gonna enlighten us
so great and Firefox and edger are all
working really hard and they've got
dedicated teams to dev tools now and
but there anyways that and they're kind
of closed silos but I think some of them
are open sources the only way for us as
developers and not vendors to be able to
submit patches or bug reports or feature
requests for dev tools yeah I guess in
the in the sense that if code is open
source you can contribute to it I would
say in that sense yeah you could totally
do that and for me one of the biggest
reasons to do it is because it's just
the most amazing learning experience I
always say that at least for chrome dev
tools I haven't actually looked to the
code of other dev tools but chrome dev
tools has one of the most complicated
web applications you ever seen and if
you use in dev tools you're probably a
web developer and you probably want to
get better web architecture and things
like that and the code base itself is
fantastic so you I would like 100%
recommend they learn from it yeah even
if you don't yeah exactly if you could
propose one feature for dev tools one
thing that you think is missing in
distance what would that be
ah like maybe a button that you click
and then it just fixes all of that
feature I would like that feature please
I mentioned it earlier like your use of
commercial P there and it really does
feel like it's becoming an IDE
do you would you agree with that
statement mm-hmm especially as we now
finally have local resources which blew
my mind during that talk and it's like
something that we've wanted a developers
for ages like we're getting so close to
not having to leave about Lea look over
it is a big deal and I think a while ago
I showed in one of the Smashing confer
talks I showed the terminal which was
kind of it's like a built in terminal in
dev tools which is bizarre and it's a
bit flaky I think possibly they're
trying it unofficially and maybe they
don't want to say that too much because
I voice people will cry and be like hey
it's really buggy actually so I think
one day it's just going to will come
naturally it will be a really gradual
thing and you get more and more people
being like here's how I don't leave my
balance a writing blog posts re
here's how I don't leave my browser and
more and more you'll start to see oh the
workflow is possible but right now I
don't think it is and I don't think they
claim for it to be even you
while the dev toward a photographer
there do you leave the browser do you
use the text editor well I make a point
to try and use it because it's always a
nice to like if you're trying to teach
other people about a certain topic it's
always nice to use it as much as you can
and I force myself to and for the most
part it generally is pretty good and
pretty stable but then every now and
then everything will crash and you
remember why you don't use experimental
software too much yeah I try to the code
coverage in and that was awesome and I
actually it it brought back horrible
memories to me the way before things
like puppeteer existed and we could get
access to the CSS unused property that's
it unused CSS properties I was working
in The Guardian wrote the most horrible
hockey scripts try and automate that and
now you you know it just ten lines of
code just solved what I spent about
nearly a month of my life working on
it's great that we are progressing like
this but it's really useful but is it
possible to exports that those forms of
poverty
yeah well I'm like how would I go about
doing so in the code that we had to look
at I was kind of yeah I should have
rushed but I kind of rushed through it
and I only showed oh look unused
percentage right but it turns out you
get heaps of information like the
variable that I was logging was only
part of the story
you get like all the ranges like from
this byte to this byte is unused you
know all the CSS so you can do all sorts
of relatively basic Maps you can do all
sorts of computation to figure out is
they use CSS A's are unused here's the
the CSS which was used after initial
page load after some user interaction
and you can make all these
understandings and slip and create the
style sheets automatically from that if
you so wish to and then we could like
take it one step further and try and do
this as part of our continuous
integration and things like did you have
any sister people doing that yeah
integrating it to that level how I know
there are tools on github which I think
the extent of what they do is basically
tell you hey is here's what's happening
like here's the deal with your unyuu CSS
and i think there are possibly some
tools which will try and create a style
sheet for you based on the
what was yeah this that but I'm not sure
than using like the dev tools political
to intelligently create post style
sheets after the user interaction that
would be awesome
d is there any metrics other than those
that you'd like to see exposed in the
performance AP ice you know you you
mentioned first meaningful paint there
we've got access to it now and and the
paint planning everywhere I've gotten
what other parts of metrics that you
maybe we might be able to get via
lighthouse on not even a lighthouse that
you'd like exposed where are those 80
lights I think I really like what's
there now because for me this is why in
the previous talk in the Q&amp;amp;A session
they did raise the point it was like
what's window unload even about like who
cares about window unload your window
unload could be the twenty second mark
and your page could still be blazing
fastest you know one doesn't cause the
other necessarily but for me the paint
timing API is our one of the best that
I've seen because it's what matters to
the user so yeah well I would say maybe
the paint timing API but enhanced
because right now I know that it's
flawed in some areas because they are
having to make guesses based on like
what's physically on the screen and how
much has changed in there that alluded
to some of that earlier yeah well um and
so finally you know I'm amazed and
that's why I subscribe to dev tips as
well but what happens if you decide to
go on holiday for like a month
I'm not gonna be able to keep up to date
with dev tools so how do you as boom are
keep up to date with the latest of
element after that so that you can
obviously teach all of us but I would
love to know about some of these
resources as well I think in terms of
resources honestly you know if it's a
typical Friday night for you and when
that party movement you stop what you're
doing and you open up the dev tool
source code and you just let's stare at
it so hard and you typing get I have
that Friday night who has a fire Jake
Jake doe yeah just reading the code
looking at the commits I mean this it
Twitter slash dev tools commit you need
to mitts plural maybe and that's pretty
nice because you'll see the commit
message in the tweet and if it seems
kind of interesting then by all means go
and check it out if it's something like
we architected interview then just like
now it's Friday night I like this mantra
that you've said twice now for our this
Q&amp;amp;A session is that the best way to find
out is just read the source right can we
all give one final round of applause for
