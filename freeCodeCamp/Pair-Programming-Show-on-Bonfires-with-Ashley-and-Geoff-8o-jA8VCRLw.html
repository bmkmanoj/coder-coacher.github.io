I'm not sure how most people do it yeah
I'm still getting used to the pair
aspect too because everyone does do it
differently and it's what's interesting
to me is kind of how you work with
different people like sometimes is
structured kind of i'm going to do this
and you're going to do this works really
well and other times I've had to be a
little because that's i'm more of a
please tell me like where the boxes are
you know so i can check them but
sometimes you have to be a little more
flexible to kind of go with it so i'm
cool with whatever and we can probably
just figure out what works best here
okay trying to get Jason to help me out
with get a new box set up I don't know
how I forgot about that but anyway um
cool so if you want to read the
description okay yeah so this one is far
out thou make a function that looks
through a list first argument and
returns an array of all objects that are
equivalent property values second
argument
those are new as I knew it looks like we
need to use has on property and check
for the keys so if we need to find every
object in this array that has the same
key as the blonde dinner so the way i
did i do it just the easiest way and do
a regular four leaf I'm going to let me
use map or filter or you know whatever
else there is your functional
programming but I think a good easy way
it's good all of them
are you doing the mongodb course no I
just thought you typed where and that's
one of the the queries it's like where x
equals y or whatever oh yeah I was doing
some Mongol stuff but not through the
course okay
I guess I can just check all the keys
first
so can you iterate through objects with
number of teeth like an array that's a
good question I'm not sure so it's
reading today I think JavaScript the
good parts this is actually in the
appendix which is called JavaScript the
awful parts or something like that but
he was talking about how arrays are
really just objects and there's some
confusion in there it looks like you can
with objects clock keys you probably
just use that then put in you know
whatever the index is
I really want to see if we have multiple
keys can overdo or not yeah so glad 101
key
in the comparison object or the
collection and the ass or something ok I
see ya then be yeah yeah although as I
would just check for the first one but
ooh
hello I'll just check calipers long oops
trying to get the stream running on my
phone so I can see if there's any
messages in the chat room there we go
turned an array properties
yeah and that's a helpful thing to know
if you don't mind going back the part um
we're on object keys there's a little
note where it says the for in loop do
you mind if I go back here for a second
you know Todd um the foreign loop goes
over properties in the prototype chain
as well so if you have an object that
you know you created but it inherits for
something else there may be stuff on
there that you don't realize is there so
it's helpful that they have these
methods get owned properties as opposed
to the ones that you know it may have
gotten from other objects name is
charred see this one's here I'm not sure
if it will
oh no I need a loop again I think to go
through all these different key use yeah
because you're looping through the array
of objects and then for each object
you've got to dive into the the keys and
their properties as well yeah those
effects
Oh
think that's your work
collection Ikki where's your e coming
from Oh keep changing variable names and
I forgot it just relax ah ok
get this out
geez maybe
oh nice one test yeah that would not
happen I can go over it um just so
everybody yeah so the first thing to do
is leap over everything in the array and
then and each one we go through like so
for the first one law of this and we're
also going to loop over every key and
this and then if this key like this and
this and we'll continue on to check if
the actual value is the same if it is
push it into this empty array and we're
all done return being rated we have left
looks like we have a little error there
that's about it nice and straightforward
definitely works for me um I think I'm
trying to remember how i did it i need i
know they're saved somewhere need to go
back and look um I know you can use
filter as well I know they are saved if
you go to your like a free code camp API
right there's not really a new
formatting um yeah I can make it hard
interglobal media thinks she mentioned
that the code is a little hard to see so
I wonder i'm going to try and make it a
little bigger and see if that helps
can you please do the palindromes
bonfire next see Helen groans these
object that key you'll need has on
property yeah that's true I guess I
didn't need to do that I just kind of
jump around the different things but if
else in just the first rewrite those two
it's always fun on the on the live code
stream you get people you know
especially if you start really going off
the cliff and they try and call you back
no no don't use that function holy
always have really helpful insights it's
you know sometimes it's good to get
somebody's head is not in it right now
to try a little too far into it forget
what we offer yeah um it's yeah I'm I
tend to be stubborn I think why I know I
want to solve it with this method so I
have to not necessarily true um I'll sit
if you got easier with you know map or
something but I just haven't used those
too much to really know all the ins and
outs of them with a nap or filter filter
super useful um do you want to try doing
this one with filter and see what might
be different I could try I but I don't
really know filter so by taking a long
time to do it I can get it started I
think once you see it you'll realize
it's pretty straightforward so yeah so
basically you you call it on an array so
our collection is an array
and you pass in a callback function and
there's three arguments you can pass
into that function which are Value Index
I think the third one is in this
argument um probably get to lift this up
before we dive in too deeply wait a
minute oh I put that one on here for the
Indian yeah this lights are super useful
it's tricky too though because like you
could have like eight links on here you
know what I mean and then definitely
don't want to give the person the
impression like you need to use all of
these things yeah dude to solve the
problem it's kind of fun I've using all
three of the links you gave and nothing
else will well that's good t-value
dozing wasn't even really intentional it
just kind of happened that way see I
guess there's none of this argument okay
I'm glad I looked the array of the
object being traversed or a bright
object being traversed Oh as if this is
provided it will be passed to the
callback we don't need to do that here I
usually just use value index what that
gives you access to inside the callback
is each item as you go over it but then
so how filter works is if you return a
trophy value it will keep it and if you
return a faulty value it will throw it
out and does it make a new array yes it
does does not mutate the Ray I wish it's
cold yeah creates a new array so you've
got to store it in a new variable okay
the value would be the actual object
then shows all u dot yep and you can
kind of see what it puts out here I
console.log everything then I have to go
back like when I make pull requests and
go back and delete all of the console
logs because there's way too often yeah
yep so first object index second object
index third object index so it's just an
easy easy way to get everything which is
super super handy you check the chat Oh
we'll come back to that in a second so
you do return in here and so you want to
keep the ones if you decide what you
want to keep so we want to keep the
objects that have equivalent property
values so we want somehow I tests for
that that will return truthy and then
those will be kept I also really like
saying truthy because there's no other
situation in my life where that makes
sense um so let's see it wasn't property
values so you can jump in and help me
here because you just did this so it's
fresher in your head use has owned
property yeah and then how would you
check for the value of that property
you would do like the value and then you
can put the key inside brackets that you
don't know what it is so if you're
looping over you can just use whatever
variable you're using okay so you put um
can you say that again so if so return
if the value has a property index so how
would we know what the first one is I
guess is the thing we've got to figure
out the first property yeah I think you
might have to do another loop inside of
there might be able to do another filter
I don't you might have we're tapping
with this but I don't want to know
that's why I just kind of tricky lies
usually they'll see this regular loops
hmm let's see we can figure out for this
object we really just need to get the
key and once we get the key we can
access the value right so let's see this
there's get keys yeah turns an array I
guess we don't know that it's only 11
key so if we can write a flexible
function that does for more than one so
we should probably handle the array it'd
be easier if you knew it was one yeah
cuz I think some of those have us that
will have more than one see someone's
mike has some weird feedback thanks arts
algae hope it's not mine I'll move it a
little further away i also have a cold
so it sound really pitiful good crispy
rios map filter for the wind yes yeah i
think once i learn it i'll probably use
it all the time but i'm only use it I
only a handful of times I'm not real
confident it especially with the world
collage right now yes yeah if it does a
little nerve-racking isn't it hi
everyone um it gets easier I'm where the
first time i streamed i was so nervous
and then I was like this is ridiculous
there's no one in my room I'm just
talking to myself yeah
mine has feedback I'm not sure why I'm
using a no headphones ha did you see ya
whenever he speaks it's crazy huh ok I
just tried turning the microphone down
cuddle you all yeah I'll turn you down
here too because I've got headphones on
so it's not coming back through mine
that better nothing too quiet well
there's like a 10 second lag too so
we'll get we'll get feedback on the
change in about five seconds someone
else said where did it go let it helpful
comment and I lost it oh um yeah key
yeah CJ said the third argument is the
collection itself into filter thanks for
that um that if you just don't want to
use this you can use collection instead
yeah that's interesting like um I'd be
curious if you just you don't call it
like a method i guess um curious how
that works it isn't feedback it sounds
like a sound sample buffering problem I
wouldn't worry too much about it from
Danny frit my clock says it's because he
is alien I'll fine with the mic we'll
try and get that worked out but okay
quiet now but not better like a turn
your volume down for me maybe that's why
I guess going through that I've found
another speak too much feedback
they're the better we can press on can
use eclipse or sneeze so we'll have an
array of that so we can loop through
that array so for every key we want to
check both if the collection know the
value because we have one at a time it
value at pleased by that multiple values
origin and all of the month now you
gotta know much yet may be a confusing
variable to that's another thing
sometimes it's hard to keep track stuff
when you name them not well object keys
at source from Jerry 314 don't mind my
rambling it's not rambling nobody really
wants someone to scream in my ear
I'll trip duckies source where's the
source coming oh I see that thank you so
that is a global object method this is
why I like streaming everyone catches
all of your mistakes so if value at keys
I is the same as source actually we can
just say return because if that's true
it'll keep it in the array I'm not
confident it's going to run like you're
stood the first time cannot read
property zero of undefined something
let's see property zero keys
let's see what we get here please feel
free to jump in but you wanted to check
against sorcerer against the key use
what I'm trying to do is pick yeah I'm
trying to and maybe this isn't the best
way to do it I'm trying to figure out
for each of these keys which we only
have one so okay for last if ah that's
what I might be what's happening I
should be des own property trying to
figure out does this object have a key
called last and does it have the same
value as this one but it's returning an
error
Miller they matter wat I'm guessing
because value is not undefined their
keys is an undefined rather I'm guessing
it's because the first value doesn't
have no the wood the last property but
the second one doesn't or it doesn't
have a move known confusing myself Danny
for it says value duckies is undefined
in you're accessing 0 so do you think
this will help
well the different air
jared 314 is suggesting that we look at
the keys on each value as we go through
and maybe compare that way we have my
keys and you're moving over the
collection anything over the key use
again
yeah time if value ki is equal to source
these are
you could try and like a node let me get
my cue a better air blows air handling
isn't that great just on the fine or
narrow I remember anything it just keeps
it interesting yeah we can definitely do
that or repla is a helpful tool that um
Vince in New Jersey introduced me to hi
Vince if you're there I hope you got to
go surfing recently we're talking I like
to ski and he likes to surf enough this
was like two months ago and it was
freezing cold now it's kind of like oh
dear that just sounds miserable really
fun but really cold all is perfect if
you want to go yeah oh yeah no I
wouldn't be doing that row which is
happy here
nothing Oh Danny for it says that's on
error alien face I think that's what
that is you aren't returning anything
from your function that's very true okay
you know we're not actually running it
here you know Philip oils
oh it's not good it's still log in that
keys for us all good let's see um RX
ouchie says you're looping through your
source object and not the collection oh
yeah well you're not returning they are
you need to take out that and return the
whole collection not guilty oh that's
right that's right nothing hey I like
when it's something simple makes me feel
like maybe we do understand the problem
yes no awesome thanks for all the help
guys on the chat um yeah our left that's
I mean but that's at that's the beauty
of it like I'm super stubborn so when I
first started learning how to program
was like I don't need help I'm gonna do
it myself I'm girl boo then you know you
learn really fast that that's not the
right ways to it and it's I've been
humbled I think in a lot of ways by that
it's been a good thing and I think I've
learned more when you accept help you
know what I mean yeah that's also got a
just a good thing I'll javascript in
general I think use your answer and my
ass our ward completely different than
the table fourth so now we learn
something yeah that's great yeah if you
want type your name in I know you've
you've already done all the barn fire to
you but it's my account so I'll already
get credit oh my username I'll tell you
then I think it's whatever you sign into
free code camp with like I sign in with
twitter so as i typed in my twitter name
that's what works for me wow so you have
you month to anyone email these just
your handle like just store back i don't
think you do at you know
yeah yeah yes so my husband was asked me
is like do you call those your camp
themes you know like your um you have
the camp name when you go to camp right
so I think if that's a good idea we
should call them our camp names yeah
let's see okay we did where art thou I
can't click these so oh I don't have
access to this that's okay um some all
numbers in a range not a big it I would
actually give me some issues because of
it was challenging because i think the
warning was not that great oh ok there's
this one to the past two number three
times of some of these two numbers and
all numbers between one lowest number
will not come first that part was tricky
yeah so the issue i had was I thought
okay maybe we'll just give us you no
longer ones we add all those together
but it's actually like one two three and
four great I had to ask I didn't really
get mad at first
reduce what's what I just sorted they
ready first man what if I not like
normal oh that's so smart I had like 10
lines of code trying to figure out the
biggest one oh yeah so much easier like
it hey but it worked easy try and find
it
what are you looking for I'm sorry oh
I'm not the audio song trying that
rather than the soul I think oh ok i
thought you're looking for let's say
feel free to go to md n or whatever
Yassky j what's the URL for the bonfire
list i'm using a link that Quincy sent
me for troll oh but I know there's a way
to look at them either through the
github repo um it's the seed data
bonfires and then I think actually JSON
if I I know did a project on that and I
think he posted it in came from you is I
can't remember where that is that all
I'll try to find that thang this all
right maybe I was alright I was have to
look that up it's so simple but i always
forget it what's the greater than had
what's an earth I think it might be less
or subtract really check really quick I
can't believe I haven't have this
memorized yet such a simple thing
oh it doesn't work he changed his name
okay interesting okay yeah I know it's
just some oh right way your life that's
why I so it's true to figure out okay
that makes person let me guess the past
this will be quick
cause this missing semicolon sort all
function yeah okay call that Jerry
posted his attempt at where art thou I
can't see the link on my phone but
someone says he uses of ray every so I
definitely want to go check that out
thanks for following us MIT midterm
intern at X glad to have you hope I
didn't butcher your screen name
about work
so I didn't know you could pass
arguments into sort when I you do sort
it normally just kind of sorts them in
place and then jared says watch out for
a raid on sort with numbers because by
default it converts them to strings
which I do not know
this
this seems a little slow but we kind of
lag design of the mouse yeah it is a
little frustrating when you're it's not
your computer on the screen share Wow oh
no it make sense
okay I think I've seen this
implementation before
I'll just like one work either because
they're just numbers for fun okay so if
you you could do B minus a and it would
do it backwards right yep awesome is
definitely good to know
no that's 50
I'm sure the design way to do this spot
the quickly anyway I think the better
way is the way that we can do it without
errors different covers hopefully I can
do that
this works
maybe length is not defined oh yeah I
don't need like you know they're less
top-ranked here
yeah it's not adding anything some plus
equals lista i4ii long
you could just do list dot length you
don't have to do list and then list list
list list sorry I don't know why said it
for time yeah whoops finest ball right
and you don't do curly brackets which I
is that does that haven't had that okay
I didn't know you couldn't do that yeah
if you just have one then don't need it
some plus equals listed I interests me
we we should console log and see what is
accessing yeah
should i do control right everybody
gotta use that
I want to get that this
for
it should be 50 less than that equal to
0 you know what I I'm a spoke you were
right because what you were doing is
you're basically making I up to the
value of lists at one so you could just
do list at one because list dot length
is only going to give you to two items
in the array which should still give you
some of one so that's strange but does
that make sense yeah yes I don't know
why it's skipping the first one see if
anyone had shot I've done anything
stupid
broken this hawk
so saying you could do licit list at one
because you only have two values but
then your I would still be iterated that
many times you will sidewalk do you mind
if I type sure so list at zero right now
is one and the listed one is for and so
you're trying to get I ago one two three
four um yeah I just started saying
there's anyone along by guess you like
they're not in volume ABT well mentally
I think we're working with an array with
like four elements but you know there's
only two there today I'll see what I'm
saying yeah okay no oh yeah I'm not to
do a different way then I can't use it
for loop not a number wonder if that's
because of the sort and what well it's
all good twice oh that's not going to
work at all i can do this another little
oops Calgary
what's up human white ism I like your
screen name
clicker spot we're using a screen hero
to share the screen I'm assuming you're
asking about the screen sharing and for
broadcasting we use OBS and I don't
really know much about OBS to be honest
but so just go to work
I'll run our locally just in case I
don't crash your bowels in with mommy I
think actually it's set up so that it it
there's a safety break on it like it
only lets the stack get so big yeah six
so one two three it's just missing the
four I think oh ok so just to
there's probably better way to do this
what is it
awesome that's definitely not elegant by
any means but it'll work it works go
ahead and read it sorry the guy was on
rewriting if you want to take us how
about it sure um because i did it i
think i did it with recursion but i had
a problem trying to figure out the max
like the recursion part was like two
lines or something and then the rest was
figuring out which number was bigger
which seemed really silly Danny Fritz
says the bonfire times out after like
one second yeah super helpful humanoid
ISM says you guys could use map um yeah
I don't think we can use map or reduce
unless we already have created the array
of every number between the start and
end date otherwise it'll just be like
how we had it before or it didn't all
work that is a way to do it though um
basically generate entering do yeah
people are saying chat you'll reduce on
that um you could but if you're already
generating the right you might as well
in this half month instead of running in
a non-league twice
okay these were things I learned about
after the fact
returns the largest a zero or more
numbers so it's a static method of math
all right can you pass in an array is
little or no yes it expects anime well
can you do that to find us know what to
start out um well i'm going to try it
because last time like i said it took
way too long to do that I think ram de
is in scope yeah it is um and I have not
learned about it yet so one day one day
I haven't actually heard of all lambda
yeah it's a library um I think it's a
library see impression I get but it's
built for functional programming so it's
just a little different I know I'm a
couple of the campers are a lot more
knowledgeable about it this was included
yep looks little challenges yeah I think
it's it I think it's legal um I think
the idea is to solve it with vanilla
JavaScript first but Danny Fritz's
hopefully posting that for everyone
y'all check it out thanks but I think I
did it with recursion and I had to make
a helpful function because you don't
want those to change so
and it took in two values
how did this work the base case would be
min equals max if you start from the
bottom and work your way up see then you
just return else are you familiar with
recursive functions yeah back time Colt
else you're going to your turn no you
don't return there there's going to
increase when you start right a break
sum equals sum plus hmm
having a brain fart
now you have to call it all right I'm
not confident this will run person
maximum call stack size exceeded um I
recursion another one of these I changes
the actual function I don't know if I
was supposed to but I did just to do so
one of the recursions other things which
which what are you talking about on one
of these blackguards I figure what's
wrong but I had changed the actual
function that it calls the house I got
some value I didn't do it I should've
them your way back in oh I see
everything um
hmm we're running out of time I guess we
have a few more minutes
I don't think you're increasing men at
all you're only increasing the sum oh
wait no my nigga right there
okay let's talk this through so you want
to start with let's make sure we're
getting right ah not a number okay so
that's awful um that would probably
explain what if at least one of the
arguments cannot be converted to a
number the result is not a number
interesting i wonder why it cannot be
converted to a number do you have any
thoughts on that math for the wind has
changed
see try and look up the documentation
where you look nice
because men
if at least one of the arguments cannot
be converted is old it's not a number
they're passing those numbers though
right if passed it is an array oops we
lost some first second he'll come back
are you back your back oh this will do
that sometimes we'll come back up the
connection here just awful actually like
our wiring is so horrible our apartment
that's as a work of arson we're in a
rural area and it's funny sometimes the
day we get we want the fast internet
because we watch TV through the internet
like we don't have cable and some days
it's blazing fast in other days it's
like one whatever a second so yeah
that's how I just too we have a really
cable that goes just like through
multiple balls into different apartments
like they just shown a whole and ran a
killer way through it sure I don't know
why but I can't run all the way down to
the end and then run it back to us to
finish off interesting
Garretson you need to use apply to use a
collection of arguments okay
apply no memory okay
wonder what the Noah's for
okay we got numbers now so that is good
thank you now I have undefined how do we
get from there to undefined let's see
some is undefined if it that's what it
is I'm going to us
interesting three returning in the house
I'm doing the recursive call at which
I'm guessing I'm doing wrong so I'm
trying to figure out why that is then
plus the result of calling this which
will keep returning then until it
returns max and we keep increasing then
