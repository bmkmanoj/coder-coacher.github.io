system you can come here anytime of day
hang out ask questions and find other
campers to pair program with but first
you'll need a github account which we
can create by clicking here we'll want
to set a username and use a valid email
address and a password and click to
create an account github is free by
default for everyone you only have to
pay if you want private repositories
which you probably won't need to worry
about for some time so now that we're in
we can click settings and we can click
upload a new picture it's best for us to
include a photo of our face because that
makes it more natural when people talk
to us in the chat room so I'll upload a
picture of my face then also set my name
it's important to note that your email
is hidden by default both in github and
the chat room so you don't need to worry
about that aspect of your privacy if you
have a personal website you can include
a URL here if you want you can include
your company and where you live great
now we've configured our github account
before we join the chatroom let's take a
quick look at a github repository so
this is free code camps open-source web
application that you are using right now
everything is pretty well documented you
can see how many pull requests and
issues we've closed recently you can see
the directions if you
wanted to set up freako camp on your
local machine or if later if you want to
contribute to our open-source project
how to do so I'll just show you one
thing that's pretty cool
if you click seed and then you click
challenges and then you choose this get
set for free code camp JSON file you can
actually see the code that is creating
this challenge that you're working
through right now
to join our chat room challenge it's
pretty cool while you're here if you'd
like you can give our repository a star
which is kind of the equivalent of
liking something on github now let's
join the chatroom itself we can click
this link to go to git er which is a
great chatroom system you can see there
are already a lot of people here and we
can see what's going on in the chatroom
everything in the chat room is
completely public unless you want to
create a private room which you can do
as well so we'll authorize this
application so git er is going to pull
the information from github that we just
entered such as our photo and our name
and our location and here we are we're
in the main free code camp chatroom so I
can say something like hello world I
heard about free code camp from a friend
I want to become a full-stack software
engineer so just tell us a little bit
about yourself and you'll see that
people will frequently greet you quite
quickly because there are a whole lot of
people in here and we can even chat
privately with people this is Michael
Johnson he's in charge of our nonprofit
projects so I can click chat private
hi Michael you'll see that I'm getting a
lot of these notifications what you'll
want to do is when you're in the main
chat room and you can see Michael's
responded to me right here so I can have
a private conversation with Michael I
can also go back to the main free code
camp chat room and what I'm going to do
is I'm going to change my notifications
so instead of being notified for all
messages which is hundreds of messages
an hour I'm just going to choose notify
me when somebody mentions me that way
I'll just know if somebody's talking to
me and I can jump in and talk back to
them so my recommendation is to keep
this chat room open while you work on
your other challenges and you can even
download an app for whichever type of
computer operating system you're using
or if you have a smart phone so you can
use it on the go enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
