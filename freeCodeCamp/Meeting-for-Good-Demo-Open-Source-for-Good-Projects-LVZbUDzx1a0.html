code camp and today i am so excited to
show you the newest tool that campers
have built it's called meeting for good
and what it does is it makes it really
simple to schedule meetings with people
in multiple time zones this is a problem
that we've suffered for the
two-and-a-half years of free code camp
as we've grown if you don't know we code
pro bono for nonprofits and we have
developers all around the world so that
also means we have developers in a bunch
of different time zones and scheduling
conferences to build apps has been a
real headache
meeting for good makes it much much
easier very quickly i would like to
thank JP in sao paulo
anna rude in singapore bob in california
and akira in new caledonia for helping
build this app so let me show you how it
works right now you just see a landing
page it's very simple is that meeting
got free code camp calm and we are
hosting it for free let me just sign in
you we have Google authentication and we
land on my dashboard this is really my
dashboard and kind of a sneak peek at
some of the stuff we have going on but
you can see it's a card view there are
five different events that I have on my
own dashboard and only one of them I can
delete and that's because I created this
one the others were created by volunteer
project managers and I've simply been
invited to them so let's take a closer
look at one let's look at the foodbank
react if occation we've built an app for
food banks and we're currently react to
fiying that so that campers who have
learned react can help us contribute
you can see that it is automatically
displaying in my timezone it has
detected that on my computer and that's
really the the bread and butter of what
this does is it just removes any effort
on converting and thinking about who is
where you can also see what is really
the golden egg and that is the times
that we all have in common we actually
just had this meeting because 232 3
worked for everyone today you can see a
participants list
Jason is our volunteer project manager
James and Kenji are campers who are
developing this app and then there's me
let's look at the Devere details page so
here you can see there is a heat map
grid that shows times that get darker as
we have more times in common so you can
see that from 2:30 to 3:00 everybody was
available and this is just a handy tool
upon hover to show who isn't available
so say we really needed to meet at 2:00
we would know that Kenji wasn't
available and we can just say hey Kenji
if you can't make it maybe we'll fill
you in
or maybe could you try to make it at
2:00 so it's really cool that it offers
that granular ability to see what is
preventing a meeting from happening or
really just let you know who you need to
keep in the loop and maybe send a recap
so you can see the following times work
for everyone again and if I scroll down
you can see the participants I can add a
participant to this so say I'd like to
invite Quincy Larsen I can click here's
a recent guest I've invited him to
something before and I can click invite
I can also this has a custom URL and I
can just copy the link and send that to
somebody in an email there's a lot of
different ways to invite people maybe we
can just create an event from scratch to
show you how that works so I've come to
create a new event I'm going to give it
a name test event for demo and we'll say
that we want to meet today tomorrow or
Friday we're developers so not
10 a.m. and we're willing to meet pretty
late into the night create that event
and what that means is anybody who
received this event will not be able to
share availability outside of what you
kind of imposed from the outset so it
immediately has taken me to my own view
and I can submit my availability so
let's say I'm only available here and
here and then I can submit that it saves
it and that begins the heat map so you
can see I'm not available there but
Michael Johnson is available from 5:00
and onward and now I can add a
participant I just get a copy of that
link and I'll uh I'll send that off
later so going back to the dashboard
view you can see my new test event is on
my dashboard I can delete it I have
privileges to delete this because I am
the event creator and yeah that's really
all it's super simple that's how it
works we have a lot of aspirations this
is really just the MVP I would like to
see Google Calendar integration and
other things like that there is also
this notification system that works
really well and the guys added an about
page which links to our github repo just
like everything else that we build it is
open source so feel free to look through
the code add issues as you find them and
help us test it we are looking forward
to hearing your feedback and we want to
make it even better
but for now hopefully this helps you as
much as it helps us thanks so much for
watching and be on the lookout for other
cool apps that campers are building with
open source for good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
