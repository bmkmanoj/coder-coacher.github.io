the project management section of free
code camp where we basically maintain
the projects for the nonprofit's one of
the tools we use in maintaining the
projects for these nonprofits is a
service called Trello tre llo it's calm
and basically once you sign up you'll
get a little she like this there will be
like an inch reward on it what I want to
go show you guys today is a little bit
about how these boards work and a little
bit about how we use them at free code
camp so what I'd like to do is I'd like
to show you this this is uh this is just
a fictitious over here I have a personal
project over here Trello is an amazing
app for organizing whatever the whatever
in the world you can think about
organizing it's super super awesome like
that anyway so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go ahead in here into this
project Trello and basically you know
just kind of review a few things with
you we have the project information
replace the functionality of a wordpress
project or wordpress plugin this is
basically kind of like how a normal
project would work in to us so basically
replace the project or replace the
functionality of wordpress plugin not
not a huge project that we would take on
but we would still take something like
this on let's say that it's just like
limited to a calendar plugin and that we
will have the ability for the
reoccurring events which it was
available in the original plug and
hypothetically so what we have is we
have as an authorized user will be able
to highlight important events as an
authorized user I'll be able to add
events as an authorized user I'll be
able delete events and as an authorized
user I'll be able to send invites to
users for the events so let's just
pretend that you know we're working
through were developer as a developer
you take this you say I'm going to go
ahead and as an authorized user I'm
going to take an we're going to go ahead
and I'm going to start working on this
so you start working on it and you work
through it everything's good basically
you're like this is done I've done it as
an authorized user I'll be able to make
highlight the important events so that
basically will sit over and recently
completed and then during like the
follow-up scope meetings and stuff what
will happen is is this will move into
demoed as you show show the stakeholder
in and what will happen is is they look
at it they approve it they're like okay
this is great or
are they may take and they may send it
back to a user story and say you know
hey we need to go ahead and you know
highlight important events but only in
yellow pretty straight up and down you
just do that and then you know you bring
it back recently completed after it goes
to in progress down low and then it's
complete now let's say that we get
something like this as an authorized
user I'll be able to delete events well
what happened here is there's a comment
and there's you know a couple checklists
associated with this so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to go ahead and head
into it basically there is a checklist
you can click checklist and you can
create a checklist you the title is the
title the checklist and you can copy
items but doesn't really matter so
basically what happens is you'll get a
checklist and you can add items to it so
you can go ahead and you can add stuff
to it basically in this one and you have
a make button making the bottom wasn't a
big deal but making the query well
there's a problem so what happens is is
you can come down here and go hey I am
having trouble with mongo DB delete
query and then you can call in the
basically the whole board and this what
will happen with this is this will send
a notice out to all the people
associated with the board yeah let's see
if I can actually spell board right but
whatever it'll send it out to the whole
entire people and then you can see
what's going on down here and so that
that basically flags people that you
know there's an issue you know you you
pulling attention to it by adding that
comment and then someone can probably
take and pop some code in there or just
even put up a pull request or whatever
and you can subscribe if you would like
the developer and be like oh hey you
know I need to take a know when this is
updated so that's pretty simple the
other thing is is you know with
you can click in here and you can click
due date and you know it's due tomorrow
you know or were shed it was due
yesterday and you know now it's all
turning red and stuff saying hey you
know look at me look at me you know so
what then happens is up I took in you
know I figured out the query and I
finally made it so this is all good and
it's ready to bounce on over to the
recently-completed that's nice and easy
so you can just take and keep working
through it like this or if you need to
couple if you're working a couple
different things at once because they're
real tightly tied together you can just
pull them out like that and you can move
everything around on these I mean you
know nothing's nothing has to stay where
it is it's basically like the best way
that I've heard it described is like
sticky notes on a cork board in the
second that I heard that this is like
the greatest piece of software in the
world so that's kind of like the basic
functionality as you'll use it as a
developer as a project manager will go
through and add various things to each
of these during scope meetings and
additional sprint meetings and stuff
like that we may add more stuff just
kind of as hey they've already got this
stuff done let's add a few more things
here because you know it wasn't in the
original scope but they're nice to haves
and we can do it next thing we have is
the menu you can go ahead and add menus
you can just type in their email address
michael is one of the main met guys over
free code camp he's also basically in
charge of the project manager core I add
him to a bunch of stuff so it's just
super easy to get a hold of you know he
basically can drop in and see what I'm
up to or see what's going on there's a
bunch of other stuff you can do like
settings email to board settings you
know you can change your team common
pravesh permissions basically it's just
super super easy to use you can close
the board which basically deletes it
that's basically kind of a super high
level thing you can change the
background if you don't like blue you
can also filter cards by you know colors
and you know who is assigned to and all
that stuff you know basically it just
really helps with like everything that
needs to be done on a project this is a
really really awesome app and as it sits
right now we haven't really found a tool
better than it for doing our
information or are doing our project
management but as it sits this is you
know one of the best tools that we've
come across anyways so I thank you guys
for listening to this hopefully you guys
have a better understanding of how to
use Trello</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
