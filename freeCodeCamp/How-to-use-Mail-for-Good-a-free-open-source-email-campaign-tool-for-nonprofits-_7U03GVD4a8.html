source for good mail for good
application setup tutorial I'm Quincy
Larson I'm going to walk you through
setting up this application we are going
to assume for this tutorial that you
already have mail for good deployed to
the cloud on a virtual private server
for example an Amazon ec2 instance or a
digitalocean droplet so you will connect
to that by going directly to the IP
address you can see here I'm actually
tunneling through localhost you will
probably just visit the IP address
directly and you're going to sign in
with Google it will choose the email
address that you plan to use to send the
emails and then you're going to jump
right down here to settings and we're
going to go ahead and add the Amazon
credentials so first things first we'll
go to AWS we'll login and we're going to
go to identity access management this
will assume that you already have Amazon
SES configured and you've added your
basic domain information to that and
we'll just create a new user so we'll
call this mail for good test and we're
going to grant programmatic access we
don't need AWS console management access
next we're going to create a group
linking to grant full access to three
different Amazon AWS services the first
is simpler simple email service SES and
we're going to give the group a name
and then SES Alexis asked us simple
serve a simple queueing service full
access and SNS simple notification
service we're going to grant doubtful
access again the only one of these
services that you'll need to pre
configure is SES itself now that we have
the group set up and we have the user
will click Next to review and we'll
create the user so here we go this is
going to be the access key so I'll copy
this and I'll go over and I will paste
it into the xsq then I will go back here
I'll show my secret I'll copy that I'll
go back here and paste that into the
secret access key the SES email address
is the email that I'm planning to send
my emails from and the region will be
whatever region you've configured it to
by default I think it's us east I'll
click Submit all right so these are
saved and we're ready to go you don't
need to worry about the white label URL
at this point so we can go to our
dashboard we can see that we have no
campaigns I haven't done anything let's
set everything up first let's create a
list so it will automatically assign a
time stamp as the lists name so you
don't need to worry about that unless
you want to and we're going to use my
test emails dot CSV file and we'll just
upload it directly and it'll process and
we can check the notifications up here
and we can see the upload of the CSV and
it's successfully uploaded and it's
ready now we're going to create a
template
so again it'll automatically assign a
timestamp is the name so I'll just use
the name and see Larson at the sender
and my email address as the email that
it'll come from I'm going to insert okay
so first I'm going to set it to an HTML
email technically plain text emails have
higher conversion rates historically
based on a lot of data analysis but
we're going to use HTML so we can show
all the coil HTML features here so I'm
going to insert a tracking pixel I want
to track link click throughs and I'm
going to add an unsubscribe link
so first I'm willing to add a subject
test email then this has a cool WYSIWYG
editor it'll convert it into HTML so I
will say hello and I'm going to go ahead
and make this heading 1 sighs that's the
h1 tag in HTML and then I'm going to say
greetings your email address is Rome's I
can use this form of insertion to add
their email from the CSV the CSV has an
email column now I can add a link go to
free code camp comp and what I'll do is
I'll just put a single thing in here and
I will use
so I'm going to put a slash in front of
it first
and then I close up the brackets like
that and and I'll say sincerely Quincy
and then I will just to show you that
you have full ability to like color it
I'm going to change the background color
to this kind of orangey color you can do
a lot of stuff with this in terms of
text formatting you want to make it a
quote maybe not and you can insert links
and stuff so I'm going to go to the next
step and I can see a preview of what
it's going to look like and I'll save
that template now that I have my list
uploaded and I have my campaign or my
template created I'm going to create a
campaign so I will select a template
which is the template I created earlier
you'll see that as soon as I click that
it fills everything in below and I'm
going to select my list and I'm going to
come down here and
I am going to send it alright so you'll
see that the status is ready sometimes
if you have a larger list it may take a
while to process but this list only has
about 80 miles on it so now I'm going to
click manage and I'm going to click send
this will send it to all the subscribers
and now I can open my email and we can
see what these look like so first of all
I included three of my own emails you
can put like a plus one plus two behind
your email and then it'll be recognized
as a distinct email but it'll still go
to the end the same result place at
least with Gmail addresses so you can
see that here's the HTML and click here
and it takes me to free code camp column
and this is indeed my email address so
that that interpellation work properly
and then if I want I can unsubscribe and
it will give me this notice you have
been unsubscribed from this mailing list
also it'll email me this confirmation
that the entire campaign was delivered
and so it has my campaign name and it'll
tell me that it was successfully
delivered and took zero point zero seven
minutes which I think we can send about
100 emails a second depending on your
rate limits on ends on IDs so unless
this cracked like a list of at least 100
it probably wouldn't have even shown up
on that so I'm just going to archive
these and now we can go back over to
mail for good and we can go back to
manage campaigns and we can see that
it'll take a minute for this to tick try
to refresh it and see if that works
but basically it's going to track the
fact that we had a scent delivered a
complaint and a bounced and and this
this has like a two-minute heartbeat I
believe so we just have to wait until
it's completed and then this should
service let's go ahead and take a look
real quick it one thing we can look at
is then we can see the if we go to the
quick threes we can see that there was a
click through we can see that two of
them bounce five of them were delivered
we had here we go
we had zero complaints and four
unsubscription if we go to our list we
can see that we can see confirmation
information from each of these one of
these lists will automatically complain
into the complaint simulator from Amazon
one of these will automatically given
out of the office and our software will
basically unsubscribe people who who
bounced automatically and then the one
user that I unsubscribe manually is now
unsubscribe as well so we are this went
from seven to four and we have all the
data on exactly what happened there so
this concludes the mail for good
tutorial now for good is completely
open-source it's completely free Amazon
SES I think charges one penny per 100
emails sent so it's like ten thousand
emails for a dollar it's extremely
economical you will not find a cheaper
email service and we are running this on
a ten or oh I think it's a one gigabyte
is it one gigabytes 1 gigabyte AWS
instance
Jewish one-gigabyte digitalocean
instance for I think $10 a month and I
am you know we spend very little money
we're able to do our email campaigns at
scale and just to just to give some
ideas of the numbers we're pushing we're
pushing about 700,000 emails in about
three hours
lesson slightly more than three hours to
send all those out with this and it
costs you know 70 bucks so it's
extremely inexpensive and of course
there since you have the server all the
email addresses stay within your system
they're not exposed to anybody else and
importantly you have full control over
this you're not paying any sort of fees
for having the list stored in the
service and you can export it you have
full control so if you have any
questions or anything please send me an
email
Quincy it Frank okay calm or better yet
visit the mill for good github repo and
you can create github issues for things
that you'd like to see we have a number
of things that are already on route and
we welcome you to use this and we
welcome your questions and our goal is
just to build the best email campaign
tool that we can build and make it as
economical as possible for nonprofits
and other small businesses to be able to
reach their customers inexpensively and
effectively thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
