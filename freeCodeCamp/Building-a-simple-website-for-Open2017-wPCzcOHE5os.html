about to start streaming okay so this
should pop up pretty soon we should have
a good stream gone should have
reasonably good sound and reasonable
compression ratio I'm totally open if
anybody has any feedback so I'll just
just look forward to people jumping in
and seeing what you all think so what
I'm doing today is basic info is going
to be building a simple website for open
2017 I'll just nuke those yeah all right
and then does that immediately get
updated how does that work if i refresh
okay so it says all changes saved so now
hey everybody welcome to the live stream
I'm just doing this out of nowhere to
have some fun and to do some live coding
just I haven't done it in a while so it
looks like we've got a few people are
watching now everybody welcome I'll
throw the have you here I promise that
I'm gonna do my best to make this
interesting and fun so first first uh
first things first how is the sound
and also how's the video is it
reasonably fast okay cool alright video
is great
alright cool so as you know we used to
stream on Twitch well we have like 65
thousand people who follow our YouTube
channel now so I'm like why not stream
on YouTube alright so just to let you
all know what we're doing we're doing
open
hashtag open 2017 so we're having a big
live stream which will be much better
done than this this is just literally me
sitting down and basically on a whim I
was taking a shower after the gym and I
was like I should stream so all right so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead
and just grab a simple website and I'm
gonna pull it down and we're going to
start building it into something that
looks better
so we happen to have a really cool
website just grab this see so what I'm
gonna do is on free code camp we have
our design style guide I like this a lot
now it's written in PostScript I have no
idea what that entails let's take a look
at the so there's no there's not
actually any index okay so what I'll do
is I'll just probably pull this repo
down clone or download so we're gonna go
into terminal that new call the things
that I don't need just to free up as
much space as possible
so okay so I'm gonna open up terminal
okay and then we're gonna CD into web
which is my root directory where I store
a lot of this stuff and I'm gonna go
sublime oh wait
you get clone and then I'll paste my
clone repo there all right I have to
have specified where I wanted to go git
clone and we'll call it open 2017
all right cloning into open 2017 now
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to push
this back up but I'm gonna push it to a
new positive re and
ideally I don't want this to be shown as
a fork because if anybody contributes to
a fork on github they're not going to
get the open-source contribution credit
that they would normally get from
contributing to an on fork open-source
project so I need to make sure that
whatever happens so let's do git remote
okay so there's no good remote oh wait
I'm not in the directory yet so let me
CD in get remote okay so I'm gonna get
get remote RM actually you know what
I'll just do RM dot get and that's going
to completely remove the git history now
get in it case it's reinitialized so git
remote so get remote RM origin now let
me make this bigger for y'all I want to
make sure you all can see and keep in
mind like I don't have a second monitor
here I'm literally just working off my
macbook air so I can't frequently I'll
have to kind of tag back to the chat oh
wow a hundred people are watching holy
cow that's awesome so first of all if
you're just joining us we're gonna be
building a very simple static website
that will help us for the purpose of
having our New Year's Eve livestream
which we have a lot of exciting guests
that you're going to hear all about ok
so I will be somewhat monitoring the
chat I think there might be some free
cooking of quarantine people here so
Texas 2010 is one of our core team
members he's our moderate one of our
moderators on git er so he can help
answer some questions as well all right
so I'm gonna dive back in so this is our
style guide which looks pretty sweet
I'll show you what it looks like I'm
grabbing it because I like the way it
looks and it's like a good basis for us
to build everything else out and you
know it's already got like this stuff in
here so I'll just use the same format
basically and and
that are using free coke camps logo here
it's just gonna be boom open 2017 which
I'll just do twitter.com I was good have
Twitter and let me get a link to this
stream what is the link to the stream
it's just how do I share this stream
stream options ok cards gee how do I
share this stream events copy link open
up in incognito alright it looks like
that is the public URL for that so now
what I'll go back to Twitter and I'll
just say gearing up for hashtag open
2017 live now yay
alright hopefully that'll inspire some
people to come and watch this alright
now this is what our design style guide
looks like so what I need to do is
basically take this and modify it to
display information from the upcoming
stream so I've got like all the data
here ok so now that I've pulled this
down I'll do get o get remote just make
sure you don't have a remote I remove
the remote now I'm going to go back in
here and I'm going to go to a frico camp
organization I'm going to create a new
repository and it will just be open 2017
and I'll say a landing page for our 2017
for our New Year's Eve 2017 live stream
it's public and a license
gonna do the BSD 3 which is the license
that we use on all of our open source
projects it's pretty permissive but it
basically says you can't pretend you're
free code camp and like using this isn't
an endorsement of of your project like
on behalf of a free cocaine so Wow
somebody's already watching it that's
nice he's watching it Berkeley ok so I
guess they automatically watch things
because I'm pretty sure their reaction
time is not you know less than 17
seconds so now we're going to push up
some code so what I'll do is I will get
the git repo let's see I could probably
just guess it I'll just go back so right
now I'm going to be the sole contributor
so I'll do get remote add or get at okay
so here we go so this is I'm just going
to do get remote add and then instead of
about bucket it's gonna be open 2017
duck it I think I might have to specify
origin come on Zia says you're supposed
to catch those things all right we need
to tell Bobby that his zsh is not
sufficiently afforded okay so now we're
just gonna do get push origin master oh
wait
satis let me just make sure everything's
in here so I wanted to get at a okay so
it's not picking up any changes so I'll
just make a quick change I'll just do
sublime readme and D I'll go in here and
I'll just say the simple website that
will host free code or just are open
2017 New Year's Eve livestream so we've
got this and then we'll change this to
this we'll say happy new year 2017 this
simple website will host alright because
I'm like a copy editor basically what I
do most of my life okay so I say now
we've got some changes get add a git
commit and let me check the log oh darn
it I thought I'd believe you big I
thought I completely deleted the git
history
I'm not sure if this is gonna be treated
as a fork I didn't fork over thing
github so let's have to get push it and
see what happens get add a git commit em
update readme get push origin master and
we'll just push directly to master bed
form but Oh get pull origin master it's
gonna pull the license down ok sweet now
if we go back to the code we should have
our code here and one branch should be
master oh wow five people are watching
it
let's see who all watching it Joseph Joe
is working on some of our projects right
now our test for projects
Rafi thanks for following us skip skip
Peeta thank you for watching us and for
following this repository watching them
for changes in it ok so now i refresh
boom everything's there so this has a
bunch of stuff we're not going to need
I'll just clear out the croft later my
main thing that I want to do is
HTTP what was the name of the thing that
oh yeah there we go
hipster it's like HTTP ter this is a
cool tool for launching static sites so
we've got our own little static site
here and so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna open it up I'm gonna open a new
tab CD web open 2017 and I was just
let's make a quick change to the logo
I'm just gonna change that lime dot and
I'll just go index.html and so this is
the title which will change to I'll give
it a better title later I mean this
isn't something where I'm gonna go in
and like micromanage the yeah I'll just
throw the hashtag in front of it I mean
why did it why not
we can dominate that fash tag so I've
got the github analytics already baked
in here image Rico Camp SVG okay so this
is putting an image in here what we can
do instead is we can just do hash tag
open or open in 2017 and so that's going
to be that's in the body it's in the
header section and I'm just gonna make
that freaking massive let's do h1 and
we'll assume h1 is reasonably large all
right it's got the underline so I need
to restyle it I'm not sure whether text
is grey probably because this is styled
to be grey let's see what classes are in
here the top here oh it's crack opened
the CSS style okay good so the guy who
built this is Hayden Mills he's a
designer and developer he's still in
college I think he's on the East Coast
I'm not exactly remembering it Hayden if
you're in the audience sorry that I
don't remember more specific via
graphical details about you
so we
let's see color zero okay interesting he
just didn't even use the 3ds and things
for that let's see where's the hero
okay top hero so this doesn't specify so
we can we can change this right here so
let's go in to inspect so it's got this
a visited so we probably just want to
remove the possibility maybe I'll just
not make it a link maybe that'll solve
some of the style issues let's just make
that a tag and just open 2017 this is
gonna be super rough and then my goal is
let's let's get a bunch of people to
jump in and improve it that doesn't look
terrible so I think what we can do is we
can make this div or will do h1 and then
I'll do class equals ginormous text and
ginormous text uh-huh I don't know if
anybody likes that word I just it just
came to mind an enormous text you might
notice that I'm using sublime instead of
using webstorm which is what I would
normally use for a big app the reason
I'm using sublime is because it's very
lightweight and I don't want to
completely destroy my macbook air by
streaming while also running webstorm so
we'll just say font size is you know
sixty pixels let's see what that does
boom that's bigger or if we want to do
120 boom okay so you can see it's not
like beautiful necessarily but it's not
terrible maybe this is like the armchair
designer in me saying is not terrible
okay so now we can come down here and
we've got our categories so let's take a
look at these different categories right
so we're gonna let's talk about what we
need I've got this list of people who
are going to be here
for the event let me make it bigger so
everybody can get hyped up right so
Berkeley is gonna be here Heather who's
built a whole bunch of our curriculum
Kyle Simpson who created you don't know
Jas is gonna be here
Geoff Meyerson who runs software
engineering daily he's gonna be here
schibetta who has written a variety of
articles about getting into open source
is gonna be here Peter who is building a
whole lot of our interactive test
challenges shawn smith who built our
alpha react challenges which i'm going
to go back to here and i'll just drop
the link right in here it's it's pretty
cool if you're interested this is zero
people watching what happened
oh okay 136 people okay it's just slow
so alright so now what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to share the link to this
which is like surge Huw surge dot sh to
deploy but check that out that is a link
to the is it clickable okay good YouTube
makes them clickable I was worried about
that that is a link to jump directly
into the react challenges which are
pretty cool
these are alpha we're gonna incorporate
these into free cocaine's platform but
you can try them out early and give
feedback and we have a forum thread
where you can do so for let me just
check real quick alright so we'll just
find will find the alpha react this
should pull it up yeah so if anybody
who's watching is curious and wants to
work through the reaction ologist here's
the thread you can see that 100 or 26
people have already replied to it it's a
good healthy discussion about these so
I'll throw that in there too
yeah Visual Studio code I've heard good
things about that and that's open source
so the react projects Klaus asked if the
react challenges were already
incorporated actually the react projects
have been incorporated for an entire
year however now we're actually going to
add our individual pause this on my side
so I don't have to watch my weird face
move yeah they actually react challenges
so you're gonna actually be able to work
through and learn react interactively
you won't have to use Facebook's
documentation anymore if you don't want
to for some reason that didn't say let
me try it again
did that work okay error message not
sent error try again huh why not
maybe I just okay check this out
bitly let's see if they'll let me do a
bitly link for it maybe it's too long
maybe it's considered a spammy URL who
knows what the heck's going on in
YouTube's mind there we go Billy you are
L did it go through okay yeah I think it
went through good so follow that URL and
you'll be able to get to the thread all
right so let's get back to building
shall we so we've got this we've got
this interface open 2017 so I'm gonna
say I think the top thing is gonna be
guests that should be definitely up top
I think that's important so we'll go to
guests and this will just be low we'll
change it to guests so I'm this is not a
particularly sophisticated was that all
caps yeah I'll just stick with the
commission of all caps and now that
we've got the there we go
guess so our logo appears in two
variations so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna say
these fun people will drop in to our
live stream throughout the throughout
the night
I feel like underneath this open 2016 I
think I should put like h2 and I'll just
go ahead and say New Year's Eve and it's
going to be 11 p.m. through 3 a.m. est
there we go
let's just take a look at how that looks
oh that doesn't look good
so what we need is some sort of get
Jackie alright it's not terrible and if
you want to get extremely janky don't do
this at home because people will took
you out you can just yeah anti patterns
for all okay so and notice that I put a
periods behind the a.m. but not behind
the p.m. okay so there we go and then
I'll just
is this already centered yeah I think so
so I'll just I'm gonna actually embed
the YouTube stream in there in fact what
I'll do right now is I'm going to embed
our YouTube stream right here I'll put
it under the the stream actually I'll
put that above the whole guest thing so
we'll just attempt to throw this in
there and I'm gonna have to go in and
probably learn a lot of the CSS and
what's going on here what what Hayden
was thinking when he put all this
together but I'll just do a I'll just
grab the YouTube embed oh wait you know
what I think I could just grab it right
from here if I do like embed now so
let's go open up another incognito tab
I'll grab the YouTube feed and now I'll
pause this and it should be a way to
embed it right here okay maybe not how
do i bed this just one there was like a
quick and easy embed trick here
information so that's cool that it's got
a link to our site oh wait add - okay
I'm just signing it in order to do that
so let me just I'm streaming in that
account like that person the free cool
camp persona in chrome so let's pause
that and now we're gonna go down here
and we're just gonna go boom what weight
this year button okay let's see is there
any thought there was a simple way to
embed maybe YouTube decided they didn't
want to make it so easy to embed things
I mean they've even got a StumbleUpon
button here and they don't have an embed
okay so what I'm gonna do but a nuke
that and I'm just gonna go
embed a YouTube video
oh and here's the thing salt if you had
a solved you get much better results
okay so actually interestingly like this
guy online just see what they said you
know what I'm going to sort by time this
is so advanced Google foo past year it
should be reasonably good okay with logo
from a bit okay YouTube videos okay I
saw you to black screen okay this looks
good
so from February it's on a form that
isn't gonna have a whole new show you
know pop-up modal's trying to get me to
subscribe to a mailing list okay YouTube
has got to go okay okay
domi three schools o w3 schools
everybody's favorite okay so here we go
they're just saying use the html5 video
attribute but then this isn't
specifically YouTube this is just an
html5 video what I was looking for would
be like a good code snippet that I could
just basically copy and paste like the
copy and paste coder I'm choosing to be
today so yeah oh wow this is like an
embedded Google search I think well
maybe it's actually specific to their
site okay this is embarrassing let's
check and see if anybody on chat has
already found a good URL you won't check
the chit okay just right-click the video
okay so alright thanks everybody
I will check the chat more frequently
when I get stuck so let's go back here
and I just right-click the video copy
embed code my god okay thank you so now
I'm gonna go back over to here and I'll
just just see what happens when we just
throw this I for a minute I can make it
responsive I'm pretty sure this uses
bootstrap or call access no maybe not so
maybe we'll just have to manually make
it
Pontiff or use a something else okay so
let's go back here there we go
so unfortunately it pushed all this
stuff down but I didn't push this down
so you need to figure out what is
controlling that so oh you know what it
is it's because I put it inside that
container I think so if it's above the
container completely cool I know it's
just off to the side so responsive div
CSS media query I frame so I'm gonna see
if I can find like some quick and easy
way that I can put this in the middle
and have it dynamically resize without
having to use bootstrap this looks
promising Ben Marshalls blog okay you
don't need my location okay so this is
literally the use case is embedding a
YouTube video so we can go down here we
could say remove all the width and
height attributes okay we've done so add
a container around it so we'll call it
intrinsic container interesting choice
for a div name
and yes I do plan to indent that I mean
this really this this entire div should
be within a container probably okay and
now we add a little copypasta don't
forget to specify the ratio of your
iframe I'm pretty sure the ratio gonna
be the standard YouTube video ratio
let's see what this does
let's go back to our style see it says
hey my daughter's in here I'll just uh
I'm gonna jump down to the bottom I'm
gonna you YouTube see YouTube responsive
give code just so I so it's clear to
anybody who looks at this that's what it
is so transit container sixteen by
nineteen so this is sixteen sixteen by
nine is the default aspect ratio I think
for pretty much any video after
2010-2011 so now we say let's see allow
full screen okay in fact you know I'm
just gonna drop this whole thing in you
just change that
so let's see what he was saying about
actually specifying the aspect ratio
class to your iframe if you don't your
eye friend could disappear okay so I'm
trans oh so okay he's saying just add
that it's pretty good tense I hope you
all can hear them sufficiently alright
so now we have what should be responsive
div and like you know I'm not going to
ever use this 4 by 3 ratio so I'll just
drop that in fact since in like pretty
much every situation it's gonna be like
that I'm just gonna throw that in there
and then I can delete the div completely
or I can delete that additional class
completely great now let's just refresh
that didn't work oh it put it like way
up like the the entire top give it it's
weird it's like you put it on top of
everything position relative height 0
overflow:hidden padding:0 maybe I need
to throw it inside the intrinsic
container so the intrinsic container is
there ok so it's just applying that to
the stuff inside of it
alright time to put on the
troubleshooting hat I was hoping to keep
keep plowing forward without having to
do this sort of head scratching but it
looks like I'm going to need to so
and we throw this into a container to do
class equals container and I'll just
have that in wait to bet in have been in
yeah okay see what this now hey that
worked kind of but container must have
some very specific dimensions so let's
take a look at the container code which
I know I could be doing that in the
browser but I'm just gonna go and kind
of cheat and look at it here huh
did he use some sort of library because
I don't see a declaration of container
in here yeah
okay so let's um take a look at his CSS
grid CSS okay so this is he's using
something called skeleton copyright 2011
Wow
is this current I wonder I mean he's
done a beautiful job I'm not saying I'm
gonna just kick this to the curb if it's
old school but let's see dead simple
responsive water plate okay good so oh
yeah he's got these classes it's got a
fluid grid so I just used that so you P
I'm gonna be learning a new CSS
framework today first of all I'm gonna
take a moment to check the chat it's
start way to pop the chat out pop out
chat yes okay I'm gonna just make it
over here you can't hear my music at all
so how do I kick your new how do i how
do i um make somebody a mod in here up
Texas 2010 actually you already have a
oh yeah you're already a moderator so
yeah if that guy is clearly spamming I
mean this is definitely a spam message I
would just kick them out I don't think
it's a human being that's what I'm
talking so insensitively about it I'm
almost certain it's about so
yeah I'll be shakeout be also seems to
be like a spambot
so just to double-check people are
saying they can't hear the music at all
so let me see if I can figure out how to
help them hear the music it's very low
my voice is much higher than the music
that may be the problem so if I go into
sound sorry for the trippy effect Siri
I'm gonna go to the sound and my input
volume was here if I turn it down
multi-output of devices aggregate up
with volume up with volume is this does
this change the volume at all this is
the actual okay so we throw that on
there and then let me check and see if
it's changed no I'm not sure how to get
that volume up the system volume up
sound flower bed which is what I use
previously when I screamed they defecate
'add it so hey Oh Manish Giri welcome
so yeah the spammers if you see a
spammer like it's almost certainly a bot
you're probably not gonna hurt anybody's
feelings just you know with extreme
prejudice because you know nobody likes
spam so you have my permission
in fact Texas is hearing-impaired so I'm
gonna go ahead and say hey hey Texas
please ban spammers with extreme
prejudice
actually I'm not sure that I hope that
expression isn't offensive I always hear
it used in like Robocop and stuff like
that terminate with extreme prejudice is
euphemism for aggressive execution okay
so yeah so it's not it's not related to
like any I think it's basically just
like a cool 1980 style word okay yeah so
boom get an external Bluetooth and play
in the background I could certainly do
that right now I'm I'm thinking of
things I can do right now to improve the
output volume
you
see any way to do it in here MIDI
alright so we're gonna do how about now
is that changing it doesn't seem to have
changed it hold the output device just
built-in output is what it once I think
configure speakers is just I'm sorry
that you all can't hear the music I
spent like a lot of time getting
SoundCloud sound flower installed hoping
that it would you'd be able to hear it
it's just very low so if I turn built-in
microphone test test
test ok this much louder so turn this
down test test test
doesn't seem to affect the volume so I
couldn't Theory turn that down and then
turn up well this is already maxed out
so yeah I was just
I'll wait for somebody to hop on with me
later and we'll fix to the sound but if
you want to hear the music that I'm
listening to you I'm just listening to
monster cat which has an awesome youtube
channel so go there and you can hear the
music alright umm hey joseline you my
little baby came in here you'll see her
hey joseline you want to say hi to the
good people of YouTube hi she wants to
high-five you all yeah high five alright
doesn't go in and destroy stuff in
mommy's room okay daddy's dreaming right
now he has to he has to work so go
destroy elsewhere daddy indeed here
let's let's hop over here and I'm gonna
be right back to take your physically
take her in there otherwise you won't go
once I get
okay thank you everyone for your
patience okay so back to the task hey
thanks everybody for high-fiving her she
is like the light of my life but I
wanted to take a break from her off on
the stream so I think we're good with
this this seems to made this div
responsive let's let's take a look here
so yeah it responds it's responsive okay
so maybe we didn't even need to use this
special logic maybe we could have just
used the skeleton framework container so
you row class row okay so I I think I
could probably just put this in a class
row let's try that
now let's take a look okay so we put it
away over there for some reason and then
maybe if I specify that I want it to be
12 div class row div class 12 columns
again this is kind of like when you
don't read the manual and you just dive
in 12 columns
I like how they just used the word 12
instead of using something you know more
difficult because bootstrap uses like
yeah let's take a look now we don't need
that anymore so
hmm okay okay so they don't actually
have a an example that involves
container
okay so centers everything that's cool
is railway the default font that's a
great typography selection for a default
font
okay so honestly I'm not sure what to do
about centering this dev if we were
using bootstrap it would be like super
simple media queries okay we don't need
to deal with those in theory it's
getting skeleton is gonna handle those
so let's just do skeleton skeleton CSS
YouTube's responsive let's just see if
somebody's made like a specific thing
for that now looks good well I mean you
just go back and specify that it's
skeleton
YouTube embed salt so this is missing
the word skeleton yeah so it's its
skeleton I'll share this if anybody can
figure out how to embed this boom we're
gonna crowdsource this we're gonna keep
moving and we'll come back to it later
but in the meantime if anybody has time
to figure out how we would do that rock
and roll okay so just to be clear man is
there like there must be a github page
for it okay good it's got a lot of stars
- this is so customary whenever you use
somebody's project if you're making use
and all of their project I recommend you
start just because it's a way of
indicating gratitude toward the
maintainer of the project so again I
wish there was it's 400 lines of CSS
it's amazing it's amazing how skeletal
skeleton is unfortunately I just don't
know what to do about that that issue
with the the code so I'll just move it
over there and this just blow that away
and then this personal stuff will just
minimize so I want to be able to have
the chat on every view so I can see what
you all are talking about okay so I'm
just gonna leave that as is I'm curious
what would happen if I did two columns
if it's gonna actually change the width
of that oh wait did I did I give you
this URL okay so this is good skeleton
yeah so if everybody's watching drop
these gentlemen and ladies a star okay
so let's go over here and refresh I put
it as two it doesn't seem to have made a
difference at all okay so guess
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to go over into the sidebar and so we've
got these li elements and we're
basically trying to change the what do
you think would be good heading so we've
got guests we've got schedule and I
guess these are going to be and then
we've got what else Twitter you know
hash tag maybe you know maybe about and
then we could probably nuke the rest of
these and then we'll just change these
do schedule okay cool so we've got our
things here and then so I'm gonna change
this section to guest so it'll just jump
down to guess whenever people click on
it then we'll come down here and the
next section with local colors well
we're gonna change that to just be
second section is scheduled grab a pad
on my clipboard to
okay and I'll change the copy in a
minute and then this will be about all
right and now we're gonna go down here
we'll just blow away the rest of these
dudes because we really don't need them
okay that's British pretty small dish so
we're just going to make sure I knew
coming down to the right place
okay spacing considerations okay we
don't need that either
logo miss you sweet only that section
awesome questions we probably need a
question section ideally this will
answer all their questions so this is
using jQuery which I don't know if we'll
actually I need to use it anywhere it's
gonna be pretty basic so now we're to
the guest section let's take a look at
what this looks like real quick so I
click schedule drops down to schedule
and then about likewise if I click about
it just jumps right down there and it
attaches the hash about to the URL so at
this point I think we've got some basic
structure in place I wanna make a commit
actually before I do that lets go into
the style.css I'm just gonna now I might
not even keep this just the other
information because skeleton may not
have a way to embed centered content so
I'll leave it and then what I'll do is
I'll just offset by one content what
does that do oh I think that's it's
offsetting it so it has room for the for
the directory of things which is those
three columns in this sidebar so there's
special cyber class apparently unless
they sidebar now that's built into
skeleton skeleton has a sidebar class
okay so what I'll do is just for
simplicity instead of having a row well
I could do row twelve and then I'll just
is there a sinner
sit context okay let me just check grid
CSS senator okay that's in the oh so if
it's in the container is automatically
centered but I think this may just be
for text you actually have to do special
stuff for so what I'm gonna do just for
sake of expedience I'm gonna drop that
intrinsic container back in here as a
class just take one last look at it
before we commit it okay so it's back to
the weird kind of there must be
something that it's forcing this to be
unfortunately I can't right click
inspect cousin iframe I guess I can go
right above it so that our body that's
the jas container and then this is the
container contains a row so our row is
actually below the YouTube element for
some reason div container okay so it's
not showing the actual iframe for some
rink I'll be completely honest I'm still
getting used to debugging CSS and Dom
elements in the the console here if you
have one more column before the YouTube
embed it will fixed okay let me try that
oh it's the wrong place
yeah I'd do anything positive actually
it does make just make it like whoa
that's weird
okay I'm gonna I'm gonna come back to
this I'm gonna wait until I've got like
a more baked solution in the meantime I
think we can keep keep going though I'll
just leave it as it is for now
hey Jocelyn high five yeah no I'm gonna
be on for maybe another hour to you
so thanks take care you know one second
I'll be right back
you
okay I'm back alright so what I'll do is
I'm gonna just go ahead and start
modifying this gas section so we have a
variety of different images of people
subscribe anneal - he's gonna be on the
live stream this is his photo so I'll
copy the image address okay so what I'll
do is I'll do I'll go into here and I'm
not gonna actually like leave it in this
state but basically it's a clear fix pad
man okay so I'm pretty sure we can get
rid of some of this stuff so let me take
a look at the actual code here
okay so this is in a row called clearfix
pad which we might be able to keep let's
see what's inside of it so he's got
eight columns and then he's got four
columns so what I think we could
probably do is just do four column four
column or six column six column and just
have two thick rows of two people let's
try that here and we're gonna go
a little border dark-green I think what
I can do is I can just get rid of that
and just you pellet pad okay pellet pad
okay so that's that's the logo border
green that's the div eight columns alpha
Dave clear pad okay so we want it to be
right below that and it'll just nuke
let's just get rid of that area right
there so so the four pad alpha and then
man what does this pallet pad do again
let's take a look at pilot pad so pallet
pad is oh it's just kind of creating the
space mop beneath it that's fine we can
keep that so then I would just change
that to like an eel - and then in here
what we'll do is we'll do image class
equals what was this before let's just
go back here so you hit that so I'll
just leave the logo border dark green
for now and we'll just change the image
source to what I pulled off Twitter and
then we'll change that to any ol - and
then what I'm gonna do is I'll get rid
of those for now or maybe this could be
like a link to his Twitter I'll just
leave that as Twitter but alternatively
the simpler thing would be to hyperlink
his name
that is username is Anil
okay yeah I'm gonna write so now then we
just have like a short bio a super short
bio for him okay
and then let's just see what that looks
like okay for some reason it's putting
it inside this green thing so let me try
to get rid of the green thing so if we
just get rid of I'll just remove the
classes from that okay there we go
so that's the it's it's boxy we might
want to change this to where it's round
and we could do that pretty easily by
just like creating a class we'll create
a class that is profile image and then
we'll go into CSS the dot profile image
and we'll do shape around I can't
remember what the big an image round a
bend McMahons here everyone I want to
welcome Ben McMahon he's awesome okay so
how to make 400 images with CSS
border-radius 50 okay I thought there
might be like something more like less
um I guess technical like shape around
that would be really nice but yeah I'll
take border-radius 50% that's one way to
do it okay it doesn't seem to be
applying it so maybe I need to drop it
on the oh I'd put it on the day of what
I need to do is do it on this and no I'm
not planning to keep this div I just
didn't want to delete it you can send it
later so there we go boom
looking a little bit better right and
then I don't know why this oh I didn't
close out the a that's why
now what I'll do is I'll just grab this
sorry once again don't you hate it when
you're about to sneeze and you just
don't know if you're gonna end up
sneezing that's that's basically what
just happened there a brace for sneeze
and it never came all right okay so
first of all we can get rid of this
extraneous div or on the image and we
could we may actually end up going in
there and making it more responsive
later so this this link will be a yeah
we don't even need this link anymore
because we're just gonna make his his
profile name a link or better yet you
know what we could we could get rid of
the a ref here the the anchor tag leave
his name as is and then in here we just
do that and then we do
an eel dish
that doesn't look terrible I think his
name probably needs to be centered but
I'm starting to wonder the wisdom I'm
making these round anyway
if they're all gonna be images from
Twitter they'll all be uniform the form
of these nice nice little blocks I'm
sure some designer is sitting there
watching the stream screaming right now
like oh my god this is so terrible
looking okay so let's let's say
hypothetically we we just go ahead and
change this border radius to 0% and just
see what it what it looks like again
that looks probably better in my opinion
the spacing looks pretty good
I like the typography and it's got this
hard to read gray font that designers
love but accessibility people hate
myself I'll probably make it darker and
then yeah so what we like imagine what
would happen if we just did this and
keep in mind I'm doing this like super
quick and dirty but imagine if we did
this we just had you know three anneals
simulated annealing all right BAM so the
main issue I see is that the text
doesn't like it can easily be perceived
to bleed so we might want to do
something about that but I think that
this is a good place to start so what
I'm gonna do is do something pretty rote
I'm gonna grab a couple other key people
Kyle Simpson it actually has a good much
better YouTube or github image I thought
I might have the URL actually I have the
URL here so I've got a lot of people's
URL images here I thought I nailed -
okay so let's go get Kyle Simpsons image
here is on github I like this image of
him a lot better than this image that he
was using someone else so copy image
address so this is where we're gonna
have to like specify the actual size
unless skeletons gonna handle that for
us I think it will actually so go down
here this is where it is and by the way
I'm gonna throw these on like image or
something so they're not quite as
brittle because you know github could
totally change the way they handle
things like that okay there he is BAM
then we just changed it to Kyle Simpson
and then instead of having a bio I'm
just gonna say you don't know GIS and
this will be CEO fog Creek you don't
know jeaious author you don't know GIS
it's a little bitter well okay then
then we'll get we have one other person
that I think it's currently headlining
we'll have a lot of people that will add
later I'm still getting a bunch of RSVPs
for this event but it is a Sarah Dresner
if I got her name correct
Sarah Dresner yeah here's your Twitter
copy image address I could link to their
website as well I don't want to like
just load this thing down with links
somebody needs to make a tool that
basically finds all the images on a
static page don't sew onto em sure that
would be so cool and then like basically
just updates the urls like a major Fi
that would be awesome so if we go to
Kyle's Simpsons Twitter there are a lot
of Kyle Simpson so there I imagine but
yeah it's him
let's grab that URL so I'm not gonna do
all these on stream I'll just do them
later cuz it's pretty clerical and wrote
okay so we've got at least three people
up here and she's not CEO of fog Creek
so let me follow her here
oh wow that was weird they liked it
tried to download the file did I specify
this should be down low Oh download okay
there's a download in the URL I didn't
even know you could just add a download
and automatically download things so
that's cool though so let's go back up
here oops let's remove the download from
here and let's just update this guy's
URL get if I and this is Sarah
underscore ed oh okay now we refresh now
we just need to figure out what her like
the best way to describe her is for
winning speaker consultant writer at
real CSS tricks what should I say about
her how would you describe herself
award-winning speaker writer at real CSS
tricks I'll just say real see assist
reeks yeah
you'll CSS tricks okay cool so we've got
our first three people in place you need
to delete that download lull oh yeah I
can do that for sure you a finder you
can see all my private files delete
somewhere where are you why don't things
call it delete what do they have to call
Buddha trash okay thanks
Texas for kitchen that okay so what I'm
gonna do is now I think we're in a state
where we can incorporate the Google
Calendar actually you know what I'm
gonna go in here to this account Google
Calendar and so I'm gonna create a new
calendar how do I just add a calendar
create oh I don't want to create an
event I want to create an actual
calendar
create a new calendar okay and this is
going to be open 2017 okay
and so this is going to be the calendar
official calendar for our 2017
livestream and I'll okay timezone is
gonna be Eastern Standard Time
about half of Americans live in Eastern
Standard Time so if you're looking for a
good time zone to default to that's a
good one
share this comment make this calendar
public okay good let's just make it
public okay well what can i click public
I thought I just click that okay for
some reason when I unclick that it just
okay alright and now so this will be the
only thing that can actually make
changes this free code camp account so
Craig calendar yes even Google search is
gonna be able to find this yay so what
I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go to New
Year's Eve this is the actual date of
the events and we're going to start at
11 p.m. and then I'm going to click into
it edit event we're gonna say open 2017
and I'll just throw the hashtag in there
so everybody knows by seeing the name
that there is a hashtag associated with
it
and I'm not gonna add any guess at this
point I'm just going to say it'll be at
youtube.com slash free code camp
and then I will set the notification to
one hour before make sure this public
and then this is going to run from that
until 3:00 a.m. on the first safe extent
now we've got our calendar event and
then within this we can add additional
spots like first half-hour or countdown
to East Coast New Year's and then I'll
add additional details as we do it but
then we're going to go to the next day
and then we'll just I'll just quickly
add you know countdown to central new
year's countdown to Mountain Time New
Year's and then countdown to West Coast
New Year's and I think these need to be
on the open 2017 so I'm going to mod one
of these real quick
you thought you were just gonna watch me
coding but no I'm being the the
socialite okay so there we go
open 2017 save and then the entire event
is going to be on the calendar of open
2015 okay now so now what we need to do
is embed Google Calendar oh wait maybe
there's an option here to just embed it
so settings
hmm sure this car
okay I'm not I'm not finding it so what
I want to do is I'll just Google bet
Google Calendar thank you do click open
calendar right click settings settings
calendar tab
when we got the schedule so we'll just
come in here and I'll tend to throw it
in here try to throw it in the sea 6 :
alpha I think we can just do that and
new whole lot of stuff
blow up the whole world and then BOOM
and we'll probably want to get rid of
the width and height so we can ensure
that it
I don't know border I do I want to frame
border no just rollin no let's just see
what happens when we do it's just that
and just to make sure this is embedded
it within that okay and then we'll say
you know create a calendar reminder to
jump on in
or do you join us all right let's go
back thanks
schedule okay so the world's tiniest
calendar it's practically invisible so
we'll need to fix that but I'm gonna
leave that for now since it is pointing
to the correct calendar if we click the
31st it's so small I don't anything I
can click into it
hey thanks for joining us
Caesar from Venezuela so just to let you
know like if you're giving the delay in
the feed I think YouTube automatically
delays everything by like 20 seconds so
don't feel like you're necessarily
experiencing a bad connection is result
okay so now what I'll do is I'll just go
in here and we've got the final thing
will say open 2016 is brought to you by
free code camp and see by the free code
camp open-source community I'll just
give you all that
all right I think we're basically in a
state where this reflects more or less
what we want to have on here so even
though things look super janky at this
point it's not that bad
we're gonna fill this in and fix this up
but I want to go ahead and push this
live right now so what I'm gonna to do
is get ad a I've heard that you're not
supposed to do that because it creates
an additional like record of that and
get it's like a very small amount of
memory but tracking what has been staged
so I need to stop doing that I should
actually be doing get ad dot or better
yet using SourceTree which is a really
cool tool to I have to update it I'll
update it later um it's like a graphical
user interface for doing it I strongly
recommend that so you don't get get
shoot yourself in the foot so I'll do
get commit M get basic elements in place
get push origin master now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to get check
out a new branch and it's gonna be
gh-pages get push origin gh-pages so I'm
just pushing what's on master up to the
gh-pages branch so now if we go to open
2017 dot github dad I oh oh wait it's
free code camp comm slash github that IO
dot slash open 2017
boom it's live on the internet you can
all go to this URL and you can indulge
in a splendor thanks for joining us
Fabio who did I write open 2016
where did I do that oh yeah so it's it's
kind of like a furtive bait whether it
should be open 2017 or open 2016 because
technically it starts in 2016
New Year's Eve 2016 for New Year's Day
2017 but everybody calls it the
following year because they're so bored
of using honey 16 they're looking
forward to 2017 so that's what we're
gonna do so I'll make some changes and
stuff later the important thing is it's
up and if you want a hack on it and make
a pull request and significantly improve
the way it looks
please do so I will continue to add
stuff I'm not going to be pushing to
master I'm going to be pushing to my own
private branch like I should be I should
never have been pushing the master
that's a bad practice
so let me since you all have been so
patient as to watch for a while I'm
gonna break down some of the things that
I did that I really shouldn't be doing
first of all I should have read the
actual documentation for skeleton a
little bit better I didn't even realize
we were using skeleton until halfway
through the stream second I push
directly to master which I should not
have done I should have created a branch
called like you know basic basic layout
or something like that and then merge
that back in through a normal process
that way there could be like a QA step
and somebody could take a look at my
code and make sure it's not complete
garbage and then the other thing I
should have done was not used get - a
get get add - a I should be using
something else that's less expensive so
we see here very rudimentary but it's
going to grow we're gonna really flesh
this out and I have to hop off the
stream and do some other tasks real
quick but I'll be back around and all
now that I have the capacity to stream
more readily I'll try to stream more
readily by the way on New Year's Eve
we're gonna have like a lot better AV
you'll be able to hear the music a
little bit better you'll be able to
we'll have multiple screens we'll have
bigger faces we're gonna be hopefully
doing that Hangouts on air or at least
something where you can see people's
cameras and there will be multiple
people so one thing I didn't mention is
that I am going to be emceeing this and
so is Breanna who's really amazing see
free coke or Twitter so I'll just show
you if if you use Twitter and I strongly
recommend you do because so many
developers are on Twitter there we go
oh no it changed it at the last second
there we go
this she's amazing and she is going to
be on the string with me she's basically
my co-host
so I recommend following her if you want
to see what I'm up to
I'm on Twitter @ OS s ia is my handle
and if you have any questions comments
anything that I think do you think I can
be helped with just shoot me a message
on Twitter and I'll try to get back to
you I like literally allow anybody to
message me on Twitter only other thing I
would tell you is if you are not sure
what you're doing New Year's Eve if you
want to stay off the road where there's
oh my gosh people are calling me out on
all kinds of things yeah thank you so so
what I'll do is I'll just I'll show you
the ideal workflow real quick so I'll
just do I'll go back into here
I'll get stash this and then I'll get
checkout master again because you always
want to branch off a master or whatever
you're staging branches and I'm gonna do
get checkout branch and I'll do well
what was your user name Dennis so I'll
just say Dennis's fixes so get chanting
and this will be fixed
Dennis fixes I'll give you credit for
this one that you can pointed that out
good eye and then I'll just do get
stache pop get add dot get status and so
we've modified the index.html do get
commit
and make a fix that Dennis spotted good
eyes and now get push origin fix Dennis
fixes now I go back into github and this
is how the workflow is supposed to work
ideally somebody takes a look at what
I'm doing and tells me what I did wrong
so I'll just compare pull request I'll
create the pull request I'll merge the
pull request back into master and
there's an extra step if I want to merge
it into github pages there might if
anybody thinks of a way that is faster
to push code from master to github pages
let's see fast way to merge master into
gh pages maybe somebody's written about
this keep Jake's pages and think Oh leav
Errol whom I invited to our thing she
was busy unfortunately but normally I
mean she seemed receptive she seems like
she would come so okay so push the
master so I do get check out there are a
few commands that are usually above it
would be let her see me so I'm writing
this for those okay if only there was an
easy way to mop automate this well is
there an easy way to automate this well
they'll detailed a few proaches here
okay let's take a look it's from five
years ago
hi five years ago I wasn't even
programming really I barely even got a
Linux working on my local machine it's
crazy this is like older than I am as a
coder okay so
using the get post-commit hook okay post
MIT hook automating Lea's workflow
another way is just to do this which is
kind of ugly but let's just do this
alright let's see if it changed the the
final part
- okay so currently it says 2016 if if
that worked it changes to 2017 didn't
work oh because I didn't pull
there we go
wait a second really okay there goes it
worked okay so what I'll do is from now
on I'll just use that command git push F
which is force scary cuz you can
completely all right stuff but I'm I
know what I'm doing
even I screwed up the first time I know
exactly going right get push F
origin/master gh-pages so yeah that
works so that's a better workflow is
creating a pull request and merging it
so I'm gonna sign off any burning
questions a brew gosh is here thanks for
joining man yeah Travis see I would be
better and you could just add it
wherever there is a PR merge shouldn't
be tough okay well we have to get Travis
see I set up for this specific repo
which is a very humble simple repo that
I didn't want to bolt bring out the
whole tool chain for but we can do that
so everyone who's watched thank you very
much for joining us I am very excited to
announce this to the world I'll announce
it in a more formal way later but I
appreciate everybody jumping in on my
impromptu livestream and I hope you all
have a beautiful day and happy coding
