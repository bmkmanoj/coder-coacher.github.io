data across the globe here's an example
of a d3 map visualization we can zoom in
and see lots of points and if we mouse
over it we can see there is some
additional information including time
mass what is this well this is a
visualization of meteorite landings
around the world we can see by the size
of the circle the approximate mass of
the meteorite rule number one don't look
at the example projects code figure it
out for yourself rule number to fulfill
the below user stories using whichever
libraries and api's you need give it
your own personal style and be sure to
use d3 to build this project user story
number one I can see where all
meteorites landed on the world map user
story number two I can tell the relative
size of a meteorite just by looking at
the way it's represented on the map
users story number three I can mouse
over the meteorites data point for
additional data here's the data set you
can use to build this it's very large so
it'll take a minute to load and you can
see that i'm using the json format or
plugin which makes this much easier to
read you can get that in the chrome
store the Chrome Web Store it's free and
we can see that each meteorite has the
coordinates where it hit the mass a name
a date a whole lot of other metadata
once you finish this be sure to share it
with us in the code review chat room
and also on Twitter and on your city's
campsite on facebook we'd love to give
you feedback on it have fun and good
luck with this challenge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
