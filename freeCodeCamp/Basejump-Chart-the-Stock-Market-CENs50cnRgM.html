let's take a look at this full stack
JavaScript app which has the ability to
mouse over a stock and see the date and
price associated with it and if we
scroll down we can even add a stock and
here we go
3m is now on here and we can just as
easily delete it you'll note that there
are no accounts associated with it
anybody can just come in add a stock and
delete it and quickly compare stocks and
then if we open this up in a new
incognito tab we'll see the exact same
stocks let me delete Amazon for example
Amazon's gone here and I'll go back here
Amazon's also gone here Wow so let's
talk a little bit about the user stories
as a user I can view a graph displaying
the recent trend lines for each edit
stock as a user I can add new stocks by
their symbol name as a user I can remove
stocks and then the bonus user story is
as a user I can see changes in real-time
when any other user adds or removes
stocks I think you're gonna have a lot
of fun with this one
enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
