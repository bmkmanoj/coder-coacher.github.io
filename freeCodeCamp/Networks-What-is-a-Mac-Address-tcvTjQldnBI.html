what is the MAC address let me remind
you this has got nothing to do with the
Big Mac or the Mac operating system now
before we get into the details let me
give you an analogy now we have three
people John Bob and Mary in a room who
want to talk now John when he wants to
talk to Mary he says hi Mary how are you
doing when Mary listens to this message
how does she know that she has to
respond to John it's through his voice
so she she replies to John but not Bob
saying hey John I'm doing good now if
you have three different computers who
want to talk to each other they don't
have any names so to bring the analogy
of names and identification to computers
we have this concept of MAC address
which is unique to each computers
network interface card</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
