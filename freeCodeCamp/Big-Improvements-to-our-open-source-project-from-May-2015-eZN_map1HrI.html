you about some exciting new features
first we've broken our entire curriculum
down into smaller segments you'll notice
for example that the bonfires are much
earlier in the curriculum and we moved
some of the full stack JavaScript
waypoints to the back right before the
base jumps we've also added
object-oriented JavaScript and
functional programming and most exciting
of all we've started creating our own
challenges so I can show you one right
now so when you get here you'll see that
we have this phone and we have a text
editor area and we can expand this to
read more information and we also have a
failing test that says your H 2 elements
should be read so what we can do up here
is this challenge is trying to teach us
inline styles so we can just do style
equals color red and you'll see that the
color immediately changes and it's a
text that the color has changed and that
means the test passes so now I can move
on to the next challenge so we've been
hard at work developing these we're
going to build them for jquery and
eventually a whole lot of other things
as well and eventually we want to move
our entire curriculum in house to wear
free code camp and our community our
building all the different exercises
next I want to tell you about another
cool feature on here let's go to a
bonfire so you'll notice there are three
new buttons one is the Help button if
you click it it will give you a quick
reminder to read this field guide
article about what we call our sap
search ask post are recommended sequence
for you handling getting stuck on things
and if you've read it and you've read
the air and you've searched google well
the next I'm going to do is to ask for
help and you can do that right here by
clicking this so it will open up the
help room in slack
see that d buggy the rubber duck we'll
go ahead and post for you and d buggy
will post the actual content of your
bonfire or your whatever you're stuck on
we'll grab that content right there so
it's right there in the chat and people
can look at it and then it'll also give
you some advice for how you can debug it
through what we'd like to call rubber
duck debugging which is very helpful if
nobody comes and helps you real quick
then you can use that but it should make
it a lot easier to get help we also have
a pair button so if you have screen hero
installed which you can install right
here then you can create a pair request
this will open up the let spare room in
slack
companion cube will create a pair
request with a link to the challenge and
directions for how you can initiate a
pair programming session so this is an
open invitation to other campers to see
if anyone is available to pair with you
on this challenge finally we have a bug
button we've made so many changes and
there are so many bugs as a result of
these changes this just happens it's
pretty difficult to avoid this sort of
thing but one thing we want is we want
to know if you find a bug so you can
click this button it'll give you some
basic directions to try to give us the
exact steps to reproduce the bug and if
you can take screenshots that's also
very helpful and then you click the
button and it takes you right in the
github and it already has a link to the
issue and you can just quickly give it a
title and tell us what's wrong and we'll
get to it really quickly the next thing
I want to show you is our jobs page so
as you know we there are thousands of
junior software engineer jobs out there
and many of our campers have already
gotten jobs getting a coding job is the
objective of free code camp we want
everybody here to be able to get a job
after they complete all of our
curriculum and our nonprofit projects
and you can see some of the campers who
have already done so and you can also
read this blog post I wrote a few months
ago about the job market in aggregate
for developers and then you can browse
some curated list of junior development
jobs finally one thing I'm very excited
to tell you about is we have a
translation effort going on so if we go
to free code camp I'll just go in an
incognito tab because this modal will
only show up one time if I go to map
you'll see that we're translating free
code camp into Chinese Spanish
Portuguese French and Russian and if you
click these buttons it will take you
directly to a chat room
in slack where you can talk with people
in these languages we want to make it
easier for our campers who don't
natively speak English to be able to
learn to code now you'll still need to
be able to speak English for doing the
nonprofit projects those are conducted
in English but you can focus on learning
to code instead of trying to focus on
learning the code and learning English
at the same time we are actually already
have a pretty big translation effort
underway and we've broken all of our way
points and bonfires and everything down
into these little Trello cards and if
you're interested in helping with the
translation effort just let us know
that's all for now but we're going to
keep making awesome features and keep
improving free code camp as quickly as
we can stay tuned and happy coding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
