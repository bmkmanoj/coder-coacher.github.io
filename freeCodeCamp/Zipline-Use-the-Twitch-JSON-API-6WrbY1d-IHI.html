json api to see who is broadcasting at
what time let's go ahead and take a look
at the example app so we can see that
currently only one channel is
broadcasting and we added this channel
because it broadcast 24 hours but we can
also go through and see who's online and
offline and we can search within them so
for example if we just wanted to see
free code camps channel we have instant
text search so let's review the rules
don't look at the example projects code
figure it out for yourself you can use
whichever libraries or API is you need
reverse engineer the example projects
functionality and also feel free to
personalize it it does not have to look
like this it can look a whole bunch of
different ways different color schemes
different configurations as long as it
has the following user stories as long
as it meets the following user stories
as a user I can see whether free code
camp is currently streaming on Twitch as
a user I can click the status output and
be sent directly to free code camps
which TV channel which we can see this
is a link and it does indeed take me to
twitch TV for free code camp as a user I
can see whether free code camp is
streaming and if they're streaming I can
see additional details about what
they're streaming which we can see here
this channel that broadcast 24/7 there
the subject or the title of their stream
is 24/7 classic start track a Starcraft
stream so if they're streaming you
should be able to get that additional
information from the API as a bonus as a
user I can search through the streams
listed and we have an example call to
twitch is JSON API and we
so have a link to the relevant API
documentation and just to give you a
little help here is a list of some
people that regularly stream code on
Twitch so you can basically use these
usernames in combination with this API
call to check whether they're online and
if they're online what they're streaming
and as usual if you would like to get
immediate feedback just click this
button and you'll tweet it for you code
camp and let us know that you finished
the project and just be sure to fill in
what the link to your current project
will give you fast feedback otherwise
we're going to review all this before
you move on to the nonprofit projects
