visualize data with a bar chart which is
one of the most fundamental styles of
data visualizations let's take a look at
what our bar chart will might look like
as we can see here this is a chart
charting gross domestic product which is
an economic term for total economic
activity there's actually it's a little
bit more of a nuanced equation than that
but basically you can see that I can
mouse over and I can see the number of
billion in a month in a year and it goes
up through recent history through
halfway through 2015 so on the y axis I
have the total amount of money on the x
axis I have the year let's talk about
the rules for building the zipline don't
look at the example projects code figure
it out for yourself to fill the below
user stories using whichever libraries
and api's you need be sure to give it
your own style there's tons of room in
d3 for for adding your own personal
flourishes you must use d3.js
to complete this project here are the
user stories I can see us gross domestic
product by quarter over time and I can
mouse over a bar and see a tooltip with
the GDP amount and the exact year and
month that bar represents so we
recommend you use the GDP data that we
provide right here which I have a
special plugin that allows me to see it
in a nice expanded JSON format you'll
probably want to get it it's called JSON
format or it's a chrome plug-in now you
don't have to use the GDP data if you
have some other data that you
particularly like that lends itself well
to this style of a bar chart please go
ahead and use that we simply recommend
this data to save you the hassle of
having to
and find it and and hammered into place
so that it works well with this because
that's not really the exact nature of
the exercise this is more of a get used
to using d3 exercise however as with all
of the d3 challenges you are welcome to
use your own data sets knock yourself
out
so once you get stuck which you
inevitably will don't be afraid to read
the error message read the documentation
then search around on Google and then
ask in the chat room if you need help or
ask a friend from your campsite whoever
you get to help you out and at the end
of this project you're going to want to
be sure to share it with your friends so
they can take a look at it and give you
feedback you do that in our code review
chat room you can share it on Twitter
and of course on Facebook and your
city's campsite have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
