voting app let's go ahead and take a
look at what the finished product would
look like this was built by one of our
campers based on our user stories so
first things first we'll sign up all
right and basically we can create poles
quickly so we can say who is your a
right captain we say it Picard Walker
all right your Pole has been posted so
basically we can copy this URL and then
we'll open a new incognito tab that's
not connected to the incognito tab that
I had previously and you can see that
this is a publicly accessible thing and
when we vote on Picard Picard gets at
one point and let's say hypothetically I
open another incognito tab and visited
that I don't need to be authenticated
and let's say we voted for Kirk Wow and
you can see that Kirk and Picard or
neck-and-neck thanks to our voting
pattern so let's close these tabs and
let's go back and we can also go and
view who is the favorite captain so if
we want we can click on it and pull it
up again and we can also delete it if
we'd like to and it just goes away some
other cool things we can do here or we
can change our password and we can log
so this is what the challenge generally
looks like and this was built with the
yeoman angular full stack generator so
give that a go and let's go ahead and
take a quick look at exactly what the
user stories are the first user story is
as an authenticated user I can keep my
poles and come back later to access them
basically that my poles are saved the
second one as an authenticated user I
can share my poles with my friends which
is what we did we copied the URL and we
went and visited it and we were able to
see the pole even though we weren't
logged in next as an authenticated user
I can see the aggregate results of my
poles that's what we use that chart for
where we could see how many people had
voted for each of the two options and as
an authenticated user I can delete poles
that I decided on one anymore which we
did and as an authenticated user I can
create a pole with any number of
possible odd items so in this case we
can add additional islands to our poles
let me just show you that real quick
so if I want I can add additional
options here that's what the more
options user story I can close then as a
bonus user story as an unauthenticated
user I can see everyone's polls but I
can't vote on anything so this way you
would be forcing people to authenticate
in order to vote which is kind of a roll
controlled like access control component
that you can do within the means deck
another bonus user story as an
unauthenticated user or an authenticated
user I can see the results of the polls
in chart form so you could use chart yes
you could use google charts you can even
use something like d3 on this and
another bonus user story if you really
feel like going for the brass ring as an
authenticated user if I don't like the
opinion options on a poll I can create a
new option so if you have any questions
or difficulty understanding how to use
angular full-stack remember we've
created this guide that you can check
out and this should be really good
practice at building a basic crud app
create read update delete those basic
actions and managing objects within a
database so I think you'll have a lot of
fun and I'm looking forward to seeing
what you build enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
