ok so it could be that i want to start
working on the stylization was there
example one look like ok
so the example project looks like this
you can change the session length up and
down but doing the break length doesn't
change the session length I guess you
have to actually complete a session to
get to the break you can't make it below
1 so they've got an animation where
you've got this green filling up the
circle
sorry for the wait i just want to see
what they do when the session is
complete I guess technically I could go
into the code and change it to a really
small session but then I would look at
the code and maybe figure less stuff out
for myself
ok
I do like that animation kind of better
than my orbital idea
and it started the break immediately I
don't agree with that because I've done
pomodoros and the whole point is that
you might continue working or one of the
bigger points is that you might continue
working past the expiration of the
Pomodoro so I'm going to build this in a
way that I might use it
okay yeah I might use bootstrap to
create some space here and here
a jquery plugin to do that more easily
maybe and offline oh you might have
wrote that while I was taking a little
bathroom break okay
and I really i'm struggling to think of
where to begin for any sort of animation
i do have the whoops
the image so this is I saw this
yesterday i inspired me
but i'm not sure how I would code that
even better it would be if i could have
a two orbiting spheres one for the
minutes and one for the total doing one
for the seconds might be too jittery
okay look at this example code again
call it a loop
I wonder how dangerous it would be to
copy some of this in here and play with
it
what
I guess it's sort of fork is for right
oops
so how that works do I now have two
copies
I hope so
well let's do that okay
let's try this
sit down here you create a animation
Test section then our CSS
what's happening so far okay plenty of
room for improvement and
hmm
I've not seen this before where you
started function it with an open
parenthesis so that kind of creeps me
out a way but let's see what happens
ok
interesting
ok
dis rotation
you
it's nice to have that tidy button there
but anyone doesn't hasn't used this
before if you are in code pin and you
click the tidy button and HTML or CSS or
the java it will tidy up the code it
will take it and reformat it to whatever
best practice way it believes is the
best boxer says makes divs and create
that with CSS and make the dot go around
with jquery rotate animation yeah yeah
that's kind of what I'm trying to trying
to do I think that's what I'm trying to
do
you
Oh
where's the code I've used in the past
to put divs in the center margin zero
auto
but then I lose my
it was rotating just a moment ago I
don't even think I've changed anything
so this is mostly math
which generally seems the Cascade like
if I were to change a number at the top
level it would cascade through all the
mathematics and should technically be
that difficult to edit the variables
I'm kind of understanding this jquery
even though i haven't done tons of work
with jquery except for what was done and
the early stages of free code camp but
this is uh looks like this is we're
declaring a jquery function called orbit
it's that simple and then that's the
entire function then here we're calling
the function to apply it to objects 1 2
&amp;amp; 3
now that does seem to only rotate on
page load which concerns me oh no it's
just stopping let's just stop in the
animation at a certain point that's fine
we could change that
I wonder if I just
what if I put this inside the timer dev
what is center
they would not
the first thing I wanted to do I wonder
if I could just delete that background
color ok that's an improvement but I
want to center that
and I'm worried about it because we're
dealing with absolute positioning
anybody hey Kip van der Zee thank you
this isn't actually my animation this is
a credit goes to someone on stack
overflow and I'm trying to modify it to
work with my Pomodoro clock so this is
kind of the idea this is actually some
companies logo or they branding image or
something but I copied it because it
inspired me and I'm thinking I would
like my Pomodoro clock interface to look
something like this so I found some code
on Stack Overflow that works with
rotations and going to give this a shot
its center with height so if I want it
to be this big that would be 122 pixels
by 122 pixels
this kind of arbitrary but oh but that's
not a circle it's got a border radius
but if you change the border radius what
he isn't it like two percent four
percent or something
I've done this before I did it for my
buttons here yeah
though this is why you okay so it
doesn't look like changing that would
affect anything as a JavaScript not sure
why it won't change Oh way it was
changing it was just changing very
slightly what would a circle be like
fifty percent or 100 yeah 50 ok cool and
the color I do like this color though it
might not look as nice on this
background that I've chosen but let's
try it out yeah it does not look as nice
let's go to my favorite source for
colors at the moment flat UI colors you
just copy and paste the problem is I'm
over using these colors so when you look
at my super amateur JavaScript portfolio
everything looks kind of similar it
looks a little too dark actually
yeah whatever good enough
line height what does that change
cool
this feels like progress I still don't
know if I'll ever get this working but
until I hit a huge roadblock I'm gonna
keep digging at it let's see how long
have I been streaming an unknown amount
of time okay
this dot rotate in degree 360 on the
outer circle and I should do it where
exactly are you talking about
orbits within guessing within the the
function that's getting called
yeah Kip my design skills are pretty
 as well but this is how this is how
you learn I guess yeah it is its own
function but we'll get there what I'm
trying it what I want to do first is
just get this centered because i'm
afraid the process of centering it I'll
somehow break the code and I won't
understand it enough of the code to dig
myself out of the hole so it seems like
this rotation I should be able to do
something like this is position relative
what are the other positions okay just
put center in there whoa that just
totally breaks it what are some
different ways of center objects and CSS
horizontal align yeah margin auto I
tried I tried that
so maybe I need to do margin auto on its
own
hey added something what if i remove
that okay so i definitely need the
relative positioning i'm not sure why
it's not totally centered but alright
let's see if all the rotations still
work they do cool yeah that's cool a
line item only on flex box
ok
I don't know why bored arranged this
thing anything no that's fine is it
because I have a set with here
weird I just keeps going down it keeps
dropping I don't have a set this weird
stuff going on it's a whole new world
for me width all right I'll curiosity
let's just drop that by a third okay
let's increase it I don't know how
that's happening
interesting okay well it's closer to
censor than it was
and it's almost like right on center
don't know don't know okay that huge
animation text is bugging me and the
timer one and why is there so much space
between that
be gone
you center the rotation dip but not the
elements in the rotation div today
well
I mean really weird déjà vu I try to
do this at some point in the past okay
tidy it's good stuff okay something in
the rotation
you
or if it's too I need to be able to so
the period let's look at one object at a
time okay and what if you don't set the
number of orbits remember four bits all
right let's just to think this through
say all right minutes orbital i'm going
to call it a satellite then it's
satellite okay the orbits would equal
the work minutes
you
but can't know the variable since jquery
something
whatever we'll just say 40 yes save my
work has a 15 changes already let's just
keep going around on the period which is
a millisecond it's right so it's taken
about eight seconds one two three four
yeah about eight seconds so in this case
the period should be 60,000 let's be
really nice and slow word of it cool
next one
what happens if I just delete that
object everything break now
I would describe more of what I'm trying
to do but to be honest I don't fully
understand what I'm what I'm editing
here but it's kind of getting close to
what my initial vision was so my text to
would be the total so let's say it took
25 minutes do you like 25 times 60,000
will that work it does okay we'll say
that's minutes and that's the session
ok
don't think this value is available
before page load not one hundred percent
sure would you prefer that I do want to
change this ugly orange to something
nicer like maybe that blue
so right now I'm just editing the
variables and the CSS to kind of try to
get this style looking closer to what I
want it to be though admittedly I should
save that to the end because I'm pretty
sure I know how this stuff works but
well you only need the one
my hey
I'm pretty excited even if I end up not
using this and the final project just
saying kind of what's possible is pretty
interesting to me so what color do i
want there may be a green
you
cool so one other thing i want to do i
might make that actually they're going
are they going similar speeds they are
going simple oh no they're not yeah the
session is going way too fast the
session is supposed to orbit once for
the whole like 25 minute Pomodoro what
would that be it might not be doing that
math 25 times 60,000 it's 1.5 million
okay doesn't look as cool but that is
more what I was looking for
why is that space they're so huge I
don't know that's it based on this the
margin auto
that state you know that that's the
vertical space is still giant
this is the 700 pixel height
apparently not
I don't know why the space in between
the timer and the animation is so
ginormous
but
so they need that anymore so I need
timers anymore
that's not even noon here made some
great progress this morn
but I feel like I'm kind of hitting a
bit of a wall
just out of curiosity how that's what it
look if the period was only one thousand
and it went around you know a lot oh
yeah I deleted it
is that too much I think it might give
people a seizure or something that's
pretty jittery it's cool to know that it
works I'll give it that much one other
thing I want to do in my original kind
of conception is there's the inner
circle but then there's the outer thick
line it's forming the track oh yeah yeah
I know no one's looking to look at this
but um it's more like this is a
portfolio piece so hopefully future
potential clients or employers will
click on it and be like cool he is I
screwed around with some animation so I
don't anticipate too many people
actually using using my poet or a timer
if you google around there are thousands
and thousands of point with Dora timers
on the internet if you want to hypnotize
people is perfectly fine yeah well I
wouldn't be a bad maybe I'll make a
separate hypnosis up at a future point
in time if anyone has a clue on how to
eliminate this space between the timer
and this animation I would love to know
because my timer and rotation classes
don't seem to have anything that would
clue me in to it it's not the height I
tried changing the height and less
would that be maybe like four or five
hundred pixels
I don't think that did anything
maybe I could do as a padding bottom
bottom padding padding bottom padding
bottom negative 500 pixels that suck it
up words code pin link um no I'm not
using canvas I'm not actually too
familiar with canvas in terms of the
code pin link if you I guess you can't
see in the chat I'll paste the
alphanumeric code and you can rebuild
the URL which is code pin down I 0 /
Collin ferry / pen / the alphanumeric
thing I just pasted hit the chat
Oh interesting
the period is three thousand and the
main function
no but I guess it so it gets overwritten
that's just if it's not defined meaning
it should I don't want to test it
such a strange thing I'm trying to do
likely your relative versus absolute in
terms of the spacing the rotation is let
that do it without break everything yeah
it doesn't help this is good suggestion
but changing the position to absolute
just makes the animation like clunk over
to the left margin top- 45 pixels for
object 1 plus 45 somebody is right
speaking typing Russian add top- 200
texts the rotation those both probably
work let's try a negative 200 pixels hey
thank you thank you too jackal and 2
Klatu 91 for suggesting not okay
ok
this is a problem my but Maya Pomodoro
buttons don't work anymore you guys
noticing this they they do until I put
that that code in but maybe if I change
the height that was quicker to solve
than I expected
awesome
ok
so now I'm thinking I want to make it so
that the timer appears inside of that
red circle most efficient way to do that
would be
that's just duplicating us but saying
center
maybe not
that was just for the buttons
it works the
let's code is getting really bloated
ok
okay it does work
sorry
I've seen your code I don't think I know
jquery selectors enough to
yeah I the only jQuery I know is the
very basic jQuery that was covered and
pretty early on which for me was like a
month ago going through the front end
web dev stuff on free code camp so yeah
are there any strong advantages to the
using jQuery for that instance or is it
just like I understand it it looks
cleaner it's a less actual code it's
probably more readable but other than
that for something that's simple is
there a strong advantage to using jQuery
when you can
hmm fair points
okay I i might be up against the break
time
yeah i think i'm going to call it my
brain is feeling a little bit fried I
think I need to make some coffee and
have some lunch or something but thank
you guys for watching those of you that
stuck around I appreciate the help and
the audience is like a time I have
streamed and I find it to be pretty
pretty fun yeah so let's see jackal is
saying before you go what do you what do
you want me to do before I go
okay save that javascript in a text all
right let me grab that
let's see I think you're suggesting that
I save your java script that you wrote
up here too
cool all right yeah saving that yeah
I'll take a look at that later with my
brains back online thank you for that
until next time thank you for watching I
use guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
