started yeah it in the wind and take one
long okay its back to the login box so I
need login feeling I think I'll just
rewrite to CSS cuz it's it's not liking
changing values button
hey thanks for the follow Oscar - GUI
overwritten throw an important on the
end of that man yeah I can it just
always seems dirty wish this would say I
wonder if there's a way to tell what's
overriding it yeah I mean sometimes you
gotta gotta break a few eggs when you're
making an ailment very very - oh wait a
second background color no I have like
background color and border syntax here
oh yeah we good I could have been it
nice and it changed borders a little
weird
I think it's lighter color text though
well why don't you give the background
color
eh why don't you give it an alpha of
like point eight okay more dye probably
this one
yeah it doesn't need much at all that's
pretty good
it's um padding
right away with you well you could
scaffold this and big stretch since he
had big strap available I mean you know
we can see that you know if this was a
call you know say you know whatever then
you'd have four four and four yeah
that's good point it's plan to contain a
safe container you you just have to do
it off set for call large for call yeah
call large offset for dot call large
offset for you yep like that
no here yep just like that and then add
it to the end of the this like that
yeah and that should offset it yeah like
do you think we do some styling what
yeah it works that's probably a better
way to you anyway and then it'll be much
easier to read align that button and
keep it pinned yeah much better one
button hide your flute right
margin Oh
so with that honestly at this point what
you want is rose probably yeah
and then so like okay forum here and
then you could do either a form group or
a row so you do a row there at ero
unfortunately bootstrap has not not
implemented mighty right yet I've talked
to him about it in a row and text see if
that pulls it to the right we might it
might be pull right
I think button all right yeah but then
you could you could actually add a text
center all right
yeah uh still oh I think that might be a
margin or something though mmm yeah just
inspect it let's take a look at the yeah
scroll down here um here do me a favor
I'm gonna I'm just gonna change this
real quick so I know it's not new but in
itself it's problem is it's not lining
up in here let me just take some of this
stuff out me it's for padding yeah
search the beach at site here bootstrap
all right yeah he's all the text no I
don't think I'm doing anything else
causing that yeah one sec things gonna
be on the row above the button yeah
that's who we have it
then I took the line SPECT all right
let's try this head we can change
okay okay all right all right let's go
back up to the stuff all right so yeah
bring it back let's let's just edit the
button in line real quick here so let's
see element style let's see I'm pretty
sure that's what pull right does so
let's see that's pulling everything
what's going on here are we on the
button itself doesn't look like it no I
think you're on yeah now you're on
everything
okay now I'm on the button yeah
okay I wonder if the detective in boats
are just overflowing and that actually
is the right
no it's it shouldn't be overflowing mmm
well they might be let's take a look I
think since we're using the columns I
could just I don't need to mess with the
view with you should go to a hundred
percent with 100 percent okay yeah okay
let's look at the button now and the
HTML little bit of water around this
whole thing see what we're going with
all right so the pool right is working
yeah
I'm on the whites outside of that dough
that's kind of weird
do I have something else here Kaname
positioning I don't think I need that
anymore I don't need this all right so I
guess I do need that
why the width on those not working now
let's look slick here for a second oh
there we go now there we go yeah so why
are they so well as needed if I was this
so wide let's make this like a three
yeah
and change this to medium instead of
large medium okay mine you know but you
changed it to three change perfect for
then it to you three not four hmm yeah
you might even you might even do five on
the medium Oh
I'm using Adam - Jade for the
highlighting alright I think that's
pretty good right there yeah now let's
pull it down again where it was and
actually give it and set us off set two
to four as well time for let's try five
on the offset I might mess things up
top yeah top 50%
oh I think I need container
hello see if you already know JavaScript
and don't want to learn PHP MySQL has no
comparable okay you buy I think
personally note is better than PHP and
SQL it's a lot faster and I don't think
there's anything in PHP can really do
that node can't but my sequel is not
really my sequel just database so you
could still use my I don't know but if
you want it yeah I check my when when
you're talking JavaScript it it's really
JavaScript versus PHP and as far as
being able to run anywhere so if you
learn PHP that's cool you can write
server-side stuff all day long if you
want to do and interpreter activity in
your browser you're still gonna have to
learn JavaScript yep so why not learning
JavaScript really well and run it on the
server and the client and in fact you
can use isomorphic frameworks to where
90% of the code you write is used on the
server and the client both so you reduce
the amount of code that you have to
write which reduces the amount of bugs
that you write speeds up your
development time yeah and you can I mean
a lot of people only think you know I
think a node or JavaScript and you think
websites but that's not really the case
you can use server-side scripts things
that don't even belong on websites with
node in fact I just did that yesterday
yep there's quite a bit of stuff people
are using node for robotics now in fact
I know a guy that's using node to power
essentially a web service that tracks
entry into something with some raspberry
pi devices he built that thing in the
background running is the terminal and
it is grunt
I believe running in the background
running its file watcher so every time a
file changes grunt picks up that file
change and in recompile say application
yep and also is live reload so when the
file change it'll refresh my browser
automatically which I don't think you
can really do with PHP so plus one to
node yeah all right so back to moving
this down yeah
with saw on a percent top oh yeah that
doesn't go there it should be in
container think I'm not sure you want to
do position absolutely yeah
no I don't
maybe you do well better
position:relative
yeah I could try that if not all maybe
I'll choose another rapper yeah
container has some weird stuff going on
with it I love that my my keyboard Beck
I've never really used a mechanical
keyboard I mean I did like back in the
day when that was the thing like the
only thing you could use but since I've
gotten cool I haven't really yeah I got
a Corsair Vengeance k70 keyboard yeah
it's uh well I got it when I was
actually playing Starcraft pretty
regularly and I kept it it just it makes
you say it even if you're not doing a
lot it makes it sound like you're so
productive I Rangeley coming down here
with 100% baby yeah yeah happened to our
columns it's not really bad though
maybe somebody's already figured out how
to do this
bootstrap vertical-align Oh God in their
vertical align class oh maybe or like a
select your vertical align the center I
can do be a lion
hmm I'll be right back
my my lining kugel is unfortunately
empty
Oh
Wow flexible box we're too cool oh so
this guy was doing what I was trying to
do earlier with the Flex box
yeah I didn't work at all unfortunately
I don't think bootstrap plays well with
Flex boxes yeah oh wait no II knew that
over I think bitch Stratfor is gonna be
all flex box stuff oh really
yeah I don't know I might be I might be
making it up hey people are mess or
missioning me on twitter well Briana
mentioned me I'm famous hey sea snails
says you sound so pretentious kappa
your life's not pretentious you know
extreme moderation says me okay hey sue
snail says not you the other guy yeah
I'm definitely not pretentious and I'm
googling how to vertical line oh yeah
yeah I don't know why is is not working
yeah it's a giant pain man mm-hmm
the top didn't work just setting a top
like 50 percent on it yeah I can try
I'll put on everything
Oh
peace peace and chat guys peace and chat
it's the Internet
everyone's a pretentious asshole
somebody had to have done this already
everyone else using flags but I didn't
work for me
big isn't flex with bit your yeah
that's what it looks like well I mean it
might work
berkel aligned responsive oh no this
images floating on display inline
display:inline-block well i'm middle I'm
trying
yeah there's that train again it's a
little trend that could man that's just
letting you know it
well I may have to come back to this I
don't think it's an important issue to
spend all this time on no I would agree
it's all right so we need to make a
absolutely horrendous user experience
once they log in if we're gonna clone
snapchat so we start working on the
interface yeah I think so
so before we do that let's think about
what we want though I think the ability
to send pictures and time amount is
probably one of the last things that we
need to think about so a user is gonna
log in and they're gonna need to be able
to add friends so we're gonna have a
French list in that they'll need to be
able to add someone as a friend so do
you have do you have sketch or anything
sketch not sketch oh you should
definitely get sketch and Aaron out yeah
how's GIMP I think yeah so let's see all
right well while you set up the they're
out for it so after they log in it's
going to take him to the next so set up
a route and a blank view for now and I
will work on
sitting on something profile I get an
eyeball
I guess chat I guess yeah
all right now I want a couture
oh not in the right directory I want
Toller oh yes I do won't grow
and this is probably gonna be pretty
interesting to our viewers so make sure
you're explaining what you're what
you're doing here yeah so I don't know
how long you guys have been in here but
we created this using the yeoman
generator angular full-stack and that
has different methods you can use to
create different sections</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
