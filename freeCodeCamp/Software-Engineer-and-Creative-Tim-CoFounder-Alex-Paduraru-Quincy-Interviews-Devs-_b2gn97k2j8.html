and I am thrilled to welcome him he is
currently in Romania and he is joining
us for this live interview just a little
bit about Alex
alex is the co-founder of creative Tim
which is a product design company
basically they build web design tools
for developers and they have an
extremely popular bootstrap template
which Alex will talk about a little bit
but one of the really cool things about
alex is that he and his co-founder
kristina they were able to basically go
from working in a starbucks doing
consulting work as college students to
three years later having this company
that generates around i think it's
twenty two thousand gross each month and
then after they pay their vendors and
everything it's seventeen thousand
dollars so they're doing this on their
own it's amazing so Alex thank you for
joining us yeah thank you Quincy I'm
really happy to have this interview with
you and thank you for everything that
you did with with the articles and all
your help so you're doing a great job
with free code camp so thank you so
everybody if you haven't read Alex's
article it's currently one of the top
articles on medium I've linked to it
below and it's just like this amazing
epic blow-by-blow of how they built this
company up how they marketed their
product how they built their product how
they learned a whole bunch of additional
skills so check that out I've also
linked to their their company website
which you can check out as well and be
sure to follow Alex on Twitter he's
really interesting guy
Thanks so I want to talk a little bit
about the history of creative Taman and
how you and Christina got this going can
you tell us a little bit about
background yeah we used to work since
the faculty period of time so actually
we get in contact with boost drop the
the famous framework but the course in
faculty then we just used that to get
some websites for different friends and
and all those people that say hey can
you build a website for me because you
are in in the mathematics and computer
science university and we said okay yeah
let's do this and we started to build
the websites then there was a guy who
requested us an invoice and in that
moment we had to create our company we
created the company and we continued to
do services for different guys and then
at some point we we've seen that we
always have to create all the items
again and again and again like landing
pages login models dashboards actually
everything that to need for a website we
had to create it from zero and we
decided to to create some kids that are
helping us in the work with clients
taking this further and checking the
marketplaces and everything that was in
that period of time we decided to create
a product that can help also the other
agencies to take this process and to
create a website for their clients so we
were thinking okay if we're two guys and
we have this problem we always have to
create this that means there are also
other agencies in the world that are
having the same problem with us so let's
see if this is just our idea or our
method of work or if this is a method of
work also for the other agencies and
then we created our UI kids
it was the gadget on kid
and we posted on our website on creative
team and we've seen a lot of good
feedback on it and people just starting
to use it in this way in on that time we
validated our idea so that means there
are more agencies in the world or
freelancers or guys who are doing
websites that need like like the base
they need the base for their projects in
this we decided to create more
components and to add all those
components in a package and ask for
money and then we see that people
started to pay for it and we said ok
this is the point that our idea is fully
validated if somebody is paying for your
product that means you solve real
problem for for somebody awesome so this
is like introduction about so basically
you created these tools you put them out
there as developers so people were
asking for that created them people
started using them and then you started
charging from more premium stuff you use
a premium model yes this is the premium
model where you acquire an audience and
traffic for the free products and then
you try to sell for for the premium
versions and you have tons of different
web design agencies companies freelance
developers who were paying in licenses
to be able to use the most advanced like
non premium premium versions exactly and
the premium was nothing so different or
complex or it was the same as the free
but has more components so to get from
free to premium is not something really
really hard it's just more work right
and speaking of work I just want to put
this in context but at the time that you
and Christina were doing this you were
yes
college student you were third year
undergraduate computer science and
mathematics students exactly Oh
you were basically working doing a
consultancy as well you're a building
project for individual clients yes also
started building your own product you
did that and then after you finished
college you also went and you did a
master's degree in software engineering
both of you exactly yeah you were going
to school the entire time you built this
yeah yeah we had to do this so like our
families or were happy with okay our
kids are going to school like all those
kids we just wanted to have that we had
like an idea that if we start something
then we have to finish it it doesn't
matter how hard it is going on the way
so in this way we will not stop because
we are tired or because we we just don't
feel good to go to school and we well we
just wanted to finish the school I mean
I'm not saying that finished or doing
the master degree change too much our
course but it was something that we had
to do so that's the the idea so yeah we
did that in parallel we've been working
for different clients we've been doing
the school and the project and
everything there and we were also doing
the in parallel the products for for
creative team so that was the third year
of faculty and the first year of off
master it was a mess we've been working
also on Saturday on Sunday you could
find us every morning joining in a in
the Romanian Starbucks at the 99 a.m.
til the night we we always closed with
those guys oh yeah it was crazy we've
worked really really really hard well
here it is it's is it a pm in Romania
right now yeah it's a p.m. yeah and
you're here but you're no longer in a
Starbucks you're in your own beautiful
yeah yeah we have we have a great office
and that's good
also the we are not working at this
moment we are not
as crazy as we did in the first two
years we have like almost normal
programs like until 6 7 8 p.m. and yeah
I think it's it's good that we we also
have time to to recharge and to to be
productive for the next day and do you
all have a team of developers and
designers now working for you uh yeah
yeah we at this moment we're seven guys
which are working full-time and we have
two guys who are doing part-time of
they're helping us with different items
that we we need Wow
so you you've really come a long way
from working in a service yeah and you
are looking for two new guys so well we
are growing very very well awesome
well there there are some questions that
have been like like I read your article
of course I added it and we published it
in free cocaine's publications and I
heard about your product before you
reached out to me and it's just really
amazingly beautifully designed I mean
there's a reason why all these people
are coming up and giving you a whole
bunch of money for this product
it looks yes how did you learn design
you're both both you and Christina are
software engineers yes yes yeah I want
to be 100% sincere because the guys who
are watching us I hope they'll learn a
lot from this yeah we copied a lot in
the beginning from from Apple so we've
seen okay we had this in mind if we want
to become a good company on delivering
products with great design go and look
for the best in the market who is doing
great design and we've checked and we
seen that Apple is is the greatest in
the design and we started to dig in
their interface checking the gradients
the icons that they creating the the
board the reviews and we've got
everything like
there I owe a saps from phone from
tablet the interface from from the Mac
everything we started and we reject
everything that they created then we
used dribble for inspiration there are a
lot of great designers on dribble I
think the greatest designers you can
find on on dribble and this is what we
we did we've checked for example before
doing the product we we checked like 10
20 products that are similar in our area
and we took the greatest part that we
can see there is the greatest from each
from each interface that we found we've
put that together and then we we've got
the final product so yes it was copying
a lot from from a great companies so
copying the master so to speak copying
the Masters and you will become a master
of course on our latest product the
copying process is reduced oh I don't
know 5% because we already formed our
mentality and how our products are
looking we have a trend that we we set
and of course we are not inspiring too
much at this moment so but but in the
beginning I think you should learn for
example if you'd want to do design go
and check the greatest designers on
market if you are writing code
go and check how the greatest
programmers are coding and learn how how
the greatest are doing the those stuffs
and you will be like them in a couple of
years yeah it's easier than ever I mean
everything's on dribble as you said
exactly everything is on tree but
everything is published you you have a
lot of repositories and a lot of places
where you can learn and that is that
it's always it's fantastic because you
don't learn this in school right and
just to put this in perspective of human
history right like as
fifteen 20 years ago you were able to go
on and see what other people are doing
before that you've wait until a book was
published and exactly within the years I
mean before that people are literally
writing letters and hand copying
manuscripts we live in an age where it's
so easy to get access to the works of
the masters exactly exactly
and and I'm sorry go ahead no and that's
not a shame so I I want to be sincere
and I'm just saying I'd go and check
what what others are doing so that
that's the best way to learn and to you
compete with a lot of people so you have
to do something to be different so yeah
but everything I think everything is
possible as well I'll tell you what
really blows my mind like I'm very
impressed that you learned all these
things about design but one thing that's
very hard that it I think people don't
understand how hard it is is marketing
and actually reaching out you know it
like it's not it's not build it and
they'll come it's very much build it
then shove it down their throats you
know yeah and yeah it's really the
marketing is it's really hard also for
us because we we come from the makers
area so we are the makers we like to
make something we like to code something
to design something and and then put it
on internet and just wait and see okay
so the guys will come and pay for it and
download it but this will never happen
so you have to go and find people stalk
them ask them to try your product you
have to do all these things that are not
natural to you I say where we come from
them makers field and from what I know
the makers hate the marketing they just
like to create stuff and and publish it
and then create again and again so yeah
it was difficult to to put our products
on
one market and two to see how how people
interact with with them in the beginning
we we just used Twitter we wish we were
searching for different hashtags that
were on our area like date pickers login
models and all that stuff that we built
we've seen that there were some guys who
are talking about those products and we
just ask them they do have time to check
our product our picker our stuff of
course we got like one in 100 responded
to us the others in Thursday okay we
give leave me alone or I don't care I
don't need it
then we continued to to check different
communities on that period of time we
we've seen some forums for designers we
asked them what they think about our
products and all that stuff in the
beginning actually nobody really
understood what we are trying to do we
we wanted to to create better interfaces
also for for the products that were on
that on the market like the date pickers
and all that stuff for bootstrap we
wanted to come with an interface that is
better and after we created our first UI
kit people started to understand okay
that that's a new idea I can build a web
page so we just test with with freebies
with UI kids we're plugins and when
people started to understand what we are
doing they also came to our website and
downloaded them then we appeared on I
think on product hunt and people said
they liked our products and started to
use them then we created the premium
version and that that was the sorry
that's so producthunt played a big role
and you well-known yeah we and I know a
lot of people who
products they want to launch them on
product hunt do you have any ideas for
for a successful product launch yeah we
at this moment you are doing since it's
because we we create templates in UI
kids that means we can launch every time
on production because it's a new product
so if learning the of course doing some
tests that the best way is to have
somebody who who can post the who can do
the post featured so you need somebody
who is from the staff or from what I
know there are some accounts who have
the the featured post and when you have
the featured post it appears in the
first page and then you you have to to
talk with some some friends or with some
guys or if you have a newsletter just
ask them okay with appear on product
hunt just help us with on our boat or
with something III know this this is
against the rules of production but you
have to you have to give that that
little boost in the beginning like ten
five I don't know 15 up votes because
otherwise it will just disappear in in
the list it's crazy in these days right
yeah and same thing is with like hacker
news and designer news you need just a
little boost but then of course you can
you can talk with 15 friends they
approved it it and then if if the
community doesn't above it it and then
you cannot do anything but you just need
to give us more a quick boost then the
community decides if your product is
great or not right and that's the
problem is there's just so many products
being released there's so much noise
naturally the lot of noise and the
strategy that I I just told you was also
posted on medium it was very popular a
lot of recommendations like 2000
recommendations so people know this
strategy and that's
there is also a lot of noise but in that
noise if you if you give a little boost
or what we are post and if you have a
good product I mean a great product then
the community just uploaded it so this
is what we have learned till now so so
it was just to reiterate everybody
watching it was not enough for Alex and
Cristina to build an amazing UI kit it
was not enough for them to merely build
it and design it and for it to work
great and make people happy they still
had to kind of go out and get the
initial user base who would start
spreading word and and that involved
just like people often call that growth
hacking which I think it's kind of a
ridicule term but I I will tell you free
code camp didn't just take off because I
said because the pre-code came back
column was accessible on the Internet
thank you I had to put a lot of time and
energy in and make it yeah yeah know
that it existed in care that it existed
so exactly and and I think Alex and what
he and Christina have built with
creative Tim is an excellent example of
how you can build something really
amazing and then you can also go out and
do a good job of evangelizing it yeah
and more important is that we we started
with zero investment so we just paid for
for the creative team site and that's it
we all that we invested was our time and
all that we did for for those growth
hacking zwi we did it with zero with
zero dollars so if you just have to do
hustle so yeah and so so just to be
clear creative team is what we call
bootstrapped like they didn't go to you
know Mark Cuban or mark and recast with
millions of dollars they literally just
started in a cafe yeah working I feel I
think this is this is a this should be
the natural growth of each company just
build something test it send it to some
users ask them to give you
feedback and then if you get feedback
and the feedback is good and people want
more from you then you just create the
pro version the premium and and what you
want to do it's easier to test them to
grow like that then going to an investor
getting I don't know a couple of hundred
thousand dollars 1 million dollars then
trying to figure all these things out
and what to build yeah of course 99% of
of the star of the startups fail because
they don't test this before getting
those money and they just oh okay we've
got some money let's see how we spend
them so you have to to try it and and
try try try it and try it again of
course every time when we post it on
different communities we've got band
we've got we have to create an other
accounts to do it again and we just test
all the possible items so just to
reiterate like pretty much everything I
think alex has been saying it's just you
have to hustle you have to power through
any setbacks and adversity let's talk
about what you're working on now so you
have like six different products I
believe different UI kits and tools do
you have anything exciting that you can
tell us about that you're working on
right now yeah yeah we have there is a
new eye kit built by the guys from
envision it's called now UI and it was
very very popular like two years ago and
I think it is still popular and we
wanted to create also the HTML for that
UI kit it is all just for sketch and
Photoshop and we wanted to create
something also for the developers and
we've got the approval from the guys
from envision to create that UI kit it
will be released under the MIT license
like all the other freebies also we are
we are releasing them to MIT license so
more people can use them and what
they want it done man and yet this is
something that that I think it will be
huge this year having that UIKit for
developers I think that will be really
huge well it's great that you're
releasing all these things open source
because it just goes to show that you
can totally build a sustainable
bootstrap business and still open source
a significant amount of what yeah yeah
anyway sorry I'm just going to say the
MIT license is like one of the most
permissive licenses so you can do
literally anything with this pretty much
yeah in the beginning we didn't know how
to protect our items and how to keep
them under our hood so okay this is
built by creative team and all that
stuff then we realized this year that it
makes no sense to keep all that stuff
it's a lot of great stuff and we've
invested a lot of months and a lot of
hours of work and why should we keep it
just for under our license it's part of
our culture to help the developers so we
decided to release all that we build all
the freebies all the UI keys that are
for free under MIT license also of
course this this will give us some more
users because the that will be spread to
a lot of developers but in the same time
we risk that other companies to take our
products and sell them and do everything
that they want but I think it's it's
something that in the end will help us
and we'll have the developers yeah and
again I just want to applaud you for
making it open-source a lot of people
are protective of their intellectual
property and you know but a lot of
people I know who run bootstrap startups
and and communities and nonprofits
they're making everything open source
and
I really think that's the way forward
like you don't even have to make I mean
you can do what's called open core which
get lab is open core basically the core
product of get lab is completely open
source and then they have additional
functionality of modules that you can
basically buy a license to you so but
what you're doing with creative Tim is
for a vast majority of developers
especially the developers you don't
necessarily have a credit card they
don't necessarily have a lot of money
they can still use like a version of
your product for free I think it's still
going to tremendous amount of the
utility out of that and then for the
enterprises and the deep pockets they
can come and get it now so it's exactly
the idea yes and it's the big companies
that are basically able to sponsor all
the individual developers who can't
afford it to also be able to have a
version of that product yes
for me that's just like really profound
that that's also what we we wanted to
achieve so giving those products for
free to all the people so they don't
have to come to our website and inspect
element and just still the resource you
have it's under MIT just build great
products with this and and maybe if if
there will be developers who see value
in this maybe they can contribute and in
this way we create together a better
product so I think it's it's a good move
the going under MIT yeah well I have to
ask is the entire time we've been
talking I've been looking at your
beautiful adorable logo of creative
mascot and also the name of your company
how did you call the name creative
teaming and the the Tim figure yeah in
the beginning we wanted to have the name
creative theme so team for the team
template and the domain name in the name
was was already purchased by somebody
else
and we just used the Romanian
pronunciation for theme which is like
team
and we've seen that that domain is
available we purchase it and then we
were thinking okay this team can be also
persona 4 for our users and we we've got
the guy who is in the back and we wanted
to make that guy with the so the the
users who are coming to our website to
identify with it ok that guy it's like a
developer or designer and this is the
the story of the name awesome whoa it's
been an absolute pleasure talking with
you Alex
thank you I want to thank all of our
live audience for hanging out and I
really appreciate everybody who watches
these below we have links to to the
creative team website to the extremely
popular article it's currently one of
the top articles on medium that Alex
wrote and also I strongly recommend you
follow Alex on Twitter he's always got
great insights and thank you thank you
for joining us Alex thank you hello
pleasure see you soon bye everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
