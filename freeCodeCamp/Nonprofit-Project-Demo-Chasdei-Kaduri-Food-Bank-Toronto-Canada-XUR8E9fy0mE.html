today I will introduce to you the
nonprofit project at me and my partner
Harry have been working on for the past
three months castigado is an
organization nonprofit organization
based in Toronto Canada and they
approached us because they wanted to
digitalize their entire workflow they
helped poverty alleviation by sending
food packages every week and they have
around 300 volunteers and clients and
there's at the moment they had a lot of
stuff coming wrong and with the
inventory system and keeping track of
which packages have been delivered and
which not so that's what we have done
I'm going to go into login here real
quick and go over the features and then
at the end I will explain the technology
style that we've used so first off the
just client database and this one
because all the clients that of Casta
Kaduri
and their statuses so when a client's
submits his form digitally previously
was on paper so we've created an
application form for them and when they
do that then the volunteers or the the
stakeholder can't approve or reject them
and this is basically the table and a
need overview of all the clients you can
click on a client and see all their data
their financial information food
preferences also their household if they
have children or other family and then
you can basically choose to accept
reject making a client inactive or
deleted and then there's also
a place which you can generate then we
have a table and yet this is pretty neat
for the for our stakeholder you wanted
to have that so you can have a overview
you can present to his volunteers and
you can also export the data in an Excel
or a CSV format the next concert next
feature is the food schedule these are
all the food items that currently is in
stock the name the starting date of the
schedule and the frequency so what it
has to be delivered every week or every
other week or for items that are less
frequent like ketchup or for example
sugar then you can do that every once a
month or six weeks so you can edit that
in line choose a date and choose a
number so yeah the next feature is the
packing list so after all the inventory
has been filled in then the packing list
is it's being printed out for the
volunteers and they also able to to
checkmark a client whether it be back to
not so and this packing list basically
the algorithm behind it takes into
account the clients food preferences it
takes into account the food inventories
that's in place and it also takes into
account the food schedule so which items
are to be packed this week so as you can
see the first client here only has has
less atoms at the second one because
most probably he his preferences are
different and again for this table we
have a print list as well so volunteers
can print it out and check mark on their
own but they also have access to this
part of the admin so basically the whole
app is has this is the admin panel but
the clients volunteers and donors also
have their own
section on this website so and their
based on roles so volunteers there
they're able to view the packing list
and a full schedule but clients for
example they're not so yeah and then you
can check mark off and send packages and
hopefully it's done yeah and then the
inventory this is the place where all
the food items are being inserted this
is mostly done at the beginning and then
you don't have to keep it up to date
because the quantities are subtracted
automatically when a packing list has
been delivered so you have food
categories on the left you can edit them
in line so and food items on the right
you can add a food item or search for
say soda yeah and you can edit them so
of course even delete them and then next
onto the second the next feature the
driver Center all assignments so these
are a list of the drivers and their
deliverer status what is completed or
pending and if you have general notes of
on the delivery pretty simple and then
the route assignments we've integrated
with Google Maps in here so it's so yeah
the admin can have a neat overview of
all the clients and their address or
addresses on the map and he can select
them based on the location and say ok
these two are pretty close to each other
let's assign them to simona and then
Simona's assigned to the client so she
has she received the plans on the
backend and she can then proceed on with
the delivery then the volunteer database
this is a list like the same pretty much
similar to the client database but then
for the volunteers and their statuses
and you can see more information of
åland here we can assign the driver role
to them so volunteers can
treiber's and yeah you can also delete
them if you want to and then the last is
the donor database this is a list of all
the donors the total amount that they
have made it and somebody's information
if you click on a donor it then it gets
see the list of their donations and the
dates and amounts and the type of a
donation and if you click on none
donation then together I mean tomorrow
where you can see more information
detailed information about it and you
can also send the email and tax receipt
Thank You emote and tax receipt to the
daughter so that he can he or she can
print out for Texas tax purposes so
that's pretty much the features that we
have in here the stacked that we've used
this we start off with the mean stack
with a mean boilerplate so film ejs and
then we've used quite a few of third
party libraries first of all we
integrated with Google Maps API with
manual API for the mailing systems and
with mail chip Jim so that because our
current state called the Jonathan was
using MailChimp to keep keep the emails
and names and send out mailing list if
he wants to so we've integrated with
that so that he can extract data from
here and insert it into there and
otherwise other than that we also used a
bootstrap on the front and angular of
course part of the mean stack we've used
moment Jes we've also used that the
admin LTE that's the template you see
right here and the pretty neat actions
and quite a few others on the back end
we have the node mailer to send out the
emails sweet template but you're not
using the template engine that much
because we have angular on the front-end
of course we're using a UI router with
angular
and angular Google Maps wrapper so that
we makes it easier to integrate Google
Maps with it and many many many more
I've too much to cover in five minutes
so yeah if you have any questions about
this feel free to ask them - to Nitin or
Quincy and now I'll get back to you or
you can get straight to me you can find
me an FCC chat
my name is maximization or Twitter at
underscore maximization shoot me feel
free to send me an email or message and
I'll answer any question you might have
I'll be delighted to
also if you working on nonprofit project
in the future for free code camp then
and your your your scope of the project
is pretty much the same as ours and you
find yourself with problems ask me how
to gear be glad to help because you
don't need to reinvent the wheel that's
that's it have a nice meeting after this
and see you soon
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
