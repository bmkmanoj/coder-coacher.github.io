camp and I am thrilled today to accept
this award from YouTube on behalf of the
free code camp community so I'm going to
open this up before I do I have some
important people whom I need to thank
free code camps YouTube channel would
not be possible without the help of
several key contributors beau Karns
Breanna Swift Jesse Weigel Cody Siebert
prithi Cassidy and Ava Wujek these
people have been absolutely instrumental
in helping the free code camp YouTube
channel grow and they've contributed a
significant amount of the hours of
learning material we push every single
week so several months ago we did a
survey of about 20,000 developers and we
found that YouTube is by far the most
popular way that people learn to code
and seventy-five percent of respondents
said that they use some YouTube channels
or others to continue to improve their
developer skills so we've really made
this a new focus of the freako camp
community so let's go ahead and open
this up first there was a letter that
came with it the letter is from the CEO
of YouTube Susan Wojcicki and she says
you've done something that very few
YouTube creators have accomplished
you've had an astonishing hundred
thousand people subscribe to your
channel so you can see that I think
we're already up to two hundred thousand
people who've subscribed now so there's
a little bit of a delay when we hit that
and when they send it out but what they
sent seems to be pretty cool let's open
it up so first there's this nice box we
can bust it open here
once you remove the cover there's foam
inside and if you peel back the foam
there is a picture frame I'm going to
get it out of the plastic here
and here it is it says free code camp
congratulations for surpassing 100,000
subscribers so there you go thank you so
much for watching free code camps
YouTube channel I am linking to in the
description of this video several videos
that we published recently that I think
are very emblematic of the kinds of
videos that we hope to publish in the
future and I thank you all so much for
tuning in and for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
