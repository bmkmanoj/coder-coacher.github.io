the classic 1980s game Simon let's take
a look at what the app should end up
looking like something like this of
course you're welcome to stylize it with
different sounds and colors but
basically this is a pretty accurate
rendition of what the original Simon
game looked like you turn it on and it
would show you how many steps or in the
current iteration after we click start
here so we'll click start and then we
got blue so I'll press blue blue red
blue red blue red blue okay so at this
point I'm gonna get it wrong blue red
green and you note that it gives me
feedback that I've got it wrong and it
starts replaying it now I can enable
something called strict mode and then if
I mess up it'll notify me that I messed
up and it'll start with it it'll start
way back at the beginning so it gives me
a new pattern to work through so this is
how the gameplay looks and now we can go
over the user stories as a user I'm
presented with a random series of button
presses as a user each time I input a
series of button presses correctly I see
the same series of button presses but
with an additional step as a user I hear
a sound that corresponds to each button
both when the series of button presses
plays and when I personally press a
button as a user if I press the wrong
button
I am notified that I've done so and that
series of button presses starts again to
remind me of the pattern so I can retry
as a user I can see how many steps are
in the current series of button presses
as a user and this is a bonus story as a
user if I want to restart I can hit a
button to do so and the game will return
to a single step so a reset button
story as a user I can play in strict
mode where if I get a button press wrong
it notifies me that I've done so and the
game restarts add a new random series of
fun button presses as a user the tempo
of the game speeds up incrementally on
the 5th 9th and 13th step now this
actually resembles the original games
gameplay but actually get faster the
farther you went as a user I could win
the game by getting a series of 20 steps
correct
and I'm notified of my victory then the
game starts over now you probably
weren't able to hear the sound when I
was playing it but we have sounds right
here that you can grab these are from
the original Simon game and of course
you're welcome to inject your own
creativity into this challenge feel free
to use whatever sounds you want whatever
colors or textures you're interested in
this will be a pretty challenging
zipline but I'm sure you can do it happy
