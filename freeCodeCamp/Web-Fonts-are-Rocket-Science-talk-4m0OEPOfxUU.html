transmitting we had I was told that
Twitter display names were not legally
binding and I'm very disappointed that
you use that in my introduction but okay
here we go alright I work at filling my
group how many guys know Phil my girl no
phone one good all right great
that's a great number we were website
consultancy we do performance reviews we
do website development yeah get in touch
if you're interested so today we're
going to talk about web fonts this image
is particularly relevant because of the
SpaceX Falcon Heavy launched a stir day
or this morning to today what day is it
with yesterday all right yeah completely
thrown off hmm so yeah web fonts are
rocket science not rocket science so
it's actually kind of interesting if you
look on your name badge the text from my
talk doesn't actually include the
Unicode characters that we're missing
there so it's advertising the web fonts
are rocket science I'm here to try to
convince you today that web fonts are
not rocket science we'll see if I'm
successful in that or not today we're
gonna kind of go over that red is not
good all right
the first topic is MIT the second is
invisible and unstyled text font paste
syntax and font loading strategies to
improve the web font performance on your
websites so how many people know this
guy couple all right yeah it's kind of
expected US presidential candidate Mitt
Romney lovely face better than the
alternative US presidential candidates I
can put up there so Mitt Romney was
deciding whether or not he wanted to run
for president in January of 2015 and
ultimately he decided not to run but
slate.com ran this headline on their
website which James Muspratt took a
screenshot of and it said Mitt Romney's
officially running for president the
exact opposite of what was actually
occurring and this was a web font
loading problem because Mitt Romney is
not running for president and not was in
italic and I'll go over the why that is
later
so this is a huge problem right because
there's a war on journalism right now
and the accuracy of headlines is very
important so similarly this California
newspaper in 1918 might have posted a
headline that said the world is over
when in fact the world war was over or
this Baltimore paper in 1912 might have
posted a headline that said that all
Titanic passengers are safe and they're
in lifeboats actually they did do that
so yeah so you web fonts are kind of a
Content problem in a performance problem
rolled into one your content problem is
now informed by your performance problem
so a little bit about rocket science
before we continue rocket science is
more commonly called aerospace
engineering it's divided into
aeronautical and astronautical things
that find the air things that fly in
space completely are irrelevant to the
topic of the stuck because web fonts as
I said earlier are not rocket science
so topic two invisible and on sale text
so web browsers have chosen a default
way to load a font a web font and often
that is invisible to make the web font
rendering text the text invisible while
it's loading so after a few seconds
after the web con is successfully loaded
it will rerender using the web font
content and this is called the flash of
invisible text so hopefully the text
will come back and when it does it will
render so that's great I didn't name
that so don't get on me about horrible
acronyms so but this sort of creates a
problem right the text is invisible the
text would be readable system fonts had
been used and so at least your
complaints like this remember when the
text used to load before the images I'm
gonna complain about image optimization
so text your load before images right
the text is there the content is there
so the other approach sort of to
mitigate invisible text is to show the
fallback font while the web font is
loading so this is usually the first
local or system font in your web font
stack and this is called the flash of
unstyled text so when the web font
content comes back it will rerender
using the new web
as I mentioned this is called the flash
of unstyled gone
no @x excuse me so those kind of pitted
designers versus developers and this
sort of I don't know sort of adversarial
relationship because on one hand
designers want full control over the
medium they want the text to be
invisible wow that is interesting how it
loads all right so they want full
control over the medium they want the
the no fallback fonts to be shown until
the web font has successfully loaded and
developers want to render as quickly as
possible they want to render that
Minimum Viable Product to the user as
fast as possible and all of these things
are sort of rooted in the flash of
unstyled content which is a really old
problem when it came to CSS loading so
you don't want your HTML to render
before your CSS is finished loading so
browsers will typically block and show
white screen well that's well that's why
your CSS external CSS is loading and
that's why we do things today like
inline our CSS critical CSS and things
like that the sort of elevation of the
flash of unstyled text to be on par with
the flash of unstyled content I feel
like is is not warranted and I think
it's kind of unfair because we have
great tools to minimize the effect of
the flash of unstyled text so we can't
have this saying it's making a mountain
out of a molehill right the flash of
unstyled content very serious problem
flash of unstyled text not so much so
how many people are familiar with lift
coefficients nobody a one person are you
a physicist hey nice cover your ears
lift coefficient is dimensionless unit
that relates the lift Andrade by a body
compared to the fluid density around the
body
again completely irrelevant cuz we're
not talking about rocket science here
we're talking about web fonts so back to
Mitt Romney the easiest way to sort of
solve this mit romney web font loading
problem which i will keep them i will
keep repeating that phrase to my death
it will always be the MIT
any web font loading problem is not to
use web fonts right but we don't want to
do this that's not a good solution to
the problem the second easiest way is to
only use one web font so don't use an
italic we don't want to do that either
we want to provide techno tech nakum's
technical solutions to problems that
enable our designs
so the third easiest way to mitigate
this problem is to force a flash of
unstyled text for all of our web fonts
so this sort of default browser behavior
is very contentious it's sort of gone
back and forth for a long time and
people don't really agree and when these
kind of situations happen we need tools
or we need specifications we need
standards and web browsers that allow us
to customize that behavior but again
it's it's a very contentious topic so
historically looking back at the history
of font face in 1997 the first web
browser with web fonts came out it was
in our Explorer a shout out to them nice
they added font face support with a full
flash of unstyled text so by default it
would show system fonts while the web
fonts were loading opera was the only
other browser that existed at that time
on this specific chart and then in 2003
Safari came out did not have font face
support so full six years later only one
web browser with with the web fonts 2004
Firefox and in 2008 the second browser
finally added font face supports web
fonts a full 11 years after Internet
Explorer first pioneered it but they've
decided to use invisible fonts with an
unlimited timeout so until the web font
successfully loaded it would make the
entire text on your page invisible which
is not good but it is kind of
unbelievable how much weight this sort
of had on the default browser behavior
moving forward
so in 2008 chrome came out they add web
fonts it was based on WebKit which is
the same as Safari at the time so they
shared that same decision in 2009
Firefox added web fonts with a flash
once out text a nice good job opera I
added it in 2009 again with the flash of
unstyled text and then to sort of
mitigate this sort of invisible versus
unstyled there was a third behavior that
was added which was to add a timeout a
three-second timeout so if the font was
invisible for more than three seconds if
it hadn't loads loaded successfully it
would render the fallback text until the
web font came back so you would see
invisible text for up to three seconds
and then after that you'd see system
fonts and then when the web font finally
came back it would rerender using the
web font content but three seconds a
maximum of three seconds is a quite a
long time so I'm gonna take a deep
breath and hit a button and we're gonna
all wait three seconds together already
300 word alright so after three seconds
it'll render the fallback text I think
this is Helvetica or Arial I'm not sure
don't get mad at me that don't know the
difference between them right now and
then when the web font comes back it'll
rerender using that web font content so
that's kind of nice but it just sort of
complicates the whole thing even more so
in 2011 Firefox added the timeout which
is great 2012 opera followed suit 2013
opera switched to an infinite timeout
because I don't know why I wish they
hadn't and then in 2014
chrome switched to use the timeout and
of course as many of you know opera
switched to the blank rendering engine
to follow chrome and they went back to
the timeout
so yeah interesting then in 2015 edge
was added and they went all in on their
unstyled text which is nice
see and then finally eight years after
safari added web font support they
switched to add a timeout timeout so I
feel like are very important because
without a timeout your text is sort of
or your web fonts become a single point
of failure so if they if they request
hangs your text might never render so
timeouts are very important for the
robust and serve our sites but again
invisible text is not ideal so this is
great modern day we have no infinite
timeouts array celebration with that
awesome completely red X that you all
can see and appreciate so if this is a
little bit confusing to you I actually
built the tool that will allow you to
compare the two behavior side by side so
you go to my website slash point out you
can play around with timeouts just in
the thing it's just emulator which will
kind of show you so you can change the
load time to whatever you want in the
little text box and I think there's
different load times this is an old
screenshot there's different load times
for all your I think for different web
fonts I have on this example so you can
play around with that and see how see
the difference and how they feel and
just sort of play around with the
behavior so the interesting thing kind
of is to me at least that the Floyd will
repaint more than the foul so if you're
looking for consistency in browser
loading progressive loading of your page
Floyd may not be ideal so orbital
maneuvers you want to come up here and
explain orbital maneuvers no okay yeah I
don't blame you
normal maneuver is the use of propulsion
systems to change the orbit of a
spacecraft
and I think this slide really highlights
the differences between web fonts and
rocket science they're much different as
you might imagine and again web fonts
not not rocket science as your name tag
might suggest so font face let's do a
little syntax so Ward Cunningham
famously said it's all tacked till the
code runs so let's look at some actual
code so if you go to Google or your
favorite search engine I DuckDuckGo I
love that one
and look for font pay syntax you'll find
this lovely giant what their what's
known as the bulletproof bulletproof
font face syntax and you'll want to take
that and burn it to the ground because
we're not going to use it it's outdated
in archaic and that has way too many
formats we don't need to worry about
that
so let's retire bulletproof font face
it's no longer necessary what we can do
now is just use two formats it's great
it's very simple use wofe too and wofe
and that will provide a great broad
experience for a broad number of website
web browsers so quite a bit better
compression is built into these formats
so you don't need to really worry about
compression headers or any server
configuration you can play around with
gzip and some people have found marginal
differences between the two but for the
most part you really only need to worry
about these two formats and the nice
thing is that web fonts can be
progressive enhancement right if if
rouser doesn't support this we're using
them for content fonts and that icon
fonts again so just don't use icon fonts
ever I will go out and say that just
don't just icon fonts no SVG yes but if
using for content fonts web fonts are
great they're great progressive
enhancement and if and if the web
browser doesn't support font face
fallback is fine you don't worry about
it
there's a little bonus tip for you if
you you could actually alias web fonts
and their local fonts in a you know web
browser and your CSS so if you have a
font place block and you'll save font
family Helvetica and an alias it to
Comic Sans everyone on your project will
really appreciate and be it'll be super
easy to do but debug why the well any
use some pill fatica renders as Comic
Sans so you can throw that in your
project and I'm sure your colleagues
will appreciate it alright so let's go
into a little bit about some font
loading strategies so this is kind of
the meat of the presentation how to make
our web fonts appear to render faster so
if we go back to our buddy Mitt Romney
and his web font learning problem so the
source code for this may have looked
like something like this so two versions
of a font face block the top one is just
the Roman font which is not bold not
italic and then the bottom
is the the italic version of the font
face so titling gothic so each one of
these has their own sort of loading
lifecycle right as contentious as that
may be I don't think that browser should
do that by default but each of them do
have their own low font loading light
life cycle so they'll have their own
timeouts their own flash and visible
text and so as you can imagine the Roman
version loaded and the italic version
has not yet loaded so it's still
currently invisible so the easiest thing
we can do to mitigate this problem is to
use this new font display descriptor you
can throw on your font face block on
display swap will it means that you
enforce unstyled text by default right
from the beginning no timeouts no
anything so it will render the system
fonts immediately fall back to or
extremely render those system fonts
immediately and then rerender when the
web font finishes loading so that's kind
of it congratulations hey we did a
following strategy yeah whoo all right
oh but sorry limited browser support so
this is coming out more browsers it's
great it's coming soon enough Safari
11.1 so we'll be able to use this in a
lot more places and it is actually in
Firefox and Chrome right now so that's
pretty good but this is sort of what
happens behind the scenes there's sort
of two ways this can go on the left if
your regular font loads first you'll see
that the italic version will appear as a
system font and then on the right if
your italic loads first the rest of the
text will appear as a system phone so
you can kind of see that knot right
there is using your web font content oh
yeah I included cool arrows check those
out and cool highlights check that out
so web font content there is denoted
with the green check mark green
highlight and the fallback that's red
but I mean it's still hey it's a red
that you can see all right amazing all
right so
red is the system font but it's
important that all this text is
immediately readable even if it's not
pretty this isn't how the web the your
web page will be when it finishes
loading it's how it's how it's in flight
so the text is always readable another
thing you can kind of do which I kind of
like I think it's kind of neat is you
can mix different font display values so
for your Roman font you can use swap
which will be the flash of unstyled text
and then for your italic version in this
example we can use something called font
display optional which is just kind of a
shorthand for saying if it's not in
cache don't render it it puts a
super-short like a hundred millisecond
timeout and if the font doesn't come
back in that in that super short timeout
it will ignore it and then when you
reload the page again or to go to a
different page it will be in cache and
render at that point so hey
congratulations we just did our second
font loading stro oh yeah sorry
limited browser support same as font
display we're using before but here's
the different behaviors that you could
see so on the Left you'll see empty
cache version at the top is just both of
those our system fonts loading together
on the bottom on the left is when when
the roman font has successfully loaded
and then when you have a primed cache on
the right both web fonts will load
successfully so this is really neat I
think because at any any possible
rendering of your website you're not
mixing your system fonts and your web
fonts together so if you look at the
bottom left there's oh there's kind of a
caution icon there it's using emoji not
font icons so that not there is is
actually using something called font
sentence font synthesis which is sort of
a fake italic version that browsers will
try and synthesize at runtime
so font synthesis it's a really great
tool I think to sort of mitigate some of
the the performance problems that we
might have with web font loading so when
it comes to font synthesis what the
browser will try and do if it doesn't
have a web font that matches what it
what it wants or once what it wants to
render so say for example we have a one
font face block at the top of our page
that's just the Roman version non italic
non bold and then we have in our HTML
content we want an italic rendering we
want a bold rendering the browser will
attempt to synthesize those using font
synthesis so it will really ugly do a
really ugly slanted version of your
Roman font and it will do a really ugly
bold version of your Roman font it will
try and fake those for you which is not
ideal for your final web page rendering
but it can be a really useful tool while
your page is loading to show text or
show web fonts as quickly as possible
fake as much as you can so in some
respects I kind of consider font
synthesis to be a more sophisticated
unstyled text because it's not showing a
system font it's faking a web font using
another web font that it already has so
yes you can use it intentionally most
people use it unintentionally when they
have code mismatches in their in their
CSS if you aren't using it intentionally
I built a tool to let you detect that so
yeah so it's a bookmarklet and a
command-line tool it will highlight all
the the elements on your page that have
these sort of web font mismatches so
these fonts synthesized versions of your
text because if you're not super
designer person like I am not really it
might be hard to recognize this my boss
is a super designer person so he
recognizes it so I built something to
help me not look like an idiot in front
of my boss that will tell me what fonts
synthesis where font synthesis is used
on me in my code
on the command line too it will tell you
all of your mismatched elements and all
of your fonts synthesized elements so we
can add font display to our font face
blocks that descriptor is great but you
can add it to your page but your web
fonts can still seem very slow why is
that because font display doesn't
actually change anything about the
loading the actual doesn't change the
loading of your web fonts just changes
how they render while they're loading so
it doesn't actually speed anything up
it's just more perceived performance so
this huge giant block of text that I'm
just willing to you on the screen right
now it's not super important but the
download checklist is just all the
things that need to be met before a font
face will start to download your and
your page so it finds a font face block
it finds a node in the document that
uses that font face so an exact match on
your font family it has to be non-empty
which is great you don't want empty
nodes to start requesting web fonts that
aren't actually used in text and it has
to match unicode range so if unicode
range is a way of specifying the
specific characters in your web font
that are available so yeah you want
those to match up otherwise you'll have
completely unnecessary web fonts so oh
yeah has this great waterfall that i
think describes this pretty well so a
lot of times you'll start with your HTML
or across the HTML it'll sort of build
your Dom get the response and then it'll
start to fetch your CSS which is great
it'll parse start parsing that response
it'll block your text in CSS while the
CSS is loading and then the font doesn't
actually start to be requested until the
font face blocks and live elements in
your document that are using those fonts
are available to the web browser so this
is a super oversimplification but web
font requests often don't start until
your page is almost ready to render so
that's not great because right when your
page is about to render boom you get
invisible text so one thing one of the
things you can do a really easy thing
you can do to
this is to use preload so preload allows
us to tell the browser we want to
request a web font before any of our CSS
is loaded before any of our documents
have been parsed our elements have been
parsed in the document and a pair is
great with fond display so again browser
support is pending but I think this will
be much more important than even fun
display in terms of improving how web
fonts load so this is what that code
looks like that's just a link element in
your header I think you can also do HTTP
header I don't know how the browser
support compares between those but this
is really easy to do you just put a wofe
- and your f there H ref I don't know
how yes in it and then the browser will
fetch that right when it parses this
this element so you'll still include
your font face blocks in your page
you'll still do everything the same as
you would have done before but the the
request triggers much earlier and your
waterfall so we've talked about a bunch
of different font learning strategies
font loading technologies you can use
that don't have super browsers for it so
let's talk about one that uses a little
bit more ubiquitous in terms of browser
support something you can use today and
in fact I am using preload today but
something will have a broader support
for browsers and that's the fat with a
class strategy so say for example we
have this two font face blocks on our
page ones using Lotto once using lot o
bold we can use something called the CSS
font living API oh my goodness CSS font
loading API and we can sort of wrap a
class around any of any of our use of
Lotto in our CSS so that if the browser
doesn't actually think we're using Lotto
on our page until we've added that class
in javascript so the bottom half of this
is JavaScript
it's the CSS font loading API it tells
the browser to load those two web fonts
and then when those both load
successfully we add the fonts loaded
to our document so this is great right
we control the entire lifecycle of our
web fonts and this enforces fout for us
we sort of by press bypass the default
browser behavior for web fonts the CSS
font loading API is pretty good in terms
of browsers for it not great and ie an
edge I I just oh I wish it was in edge
so bad
let's just let's I'm just gonna do a
sigh on the stage for edge right now
okay soon I hope so there are polyfills
for this you can use something called
font face observer from Bronstein really
great polyfill so you can put that
javascript in your head or you can load
it async on make your web fonts even
slower and in IE an edge if you want to
do that and that's what Smashing mag
magazine calm or Smashing mag calm does
today we a synchronous Lee load this
poly fill in when the CSS font loading
API isn't supported to sort of deliver
those web fonts to eye image so the
important thing about this font learning
strategy felt with the class is that
there's no invisible text you have one
group to repaint so we're using two
different web fonts they aren't
repainting separately they don't have
they're each each have their own
independent rendering cycle we group
them together we only repay one and it
works great with third-party hosts so if
use google fonts or Typekit or whatever
you can use that with this approach the
only bad part about it is that you kind
of have to watch your font family use in
your style sheets just kidding
so you can use font family just how you
would before there's a post CSS plugin
called post CSS soft classes which was
heavily inspired by something that was
put out by net Liffe I plug for net with
I hey Phil hey post CSS file without
felt with the class plug-in this is
really great because it will
automatically transform your CSS you
don't have to manage your CSS at all you
know
dump your web font families right in
there and your post CSS will process
your CSS using these font loading font
loaded classes and will add those around
it the bad thing about fat with the
class is that you have to manage every
web font you want to load on your page
so the default browser behavior as I
mentioned is that it won't load web
fonts that aren't used on your document
if you're loading those in JavaScript
you are in full control of what gets
loaded so if I for example implemented
felt with the class of New York Times
comm I would not necessarily want to
load 191 font face rules that they have
on their page it's so they're sort of
taking advantage of the default browser
behavior and just dumping a bunch of
font face blocks on their page so if you
have that kind of situation you might
want to go with a different approach
because that'll be a lot of flavius
locks to update all right big double
booster anybody know what the big double
booster no no anyone no no ok it's a big
dumb booster aerospace engineering
principle actually kind of applies to
how a lot of people build websites today
it's kind of it states that a big dumb
booster is much cheaper than a smaller
more efficient and more complex rocket
booster so if you just put whatever you
want on the page launch it into space
you're as long as you don't spend a lot
of manpower on it then it will be
cheaper in the long run right so this I
think this actually kind of applies to
software development in some respects
but again web fonts are not rocket
science
so let's move on to the our fifth and
final and most complex font learning
strategy I hope you're prepared for this
I know the physicists you're ready it's
critical for the data URI it's gonna be
so much different than what we've done
before just kidding the only thing you
do is just dump a data URI for a super
super subset web font file right with
your other font face blocks so we use a
lot o subset
for my use case I'm only subsetting the
Wow I use the laser pointer on this
thing like you guys are gonna see that
yeah that was awesome so I put Unicode
range there I'm only loading this super
subset version has upper case a A
through Z and lower case a through Z so
it has a very very limited character set
and this is just a small I think it's
like four kilobyte data URI and I'm just
jumping on my page so that allows the
subset version to load somewhat
instantaneously and so this is a
two-stage approach right so when my
JavaScript loads I'll add that font
Stage one class which will opt the
document into a lot--oh subset which is
my date at URI version and then I'll do
the same thing that I did before with
felt with a class just and then add
fonts Stage two so if you want to kind
of see how this works on a live website
I have a little emulator on the on the
bottom of every single page on szekely
comm you can toggle through these radios
and see they see the different
renderings live on my website for how
they look but the interesting part about
this strategy is you're really
minimizing your flash of unstyled text
because you're only rendering flash of
unstyled text on characters that are not
in your first stages first stage subset
so you can really get as much web web
font content in front of users as
quickly as possible with this approach
so what all but eliminates flash of
unstyled ticks depending on your
internationalization requirements but
you don't just want to subset your first
stage you can subset everything web
fonts often have a lot of things in them
that you might not need for your use
case so if you again if you're
internationalization and licensing
requirements for your fonts allow it
I recommend sub-state subsetting your
web fonts to the smallest character set
that you can because smaller font files
will load faster I have a tool called
cliffhanger cliff cliff hanger anybody
seen cliff hanger no nobody
yeah it's just a command-line tool that
will go out to your website spider all
the content on your website and return a
Unicode range for the different
characters that are being used on that
page it includes another website it's
spider so it will go out to subsequent
links that are linked to from that page
as well it just takes a lot longer so
yeah that's my website that's the
Unicode range of content that's being
used on my website and this is the
string representation in the command
line not all the characters can render
on the command line so that's why we use
Unicode code points there another thing
I can do is that it's a provides a nice
little wrapper around a subsetting tool
called P PI F T subset it's part of font
tools it's a Python thing so we'll
subset your font files for you
automatically which is nice because
those can be quite big so for example
there's some version I use a lot o on my
website so in some of these examples
they went from 140 kilobytes down to 24
but it's not great for user-generated
content obviously because if you don't
know what characters people are using
then you don't want missing characters
in your font just it provides some
little helper utilities as well you can
you can pass in a whitelist if you if
you know what characters you want to use
you can pass in a Unicode range you know
a subset based on those without going to
out to spider a content on the web if
you already know what you want to use
and then just as convenience for me I
also added this which allows you to
convert between strings and Unicode
ranges which i think is kind nice
because those things that Unicode ranges
are really super hard to read so the
point I'm trying to make here what with
sub setting is that smaller files would
load faster they reduce your Flash of
invisible text they reduce your the
impact of your flash of unstyled text
you really want to get your web font
content in front of users as quickly as
possible so the new hotness right now in
font loading I know you guys are super
concerned about font loading hotness
variable fonts amazing they're great
what a variable font is is so for
example
in this San Francisco rendering say we
might have eight different font files
that we use to render each one of these
different weights so eight individual
files a variable font allows you to
combine those into one single variable
font file which is great it uses math or
maths
maps you guys say plural Maps here to
interpolate the different weights of
your fonts in the browser so it's great
but and you can play around with this
there's this great demo site called
access praxis
I think it's laurits penny built this
lower pond Twitter so it's got a nice
little slider here and you can do
whereas before font weights might have
been 100 200 300 400 500 you can
actually do any number between 1 and a
thousand now so and you can use
fractional numbers as well
so you really get a lot more
fine-grained control over designs you
want to deliver to your to your end
users so variable fonts are great
they're actually being adopted faster
than the CSS font loading API in IE and
edge because they're coming there I
think they're already on edge 17 which
isn't stable yet they're in Firefox
behind a flag they're in Safari if you
have high sierra not low sierra and then
they're also available in Chrome Canary
Wharf
sorry no in chrome stable what you're
paying for this with kilobytes right so
your single individual file might cost a
lot more to the end-user for the
variable font than it would if you had
load loaded three separate web font
files so for example this source sans
source sans is now available as a
variable font it's 115 kilobyte and wofe
- which is pretty hefty for a web font
and again that will elongate the amount
of time that unstyled text is shown to
your user the bigger the font file is
and really what you want to do again is
to get your web fonts rendered as quick
as possible as much of your web fonts
content loaded as quickly as possible to
the users as you can so variable fonts I
think are great we're going to see a lot
more of them but you're gonna see a lot
more timeouts you're gonna see that
three second timeout hit a lot more when
people start to use variable fonts just
because the font files are bigger than
those three individual file as if those
three individual files had loaded so
you're gonna see a lot more two-stage
font loading with variable fonts for
sure and the other great thing is that
you forced grouped repaints at the file
format level there's no way you can
render half of a variable font so this
is great for our old buddy Mitt Romney
because on his it completely destroys
this web font loading problem we don't
need to worry about the Mitt Romney web
font loading problem anymore because all
of their web fonts will render at the
same exact time so what do you guys
think web fonts rocket science not
rocket science kind of rocket science
they might be rocket science
I don't know hopefully that's made it a
little bit easier I have a nice little
checklist so if you want to take notes
this will be the entire presentation
will be distilled into these next two
slides so get your camera's out if you
want to not worry about all the things
that you've written down so this
checklist we want to minimize invisible
text we don't want invisible text we
want the unstyled text we want to use
font synthesis where possible and we
want to reflow as little as possible as
soon as possible so we want to render
web font content as quickly as possible
we want fewer repaints we're going to
group them we're going to trigger our
downloads sooner and we want to make our
font files smaller so practically
practically speaking these are the
things we can do these are the things
that we can do and they're available in
browsers today that we can use so we
don't want a miserable text use font
display use the CSS font loading API we
want grouped repaints and force by
variable variable fonts but we can also
do that ourselves with the CSS font
loading API we're going to trigger our
download sooner use preload for that we
want to make our font files smaller you
use wofe to and subset as much as
possible I wrote this guy
a comprehensive guide to font loan
strategies super long you can go out and
read it you're not it'll probably be
quicker than 40 minutes but you can go
out and read that it's got almost all
the things I mentioned here and I also
run a newsletter called font speed wants
me dead i/o so you can go subscribe to
that if you want for updates and changes
to font loading in web browsers I just
want to take like I have 10 seconds left
so I just want to thank all these people
I have been heavily inspired by all
these all the people up here on this
list and I could not have made this
presentation without them so thank you
all of these people if you're here thank
you thank you thank you if you're not
here also thank you
alright that's it thanks
that was awesome I don't use AK can you
please yeah yeah sorry I don't mean to
hold you captive or anything just for
five minutes alright so I took a
thousand photos during your talk and I'm
gonna share those with everyone I know
thank you for that so just a couple
questions yeah I do really want to talk
about variable fonts yes because they're
the new hotness like you said amazing
ah yeah they're great so um what am I
asking like how you showed the support
tables and I also liked your flow of
this whole talk I you had in fact
example support tables yeah so with
variable fonts I am very excited about
them but as you know support is not
fully there how can we start using them
and a progressively enhanced manner well
I mean the great thing about variable
fonts is that you can use a so I for
example I've downloaded source sans
variable and I just have the single
variable font available in a font face
block and I brought it up in IE 11 and
it rendered as if a normal web font
would have so there's some kind of
there's progressive enhancement built
into the font file format so even if a
variable font isn't supported by the web
browser I can still render as if it had
been a normal web font it's still going
to do fake bold and fake italic okay and
those axes sort of what interpolation
happens in the web font are controlled
in the font file themselves so the font
authors kind of have control over what
you can or what different axes you can
use but yeah it's it's kind of great how
it's set up so there's not much you you
really have to do other than you
got to be worried about font file size
of course that's that's good to hear I
realize that
so for basic web fonts not to kind of
have the swirls and various inlets you
can just use them right yep cool great
so what do we have to keep in mind in
terms of web performance when it comes
to including variable fonts and do like
can we subset them in the same way or is
that a little different yeah I mean I
I'm not really sure how much support is
available for them in font tools
I would imagine that the the tables are
very similar I'm I would hope that that
support will be ongoing it's kind of
weird to see variable fonts
implementation in different tools
because it's almost as if the technology
is outpacing the font authors themselves
yeah there's also many variable for
support browser supports in it then
there are a variable font yeah fonts in
the wild which is I think just unheard
of in terms because I've been working on
the web first for a long time and it's
been very strange to watch adoption and
web browsers outpace authors so making
it you kind of have to have an
understanding of dev and then have a
strong understanding about typography
principles in the history of typography
like right those people are kind of a
variable fonts in some form I've existed
in a for a very very long time and I I
guess there was just some sort of
critical mass in the last few years that
that got adoption in web browser so it's
it's been amazing to watch yeah um you
also mentioned not to use web fonts for
icons can you speak more to that and
what the alternative is yeah so the this
is such a softball I love the question
it was asked by the audience they need
to know ask this one so that when you
use font icons you're subject to the
same default web web browser font
loading behavior as content fonts so
browsers have kind of taken they've sort
of shepherded their font loading
behavior their default font loading
loading behavior to work with content
fonts and sort of icon fonts are hacked
on as sort of an end-user thing that
we've decided to do later I don't know
it's just it's very strange so you'll
have the same flash events invisible
text and flash of unstyled text with
icons if you use font icons as well so
in Firefox if used I use Firefox you'll
see I see this all the time after three
seconds the font icon on a website will
timeout and I'll see like the little
Unicode missing Unicode characters it
just happens quite a bit and so yeah
you'll see a lot of the the the fallback
fonts are not not as good and not as
useful so it's just it's a completely
different ballgame when it comes to icon
fonts and it's just much easier to use
SVG I love using SVG for icons and such
yeah so how would you suggest dealing
with large font files for example like
Asian characters you know they can get
really big but how would you apply the
same strategies with large sets yeah
that's that's a really hard problem
again you can you can subset them
separately but there are all kinds of
different considerations when you're
trying to render to different web fonts
together so you may have noticed in the
strategies that I mentioned that stages
build on top of each other they don't
mix together so if you're loading a
certain character set for one web font
on another character set for another
there's all kinds of different interplay
between them that you don't really want
to mess with so ligatures for example if
you're trying to do that between you
can't do that between two different font
files so it's you need a sort of
additive or not an additive approach you
need to blow away everything that you've
already loaded with a completely
different full font face file so you can
still load in stages but it just won't
be as efficient as it could be and
there's nothing really in the works to
solve that yet I've been in talks with
some people about a new streaming font
format but that is just that's a pipe
dream right now I would love that
yes huh okay so I have a last question
for you you mentioned a couple times
that you're not a designer which I
disagree with your fondly your whole
presentation looks beautiful but how did
you get so interested involved in web
fonts when you don't come from design
background that's a good question I have
been thinking about that a lot I'm not
really sure my I know in grade school my
mom learned calligraphy in front of me
it was just like something she wanted to
pick up and I might have gotten
something from that but I don't know
I've just always been interested in it
as far back as I can remember so hmm I
don't know if that's a satisfactory
answer to your question but that's the
truth that's that's how it goes thank
you so much that thank you very much
