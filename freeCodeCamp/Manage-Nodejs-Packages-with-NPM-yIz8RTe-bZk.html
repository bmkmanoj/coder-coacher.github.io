using NPM or node package manager
first things first we'll need to sign
into cloud 9 in order to sign it into
cloud 9 we recommend you use github if
you don't have a github account you can
just create one real quick all right so
now that I've authenticated I should be
able to go back here and click cloud 9
once again and authorize
just going to ask for my email address
okay
and I can create a new workspace and
we'll name it
NPM this is that's what we're going to
learn today node package manager and
we'll select nodejs
as the app type click create and it'll
process for a moment now we can just
click the start editing button and it'll
take just a moment to load everything
but you'll see we have our directory
tree on the left hand side we have our
browser or code editor depending on what
we have open here in the main area and
then we have our terminal interface
right down here so let's go ahead and
install node schools and p.m. course
so we'll just copy this command right
here and we'll paste it into the
terminal
all right and it looks like it installed
so we can verify that installed by
running this command which will start
the tutorial and let's go ahead and make
this terminal nice uh big and you can
see there are several steps here they're
actually more but it didn't render them
because my window wasn't tall enough so
if I just take control see that'll
cancel out of what I was doing and I
could just press up and access previous
commands so I'll just run how to MPN one
more time and now you'll see the full
list of the challenges so the first task
is install NPM let's go ahead and start
that one and I can tell you we already
actually have NPM installed it comes
installed by default on cloud 9 but we
can go ahead and verify that it's
installed properly by running how to MPN
verify all right so it looks like it
does have NPM installed but it does not
have the latest version the latest
version is 28.4 and we only have one dot
4.28 installed so we can upgrade it by
just doing this command right here that
it gives us so I'll just copy it and
paste it
so you can see this thing slowly
spinning which means that it's working
there we go
it looks like it's updated so now we can
just run our how to NPM verify again by
pressing up a couple times and it looks
like we have the right version yay our
solution is correct now we can just run
how to NPM again and we'll see that it
has marked this one as completed so we
can use the arrows and we can just move
down to dev environment and it's going
to just tell us what to do for the next
challenge so this is how all the notes
cool challenges work so what it wants us
to do is make a new directory CD into it
then run NPM and it to create a package
JSON file we actually already have a
package.json file but I'm going to
delete it for the purpose of this
exercise and now we're already in the
workspace directory where everything
else is in so I think we can just run an
NPM in it here and we can just it'll
take us through a wizard and we'll just
leave the version number of the
description everything is default all
right and now we should be able to
verify that we've done what we need to
do by running how to NPM verify and we
did it worked</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
