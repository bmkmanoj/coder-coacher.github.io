today I'm going to be demoing a project
that my partner in hi Colin completed
for free code camp and they learn in
exchange so I'm going to be going
through what the learning exchange is
about and I'm going to talk about the
site we built and then the technology
stuck we used to be the site and I'm
also going to give it them off the site
so first of all the land exchange is a
nonprofit organization based in québec
they focus on free education educating
the public and making sure people have
the basic skills they need to survive in
the environment so the site we had to
build for them was a an educational site
where they could post educational
material based on nine essential skills
so this is the current sites so they
have nine essential skills writing
computer used reading thinking oral
communication document use numeracy
working with others and continuous
learning so these nine essential skills
are what they feel and what they believe
everybody should have to be able to
survive in the current environment so we
had to build this site and when they
came up to us it took a long while for
us to decide what we are going to use we
wanted an OGS back-end and we couldn't
go with WordPress called WordPress PHP
and then we were able to find CMS called
' so so apostrophe is a sorry yes
apostrophe is a content management
system that gives you a very good design
basis for your app so if I try the live
demo now this is a very good basis for
your app you can see you have a good
functioning navbar you have this page
where
you can add content you can remove
content from it you have other pages
that look quite the same and then you
have another page we looks entirely
different so in our case we also have
this navbar and then we have multiple
pages where you could see material so in
the writing page we have contents
related to writing we have alphabet
organizers who have business English who
have business letters right on the left
here we have a tag list which is like
tabs which when you click on it takes
you to everything related to that tag so
I clicked on coverlet and it's going to
show me everything related to cover
letter from the site yeah so so as I
said for this we had to use apostrophe
and we had to do a lot and I'm just
going to show you a demo of the site so
you see what's about so this is my
development environment so I can play
around with this as much as I want so I
have this I have a home I have essential
skills and a half content so this is
empty because there is nothing on the
site so I have right here this is a page
and I could easily create a new page I
could call this reading and make it a
snippets page published showing
navigation yes sucks and I'm going to
add reading to the tags and then I would
make it show snippet with these tags and
I'm going to come back to the concept of
snippets wearisome so when I save this
page
now you can see when I saved it reading
shows up here and then it also shows up
as part of the essential skills so we
have nine predefined essentials give us
on each time I add a page that belongs
to an essential skill it shows up in
this part of the navbar so I click on
reading and there's nothing on the site
which brings me to snippets so snippets
are basically reusable pieces of content
so I could define a snippet and use it
in various parts of my page so let me
create one snippet so I go to my navbar
click on snippets new snippet and then
I'm going to call this reading books
published yes sucks and I'm going to add
reading to the tags now when I add
reading because the page I created had
eat a green on it whichever snippet I
creates will automatically show up on
the reading page so on the body I'm just
going to add some text and say reading
is fun
why don't you try it and then hide the
title I'm not going to hide the title
and now with that now once I do this
this shows up reading books reading is
fun why don't you try it and also on the
left the tag I added was reading now I
could go to my snippets manage snippets
I have reading books yes now why can't
do now is I could decide to add up
multiple tags I could add fun I could
add fun times I could add good for you
and as many as I want and then I save
this now when I go back to my site right
on the Left I can see it's updated the
four of them this is one amazing thing
now be
sites this if you just want a static
page
' allows that by default so you have a
title called it static page make it a
default page yes and showing navigation
years and now I don't need it taught
well even though I can also put reading
and then save now this is my static page
and there is nothing even though I put
the tag of reading on it
there is nothing related to reading here
which is a very very nice thing
' the ability to separate content based
on what you want so that's about adding
content now right now I'm logged in what
if I wanted to give other users the
ability to add content to it so
apostrophe has next thing called users
and groups so I could create a new group
and call them add content group and now
what I want from this group I don't want
them to there aren't guests know and
they can edit files yes and so admin all
means like they're also an admin for
everything in the sites which I don't
want admin files means they can add
files and delete files and edit files
and then edit files yes admins snippets
so admin snippets means they can add and
that the thing is admin files means you
can add a remove files edit files means
you can only add files so it's very good
when you want something like people
adding files what
you don't want them to you don't want
them to delete files because of fear of
losing things you know so I could create
this group at and now I go to people and
add new person I'm calling John Ricky
now the full name is automatically
generated and then I had and then I go
to my groups and manage groups add
content group and then I go to the
people in the group and I can add John
Ricky right here so now I've created in
your person generation I've added into a
group so he'll be able to have all the
functionality that I have to find for
that group so now I can also manage
media content I can add pictures I can
add videos I can add PDF files I can add
forms and also it has a built in form it
has forms built into it so I could fill
in a form and send to the users when I
want
well that's currently disabled for the
site because we don't want we don't
require users to enter things in forms
you can do that from their main websites
at ela literacy calm and then that's all
and then for the technology stack on the
backend
' uses not yes so you can have a look at
your source code on github it's open and
everyone can see it and then for the
view engine it uses ginger which is ji
nja so it's
Python templates engine and then for the
CSS it uses less as a preprocessor and
it uses MongoDB on the back end so
apostrophe gives you a good base to
start with
and then if you want extra functionality
like we needed you'd have to modify a
few things sometimes and a lot of things
sometimes so it was a very good project
and I would say I really learnt a lot
from it and I know how it's how good it
feels to help a non-profit and anyone
who is looking to join free code camp I
would say it's a very very great
community every time I go in there
there's always people willing to help if
you have problems and you will
definitely learn to code and you would
learn to code well and once in a while
if you feel like maybe you're slacking
on your reading skills or your writing
skills or your computer use cues you can
just hop onto the site at essential
skills cubic comm and then you can just
have a look at what they have you can
search for content if you want typing
maybe
yeah it could see typing tutorial so
basically almost anything you want you
could get on the site and thanks for
watching and once again free code camp
is a great community and helping
nonprofits is also great and if you feel
like you love both of them then I would
suggest you go with them so thanks for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
