we're on okay everybody alright so we
are on the stream with everyone I'm just
going to send a very quick tweet to
announce this
okay and then I will just post this into
the main chat for all the campers that
are unaware that we're starting awesome
i'll go to that as well all right
somebody else just tweeted that up great
so thank you everyone for helping us get
the word out so we have we're going to
be very brief today and then we're going
to jump straight to questions because we
suspect you all will have a lot of
questions so first of all I'd like to
introduce everyone get my agenda right
here ok so the agenda for today is um
ROG um this this gentleman right here RG
is from Hyderabad but he's here in San
Francisco he just arrived less than 12
hours ago is that correct yeah yeah it's
good hello welcome ok thank you and then
of course we have Michael Johnson
nonprofit guy at free code camp we have
Abdul Rashid who is a camper and a
contributor and is building or is
recently wrapped up a non-profit project
some pro bono coding that he and his
partner have done for a non-profit we're
going to demo that and then of course on
the far right we have Berkeley Martinez
web development extraordinaire and he is
going to be hanging out with us as well
to answer questions so very quickly I'm
going to hand things over to our depot
before I do I just want to tell you that
our ji has been critical to the
transition we've talked about launching
you know Java curriculum and a Python
curriculum and a whole lot of other
language curriculums curricula for many
many months and it's certainly something
we thought about since before we even
started free code camp but I think we're
in a good position to go ahead and get
going on that and RG is really steering
us along that path so with that I'd like
to hand it over tarji thank you thank
you Quincy for introducing me kind of
even hit me on the video card yes I hear
me are they and so would you like to
share your screen RG I'm perhaps that
would be better let me share my screen
sure so I'm going to make you the
presenter look and you may have to
downloads on there in order to be able
to share your screen I hope that's okay
yes collapses
alright so we're we can see your
physiology yes okay so as Quincy have
already mentioned that i will be for now
overseeing and heading up the project so
that we can expand other back-end
support to other languages so i'd like
to welcome all of you who are watching
this stream and thank you for your time
for now we have all the backend
challenges that we have present in the
free code camp maps so we go to free
code can map and we have the five
microservices challenges and the five
back and challenges as of right now
anyone can submit the backend projects
in their language of their own choice so
we have replay projects and we have the
five dynamic web applications so all
these projects there are six APA
projects and there are five that
panoramic applications projects can be
submitted right now in the any of the
languages of your choice for instance we
have here Python Java go elixir Group B
PHP other than the dotnet is also
supported so we already are open for
accepting submissions like that and the
set of cricket would be given out if you
submit in any of the languages it does
not have to be no tears now I retro
stress the point that if someone comes
here as a beginner they can and this
should be following only one step too so
that they have to focus on only one of
the thing that is java school content as
well javascript beckon nodes is but the
reason we are expanding to other
languages too so that the campers who
come here to already have knowledge in
one of the languages or maybe they want
to be good back-end developer in some
other languages may be in the new job it
requires that they have to support some
latest code bases there should be able
to find support and find other campers
who have already worked or are working
in those languages so that they can go
forward from it now i would like to give
you all is small status update on how
things are going so as of right now we
have started by creating some wiki
articles on python so this is the python
wiki article that is hosted on as you
can see free code camp wiki
and this is accessible by the camper pot
so if you go to the chat room and you
type something like he'll Python this
article contents would come up python is
there we have a small logo here and we
have some general early ideas about what
python is what is typically done and we
have links to other accessible by thon
articles here so let's say I want to see
web development if I that I can just
click on this link and go here and all
these things are interlinked in a way so
that if you have missed something anyone
to go back you can go back to home then
if you go back here then what is the
previous article for this the
prerequisite for this article you can
check then similarly you can take next
so we are trying to index the articles
in a way that anyone can access the
entire article in this way next comes
the point then what about the other
languages so what at this point we have
decided since you have to support a lot
of languages is that let's first build
one language we start the work on that
we get it started then we have the other
languages follow something similar so
something similar to this let's say I go
to the pages and I search for sale Ruby
so we also have an interpreter for Ruby
it still under works and it could use
some of the links to other Ruby articles
which are being created at this moment
and I would like to take this
opportunity to hang this person goes
through sinner he has been helping us
tremendously as you can see that he and
me we both go through every article and
we review them so we have wiki articles
that at least has started for all the
languages python HP ruby go dotnet etc
we now have to expand on those and in
this expansion will be following the
direction that by fanatical septic yes I
understand that there are differences
between say Python and Java for instance
pythoness generators or decorators and
Java has probably something different
those differences would come into play
when we get there but until then we
would follow the basic structure of that
is the Pythian development so i would
like to not take all of you about how we
create the articles and get it reviewed
so for instance coast of Cena he has
added edge of my introduction page
yesterday one too much comment so when
he submit see how
as to set of reviewers getting a tribute
so rough l is helping out with the wiki
guidelines but and me and postal see now
we do it interchangeably so if one of us
rights and wiki article the other person
would be reviewing it so that if you go
something like if you go to a file okay
yeah so I would probably add some
comment about this part is not created
this really you should link it to
something else and we have a rigorous
review about the correctness of the
content so for instance if there is some
code snippet in this and obviously we
are not experts in any of this languages
but if there is a code snippet in this I
would like to see if I can actually
follow and understand this i would like
to run it in a real diamond earth and
find out if this actually works so that
is there and we check for content
correctness so my job and goes to
observe is that one of us would write an
article and the other person would
review it rigorously for the correctness
of the content and Raphael or there is
there are a few other people who have
much authority in this code base they
would review it were following the wiki
guidelines so we would have some basic
week articles merged once they emerged
we reach out to some people who are
already strong in these areas and have
them reviewed article for quality of 30
and if something is found to be that we
need some change here we need to update
something we could probably separate
this out in separate wiki article we
would do that for instance if you look
at the bike an article on say say I take
it for example of development in Python
there is there was a small discussion
here actually listen go to the previous
one next next yes as you can see there
is a discussion on Python 2 vs Python 3
now by 10 2 versus Python 3 is probably
not a discussion that we would want to
have when you are setting up some
installation it could be a separate
standard on wiki article on its own but
at this moment you would like to have it
someplace so that we can have it edited
and we can go on to return and change it
as we need next is that we are using
github issues to merge this that we need
some new articles and go we need some
days before month so if I click on this
I will find out that this person has
already started somewhat and when he
just appeared we can have revised merge
it in the code base after somebody
review so this is how we are managing it
for the time being now I'd like to give
a brief idea about the roadmap that is
ahead we would be doing it like this so
we have this kind of challenges here it
like we have java javascript error and
this and this sir is but for the time
being we do not have the challenges and
we want the community to help us out
building the challenges so if someone
comes to us in a chat channel asking
well I want to run Java okay and what do
I do about it so as you can see we have
touch a text in a setting for all of
this go PHP then dotnet Python Linux
ruby is that we tell them clearly that
for the time being you use some external
resources such as exorcism or the cones
of the language so I'd like to so what a
cones is first so ready someone comes to
me saying okay ready spike and what can
we do something like that so this is
something that you can go through and
you can understand how to work on the
cones and learn Python so let me take
you to this Python resources we have
created resources pages will more python
resources similarly for the timing we
would ask you that you go through any of
that you today else and we learn
something and you start the back and
work using this language because when
you build an entire project you would
learn the language very well not your
own but until we have the plan that when
we create all these resources using
those resources you would create our own
challenges now one of the obstacle here
and I'm not so sure it's the challenge
is that all the JavaScript we cannot run
it in a browser because even if there
are some implementations of certain
languages which you can run something in
browser than they will take it in the
server and execute in a test it on their
own it's not very secure and secondly
even if we do it in velocity that is we
create some kind of interpreter of
Python in javascript error
implementations are visible in open
source the thing is that it will not be
supported as wide as we support our
entire FCC website across all browsers
in probably all log machines and
especially not a macbook because it's a
most people are coming from cpanel adesh
pakistan or india they probably would
not have a macbook like i don't have a
record so those kinds of things we
cannot do and besides if you are doing
back into
if you're doing service said what is
supposed to get out of the browser
you're supposed to get into a real
terminal and execute the code on your
own intestine so what we are planning to
do is something like exorcism and if you
have any feedback about that please feel
free to reach out to me or Quincy is
that we would give you some set of
problems you can execute them on your
machine we would probably do the test
cases but like I go to the map page and
I then I go to my own profile bit say
yeah so it should show me that what was
I have done and that I have created a
solution so the entire website here that
the free code can be upset that should
track my progress even if I am not
running it inside the free podcamp
website so we would do something like
exorcism does is that every time you
solve a problem it would use the
internet connection to send out some
data to the efficacy upset and it will
update that you have solved this problem
and this is a solution that you have
provided we can do something like that
if you want to but we would not do it
exactly the way exorcism is doing it is
that you have to solve one challenge to
go to the next challenge because that's
not our model anyone should be able to
solve many challenge at any given point
of time that's what we also allow for
JavaScript we should also allow that for
every other language so cuddly I'd like
to summarize it like this that we are in
the process of creating wink articles
and we have already created lot of those
using the Python resources spits we
would link and in turning them in a
proper way so that everyone who is at
part any point in an article should be
able to access other articles as they
want to these are easily easily
accessible and indexable we follow a
rigorous review at least to make sure
the basics are okay and then we have the
mast okay some music is going on I don't
know what that is then we have issues to
track our work and we will take this
forward and in the long run we are
planning to create some challenges that
we can distribute among our campus so
that they can use those and we can take
it forward so with these I'd like to
hand it over to Quincy so thank you for
giving me the time and I'd like to stop
breaking wonderful well thank you thank
you very much how is it
so just to go back to just a reiterate
what r g just said we want you to be
doing the backend related challenges on
your own local machine will work on some
VMS and some other tools to help you
quickly get a development environment
together and we will also be doing a lot
of things where we just add additional
content gradually but it'll all be
created nonlinearly it'll all be
optional the only hard evaluation
criteria the only things that you
absolutely must do are the projects as
usual that's so the same exact 10
back-end projects that you need to earn
the back-end development certification
that will be the same you can do those
in any back-end language you want and
you'll still get the same certification
okay so I'd like to next hand it over to
Michael Johnson who's going to talk a
little bit about our recent developments
in our non-profit project program
Michael that's right thank you thank you
Quincy for the introduction and thank u
RG for demoing the exciting changes
coming into free code camp just like all
of you I'm extremely excited with the
expansion the nonprofit pro bono
non-profit project program say that ten
times fast a free code camp has been a
tremendous success and it's only picking
up pace right now we've done about 20
projects and we're about to start seven
more we have brought on to new volunteer
project managers in addition to Alex
phone who's done a tremendous job
helping out organizing projects in
September we're bringing on Jason from
Washington DC where I am and dull
shawnee who is currently in Sri Lanka
and relocating to India at the end of
the month both really really talented
campers their campers first and they're
looking to help with the nonprofit
projects I'm tremendously excited so I I
don't know that they're watching now but
it
they are welcome and we're glad to have
you on the team the only other thing I'd
mentioned before we talk about this
specific project is commit if you
haven't heard of commit commit is a way
to stay motivated while you are pursuing
a certification by donating monthly to a
non-profit until you achieve that
certification so in the meantime you'll
you'll know that every month that passes
that you haven't earned it you'll make
another donation it goes to a good cause
you can choose what nonprofit you'd like
to commit to it doesn't have to be one
of ours but the program is tremendously
successful and it's only growing
currently campers are donating around
eleven thousand dollars per month to
nonprofit organizations and so I've been
so proud of this program and being a
champion of it and I would just ask that
if you are at all you know looking for
more motivation that you join up so go
to free code camp calm / commit and and
join up I'd like to talk a little bit
before we introduce Abdul Rashid about
the learning exchange so a few months
ago the learning exchange came to us and
said hey we have a new program and we
need a website built for it and what we
do is we're a volunteer organization
dedicated to empowering the community
through improved literacy so they're all
about literacy about essential skills in
the workplace and they're up in Quebec
Canada and we put together a team of
Abdul Rashid who is here with us today
and his partner Colin and just this week
they finished up their project for
essential skills Quebec which is the
learning exchanges program so we have
Abdul Rashid here today to demo what
they've built and show you what's
possible when it comes time for you if
you aspire to to donate her to a
non-profit so welcome Abdullah she'd and
I just want everybody to know I'm really
proud of
he's done a tremendous job it's been
nothing but a pleasure to work with key
and column and these past several months
so of the routine I'm going to make you
thumbs up you're okay perfect okay yeah
and after a and um I macabre like
most of you guys watching right you know
and i joined free code camp last summer
it was kind of like one of my first
coding experiences i got to do a lot of
the HTML CSS the JavaScript and then I
went straight into the back and
challenged it it was kind of easy for me
cause I love coding a lot i spent like
eight hours a day coding and it's always
very interesting for me so i was so
happy to get onto it nonprofits and I
got paired up with Colin was
unfortunately not here today so we work
together for about eight months
completing the challenge and overall out
stage was a good experience so I'll just
do a quick demo the sides and so this is
the site we build we started with the
HTML code ' and it at the CMS that gives
you a lot of visual customizations so
you can easily make changes you can
easily add content to the site so what
we have to do was to tweak the CMS and
make the CMS much more usable by D
whoever needs them so you can see we
have enough for them we have a lot of
things we have contents so this is
basically an educational site it's
called the learning exchange it teaches
essential skills so we'll have to make
it such that it is a content it's easy
for users to access content
they have been ages some for skills
stone for jobs and um one of the major
challenges I faced during the project
was um it was kind of like my first
project methods for your project so I
had a lot of trouble adapting to like
codeine in it large by going through a
large Cody's make the required changes
on making sure I don't break things the
way at certain times when we broke stuff
like we couldn't get our servers running
and then we had to go back make changes
and get it running but all in all it was
a very good experience so to really
suggest you guys to check out the sides
it's a really good site you might do
anything go to shreds yeah awesome is
she good here you still won yes I'm here
I made it myself cuz there's some
ambient noise um yeah well excellent
thank you very much outdoor receipt for
walking us through your your program so
you built this on top of asterisk which
is a apostrophe apostrophe apostrophe
sir one of those punctuation marks ' so
you've got this on top of an apostrophe
and that was a can you tell us a little
bit about it hofstra fee yeah I'm
apostrophes based on those chests and I
think one of the reasons went so fast
like he could see how fast the site to
know he takes like a second to load is
because of like it's based on not GS so
um it's a really customizable CMS it's
easy to make changes and they have a lot
of good documentation so almost
everything we needed we had them and
those really great and also they have a
very good user interface so when you
start to decide it's not like you start
with something oddly whatever they give
he's really nice to work with yeah and
if I could just save that Colin and
Abdul Rashid were actually the first
campers to find the CMS and this is a
big development as far as our nonprofit
projects go because our number one most
requested project idea is WordPress and
we just don't build WordPress sites
that's not our thing so having a CMS
that's no Jas based as a as a beginning
is it really opens up the options for
nonprofits that we can work with and I
was a little unsure how it would go
based on how ' looks out of the gate but
these guys gave it the most amazing
facelift and turned it into exactly what
the stakeholder had been looking for so
really in addition to their coding
skills their research skills and finding
the right tool for the job and the right
framework for what the client was
looking for I think bodes well for their
future as developers and in just the
research skills and there's certainly
done a service to free code camp so I'm
excited about ' wonderful well we are
about 26 minutes into the hour and I
think our our audience the campers
tuning in probably have a lot of
questions for us so I would like to just
jump to a question-and-answer mode
unless anyone else has anything specific
they want to say before we do that
awesome so somebody asked why not use
WordPress well the very short answer why
we don't use WordPress this WordPress
isn't currently javascript-based it's
based on PHP now it is WordPress is
moving to reacted node that's not fully
up to WordPress the WordPress is a
community of developers kind of like
free code camp in it and the will of the
community whether they're willing to you
know learn a whole lot of additional
skills in fully transition over using
javascript that that still remains to be
seen but that certainly seems to be the
direction that Matt Mullenweg the
Mullenweg the founder of WordPress is
pushing everyone so we could be doing
WordPress apps in the future but we
wanted to keep all the nonprofit
projects focused on using node and using
you know the full stack JavaScript just
for consistency because one of the new
developments is that we do what we call
Greenfield nonprofit projects which is
basically you start from scratch or you
start from a tool like ' or you start
from mean j/s or some boilerplate and
then you build the app off of that
that's like a greenfield project and
then there are legacy projects where you
take a project that campers have already
built and you extend it with new
functionality for the nonprofit so that
way you get practice working with legacy
code which legacy code is essentially
any code you yourself didn't write is
probably a very inclusive definition of
legacy code so we can take a look at
some of the other questions here uh yeah
if you're going to be building some bots
that would be cool to see them in the
next summit as well
so this might be a question there are
some there are a lot of questions if you
all are looking at the stream feel free
to jump in and answer them Adrian j
lopez asked so my assumption is if there
is if i want to use a framework like
spring for the submissions that should
work and for the submissions i believe
Adrienne's means for the purpose of yeah
and I'm going to stop presenting your
screen a little if she'd oh I'll just so
just make yourself presented in ok ok
I'm not showing anything particular on
my screen I'm not showing my screen to
them just for bandwidth conservation
reasons so maybe we could if somebody
wants to just take note of the different
questions that are asked there a lot of
questions being fired off here very
quickly before we dive too much into
questions I just want to point out to
really quick cool things first of all I
want to show everyone the updated reddit
the updated subreddit you may have
already seen this but we've overhauled
our subreddit to make it much more
structured and make it look visually
like free code camp calm one of the
things we can do is you can filter by
different types of submissions so for
example if you just wanted to see the
articles there were submitted you can
click here and now basically you have
the functionality of camper news which
we've which we retired but you can see
like sort of by new sorted by relevance
so this is kind of a good way that we
can share articles that and the related
discussion threads that we find are
interesting as a community another thing
is that you can come in here and you can
submit your projects if you want to get
feedback on a project so you can see
that somebody here made a tribute page
and we can just click through to it and
if you want you can comment on things so
this can be a way of getting getting
feedback on your projects as well so
this is a Bruce Lee tribute so reddit is
going to serve as kind of like an
external community of an external place
kind of the free coke camp expanded
universe if you will and anyone can go
there and share questions can ask
questions to the entire community can
among other things get code reviews can
can propose tools or to share YouTube
videos or podcasts that have been
helpful so there there are a lot of
different ways that you can use this
subreddit and it's very active generally
anything you post in here like there are
27 campers here on our sober it right
now anything you post on our subreddit
it is going to be seen by people and
interacted with in some way so I
strongly recommend if you're not already
using our subreddit check it out
subscribe to it and try posting things
some things and commenting on other
things one one important distinction of
our subreddit versus like a wild wild
west kind of place like I RC or some of
these other communities is our subreddit
people have to follow the same code of
conduct that they had to follow in the
chat room so we keep everything very
civil and we keep everything positive
and constructive because we're all
trying to learn together so that's very
important the other place I wanted to
show you
very quickly is our medium publication
which you you may already be familiar
with well we've been expanding the type
of content and a volume of content on
there significantly so for example
yesterday preeti wrote this this article
about using docker and using virtual
machines and it's you know it's a pretty
long read it takes about 13 minutes to
read it but it it will break all these
concepts down for you with some great
visuals and she's excellent and
explaining these things we're also
publishing just kind of classic articles
that people are interested in publishing
on free code camp so for example there
was an article that came out a while
back in 2013 well before like a full
year before free code camp came out and
it's called things I wish someone had
told me when I was learning how to code
and it's a great it's a classic article
I mean it's one of the one of the best
articles probably ever written about
learning the code and I approached this
woman Cecily and she agreed to publish
it here on our our medium publication as
well so we're hoping that this can be a
great resource for all campers who are
interested in you know humorous things
this unfunded slack BOTS article is
quite good practical things for seeking
a job like this tactical networking
guide for introverts a lot of my
articles that i right will certainly be
here like like i'll be writing a lot of
announcements of different directions
that we're going as a community and then
of course a whole lot of articles
written by our campers as well including
practical articles like wesley who's in
charge of our streaming wrote this
article on how to setup OBS in seven
steps and it literally walks you through
using the software that i'm using right
now to stream on twitch and how to set
it up and i believe this is a Windows
walkthrough but but it should work for
lenox and and he's even got he's even
created some gifts and stuff for it so
this is the kind of content that we're
going to be publishing on medium and
right now we're publishing probably one
article a day so if you drop in once a
week maybe once every few days you'll
have new content to read and it'll be a
cross between informative and
educational but everything will be
technology focus all right that's what I
had to say I don't know if we've
accumulated some questions anyhow I just
wanted some times for questions to roll
in there are yeah there's a couple
questions somebody asked if we plan on
doing another round of t-shirts would
see anyone answer that yeah one of you
answer Michael um i would like to uh i
think we're maybe yeah no I'm saying I
would like to do another round of
t-shirts maybe for the next summit we
don't have a design in mind if anybody
wants to contribute a design please
reach out to myself or Justin who is
halle thread in i guess i'll type that
in here if you reach out to you Justin
with your idea maybe we can make that
happen and put it on the shirt I know
that the community keeps growing at such
a pace that if we haven't done a t-shirt
campaign for a few days there are now
thousands of people who have joined and
don't know that that's something with
you and so we're aware of that and I
think within a few weeks we should
probably do another one and and second
of all if you buy a shirt thank you so
much I've got my second shirt on the
first ones in the closet Berkeley has
that first shirt that we offered on now
Santa Berkeley they can't see it there
you go so those are the first two shirts
we've come up with I'd like to see uh
you know campervan on the shirt there's
a lot of ideas out there but again if
you bought one thank you so much and
Quincy if you don't mind going back to
the
a subreddit somebody I can't find it now
but somebody who's asking if we were
going to have a subreddit just for
projects and the the answer is no what
we've done is created a filter system
that Quincy touched on briefly earlier
so if you want to look at just projects
you can click projects in the sidebar
and everything tagged as a project will
show up so if you wanted to not see
those I guess we could probably come up
with a way to filter out things but I
don't know why you would want to not see
the awesome things that before people
are building so yeah use the filters on
the sidebar on Rex shader work really
hard to get those set up and I paired
with Justin for quite a while to make
the subreddit more aesthetically
pleasing and he did a great job he's a
CSS guru so yeah use the subreddit we
want it to be one place we don't want to
divide the community up in more places
than we have to and i think the
subreddit is a really cool place to
congregate and share links because what
happens is if a link is really popular
and it gets up voted a lot then people
outside of the free code camp sphere
will see it and that's really what we're
hoping will happen is we'll make the
front page of all and suddenly all of
these people who are paying money to
learn how to code find out free code
camp exists and come join us and learn
for free so my hope is that happens if
you see anything cool please submit it
to the subreddit submit your projects
make it an active place give people
feedback and overall just engage engage
with your other campers and and make it
a place worth worth going every day
Andrew Carr Andrew char said he goes to
the subreddit every morning as part of
his routine I do the same all right and
I didn't awful and some one question
people had is like how do i add a flare
so this is terminology i didn't know but
basically flares are just basically like
tags
you can tag everything is like a project
or meta means something specific to
about free coke camp so for example re G
just submitted six minutes ago he
submitted this link to the you know the
Python article on wikipedia or on
pre-cooking of wiki and you can scroll
through and see it by the way I just
want to give acknowledgement credit
where credit is due Dennis Tang who's a
camper who's very busy he works full
time he's working on a non-profit
project currently he did a ton of work
on on these basic Python articles in
conjunction with RG so I just want to
make sure that everyone knows that
Dennis tang is the man he did a great
great job on a lot of this content but
somebody asked like hey how can i add
flair like when you post on free code
camp subreddit for example it won't
initially have a subject and I think
that only moderators can go through and
add flair a mic am I correct Michael I
believe so yes but we're pretty on top
of it I know Rex tags a lot of posts so
in general there you know if you submit
something it will be tagged with flair
very soon yeah generally within you know
I mean we're all we have six moderator
seven moderators right now including me
so I think people are constantly going
here and tagging things and reading
comments and so yeah I think you'll
really enjoy using the reddit and I
encourage you to use it as much as you
can that's what it's there for we just
wanted another an additional resource to
kind of bind everything together all the
external content and reddit is a great
way to organize all that I got some
messages that Raphael sent me a s legend
001 asked does ' have plugins such as
WooCommerce so actually that's a good
question for abdur rashid you want to
take that one
' doesn't have a plug-in system the
basic idea is to install node modules
which could enhance ' so could I present
yes
okay you should be able to present now
other words you'd be so it goes in there
create a blink um it's called peer and
kaz but it was no one of the first login
that you use is called ' search please
help you get is search by onto your site
so that this is the closest they have to
plug in so you have to install through
NPM just like you do with nodejs and it
gives you extra functionality and then
they also have instructions on how to
set them up well I don't ask something
like Walker muris right now because yeah
that's
other domes yeah okay we may be having
some audio issues otherwise she'd I saw
your mouth moving a little bit but I
couldn't hear you can you say something
just to verify it's working oh so I can
okay good penny here yeah I can hear you
now yeah so I said ' doesn't have a plug
in the closest to that is um dia NPM
modules which you could install as part
of the sites for example like I give
this on the search bar which helps you
search through content on the site cool
and ' is it built an angular or you know
what the underlying um its business um
there's no like front end technology
right now what you would use jQuery is
to like add stuff if you want so it's
basically it just has the views page it
has no ability has no real tears okay
it's just no more JavaScript so
basically any resource that you could
any sort of javascript / jquery snippet
you can potentially detector breath on
the back end its expressed on the back
end yeah okay cool yeah all right we
still have a lot of questions owns
okay going okay so I'm just going to
keep moving with the questions and these
things people resizing sorry everybody
so some other questions I got from
Rafael just a moment ago my assumption
is if I use a framework like spring for
the sufficiency dwork yes you can
complete all of the backend
certifications using a back-end
framework like spring if you'd like a
spring by the way is basically like
Express for java do you plan on doing
another round of shirts we already
answer that in fact I can answer that
definitively we're going to make some
new shirts for the next summit will
launch in a new t-shirt campaign during
April summit we just need to figure out
the design if anybody has any design
ideas that they'd like to be made into a
t-shirt we're all the years the right
person to talk to is Justin holleth rod
I think he's probably watching um but
his name here and get er is hot rod if
you message this guy he is quite he's
the designer extraordinaire who was
behind us refactoring the way that our
subreddit looked for example and he's
made a ton of UI improvements on free
coke amcom itself so i'm going to try to
never get back to the other questions
so I can say something about the Odin
project my friend Eric runs the Odin
project he is using it I think mostly to
raise awareness of his paid online boot
camp a biking code school which I don't
know a whole lot about but I've heard
good things about we don't intend to use
free coke if as a feeder to a paid boot
camp or anything like that we intent
obviously to keep free code camp free
forever and to keep it going forever if
you've heard me talk on any podcasts
I've hope I've been very consistent
about that so the Odin project cover is
ruby on rails which is one of many web
development tools it used to be the most
popular one now I think node and Express
are probably as popular if not more
popular we plan to cover Ruby on Rails I
think everything on the Odin project is
open source we may be able to link to
some of the articles on the Odin project
and piece together our own curriculum
using external resources like the Odin
project for as references just like we
did it initially like free coke games
curriculum initially was us pointing to
like a lot of Stanford classes and
Codecademy classes and things like that
and gradually we were able to build more
and more in-house content and keep it
much more consistent and I think
eventually we'll be able to do that with
the other languages as well but we will
probably start out using a lot of
external resources
so Quincy we have another question from
Andrew who asked on average is that
about how long it takes a camper to get
to code for a non-profit I'm not sure
what that means i can tell you that
there are if you just joined free code
camp there about 1200 hours of coding
experience in the challenges between you
and contributing code to a real
organization it takes a lot of people a
lot less time than that it's just up to
you and your availability and how
committed you are if you're asking
Andrew how long it takes to complete the
non-profit project that's something
where we don't really work on deadlines
you know if Abdul Rashid wanted to take
a vacation to Paris we would take a
break for the week you know but in
general we would like to do every
nonprofit project intense prints and
most of the time those are weekly
sprints using the extreme programming
flavor of agile so you know if you
wanted to work on a non-profit project
your first one hopefully would be ten
sprints if you'd like to find another
partner and work on another one maybe go
do a legacy project we would it might
not have to be tense prints it could be
just based on whatever the future
they're requesting to upgrade what the
previous campers had built if that makes
sense so it's pretty flexible there's no
standard all I can say is that I hope
that you get all of your certifications
and Andrew are ready to contribute code
to a non-profit soon and then I'll get
to know you and we'll we'll get you
started on a project thanks Michael
another question so phonics and fuse 365
we're requesting that next time our
t-shirts we have women sizes last time
we went with the unisex size because we
wanted the t-shirt to be as cheap as
possible and that like the cheapest
option didn't
for fitted women's t-shirts but we will
go back to fitted women t-shirts like we
did with our original campaign several
months ago those were a big hit my wife
wears hers all the time so hopefully
next campaign will do that the t-shirts
will be like marginally more expensive
they'll be like slightly higher quality
but we will have women's t-shirt sizes
other questions that you all see that we
might want to answer like people are
requesting coffee mugs things like that
those are great ideas correct size
coffee mugs merit badges we've
definitely looked into that we are
considering the idea of creating laptop
stickers that like if you complete a
certification you can order a sticker
that will like basically correspond with
the print cocaine certifications you
completed so you can put that on your
laptop I'm catching up in the chat see
is FCC going to be getting SAS and react
challenges soon yes that's a very
popular question we have a mouse we had
so let me just bust out this article
real quick so I wrote this article
earlier this month uh basically
outlining our near-term plans for free
code camp like this a little bit bigger
you can see my computer's a complete
mess
what happened there there it is so we in
this article basically set out to define
what our goals were for the upcoming
summit so today the March summit stream
at least four hours per day every day
we've been streaming closer to 10 hours
a day actually we've been streaming that
ton on Twitch so if you haven't
subscribed to our twitch channel be sure
to click that it's like a follow button
it's not to subscribe you don't have to
pay anything to to to do it some twitch
channels you can pay and subscribe but
we're not interested in doing that but
basically I at least four hours a day of
streaming content 600 wiki articles are
live which currently I think 593 so we
got very close to that goal and this the
rate at which they're being written is
accelerating especially now that we're
including other languages the wiki on
free code camp currently is in a little
bit of a weird state that we're going to
fix this weekend getting the actual
spanish-language wiki articles live is
still something we're working on global
hotkeys is something that Ben McMahon
you may know him from twitch as DK a
monkey 64 is working on I can tell you
right now you may not be aware of this
but if you go to free code camp you
actually there are some hot keys that
are already enabled so check this out
fight if I click g.m it'll pop open the
map and then I click it again it will go
away and also I can open up the chat
anytime by doing GC so these are based
on the google mail gmail shortcut
paradigm where it's like 22 keystrokes
essentially this should close it GC GM
open them on top of one there so we're
going to be creating a lot more hotkeys
like that our idea our goals are to keep
freako camp calm itself as simple as
possible keep it you know err on the
side of really important features rather
than a ton of features we don't want it
to become you know a convoluted ebay
looking site we want it to be really
mental listing ends and easy to navigate
and so that means adding features that
are essentially invisible like API
endpoints and adding for example a lot
more hotkeys adding a lot more options
that you can tweak in the background
like night mode where you can turn
everything dark and get like a better
night time reading experience for
example so those are those are some of
the things we're working on right now
Berkeley's very close to getting the
challenge infrastructure he's already
refactored using reactant Redux and he
just needs to to get that actually
working so Berkeley I believe you said
you've got the views some of the views
in place and you're just working on the
logic behind the scenes to render them
and Link the pages yeah the view they're
ready great and then if you take a look
at our April summit next month same
bat-time same about place we always do
these at noon pacific time or noon
eastern standard time on the first
saturday of every month we're hoping to
be streaming at least eight hours a day
i think we'll probably be well ahead of
that goal our eventual goal of course is
to be twenty-four seven livestream
channel essentially a lot of the
channels on Twitch are 24 7 which is
extremely community and go there anytime
and we want to be able for you to be
able to go and watch people code at any
time and
and like kind of learn through unwinding
after you've coded yourself for the day
we're going to we're going to rapidly
expand we're going to basically double
the number wiki articles this month and
then video challenges with which brianna
is working on we're going to have 60 of
those live we're going to move all of
our project where new challenges which
currently have videos we're not a huge
fan of video for those sorts of things
because they're accessibility issues
we'd rather have them in like a
step-by-step gif format so we're going
to create that as well and I'll be
recording gifts for every single project
and and those will be moving to gif
format we're going to try to audit all
the notes goal modules and see if we can
fix some of the obvious bugs that are
preventing people from being able to
complete some of them like the how-to
mbm is particularly buggy I think
several of the chapters in there are
either like they're open issues open
pull requests that have not been
accepted so we're going to be creating
on stable forks of those probably we're
creating an academic honesty auditing
tool to make it easier for us to go
through and verify that people aren't
flagrantly cheating by you know just
forking projects and submitting them as
their own for example and then we're
also working on teacher mode night mode
and of course the multi-tap editor which
will basically be like a little mini
version code penned that's something
we're working on so you'll be able to
build the front end and data
visualization projects right on free
code camp that's the goal you don't need
to use code pen unless you want to code
pen will be much more heavier like you
know it'll do a lot more heavy lifting
if you want to do stuff there but you'll
be perfectly able to build these
projects on free code camp calm that's
the goal so that's that's April April is
give you a big month for us and then may
our goal for may is basically to
continue expanding the volume of live
streaming
continue publishing more wiki articles
double the number of video challenges
that are live in terms of you know these
short two-minute explainer videos on
theoretical principles in front of the
whiteboard and then then to answer your
question the data visualization
challenge is for react read access and
d3 we hope to get those live so one of
the reasons why these haven't gone up
yet is we've got infrastructural
continues or dependencies essentially
like we have to fix we have to react if
I the code base and go to the multi-tab
editor and all that stuff in order to be
able to do a lot of these things
effectively in the browser so those will
those are have like already underway
there under heavy development i think
akira lane for example is working on the
sass course and then github export tool
so it's easier for you to take your free
code camp work and just put it all on
github instead of having to like
manually copy and paste which is what
you currently have to do if you want to
kind of do a post your content on freako
camp and github and we do recommend you
put as much stuff on github is possible
because github while not your resume it
certainly is something that employers
and recruiters will be looking at see
how active you are on github how much
stuff you have how many open-source
contributions you have which if you're
interested in getting some quick open
source contributions if you haven't
contributed to open source before here's
an article i'll just post it in here and
how you can contribute to free code camp
within 15 minutes contribute to our wiki
and then of course the big thing that
we're interested in is live in browser
pair programming with voice over
internet and we're hoping to ship all
this stuff in May and then in June
basically just crank it up to 11 so to
speak and have
just tons of wiki articles tons of video
challenges 24 hour a day twitch
streaming and expand on some additional
content like people want more testing
related thing challenges people want
more object-oriented challenges people
want more json api challenges people
want to be able to do free code camp
offline there's a there's a prison
actually that we're working with they're
already using free code camp extensively
berkeley do you want to talk about that
real quick actually I name we should we
have mine after that okay yeah let's
talk about that later so uh and then
ideally we want to be able to quickly
match people using within free cocaine
for you to easily find other campers and
match up with them and pair program with
them live so the idea is using free code
camp more efficiently to help people
pair program and also expanding our wiki
in terms of more language coverage more
world language coverage spanish-language
articles Chinese language articles
Russian Brazilian Portuguese is well
underway and and just have a ton more
content outside of free coconut com it's
like helpful and then free coke camp
calm is just technologically very
advanced it's going to be a very modern
web application like real time like you
get when you went to like Korra for
example or Facebook so we need your help
if you're interested in helping out the
most helpful thing you can do at this
point is just to take this quiz that the
bottom of this article and figure out
where you can help us where you're best
suited to help us so that was the long
answer I do want to get back to other
people's answers but but since people
have been asking that question a lot I
just wanted to explain the entire
timeline of what we're working on for
the next three months yeah all of these
features don't just come out of thin air
it's it's volunteer contributions people
like RG who just come out of the
woodwork and are amazing and help us
grow and
teach more for free and that that
emphasis on free i think parlays into
another really good question that Andrew
had Andrew you're asking a lot of great
questions today and Quincy I know you
have to constantly constantly reiterate
your answer to this but his question is
because FCC is a free coding site is
there any risk that FCC will no longer
be able to do what it is doing right now
which is providing all of this for free
I think our server costs are like less
than a thousand dollars a month still
and just other costs I I mean as long as
you all buy t-shirts and stickers and
things like that I think we'll be able
to sustain ourselves until we until we
have so many campers going through free
coke camp that we can easily just run
our job board right now we don't have a
high enough volume the job board we
basically put that on hold because we
didn't feel that it was a service to
anybody because there weren't enough
campers that had completed everything
still nobody's completed all a free coke
camp nobody has that coveted full stack
development certification that you get
when you complete for non-profit
projects but we have lots of people that
are starting non-profit project we have
people who completed one non-profit
project and are getting geared up for a
second one so that you know that's in
insight and a lot of employers will
probably be content to hire people
before they've even done those nonprofit
projects but so we have I think maybe
like 30 people that have finished all
three of the first certifications so
they're so new it's taking people a long
time to complete them but as they
complete them we we hope to be able to
make some money by matchmaking campers
with employers that will always be
optional we don't want to make you sign
some contract and force you to work for
someplace you don't want to work for we
would never garnish your wages or do
anything weird like that like basically
we want to always align our interests
with your interests and with the
interests of employers who are desperate
for for developers
frankly so I think as long as we're able
to continue to sell merchandise that
that will cover our short term costs so
just keep that in mind when you're
buying like a t-shirt when you're buying
stickers and things like that and we'll
come up with other things that we can
sell to but basically instead of asking
for donations we've decided like let's
try to sell these things with a
reasonable enough margin that we can use
that money to pay for our expenses so
that's kind of our philosophy but the
answer is no there's no no near-term
next few years risk of free coke can't
just going into default because we've
been very conservative about how we
expand you know basically we're keeping
costs as low as possible we're not
you're not going to hear some sob story
about how we can't sustain ourselves
because we brought on too many employees
or you know committed to too much in
google ads or something like that um
okay so other questions we've passed the
hour I do want to answer some more
questions though and I've been talking
with you much so Maddie l22 asks if
there are any updates on the numbers of
people who have completed each
certification I think you just threw out
the number 34 all three do we have
berkeley do we have numbers on how many
people have the front end certification
right now you know what I can get back
so we actually have a branch or claim
that we're working on we're going to add
that to the about page so you'll be able
to see that at any time it's just that
we needed a way to do that efficiently
because we were running like three
queries against the database every time
the about page loaded which slowed it
down significantly when you have
hundreds of thousands of user account
user records it takes a while
but yeah Berkeley if you want to pull
the current stats real quick from from
the database um why don't we ask you
another question while he's working on
that sure so I just realized that the
questions are in the live coding room I
don't know why I didn't realize that
earlier Raphael headed up curating them
for us thank you very much raw file yeah
thanks I've just been pulling them from
the chat so I don't know Quincy if I was
going to moderate a few questions but I
if you know if you get those long-ago
it's great no I mean I'm just looking
from the chat um Gary says he stumbled
on FCC sometime back and things were
great we think you're great Gary do you
have any back-end server side courses
that you plan to offer so we are
offering the notes cool uh modules which
we're going to be refactoring ourselves
to make them more stable but those are
potentially courses I mean those are
actually used as the curricula for node
schools you know workshops where they
get a bunch of people together so those
are pretty good and the Python document
that we showed earlier is essentially
it's a it's like a tutorial but it's
it's it's very I mean it would take you
many hours to work to it with it so we
consider that to be kind of like a
course if that's what you're asking we
don't do courses in the traditional
sense where everybody sits in the
classroom progresses at time or even
like the more contemporary online
version where people go and their
lectures or anything like that it's just
basically text with some combination of
interactive component so here's a
question that I think I'm best suited to
answer which is when you work on
nonprofit projects can you describe how
detailed the requirements are that's a
great question I know that a lot of you
are curious about how the nonprofit
projects work we have written a very
very thorough document that is just
sitting in a pull request right now as
soon as that's live you'll be able to go
to the about page and read a whole
more I can tell you as far as the
requirements on specific projects they
differ every organization I mean this
it's not like a front-end project where
everybody works on the same thing these
are real organizations that have real
needs and so we kind of take them one by
one when i'm looking for nonprofit
projects for you guys I do a lot of
filtering I filter out everybody who has
a deadline which I don't think is a good
combination for beginning web developers
you should have the time to research to
learn as you build and to feel confident
that what you're doing is is will just
be confident in what you're doing so you
know I could talk all day about the
nonprofit projects I want to be mindful
of your time if you have if you want to
have a discussion just reach out to me
and get it I'm code nonprofit and getter
and I will talk about nonprofit stuff
till the end of time before so yeah
let's keep moving all right number 838
7870 of completing the front-end
development projects yeah so they have
870 people have the front-end
development certification at this point
yes and 55 have me back end 65 of the
back end and the data visualization 39
39 okay so a lot of people are asking
like hey I can't do they're saying i
can't do the back or the data
visualization I don't have any tutorials
essentially but 39 people have just
using the reactants ass documentation
the official reactants ask doc you
mentation and tutorials provided by
Facebook for example have managed to do
it so jump right in don't wait up you
don't have to wait until May let's get
these challenges live when we do get
them live they will be helpful certainly
but they're not going to
there's no magic bullet so to speak and
the silver bullet you're still going to
have to read some documentation just
like everything so uh Quincy drifting
wants to know where he may read more he
or she may need more about the story
behind free code camp you've been on
some podcast recently do you want to
maybe just direct into the podcasts sure
yeah so one podcast that I did that I
thought I did a good job on is code
newbie let me see if I can find it yeah
I've listened to all of the podcasts
that Quincy's been on and he is always
asked about the origins of free code
camp and what you know what brought him
to making this idea so maybe that's
something where we can share those again
Quincy maybe just tweet him out again or
something because it seems like a lot of
people have joined since those
interviews and would be interested in
learning more yeah I mean I think
listening to this podcast will give you
a pretty solid idea of the rationale
behind it the woman who interviewed me
sir ron who was code newbie she's an
incredible interviewer and she brought
out a lot of really good answers so i
would definitely recommend uh listen to
that if you're curious and i'm working
on some sort of document that will be
much more detailed in the future so kind
of the authority of exactly what
happened and what sequence type thing
you know which michael johnson in
berkeley Martinez are obviously very
critical early days I'm vibin with us is
essentially day one in the sense that
like free coke camp was growing like
this basically a flat line if I showed
you on the l a-- analytics like our
actual growth in terms of usage which is
what i like to measure free coke camp in
terms of total minutes used right now
people use
cooking up about 10 million minutes a
month yeah it's I mean basically we were
going for a while and then Michael
Johnson and Berkeley came in and we were
really ramping up but we'll have a lot
more detail about that for sure and by
the way if you're interested in podcast
in general these are the podcasts that I
personally recommend I think that
they're really really helpful and I
listen to them when I go running and
whatever i'm driving and stuff you can
listen to them on double speed so let's
see if there are any other questions and
before we do anything I wanted to say I
think we have a lot more streaming lined
up for this weekend code school which is
one of the resources free cocaine user
early on for some of its content like
our angular courses and stuff code
school is free this weekend usually I
think it's like 25 bucks a month to have
an angle how much you're 29 what yeah so
I mean if you're curious about code
school which is a good resource it's
like it has a lot of good beginner
courses on a lot of different subjects
you can check it out for free this
weekend and we're going to actually be
streaming and blazing through those on a
free code camp on our twitter stream
right here so i'm not sure who's going
to take over the stream after we're done
i think Septimus wesley who's in charge
of which would probably be the best
authority on that let's see thank you
for sharing the podcast with people Joey
someone asked here and there are a lot
of questions in here oh I can prioritize
one because somebody would like to know
how to buy more than two laptop stickers
ok so I'll tell you how I'm handling
I'll have top stickers it may sound kind
of old school and funny but I just mail
them out myself I've got everything like
down
science basically like you know I'll
throw on like a podcast and I was
basically just stuff envelopes so I've
already gone all the stickers stuff
you're not envelopes and packages of two
and stamped in everything so what I
recommend you do is just make several
transactions can like back to back and
then I'll take the stamps off and put
the stickers into the same thing and
send them out that way you can I mean it
won't save you any money because we
haven't set up paypal to be able to buy
the stickers and book because we wanted
to keep things as simple as possible our
goal is to probably move to like Shopify
or some better shop framework in the
near future but right now the only thing
we're selling is the stickers so it's
hard to justify you know all the
technical debt associated with you know
implementing a shop appliances and
wiring that in and there are additional
fees and stuff so I was just like well
let's do that so basically the stickers
we'll just put them into will put
several stickers into an envelope and
will mail them that way I might even be
able got some extra stickers if you do
that yeah so just to make sure I
understand in an answer can he just pay
like transfer money in multiples of five
dollars and then you'll send the
corresponding modem stickers correct so
basically what you could do is you could
just go to freak okay shop I'll just go
there right now show you guys what it
looks like showing you all what it looks
like shop and when you go here you'll
see that there's literally only one
thing you could do which is buy stickers
and you know that's the same cost
regardless of where you are I wanted to
be socio-economically blind to the
extent possible and the biggest cost is
shipping and pretty much anything with
the t-shirts and all that stuff it's
just expensive to ship things but that's
one of the reasons we chose stickers
because they're really inexpensive to
ship we can just ship them in like
letter envelopes so I just get the
international postage and you click
through here and it's going to take you
to paypal and then basically you'll just
enter your paypal information and I
think the quantity is fixed at one you
might be able to change the quantity i
don't think so but if you just do this
several times i was kind of
pain if you needed like six stickers
instead of for something like that you
could probably do that and then I will
notice that there are several can you
know consecutive transactions with the
same address and mop them into one
envelope the other thing we could do is
like if if you want to email me after
you make the transactions if you ordered
like you know six stickers and you want
to extra or something like that I could
probably do that just send an email the
team at free coconut com all work with
you won't message back and front the
t-shirt campaign we're probably going to
duty spraying again and that'll start in
april we'll probably launched it at the
summit the april summit as we've done a
pretty good job so far I mean they're
reasonably faster deliver and it I mean
I can't imagine myself sitting around
like bagging up t-shirts and figured it
would be Kris yeah so blitz 90210 asks
do you have the stats who successfully
got a job through FCC I can tell you
that we only know if you got a job if
you tell us and I've spent a lot of time
connecting with campers on linkedin and
reaching out to them and asking how it's
going endorsing them for different
skills and we have put together a good
strong list of people who have had
success if you go to free code camp calm
/ stories I would love for that to just
be an infinite scroll and and everybody
who has anything positive happened as a
result of FCC lets us know and we'll add
them to that page but it's true that we
only know if you if you report it being
an open source community where you're
free to go get a job you know outside of
any contracts or us docking your you
know ten percent of your first year
salary I mean we don't do any of that so
we only know if you tell us if you blitz
if you get a job please let me know and
we'll make sure that everybody else
knows you get a job as well and you can
absolutely announce that on
read it if you have time you can be like
hey I got a job you know tell us a
little bit of the details about it i'm
sure a lot of people have time in to
congratulate me facebook a lot of people
announced on facebook and that's how i
hear about it like it'll gradually like
show off my news book feats like
something that's been like a hundred
times because somebody got a job and
like a whole bunch people liked it
that's those are kind of the ways we
figure out and then we just sent out a
quick survey and then we take that
survey and we add them to the stories
page but i can tell you hundreds of
people have gotten jobs many more have
gotten promoted within their current
company which is also a huge success we
don't want you to think that you have to
leave your current company pretty much
every company if it's big enough has web
developers involved some level so you
know you can definitely like like Jason
struggling to remember his last name
placing Jason fi he's named with JSON o
fie on freako camp and he was working at
doing like graphic design and stuff at
costco and he was able to move into like
development and data science it was
wrong it was Jason Rupert yeah Jason
recruit so and and he's just one of many
campers who've been able to get promoted
within their company as well and and
keep in mind like these are people that
general like nobody's actually even
finished the program yet because we're
so new and because we're so rigorous
it's not like a 12-week program it's
literally we assume that it's going to
take at least a year even if you're
working full time and a lot of people
come in if you look at our LinkedIn
University a lot of people come in
they're already working as developers
egg companies like you know we can see
where they are Microsoft there are a lot
of people there other big tech companies
they're already working maybe in like a
less technical role like as a project
manager or product manager in their
transition to being able to work as a
software engineer but you can see that
we've got
pretty big network here that we strongly
encourage you to become a part of but we
will give more hard numbers about the
number we they want to sort of be more
hard but they'll be a little bit more
we'll have a little bit better idea as
time goes by because we're still trying
to figure out of ways reaching HP
because a lot of times people will be
using freak ocampo get a job let's just
disappear because they're like so busy
dealing with their new responsibilities
at work and and then we'll hear about it
like months later for example so but I I
mean I don't think you need to worry
about whether free coke ample will be
able to get you job frankly it's
incredible how much demand there is if
you're able to build these projects
which are not easy I mean a lot of them
are what would be like you know a
capstone project in like an intensive
coding program for example like we have
30 of them so all right so Septimus is
getting ready to take over the stream
and then I think somebody else may take
over our hope is that we can just crank
through all of code schools free free
weekend courses their entire curriculum
is free so we're going to try to
complete as much food as possible just
to exploit let's see any other questions
before we end if anybody has any
questions for me in particular just
message me and i'll be happy to get to
them that way we can end the summit at a
reasonable time and let everybody get on
with coding all right great and thank
you everyone for joining us I will
scroll through the questions and answer
other questions in the stream like I'll
just answer as as freako camp and thank
you again for joining us I hope you can
stick around for the screen have a
beautiful weekend I hope you get
a lot of coding cheers decoding over
