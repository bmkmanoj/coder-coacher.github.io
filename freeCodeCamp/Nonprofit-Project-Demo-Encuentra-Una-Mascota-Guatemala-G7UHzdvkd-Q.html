Alex Dixon worked on an app through free
code camp and we had a great experience
I'd spend a year ago now and we both
have jobs but we were asked to kind of
show the app and alex was busy but I'm
happy to do that so this is what the app
looks like from the front end which is
it's as you can see it's in Spanish we
wrote it in English and then it was
translated a couple of month or so
before we deployed so we could get the
kinks out so this is a an app for folks
in Central and South America to find
pets that they want to adopt so you can
choose the country that you're in the
city that with their dog or cat and then
you can search for that pet you can say
oh there's a pet in Guatemala and this
is what I want and then I can look at it
and say it's active Oh means that it's
available to to adopt pen dianna day is
that it's pending adoption meeting
someone is you know thinking about
adopting this adorable little animal and
there's one that's closed which you
packed it you actually wouldn't see here
because we've filtered for just active
or a pendant or pending and then if you
wanted to see more about the pet you
would click on the face you can see a
big picture of the ped and then this is
a sort of a description of the pet the
name and the principal main breed the
color the size and then a story of the
cat now this is written in English
because that was something we wrote in
but of course it would be written in
Spanish by the adoption agencies and
nonprofits and then if you decided oh
you know I really liked to learn more
about that pet or get in touch then I
could say email the organization and you
could send an email to the organization
and get in touch and adopt a pet so once
you've made the decision to look at a
pet that really the website you're done
with the website
level you're not going to interact
directly with the organization so that's
the main way it works I thought it might
be interesting since I that the audience
here are other coders in free code camp
that we you know we use github and we
both worked in it and think we look at
the pulse you can sort of get a feel for
I guess it's maybe the graphs that you
know we started in April we were
basically done and I gotta know it says
may there but I think we both I worked a
little bit longer on it because Alex got
a job sooner than I did but we both did
get jobs but that's what we were working
on and then we did use Alex found this
really great um starter github
repository and it had what we needed in
terms of you know we needed both a way
to have logins for the adoption agencies
as well as a public side so that was
kind of a little bit more complicated so
we use this as a starter system so we
use the agua is the happy framework
mongodb and node mailer for the email
transport you just saw an example of
that emailing that you would be doing
among other emails that were sent the
front end was react we use flux and
that's about it gulp for the asset
pipeline so that was that in and then we
we deployed it on Heroku and that again
I thought was pretty seamless you know
he I mean not that we didn't have some
issues of course we had issues but
anyway it just grabs the github
repository and you update the github and
then it redeploys it so anyway that's
the the back end kind of stuff and this
was that this is the site then from the
public point of view where they choose
like you could leave it a little bit of
that you can say well actually I want
Guatemala but I don't want Antigua I
want another maybe I want Guatemala
itself okay the dog is got a t-shirt
anyway um maybe there is not a pet near
El Salvador and this was sort of a fun
thing that we implemented using Mongo
and you know part of mongo allows you to
do a Geo locator so we could say you
know you look look ten kilometers away
from the
location that they're choosing in el
salvador in this city let's say we're
going to week and we got the geo
locations you know longitude latitude
for each city in all of these countries
and so then Mongo allows you to function
part of mongo is to search in different
sort of you know cascading out diameters
until you find a pet and then if
eventually you never find a pet in that
area we you know you say well we're
sorry maybe you should change some of
your parameters because there's nothing
within that area so maybe just give us
everything in El Salvador well in this
case maybe there's nothing in El
Salvador but but that's the idea that
you could look for things closest to
your point of interest and then kind of
go out from there and that was sort of a
interesting thing that MongoDB offered
so that's the the back end of the I'm
sorry that's the public by front end you
know from the public side and then from
the adoption side you're a comfort let's
say you're you're an adoption agency in
one of the parts of central south
america you can go to your home page but
let's say you haven't you would register
for the first time so that's what this
is and this is where the client said
well here's what you need to have you
need these three things these it's a
three step process what's going to
happen and then keep going well you have
to agree to these these rules of
engagement which are lit basically you
know that you're a legitimate nonprofit
you know you're trying to weed out the
scam artists and then finally if you
want to join then you have to fill out
this form giving yourself a username and
a password giving us information about
yourself your telephone and who your
veterinarians are and your mission and
you have to post pictures and then you
register and then you're not you you
then get the next screen says you've
registered and we'll contact you when
you're ready so that then goes to the
owner of the site and we can just go
ahead and register I know that I'm is
called root root and that would be the
owners at this point of course that can
be changed but the owner can then say
well
these are all active let's say this this
one I this this would be a potential
shelter this is the shelter page the
back and shelter page and I can look at
that and say call them there's a data
here but you would call them and say yes
it's good okay if I then to approve it
here's where you say okay now you are
going to be able to approve that shelter
and now that shelter could login so this
is the back end of the so for the user
of the i guess the client in this case
his name was Walter and he's asked us to
build this for him he's going to then
get every one that applies as a shelter
through the application process we just
went through in the orange colors you'd
end up here Walter would get an email
that that person had just applied as
soon as they you know they get a
confirmation email the applying shelter
does Walter gets an email and then it
ends up here and then Walter can contact
them often that they'll come they'll
have phone conversations about different
credentials or what it takes or sort of
the details of management of the shelter
of the website and the shelter and then
they'll be approved so that is the from
the point of view of the third really
facing which is the owner of the site
his name is Walter so that he can
approve and not approve the shelter's to
post so then once a shelter has posted
it is successfully and I know that I
have one here that's set up for New
Mexico shelter I live in New Mexico so
now I have this is my shelter page and I
can edit any information about my
shelter right here i can add pets here
so the dogs have slightly different
variables than the cats you know um for
instance i don't like the hair is
different or something I don't know we
had all these issues about how you what
variables you want to create around our
pets and you have to put a picture in
and then here are look at is look at and
edit your pets this is the from the
point of view of the shelter so those
are the right now this new mexico
shelter has two pets that if i wanted to
say well I want to edit
add pictures I want to change it you
would do it here and that's the same
thing here you could edit it here so
that's the shelter view so this is from
i am the Shelton's is the homepage of
the shelter and again i can be figured
here i can add them here add more pets
here and then i can edit those pets
there and then i would end that session
and then it's like it's waiting but
that's the basic three views the public
view here what i want to look at for the
pets that are in my neighborhood and
that i find appealing and adorable the
view of the shelter and then the view of
the client or basically owner of this
site these are views again this is
actually from the public side this is um
why should you adopt a pet and the
client will eventually fill that out and
here's the process for adoption again
these are basically blank pages at this
point and then these are the shelters
that you can you know sign up for or
look at your information so I hope that
was clear it's clear in my mind but then
I spent a lot of time in it so i don't
know if it's clear to the to the viewer
this is who are we that's the kind of
about us page know in our lingo so
anyway that's that's basically our
website we just use it we found a stock
photo here to make it hopefully
appealing and show how wonderful it is
to adopt a pet it was a great experience
working with alex and free code camp and
i urge anyone who's interested to do it
so thanks a lot guys and yeah happy
