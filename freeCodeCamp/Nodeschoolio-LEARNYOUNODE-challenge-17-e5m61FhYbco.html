to see to create new workspace top left
I'm just typing whatever and they click
on the new button oh here I think would
this be for the node school or would
this be for a zip line
oh sorry
I have this dream open and I was getting
perfect okay yeah yeah this will be for
middle school okay okay
you can just start editing and I don't
know if it already has installed if not
it has the NPM back in the manager
already so you can just install agree
that oh wow it's like working in sub one
that's pretty cool yeah this chat
examples oh this isn't what we're doing
now this is something different right
what oh yeah that's just the default
baby
okay so I guess if we went to free cook
camp website they would give us
instructions on how to do the notes cool
challenges I think it might just link to
notes cool okay
I'm gonna try out that new twitch
thought I made and make sure it works
oh nice that should post on my Twitter I
don't have the new Twitter accounts they
made their keys I did it just let people
know when you're when we're streaming oh
yeah okay so how you talking about that
the other day yeah it's just the same
thing that Quincy used to post to
Twitter I used just a random image from
online Oh fine yeah I don't see the
notes cool ones unless I've already
crossed it off that's weird
oh yeah it's right there good I think
it's gonna help with or no that's
something else I don't like I said notes
well this thing it has something about
node
yeah you don't have the code school link
Oh Oh free alternatives to this course
here uh-huh okay there we go
okay so he wants us to do this inseams
c9 though yeah okay but we don't have to
do all that I don't know did you run it
there terminal though yeah I just did it
in terminal and I mean I would assume
they work the same way but I'd like to
figure out how they wanted it done as
well just to kind of break this off here
loud and clear stream is choppy lagging
regularly if it sound is okay well it's
better than miking irregularly I guess
sent on an email if they are subscribed
are gonna open up chat to you I guess we
can say hello hi everyone I'm Ashley
hello um so we're gonna do some fun
stuff oh I can hear myself now there we
go
let's figure that pop out button nose
all right I don't know if we're supposed
to do it the same way like what the NPM
start and past I think it's pretty much
the same thing with where do you know
okay yeah we can just do that and and
see what happens can you go fullscreen
for your browser and zoom in so we can
see better sure hey Brianna Murray
glad to see you run you know me too I
had fun with it
it was really helpful because it was so
hard you know what I mean I feel like it
forced me to learn a lot which was good
yeah it definitely progresses quickly
yes I'm in the middle of the stream
adventure one now and it's good because
it really doesn't it gives you a lot of
help sometimes and other times it forces
you to really figure it out yourself
so you end up learning a lot right yes
do this no it looks exactly the thing
all right
caffeine writer nice screen name and
thanks for following for the follow yes
I think we can just run the line you
node in cloud nine and then maybe just
make a new file for each one okay that
works
um I guess oh I see what you're saying
so NPM install it in here basically yeah
am I already installed oh I'm not sure I
got yeah okay might have to do
Jase honest I guess I'm not sure what
you mean by zoom in I'm making it bigger
I hope that helps I mean he means like
command and plus me yeah so you know how
that works definitely don't want it to
be like teeny-tiny so I spent I'm
embarrassed to say this like 20 minutes
trying to figure out why couldn't
install learn your node yeah it does it
helps a lot all right what if you
install it globally I don't have to
pseudo to do that
there we go I'll fix it no it does not
why I can't try to search that I wonder
if you have to go into client
interesting maybe just try to delete
everything in the notes cool folder we
don't even me about anywhere
oh do we all the yeah
you know I have no idea what's gone
well
oops keep
we can refresh this
so can you walk through it you did that
that changed it yeah I just removed like
everything up here we were right here
for root directory
okay just remain all the folders just in
case something got left over and then
reinstalled any node maybe I don't need
a googly if there you've been a pat like
do we have to add it to our path does
that even matter in this environment it
should have I mean I guess worst-case
scenario we can just do it internal or
in the other ones that they have running
that I think end of the amethyst Oliver
you can try a different version
maybe some your all aversion come on
what is nvm it's the it's a package
manager for node similar to our VM if
you ever use Ruby it installs
node versions locally so you don't have
to mess with the system version and you
can usually just switch back and forth
between different versions if you have
to roll back or go forward okay that's
good to know
hey there we go yeah yeah I think we'll
have to add that into the props for n
over I keep getting that but I never use
them or any yet
I'm never any problems with nvm so I
never switched ok wait my name is going
to cleave any instructions whenever they
set it up yeah person oh my god on that
here's pen and paper yeah that makes me
sad alright let's get started this is
exciting
I'm really glad you figured
because we can make this a little bigger
because it's long instructions okay
write a program that prints the text to
the world to the console standard out so
basically you're making like a true
program file and you run it from the
console and that's pretty much how then
note schoolwork so that should be pretty
easy right do a consult log and they're
picky like it has to be exactly what
they tell you
so all caps so console dot log and
standard out are pretty much the same
thing right yeah
yes turnabout just means it's regular
output to the terminal and there's a STD
out there's a trailer output and then
has CD er R would be in here it's a
little bit different but it prints about
us to do verifies what we want
actually we can just run it and that
will give you like a test output to see
if it works and it has this nice little
thing that's all green and says that
you're awesome
I'll beat you and I are cute just in
case people see an error well know what
it looks like oh yeah
can control us just like normal that's
helpful and I'll show you what your
program did and then what it was
expecting which is helpful as well yeah
praise someone to the bonfires they're
just regular test cases you have to make
a match yes we could have moved on
either way but I like when it's green
all right
this is where it starts to be
interesting write a program that accepts
one or more numbers as command-line
arguments and prints the some of those
numbers to the console so then they tell
you how to access command-line arguments
which is a lot like it reminded me at
least a little bit of using the
arguments object in some of the bonfires
I cannot kind of passes it in as an
array
yeah the only difference is this one
will always start at two because the
first one would be node since I don't
want to be your program yeah I took me
it took me a little bit to figure that
part out you can figure out you know why
would it be the first argument but
you're already providing two yeah so all
right so some of those numbers to the
console so the first step is to get
everything from the command line so I
guess we can start there I can get it to
move
that's tricky that way here we go
technical problems
alright so guess you can just start by
declaring a variable RB and it starts at
two but then it's an indefinite number
of arguments so can you do like comma
and then not provide a second argument
is that the right way to do that I can't
remember um you could or you could just
make it possibly be and make it the same
array and then when you do a loop just
start at the second index ah that's true
just like that yeah I guess we can't
call it arguments that's a reserved word
so living through
I know one oh can we do for each cuz
that's gonna go through a bunch of other
stuff won't it um we could always shift
it or splice it too
if you want to like you could you came
in splice processed I err DV from 2 to
the length of me right I like that
yeah alright so now we've gotten array
of no actually it says it's an array of
strings and we need to coerce them into
numbers and you can do this by prefixing
the property with the plus sign we're
passing it to number
I guess we could iterate through all of
them and do it that way like do a reduce
yeah I think you're reduce to be perfect
for this challenge the view that's
French and do you have a return
statement for reduce you just it's just
no I think you are yeah maybe but um I
think would automatically return a in
that case
I think that'll work
I mean you might have to set that to a
variable this yeah okay littleneck Lex
and Ryan mains undefined okay hmm maybe
it didn't maybe it doesn't return like
that maybe it would be an arse instead
what do you mean it with the args I'm
not sure how reduce returns because I
mean that would say it that was the
answer was undefined so maybe if then it
would be returned into answer mmm okay
yeah
see they use it here how do they do a
return statement inside maybe that's
what we've got oh okay yeah
there yes that worked this is a
different person we have Ashley and
myself Jeff last night was Nathan we're
looking for that nodejs horses I mean
other learning ed courses all right that
worked but see how they did it the long
way the result oh they had a they store
yeah they did an empty variable
basically and then a for loop yeah two
different approaches plus equals number
eleven challenges left oh yeah yes I do
like this it can be tricky to kind of
get used to their presentation but
they're really small little bite-sized
challenges which is fun right a program
that uses a single synchronous file
system operation to read a file and
print the number of new lines it
contains to the console the full path
will be provided as the first command
line argument you do not need to make
your own test file
so this basically teaches you how to use
the FS module which you don't do a lot
of the stuff when you use Express
because it kind of does some of this for
you yeah so
allow you to note a lot even for non web
stuff so it does come in handy do you
want to take lead on this one or I did
the easy ones it'll just come back to me
later when you finish this one and I get
a harder one that's a long-ass s equals
to acquire profess with FS library
module no no need to use FS read file
sync FG file
this method will return a buffer objects
containing the complete contents of the
file I'll store that and buffer
documentation on the FS module can be
found on your browser here which I guess
we could open is this not oh I don't
know
the cloud9 has a built-in web browser
only window you take a 3 and T thanks
for the feedback love to hear more about
that and what in particular we could
work on because we definitely don't want
it to be bad sound quality
it could very well be my mic have a very
cheap microphone but just ordered a
webcam actually which I'm pretty excited
about so hopefully the microphone will
be a little better it's kind of open
and we're freakin scrying can be oh yeah
those trying I guess browser can be a
little weird okay so I can open in your
chrome window too if you want I think we
should be okay for now scroll up way too
far you're looking for an easy way to
count the number of new lines we call
JavaScript string can be split into
array of subjects that new line can be
using as you over there so what is it
expecting here you're just counting the
lines right yeah so okay so it's gotta
be the same as cat file yeah number of
lies
buffer I don't want a buffer so c-can I
do best top it's fun ice
all different browsers I don't thinking
test stuff don't know why this is long
we're gonna do Chrome so I get you
anyway okay well what we're trying to do
here is we're going through the learning
node courses and we're going to be
printing all the new lines of the count
number of lines and the file we're going
to turn the buffer into something we can
iterate over because right block and
show you right now if we cancel out a
buffer it's not going to work right then
there's not actually a file then you
node run program Jesus I think I mean oh
right I need to take in argument here
for the file name
oh it provides you with random argument
time so somehow it's printing out just
the name of the file
maybe yeah I might need that if that's
read file sync yeah I might need to open
up a chrome tab
and then do you mind if I suit up here
yeah let's bring it on your computer I
guess so like I remember it
Oh oh yeah your path was probably
different yes I got one open over here
though I can use blue tile sink like it
takes a callback function if I remember
right I think you might be right let's
try a little bit so people can see yep
callback filename you can pass in
options with encoding which is handy
because it'll turn it into a string for
you that way oh well I mean that's great
yeah I'm reading the wrong one I think I
might just need to do like two string to
it yeah instead of oh yeah he's right I
could also pass the utf-8 and I wouldn't
need to use a string or convert it to a
string
that whoops our Zilla up here sorry okay
let's get this out well why isn't doing
it now
hmm I don't know why spraying the file
name instead of the file unless I'm
doing something totally wrong here read
file stick it terms the contents of file
name
see we're program full-time Foley
provided of the first command line
argument how are you running it or
verifying it I'm just rolling it oh okay
we're not providing an argument for the
file that's why if you verify it it will
pass in a file for you so I'm gonna
actually return something
okay you can hit up as well I always do
that yeah maybe I do need citron
verifier which I know it's going to fail
off because I'm not counting the lines
though I just want to make sure it works
mm-hmm still spits out the name that's
funny um interesting
yeah cool cool anomaly that um that is
actually one of the later challenges it
has you do it with a server but this one
is not asking us to make a server it
just wants you to spit it back out to
console.log which should be really
simple and I'm kind of surprised that
it's not working maybe no we just got to
turn the buffer when we did turn the
buffer into a string yeah I could even
do it this thing okay so didn't work but
I still want to make sense why it's
giving me the follow me
they try to locally and see if it works
I whenever there's just something weird
with cloud 9
we've got to do the first two first
though I haven't completed online if you
want me to run through it real fast
well can we still do individual ones
though I don't know how to go back I
guess you'd have to select it don't you
know we can't just use one file or just
a random popper that's going to test the
game and file so we have to actually use
the one that's under us
okay so you're on the baby oh yeah
that's just got to be good no that's
weird
yeah definitely don't remember this one
being quite so hard so yeah I know cloud
nine can be kind of weird sometimes
especially when a court spot everything
just process our units it'd be weird
I'm gonna try playing some music here
just want to make sure it doesn't play
out on yours either okay are you hearing
the music nope okay good yeah I don't
want it to be silent for whenever they
upload it to youtube oh yeah oh you
don't have to install our first right no
mas
okay see this it's the exact same
program and this time it print sucked
out so there's something funny going on
yeah that's kind of what I thought so
yeah yeah I kind of have an idea and
well we might be able to do I don't know
if it'll work just try
temp I don't know if it'll work
maybe oops
process the r32 is when you type things
in the command line it's basically
looking for it takes in all of those
strings as pieces of an array so process
that rv2 is basically the third thing
that you type in so we're typing like
node and then a program name and then
the third thing would be the first
argument we pass in so basically the way
it Verret and this is this is one of the
tricky things I think about learning new
they don't tell you is that when they
verify your program they basically run
it for you and then I pass in an
arbitrary file as the argument and
that's what they keep talking about when
they say processed at our v2 it's that
third argument which is the name of a
basically an arbitrary text file like
they came up on my terminal so that's
just how our porting things in into the
program someone was asking about process
dot v2 and I think that's one of the
things that it can be intimidating about
this is that we're not used to doing
that because we're used to using like
module exports requires things like that
and a lot of the things we've done with
free code camp but this is another
useful thing to know for sure
so you changed it to one and it's that's
weird it's still printing out the name
yeah stacking says it would be like node
project name file name dot txt yeah I
mean that's what we're doing but there's
something weird with cloud 9 where it's
not now where arguments without working
right just pronounced arguments yeah I'm
curious what that has cuz this would
definitely be helpful if someone's
trying to do this and they're frustrated
you know it's not you it's not us the
computer it's literally just pretty
about one thing up
okay
what oh wait I haven't been saving the
file owner that matters okay well
there's the problem you need to save the
file before you can run it that would
make a difference
okay
oh I don't think I need this counsel
about long save haha there we go oh no I
don't know what text they're using that
it is weird
might be like one solo something I only
said I can't or what does that loose it
as sands or something no I mean like the
dummy text oh yeah you little Ripper
songs flames I'm afraid to read it
because I'm afraid that I'm saying
something that the cool kids know it's
funny and I don't get my um one of those
things where I just uses like random
why's that makes it look like a sentence
but it's not really
I forget the name of that there's
something for that yeah all right so
we've got the buffer this is the easy
part right yeah console.log fine sock
link
I think
all around you all right that's the
number John it seems like a lot of text
for three lines doesn't change it
changes every time that's the other
tricky thing oh yeah what Oh what is
that yes you got 32 they're expecting 31
all right all right there we go we did
pretty much the same thing we just read
it out long ways instead of training
them together note that you can avoid
the two string by passing UTSA as the
second argument then you'll get a string
way ahead of you learn you node but
thanks all right cuz I can close this is
its I don't think it's gonna be working
hi jrg 66 thanks for joining us
didn't mean to close that I just wanna
close the browser new terminal think
it'll do new terminal or a console oh
there you go yeah I just wanted to close
this
three-two-one your nose first you sink
all right all right you ready this whole
thing you need to do it sure happy do
and it's basically the same thing except
asynchronous again full path to the file
will be provided as a first command-line
arguments solution is almost the same
except you have to do it the node way
which means we use a callback so we use
FS sweet file and then callback
signature is usually error and then a
variable so well I guess I could have
just called it oh good night yeah that's
true and then you don't have it actually
stored to a variable correct thank you
for all the function why is it
complaining expected error to me okay
all right
looks like it'll work
alright we got a number great
so basically it is exactly the same
thing so you did all the work and I just
moved it around well I gotta save a lot
of time I guess saved my file well
that's I think that's part of doing this
dream is figuring out you know how
things work and yeah getting it to run
um great program that prints a list of
files in a given directory filtered by
the extension of the files provided a
directory name name as the first
argument to your program and a file
extension as the second argument okay so
we just run all files with the given
argument and if I start reader takes a
path name and a callback
yes I read the process you need to call
back oh that's nice and even gives you
the function signature that's helpful
function and if the list is an array we
can probably just run filter on it
yeah what's true jrg this is your first
time free code camp does a lot of
streaming and there's a ton of different
stuff that people stream we do pair
programming every Tuesday and people
will stream building on free code camp
sites working on nonprofit projects a
lot of different cool stuff so I haven't
actually used filter I can look it up I
should learn it so I should do it now
you gave me a list got filter think and
then a callback
with element hey wet trial thanks for
following and ducks right
the value index I'll say rages for this
yes
so also don't just need a filter in math
it looks about the same filter you need
to filter test for true/false so if it's
true it keeps it in the array and if
it's false it takes it out map actually
does a function on every element of the
array like in place if I remember right
while filter just filter make a new a
new array or doesn't mutate I can't
remember which okay so we might need to
store it yeah but it's really helpful
you can just do like any kind of truthy
test okay
so now if oh I don't want to use a bar
our land equals exp out one element
substring from home at that length minus
one so not like equals x2 you can
actually just yeah you can just return
that because it's a tree huh you're good
to go
hello hello to you chip the rip okay one
more cynical and I think but it's not
complaining so maybe no no no very
different I think
cynical on here
all eventually matter though yeah
everyone here oh I don't think I say it
again it's not comfortable logging
anything oh yeah just console.log answer
hey the genghis goat thanks for
following and is the great screaming so
that's not gonna work I think I'm going
to do my Iceland it seems like the
length plus one cuz MD is not an
extension that should be a file name oh
yeah I think so gotta have to diet boss
look yeah okay it's not all there try
that I guess I've been really explaining
why I was quitting all I did it it's all
good I'm gonna read the directory I'm
Stan Harris run error and here we're
getting the extension Postum of the
third argument and a filter over the
array set the length equal to the
extension plus one so we can have a
period and then if the element ends with
the same extension you turn true or
false
hope you got an extra verifying there so
oh yeah
and no chip there if you don't have to
be on the same oh s but sometimes with
Windows and Mac like if I push the Apple
button it'll push the windows button on
the other person's computer which can
drive them nuts interesting oh it
doesn't want to read just jingle yes I
guess I just loop over it and then
console out okay so maybe a filtered
well I guess you could still be filter
and then rather one at the time there's
a storage
