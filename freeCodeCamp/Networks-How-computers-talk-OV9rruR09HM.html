computers talk before we do that I would
like to give you an analogy of how
people talk in this room we have John
Bob and Mary and when John wants to talk
to Mary he says hi Mary this is John how
are you doing now when they're in the
same room they're sharing the same
medium which is the air and all all of
them Bob and made it here to this less
the message but only Mary responds
because it's addressed to Mary in the
same way when computers want to talk
they share a medium in this example all
these three computers are sharing a
cable this is how networks were built in
the past so you have NIC cards for each
of these computers and they have their
own MAC addresses now let's say if a
wants to talk to be what a does is it
sends a message to B which looks similar
to this hey B you know you use the MAC
address to address B this is a talking
and here is my message how are you doing
now when this message is put on this
medium everybody on this medium can
listen to it so in this case B and C can
listen to this message now what happens
is when C looks at this message it sees
that it's addressed to B so it just
silently ignores it and B when it gets
this message it sees that oh this
message is addressed to me so let me
reply and when it decides to reply what
B does is I want to know who is talking
so it looks at the original message and
sees oh it's a who is talking so it says
hey a this is B and the actual message I
am doing good
that's how computers talk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
