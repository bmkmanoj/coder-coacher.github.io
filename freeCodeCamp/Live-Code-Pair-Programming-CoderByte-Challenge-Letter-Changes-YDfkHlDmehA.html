I love code
backwards resubmit mm-hmm okay well if
you're comfortable with it so do you
play hearthstone did you see something
on my screen yes yeah but you have a spy
in in in this dream oh she's not reading
well I mean yeah but it would be like
it'd be like if you like cheated on
something where you're trying to learn
and like that's the point like it would
be really dumb you should cheat on yeah
chief my way to a programming job like
like a like a fan all right
so this is the next challenge
okay okay sorry this is the next
challenge right okay okay
have the function letter changes string
take the string parameter we pass and
modify it using the following algorithm
please every letter in the string with
the letter following it in the alphabet
IEC becomes DZ become C becomes a then
capitalize every vowel this new string
AEIOU and finally return this modified
string okay drink to upper right is
there a string to upper in JavaScript or
are you relying on C maybe we'll find
out okay every letter in the string okay
so the first thing we should do is do
like an ASCII transform plus 1 you do
that right uh yeah you can't okay yeah
so wait I've just done I've just dealt
with unicode plus 1 I don't know if that
works that we plus 2 actually right yeah
well yeah yeah I don't know start start
to having code and I'll see worrier
thought processors okay
big blink actor coke cat contains ends
with replace right yeah you do
mathematical operations on okay regular
expression substring you suck
should split it into an array and that
deal with these characters separately or
is there something larger versus there
are methods that traverse the array okay
wait
okay so we can convert the whole thing
into array and the new from care code
traversing the array and then plus 2 on
each that's not the best way to do this
okay it's weird because like I'm used to
like just programming everything out
myself not using the available functions
so okay I'm a big fan of the available
functions so yeah I'm yeah the less code
you write yourself the less bugs you
introduce into the program
all right so so you can split right yeah
okay so what's your plan okay if we
convert it to a series of arrays or not
the series of Ray's an array character
array we can operate on each character
separately that's a good plan okay and
then we take so so there's like tears to
the way this works like you can do all
the operation 100 operation first and
then do the next operation or you can do
it see here actually that doesn't really
make sense we should just check just
make sure it's a if it's a vowel then we
capitalize it so would you like switch
you know I love you some switches okay
string dot split okay okay array
I can rid this to remain the last one
was it all right can can I give you uh
give you a hint
okay sure there is an array method
called Matt Oh what Matt ma t ma p Matt
oh okay okay Matt I see it oh hey Matt
yeah I go to the array
crease the array with results of calling
a divider function on every element in
this array oh okay so does the traversal
for year wait okay callback function
once for each element structs a new
array from the results Oh
great next to zero sine values both
indexes that are I'm fine doesn't that
just create an array of the same thing
you know you see did did you see here
right right there right see it's it's
taking a provided function and
transforming the array okay so okay and
you can define the function that do you
want me to get you started so it only
works on arrays so you have to split
your strength first so I can change you
and then remember split takes a
parameter
Chinese Mac hotkeys I use a Mac at work
and then does that home before
now remember map isn't good math map is
gonna return you a new array so you're
gonna have to assign the value back
so I need to call a function
yes that's yeah yeah you have to provide
a callback function to map
otherwise it won't do anything okay go
back and I'll give you a hint all right
so if we go if we go like this yeah okay
now just write out your function like
you would normally so oh okay oh you're
gonna need two parentheses at the end of
that after your semicolon or after your
brace after your curly brace because
you're providing the function as an
argument that you get query style okay
yeah well that's JavaScript style all
right Jake really always looks like that
okay why are people speaking out about
the switch I don't know okay so I don't
see anyone freaking out about this wish
I was somebody on there free code camp
chat well oh yeah don't worry about that
you focus on the challenges so okay okay
so we've got the logic set up so we'll
get the new thing it will we take okay
so it's been split into an array we
input function letter or well wait the
function it's anonymous function right
yeah this isn't this is an anonymous
function inside of it yeah
so what are you thinking - I'm thinking
we need to be able to form mathematical
operation on like the ASCII character
okay
so then and then what are you gonna do
to it add - you can add Teela's well
wait wait no does it go I forget does it
go like 1 through 26 is lowercase and
then 27 through whatever is uppercase I
think that's how it is yeah no it's like
65 3 whatever is uppercase and 97
through whatever is lower okay
but but that means you just have to do a
plus 1 I mean it's it's arbitrary what
the value is until you get to Z and then
you put in a special case yep sign
backward but Z's the only one we have to
you a special case the logic should hold
up for everything else
yep okay so we need to use something
that lets me shake it don't need to
convert it into ASCII can I do that or
does it just work anyway like huh C++
character arrays let you do mathematical
operations off them but I don't and in
JavaScript everything is an object so
the you aren't breaking them down I mean
each one is still going to be a strength
even though it's a it's a string of
length one so so I can't do like letter
plus one yeah you can try
so it returned letter plus one
it ended one to the end of letter and
returned to you in the Estrella okay so
so I have to actually take letter yeah
and that do you a function on it so you
can do well you're getting yeah you're
probably gonna need to do more than that
oh yeah so go back let's let's look at
the standard built-in objects and let's
look at strings again oh you can play
her stone wall okay so let's let's take
a look at string string okay all right
so see these d methods up here uh-huh
okay so what's this one character code
returns a string
created by using a specified sequence of
you to unicode values 65 66 67 okay so
we should get the unicode value
yeah and that's care code
so so think can we chain it so we do
like letter dot care code wait I'm not
capitalizing at and then at Texan index
index which the index is gonna be that's
something to do with math it's the index
is going to be zero
oh yeah because it's an array of length
one
yeah yeah like the one which is index
location zero
yeah got that okay so
this letter - why are you returning a
new letter why why are you making why
are you making a new one in that part of
it part of the promise and map is that
it's gonna return a new array right okay
yes okay so then you don't need to make
a new one okay well how do I get the
return from this that well you can
return this can can you just return that
or can you do letter equals and then
your operation and I'm going to return
the letter since the anonymous function
is running in map which is gonna return
you a new array okay so I want to get
from character code for character code
ad and then from character code returns
a string created by using specified
sequence of Unicode values so I need to
be able to do from character code of
what the return was plus two or plus one
right okay so how can I perform that
mathematical operation on it if like
where am I gonna put the math I can't
just do like this
well what if you did return the string
from care code letter dot care code at
zero plus one
oh it's return the ASCII values so
what's the string dot from care code
where does that method go yeah here I'll
show you okay okay okay it's oh yeah put
the function inside of it okay and what
do you get there good okay so wait I
always want to use if statements a good
idea um yeah you could do I mean an if
statement seems to be you know don't use
a switch don't use a switch with one
case on a default that they cascade okay
so so you know reg X right yes okay so
there is a way to test on against reg X
objects for values so that's that would
be my recommendation in in your if
statement okay
letter rules yeah because it needs to be
you should you should always use Tripoli
cool by the way don't use double equal
so double equal does it does type
conversion for you
whereas triple equal won't and I'd I
personally would rather be explicit
about my type conversion wait can I use
pipes
that's not or is it that it that's a nor
yeah okay
I don't need three pipes though no this
is bad Z or capital z Cheryl okay
else is also K JavaScript
yeah else is fine in JavaScript um so
what's what's going on what's going on
with your if statement yeah there we go
we got returned Z or Z yeah well what
what was no it
it's supposed to be uppercase anyway so
it's always gonna return uppercase a
good hey let's not now is it better to
use quotation marks or this like though
you're trying to fully escape rightly it
all depends it depends on what you had
set in your winter okay okay so syntax
error unexpected token else so that
typically means the structure of your
code is wrong that's because of
yeah this isn't closing capital a it's
always capital why are there spaces
though because it's it's just returning
a single element arrays giving you room
it's returning it as an array oh yeah
yeah okay okay okay so somehow we need
to make sure that we're only iterating
over letters like Oh
switches switches are not bed switches
have their place however their place is
not in here oh yeah I know so okay let's
go ahead let's go ahead and go back to
the mdn and i want you to look at the
Reg X object it's a standard building
yeah
you don't need it you don't even need to
do that there's there's a red X flag you
can provide to it to ignore case right
yes I don't its I well I mean you can
shorten that into a reg X if if it bugs
II but more pressing right now is making
the program function correctly so I
would check to I would make sure that
you're only iterating over letters okay
and if you if you go to the Reg s object
you'll see that there is a very simple
method for testing okay it's oftentimes
a lot easier just to go to the standard
built-in types that link and then scroll
down to what you want yep okay
oh okay and then look at that look at
the test method it sits up on the left
right all your methods are right here
okay methods and properties so checkout
test
search for a match between a regular
expression a specified string returns
true or false perfect for use in
conditional but I don't have a regular
expression object I have an array you
can you can you can make a regular
expression object and then test the
element of the array that you're on yes
by looking further down in the in the
documentation or I'll show you just go
back I'll actually show you how it the
easy way to make a regular expression
object on the fly
well that's the test that's that's the
object you're testing and the regular
expression against okay go back no no no
to cut it right all right so if you
wanted to test all right then you can
just make a regular expression object
like this yeah right okay
yes and then provide it your argument
letter okay okay now so if it is a
letter it's going to match that else do
you need notes the can you shorten can
you shorten it down there you don't need
else you just have it returned letter
because it'll never hit right there
otherwise right right yeah that's that's
checking to make sure it's not on it's
not gonna be easy
yeah so and then so here's another one
I'll highlight all this code between
your open function and the ending brace
for it that's highlighted I'll hit ctrl
or copy it alright and we're gonna open
a new tab all right Jason this will save
you a lot of time on some of these
challenges just from like you're getting
syntax errors and stuff like that so you
can click over here and highlight the
whole thing and then paste your code in
alright and it has these warnings and if
you mouse over the warning it will
highlight the line where the warning is
okay so it's telling you line text which
kind of does this yep yeah at 15 so it's
telling you essentially that you're
missing a curly brace yeah well let's
take a look all right so it expected a
parentheses to match right so okay well
here we go
line three you're missing a parenthesis
and all of a sudden everything went away
yeah so J again disent is a great tool
yeah that's cool
sublime yeah like I said some I'm kind
of does the same thing so yeah any any
good text editor will you can setup them
to do the same thing really
yep
please
okay so regular expression you don't
have to like it in any quotations or
anything nope /i oh yea cuz you're
escaping like characters anyway right
what do you mean well that's what the
the backslash is you're telling it that
I'm that's the that's how you declare a
reggae object yeah yeah the the other
the that's for / yeah the backslash
escapes the special characters so you
can use them to test against in a
pattern so it mostly works right there's
there's a few things that you need to do
to clean it up still yeah we don't have
it converting to upper yep with
uppercase letters so
we should check wait put all this inside
of a function inside of that and then
check to see wait get or use a function
oh yeah yeah okay so that's already a
function so turning in a new string
that's that's okay so without before we
return so we can just have the
functionality in the function but not
inside of this function there's two
functions right yes check after after
it's been returned we just run a reg X
the checks to see if it's a vowel and
that just changes the uppercase you
could do that but then you're gonna have
to iterate over the whole thing again
right oh yeah
which on the map yeah you're already
you're already iterating so is there
somewhere in here that you can perform
that calculation well there's lots of
returns all over the place so it'd have
to be at the beginning or and your else
in your else where you're assigning
everything except for the uppercase a
you could assign that to a temporary
variable and then compare that or check
to see if it's a vowel if it is return
it
uppercase okay
again the the test is going to be your
standard go to and then to uppercase
something on a string there is a there
is a method called to uppercase
if forward slashes forward slashes we
don't need to worry about the a because
that's always getting returned properly
anyway right yeah Oh case is that it
would but I I don't know
ignore me I would still put something
like that right
no don't separate them by commas sorry
it's okay little regularly first II owe
you and we're only worried about the
lower case ones because otherwise upper
case are there slash dot if if a e i o u
it what no put it put it inside your
brace for if
there you go and then go ahead and go
into your block yep
and you can just say letter string
topper no it's to uppercase oh okay
uppercase yeah it's the function they're
like a little bit different names
it's weird cuz like I know some things
but they're like not applicable at all
and so and then okay so you're doing
this to letter all right but letter is
unchanged unless it's in a because
you're assigning the value back you're
assigning that new string to temp one
yeah
and then I would just put temp 1 equals
temp 1.2 uppercase B what instead of
returning here because you're gonna have
to return this right if it's not so you
would put a what a return temp 1 down
here underneath of it
all right so instead of having two
returns you could just have it it's fine
either way it's just your your typing
out the same thing twice
oh no I no no no no sorry this is
getting me confused that's like you
still like the formatting automatically
like popping things over and stuff what
a scientist you available yeah so you're
correct so far
it's not working okay why is it not
working because you're not returning it
if it's not about yeah yeah okay no run
your code there you go
you got it okay all right so now you
need to join it down here return new
string join the empty string all right
and then run your code all right and
then make sure that it works with that
one
all right now is there a way you could
clean this up yes okay I mean I aside
from formatting so what if you just
returned up here all right what if you
just returned string dot split and then
you put dot join at the end of here and
just change the methods
like that yeah you don't even need to
make a new string yeah
and then put join right there I'll never
never hit the end of the code without
returning something awesome so well yeah
you could have done you could have done
the same thing a Reyes test here for a
or a there for you for a little Z big Z
and then there's different ways to go
about it I've seen people check and if
it's not a letter they just immediately
return that letter and if it is a letter
then they go through and do their stuff
oh so you check you yeah well you would
just add you would add not to an in
front of the regs yeah but you have a
working solution that's so yeah yeah
yeah that would make more sense because
that does the comparison in her turns
right away
okay so just different methods oh yeah
all right no worries yeah that that's
one you just did and you can compare
your code when you do a when you get a
solution I'm gonna tell you right now
most of them are trash so and there's
there's one dude who's notorious like he
tries to yeah that dude right there
click on his I want to see if he did the
same thing for this okay he didn't he
didn't minify his code before he
submitted it except except he doesn't he
doesn't properly minify it he actually
just removes all the spaces and smashes
it all together
whereas minification would actually like
shorten the variable names and stuff too
so it's yeah yeah and he's using the for
loop said don't use the for loop yeah
see that's that's how that's probably
the approach I would have taken if you
had you know suggested using the
built-in functions like I just really
want to like do it myself yeah I think
it's hard to like sort of give over to
the JavaScript village there's very
smart people somewhere they've written
these libraries and you know at the
function the prototype functions that
you can use like that's the place so you
don't have to worry about it and cause
bugs so
where you're doing like string traversal
through an array and then you'll end up
with like you you try to you know if you
miss this a number your for loop then
you're gonna like go too far by one then
you're trying to be but you know that's
okay well I had fun I appreciate it not
oh you did fine you did fine man
