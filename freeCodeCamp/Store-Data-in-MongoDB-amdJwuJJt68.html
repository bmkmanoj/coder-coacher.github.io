MongoDB MongoDB is a popular
non-relational database one of the
reasons so popular is because you can
use JavaScript to query it instead of
having to write sequel statements so
let's go ahead and start the challenge
go to cloud 9 and if you're already
signed in click dashboard and we'll just
create a new workspace the name of the
node school challenge we're going to
work through is called learn you Mongo
and we'll set nodejs is our template and
load it up and then we'll just come down
here and grab this command and we can go
ahead and install the nut school module
so an important thing to point out is
the cloud 9 already has MongoDB
installed so we don't need to do that so
let's go ahead and run learn you Mongo
and we'll just click the first challenge
and first of all they want us to create
a file called solution Jas so let's
create that so we'll go a new file
solution is we don't actually need to do
anything in solution J's for this first
challenge it just needs to be there so
we can verify the solution so what we're
going to do is first I'm going to go
ahead and show you that you can type
Mongo D - - version and it'll find that
cloud 9 already has a recent version of
MongoDB installed if you're doing this
locally on your computer you'll need to
install MongoDB but fortunately their
directions for Windows as well as Linux
and
UNIX compatible which would be a Mac so
now that we've verified that that works
we can just run the learning Mongo
verify solution yes and we passed so
next we can just run our new Mongo and
go on to the connect so here it's going
to ask us to create a data directory
which we can do with the commander
provides and we can start Mongo D with
that is the path to our data so the
important thing I want to point out
right now is whenever you run long or D
be sure to add this - - no Journal and
that is essential if you want to run
MongoDB on cloud nine so let's go ahead
and see what happens when we run this
you can see that it's running MongoDB is
up so you can go ahead and continue
working on these challenges and I wish
you look enjoy learning some MongoDB
you'll be using it a lot in the near
future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
