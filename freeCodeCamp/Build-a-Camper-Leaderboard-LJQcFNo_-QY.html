zipline we're going to build a camper
leaderboard
let's take a look at what we want to
build so this leaderboard is a table
that has the campers rank their name
profile image and then over here the
number of brownie points they've learned
in the past 30 days and the number of
brownie points they've earned over all
time the rules are don't look at the
example projects code figure it out for
yourself
fulfill the bulk of the below user
stories use whichever libraries and
api's you need and give it your own
personal style but you must use both
sets and react to build this project the
user stories are I can see a table of
the free code camp campers who've earned
the most brownie points in the past 30
days I can see how many brownie points
they've earned in the past 30 days and
how many they've earned total I can
toggle between sorting the list by how
many brownie points they've earned in
the past 30 days and by how many brownie
points they were in in total and we've
got some API links for you to get that
let's take a look again and just show
the functionality so you can see here
our ferris has as of filming the most
brownie points in the past 30 days and
if I click that we're gonna we're gonna
sort by all-time brownie points and you
see that saint peter has 1774 which is
the most all-time
brownie points and le Adam trailing a
little bit there in second and familiar
list of faces here who have contributed
the free coke camp over the past few
months as well so basically the ability
to toggle between the two is the main
functionality and this is all rendered
with react as always you should use read
search ask if you get stuck and when
you're done be sure to post this in our
code review chatroom for feedback from
your fellow campers and share it on
Twitter and on your campers
on your city's campsite on Facebook
enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
