awesome and i'm going to go ahead and
pull christian in through this so he's
on i mean i'll just keep him on the
entire time and what we can do the
slides let me show you guys them real
quick you can still see my screen uh no
we're looking at anything hey how's it
going Chris can you hear us brick can
you hear Nathan Nathan can you say
something Chris how you doin man you
don't hear him okay but we don't hear
that's one of the reasons it's going to
be weird but yeah I can't hear him
ladder how long would that take you to
do yeah yeah why don't you reboot to
windows and can you still demo Kopernik
in windows I think you can
stream should be up great let me see it
says shrink crashed ? don't think so
bring video live okay um hey Nathan do
you have skype installed yeah you might
we might want to get Christian to you
might want to call Nathan directly then
because that way the sound should be
picked up by his thing but if Nathan
can't hear at our streamers are the
people who are viewing our stream won't
be able to hear it so why don't we try
to do that Nathan if if you could open
up skype i'll send you Chris's skype
name and Chris just hang tight and wait
for a call from Nathan or a contact
request from Nathan yeah what's his name
I'm going to send it to you just a
second oh you'll get a call from us in
just a moment like at that I've
apparently 150 thousand dollars any nine
nations poverty eradication program and
I have a seat we shall website Wow there
to the United Nations is choosing to
focus it's uh it's money on you all
people that's it's amazing education
yeah you go with the luxury apartment in
Seoul I don't have a luxury permanent
cell now now hold on most accepted
so we're going to have people on this
stream now from the us-korea Mexico we
should we should just call up the Copa
next a folder in Indonesia hey hey Chris
how are you man defends awesome um guys
on the on the stream can you guys hear
Chris okay
somebody has stream crashed okay the
screen extreme hazard crash Chris
Hutchison also is going to is Chris kin
to them or something as well I don't
know Chris Hutchison ok everyone is
streams saying oh they can hit it's moot
they can hear Chris but we cannot hear
Chris so um when I say Chris I'll say
Christian barrows there's a lot of
Chris's we can't hear them me and
Michael can't hear ya but there's
nothing we can really do about it so
you're going to be the liaison to talk
to him want to read to what to really
get an early age so like or do you know
if you want if if you if you can reboot
into windows and come in the screen hero
pretty quickly that may be superior to
skype it's up to you ok it's always what
I can complete a queasy to see say I'm
gonna give you we have to work on
windows ok ok yeah whichever is easier
for you man Adam I'm okay with this so I
don't even know if I can share screen
through linux so let's start by trying
this ok
all right I see your screen Chris
fine nice
didn't see my screen brighter yes yeah
oh don't call me sir I work for a living
men
yeah I can see your screen everything
looks good
somebody fun text editor you have there
okay well if you can share my screen
Nathan we can go ahead and get started
okay so Chris we're going to turn over
to Quincy real quick and then we'll come
back and demo your stuff okay okay okay
just hang out on the line and watch the
string yeah points to go ahead and start
sharing your screen
hey a good morning / afternoon / evening
campers I'm Quincy and I'm here in San
Francisco and I just want to quickly
introduce the people that are going to
be on the stream before I get started
Nathan carrot kilobyte is hosting and
he's basting look in Seoul Korea and
he's going to be talking a little bit
about the technology today and Michael
Johnson is based in Washington DC AKA
code nonprofit and he's our nonprofit
coordinator and he'll be talking about
that a little bit and then we'll have
some demonstrations of some of the
things we've built at the end of this
i'm going to go ahead it started i can
remember how to play slideshow okay so
this is our first ever camp wide meeting
and I really appreciate you guys coming
feel free to ask any questions you want
in the chat but I'm just going to
basically talk for the next eight or six
eight or nine minutes and we'll get to
will definitely go through and get to
your questions toward the end of this so
the agenda is I'm going to talk about
our new challenges that nathan is going
to talk about our updated point system
michael is going to talk about our
nonprofit projects and then we have some
demos so currently we have about 100
hours of challenges and these are
challenges from all over the Internet we
have Stanford courses we have courses
from General Assembly dash and code
school and code Academy and these are
these are okay I mean they're the best
that the Internet has to offer in my
opinion that's why we chose them to be
our challenges but they're not
necessarily the best that could be so we
are trying to create our own challenges
previously we had about 100 hours of
challenges and then the assumption was
the other nine hundred hours of
instruction
would be experiential learning
completing projects for nonprofits
however we think that there may now be a
better approach that better prepares our
campers for our nonprofit projects and
that would involve 100 hours of
waypoints which is what we're going to
be calling our new our old challenges
and then about 100 hours of bonfire
challenges zipline challenges and base
jump challenges and I'm going to get
into what those are in just a moment
followed by about eight hundred hours of
nonprofit projects now at this point
we've had some campers complete
nonprofit projects but we haven't
actually had a camper who's completed
several consecutive nonprofit projects
and gotten a job yet so we're only five
months in we haven't yet fully learned
exactly what this workflow is going to
be like for people but generally boot
camps and other like masters and
computer science programs and stuff
generally tend to be about a thousand
hours of instruction so we're shooting
for about a thousand hours so first I
want to talk about waypoints our current
challenges are mostly video based and a
video gives you some links and you
follow those links and you go create an
account and an external page well we
have a vision for something where you
don't even need to leave free code camp
basically we're planning to gradually
replace our existing challenges with our
own interactive lessons called waypoints
they're going to be short one to two
minutes each and you'll do exactly one
thing in them for example if a waypoint
says to create a P tag with the text cat
photo lab then you would just create
that P tag within a text editor and once
it the tests realize that you've
completed that you've created that P tag
it would just kick you to the next
challenge and you'd create you
an image for example so basically you're
going to be doing things step by step
and each step will take about one to two
minutes each of these will be a waypoint
and we're going to have them be fully
interactive there won't be any videos
there will just be in editor coding the
reason we're choosing to do fully
interactive as opposed to videos is
because we think that people can get
into a flow state where they're just
rapidly learning and moving forward
without having to stop and watch videos
videos actually aren't that popular with
people in general a lot of campers just
dive right in and like follow the
instructions and we try to give details
instructions so you don't even have to
watch the videos that people want to on
our current challenges but this isn't
just us Khan Academy and a lot of other
providers have started to realize that
videos are kind of old school and nobody
wants to watch people talk like you guys
are doing right now then they want to
actually do stuff so we'll have those
short interactive challenges and they'll
cover everything from basic HTML all the
way up to advanced JavaScript we're
thinking design patterns functional
programming you can cover a lot in a
hundred hours if you are moving rapid
fire and if you know exactly what you
want to teach and you teach you well and
so because it's a hundred hours you do
the math two minutes that's going to be
about 3,000 individual lessons so this
is going to be a massive amount of
effort that's going into building these
and we're going to staged rollout them
so the first things will do will replace
the General Assembly dash courses with
waypoints on HTML and CSS for example
next let's talk about bonfires Nathan
who's going to talk in a moment was
instrumental in helping build the
infrastructure that allows us to have
these bonfires we originally built them
because we were unsatisfied with code
pen and code Wars and a lot of the other
tools out there which are which are good
in their own right but weren't exactly
what our campers needed which was
straightforward and fast without any
sort of comp
and purely focused on JavaScript
development so our fast-paced JavaScript
algorithm challenges bonfires are not
going to change but we're trying to
build more of them and especially the
medium too difficult range and we would
love it if anyone watching any of our
campers would like to contribute these
it's a great way to get some practice
both writing JavaScript and writing
tests for JavaScript and it will be a
great first step for you to become a
contributor to the free code camp open
source project and if you want some
information about how to do that please
PM me or Nathan and we would love to
show you how to do that it's basically
you just need to change a single JSON
file and you can you can build bonfires
that way and you can test them locally
and everything next let's talk about zip
lines zip lines are a new form of
challenge that are focused around doing
front-end development so we're going to
use code pen if you haven't used code
pin before it's a great editor where you
can basically put your HTML your CSS and
your JavaScript and instantly see what
happens with it and how how it will
render and so the zip lines are
basically HTML CSS and JavaScript based
challenges but they're not pure
front-end challenges we actually want
you to work with real data so we're
going to be basically giving you data
from an API in JSON format and then your
job will to be will be to parse that
data properly and beautifully render it
and that's where the artistry of HTML
and CSS will come into play is you'll
want to render these data in a good way
you know like something like how does
Twitter render the data that is the
tweets well they put a lot of time and
energy into hierarchy and white space
and fonts and colors and you can do the
same and there will be dozens of these
to choose from but you'll probably only
need to complete 10 or so then we
haven't decided on an exact number but
we're going to we're going to see
and fill it up again our emphasis is
both on aesthetics and on quickly taking
data from a from an API and rendering it
in a visually compelling way so this
this will flex a lot of muscles and this
is a great step building single page
applications in code pen is a great step
toward doing full stack application
development with base jumps so base
jumps are going to be the last challenge
and they will prepare you to actually
build full sack solutions for nonprofits
and we wanted to gradually ramp up
toward this rather than just drop you in
and we have good news we've managed to
get all of this working in cloud nine
which is a web-based integrated
development environment IDE so you don't
need to worry about installing linux or
installing get or installing the mean
stack or getting the sea libraries in
place so we can run everything you don't
need to worry about like screwing up
your hard disk and doing a bunch of
Linux commands like basically you can do
everything right in your browser on a
controlled online instant it's quite
powerful and I spent the last day or two
playing around with it and getting it to
do interesting things and you can even
deploy directly from cloud nine to
Heroku so the code never needs to even
touch your local machine you could be
using Windows you could be using a
freaking surface and you still be able
to code you wouldn't have to worry about
what your local file system looks like
at all you can do it on the work
computer so there are a lot of benefits
to doing everything in the browser also
cloud 9 has built in collaboration tools
which are really powerful so the base
jumps are going to involve you building
full crud applications which are
basically the backbone of web
development employment these days
everybody needs you know a CRM system or
some sort of integration where they can
quickly go in and create invoices and
update them and delete them so
you'll get a lot of practice building
these types of systems with both express
Jays in angularjs where you can build
some more sophisticated views and mean
Jas is a wonderful rollout for that so
with that I'd like to hand it over to
Nathan to talk about our new point
system alright thanks Quincy I'm going
to switch over to my screen here so
we've already as you wanted you have X
improvements UI improvements well one of
the first things we did was we had to
overhaul our entire point system in
order to bring a lot of stuff online
it's mostly transparent to you guys but
in structuring everything to work with
the new course wearers and the new
challenge in general there were a lot of
changes went into the back as well as
the front so the first thing that you
guys will notice is when we push this
live you will see on everyone's profile
a like a github type street map and we
calculate your longest streak and the
current streak that you're on I happen
to be on three each just because I had
dummy data loaded in here the next thing
is that when you complete a challenge
you will see that the points
automatically go up we've also heard
your cries and pleased that points get
reset when you switch between bonfires
and courses that no longer happens
anymore if I were to go back to I don't
want to I don't want to give any answers
away but so completing this one had I
not completed this I would have gotten a
point so there's no longer duplicated
points for completing the same
challenges the other thing is we've tied
news integration a little more so
submitting a story
to camp renews will award you a point as
well and if you receive an upvote to one
of your stories you will also receive a
point for that and all this will
transfer back into your heat map as you
can see I'm starting to get more items
added from everything so the last thing
we've already you we have all right I we
promised that it was coming and here it
is you guys there is a list of bonfires
that you can see and you can jump around
you could complete this one and if you
click on next bonfire will take you back
to what it your next mon fire in this
list and that is the point system in
short wonderful thank you very much
Nathan now I'd like to hand things over
to Michael Johnson if you could share my
screen again I'm going to show this
slide while Michael Johnson talks
briefly Michael I guess so I'd like to
begin by thanking all of the campers who
are contributing to our ongoing
nonprofit projects we're about to begin
our twelfth project so far this year and
in fact last week was our first
delivered project in three code camp
history which was a Chrome extension to
benefit the copper Nick wonder woman's
initiative in rural Indonesia so co
predicts supplies life changing
technologies such as water filters
stoves and solar powered lights to
villages throughout the country and so
for koper net campers chris barrios and
alex black jr. faced the challenge of
not only replacing their paper receipts
from these sales with electronic forms
but also the challenge of working with
end users who have unreliable internet
connections for uploading these data
from their villages and using the skills
and Alex developed a free code camp they
built an extension that blew away the co
panic team and that will make a real
impact on the copra neck project so that
gave us our first real success story of
what can happen when motivated
developers are connected with
organizations and meet so huge huge
virtual round of applause is in order
for Chris and Alex for cutting the
ribbon so to speak yes ok on what is the
first of many many success stories to
come the only other thing I'd like to
add is excuse me I'd like to remind you
all that free code camp doesn't have an
advertising budget we don't advertise
people only hear about free code camp if
you tell them about it so please retweet
the things we share please tell the
world we do pro bono work please tell
everybody you know we want to keep
enough new projects coming in to give
all campers who finish their challenges
based job ziplines a chance to donate
their time and new skills so to close up
thank you all for being a part of FCC
and coding for a cause and with that I
think once he and the team want to give
Kris Perry us a chance to tell you
firsthand about his experiences with the
copra net project Chris if if you're
ready to present go ahead and share your
spring
hey can you hear me I can't hear you how
are you hi thanks hey I'll start again I
I didn't have it church so I keep up
with its train since my connection is
not very good yes okay well we'll make
do
okay so you turn 18
okay I can see your Trello board and I
saw that copra Nick app for a second
there yeah and I didn't wanted to show
the what the starting point for our
project
the starting point for the project so
what you were given to work out finition
yeah yeah okay and like right so he even
got the feed stream open so don't i
don't know if i'm asleep mmm i think
we're still streaming you might want to
close the the free coke at the the
twitch tab while you're where you're
trying to stream just in case
ok
okay is he the phone yep I see I see a
receipt number and some some areas to
collect data yeah but this one is
currently filled up by khabarakh agents
which are just regular women from
Indonesia a it a cell technology to
their community some are a lot of
leaders in Indian brutal pop metal type
of their communities so they sell things
like stoves and water filter and and
this week's are really real hope so
probably Week's happening before this
cell battery seeds of what they sell to
Kaepernick and get back more stock or
that were missing when a at the time
that with that they settle down so it's
a political process for for the
organization also sings sista sista
there are remote places and there's no
there's no power there is a form of
Maine system a many of this of the 36
gets lost along the way so the vodka
tonic one is to make this a detail so
they can submit this forms as soon as
possible and improve the way they handle
their inventory sales and and also the
tracking of the crucial data for from
the customers
and AIDS okay so it's gonna help people
and then going out there is what what
yeah it's going to intersect people
antibodies so one of the limitations of
what we were told to do is the people
see the software or application will I
don't have a former a computer
experience or any computer experience so
the challenge was making this the most
familiar to them so they felt like they
were purchased trust transpass with data
from one one place to chew the job and
don't get look don't get lost along the
way so the format was was asked to be as
similar as possible to what they see on
the form ok ok so the solver well the
first challenge was choosing add knology
on how to approach this because the
other big requirement and maybe the real
challenge of the app was that they most
of the times they don't have an internet
internet connection and they only have
sporadically connection and maybe once a
week or once every two weeks is so the
data has to be stored locally and and
sent as soon as as they have connection
and that may happen at any time so we
started by choosing the available
possibilities first we we try to make it
using a local storage for which is the
which can be hung across any browser but
the problem with that is the rule
requires a server so if you if you use a
a something like this for example a
using this format the local search God's
at war since it's bound to a domain and
so using just plain HTML for dissolution
was discarded but we came across we're
using a Chrome extension and well this
is the the final result of the form you
can compare it with what was us and 10
mins whisper whisper on we what it was
being required because chrome extension
i can has his own storage a local
storage which is similar to to the
standard but can work offline so that's
how we went and we chose the province
nation as or deployment platform it also
has many benefits such as a automatic
updates so this way it can be automated
a upgraded without the intervention of
the of the user and that has many
benefits as us updating a nap usually is
done either on the server side or doing
manual updates and since the users a
maybe they won't be even installing the
app themselves that would be harder and
this way each it's very straightforward
well it looks great Chris you now it's
dead did a really good job how did how
did your interaction with the nonprofit
stakeholder girl yeah well our
stakeholder was amber from Kaepernick
and I think we we got very lucky scenes
for starters she saw I would develop
with the better also we
maybe 15 years of experience and so she
really knew what wasn't working when we
went the work box and and also they
should she was pretty clear he giving us
the requirements or or new features to
be fixed as she already knew were
specifically k specifically within the
app was was the thing that we need that
big update about disability also there
were some quirks like for example in
putting a price reduced some automatic
stuff here and we have some problems
with this field for example that we
didn't catch when we were working at it
but she was really really quick on
finding each little disability problem
or or potential problem and helping us
fixing that because yet again she has a
much experience doing other kind of work
projects before this and that's that's
awesome how many how much time would you
say you spent on you and Alex well i'm
not sure i think the the break
destination of 100 hours of work a this
is close to 1 we spent a hunch on the
screen coding but the break extended a
bit because there are always something
stuff that made you stop a few days and
then continue my pair Alex he got really
sick and that was was pretty bad because
it had us all worried he had pneumonia
and that set us back a week but of
course that kind of things can happen
and it's not his fault so that that set
us back a week and also a at some point
they didn't they wanted to add some
other feeders or check out if there were
something missing
and that set us back another week so I'm
not sure about the real holding hours
but i think that the estimation of
giving it only 100 hours is it's okay
for the level of of what is expected
format for a beginner camper like us for
a people the adversity that that is just
starting with web development and along
the way it has to learn many things no
not just what's on the curriculum and so
that's sums up more hours than maybe a
senior developer getting doing the same
thing okay and is so this is ready for
delivery when have you delivered it or
when do you deliver it yeah well a wee
this as it is right now is already
working a the only we already tested the
the database sent to to the database
which is custom unknown but up we check
that that the data is being stored on
the MongoDB but also is sent to decline
as csv files automatically and and and
that's all really tested so the app is
working what's only missing are some
details by translating the this fails to
indonesia that we have the translation
so we have to deliver today the the
fruit translated version and maybe a
drain the amber or and transfer all the
accounts which is the closing of the
project but this as a serious right now
is working and it's not giving any
errors so that's why we said it's it's
finished that's of course I yeah of
course that this may have a changes in
the future because well you may want to
add another field or or change something
in the process or maybe
add another validation and we'd be happy
to keep working with Amber if she
requires an update so she has or all of
our best intentions in keep working with
them and keep helping a as much as we
can that's really good and it looks good
so before we end the call what was the
biggest piece of advice you would give
new campers that have finished the
curriculum and are getting ready to
start their first nonprofit I excited
they might my biggest advice is a ask as
much as possible don't be afraid of
asking and priming the chat if you don't
get a CSS right if you don't know which
are architecture will be the best or if
you had a bag in the API or want a code
review because not asking will set you
back and if you're learning it's better
to ask a and the worst that could happen
is that that the the people on the chat
will tell you well Google depth but but
its birth to do it then they're not do
it all right thank you Chris I'm connect
more with like Crisco I have a couple
questions from our viewers what's a
Christmas ah and unfortunately I can't
actually hear what Chris is saying I'm
looking forward to watching the video
afterward I'm just gonna message these
to you Nathan and you can ask him
directly yep I have some questions for
you Chris from our viewers so all right
um what linux distro are you using i'm
using this book called a enlightenment
mom this is body body body knows which
is based on buh-buh-bah ross on the in
life
which is very Milicic and pretty fast
and it like it a lot because of that
since my laptop is kind of all but it
runs very very snappy on this district
compared to loaded I can revise a much
more hard hardest to do to join in stock
alright the next question is do you have
some kind of analytics for this
extension is that even possible and they
presume it would be useful if so a well
one of the restrictions of the spread is
that the since it will run on a mobile
connection you want to use the the back
the internet as as less as possible so
the only connection from from the app to
the network is just thinking the data
server every every minute so you know
that you're online and sending the phone
data a I think analytics is trigger of
course you could just add the JavaScript
for let's say Google or another tracking
and in your cell but we don't have
analytics installed right now ok max
would like to know how are the extension
for Kaepernick be distributed we will it
be distributed to google apps or just
the USB Drive that's a really the choice
of the of the Gulf copernic because of
course making it public well it doesn't
have any impact really because there's
no sensible data inside the app it hits
an API but we
hey we made it so it uses an an epic e
the install when you install the de
station is so hitting the API we dump
data or external data we won't have any
impact on the database and but I don't
have it yet on a chrome app store until
a umber decides if it's going to be it's
going to be there or it's going to be
installed in manually that's really the
choice of the stakeholder and the only
we have to do to make it work we go
master is editing or manifest Jason we
put is the configuration for the
extension and add the URL on on the week
on which we it will be installed and
some extra parameters required for
uploading to the app store it's not
really difficult just a maybe three
lines of them all right and and on that
how many lines of code did you write for
this between you and your partner I
think I think the loan is and the
longest was getting well the HTML right
it's kind of extensive say because every
single box is its crystalline size debt
and functionality so some some aspects
of the app couldn't be making make more
dry we have to repeat some stuff along
or break any but the descripton it's not
too too extensive here the or
main up now this is the the interface up
is 300 the storage we handled the disk
storage the list is on the 59th the
bathroom which happens the network of
the app it is 100 lines so we think it
adds up to four hundred lines which is
not too much also the CSS of course is
its pretty long the as I said takes
Internet is a a lot of for time to
getting the firm ripe which is six
families yeah 650 650 lines and on the
other side it there's the back end which
is a much smaller I think it's a Express
up using a classic GTO crime writer and
it only has one controller for the API
we just you can see a 1230 no yeah it's
turtle eyes the the witch hunters the
API and those person to csv the it's any
lines so the backing is very deep and
very small or three it's what you need I
don't think we need be since it can
handle errors it can come to us it'll
come to a ticket that it's receiving
data and storing it on our database all
right looks good Chris thank you very
much for your answers and thanks for
taking the time to show us around the
app you look wonderful and we have a
just a few more questions from the
audience we'd like to answer before we
close up the meeting first of all my
Clarice toe with us by the way i am i'm
here wonderful um we had a question from
a dead sastre who asked currently
there's a gap between
track completion and starting a project
like kind of a wall between finishing
all the challenges and actually starting
a non-profit project which I think was a
question or perhaps we can explain why
that is sure yeah so um I'll just speak
on it because I didn't really get a
question out of that but we we we turned
down probably eighty percent of the
applications that come in for various
reasons we really want to ensure that
the projects will be useful in a campus
portfolio and that the stakeholders will
be working with can meet our
expectations and as such and in
combination with the fact that we don't
advertise outside of social media there
there have been there's been a slowdown
in nonprofits applying for projects and
that's obviously a huge frustration in
my job knowing that there are tens of
thousands of nonprofit organizations out
there who don't know that we could help
them so a huge part of what we need to
do is better educate nonprofits in ways
that we can help and so what we've been
doing is a Quincy and I have changed the
onboarding process and we're about ready
to roll this out to better qualify
nonprofits who are coming to our site
and we got feedback from a stakeholder
who said you know when I go to your site
if I was learning to code I would
completely understand what you do but as
an as an organization I don't quite see
how you help us so we're changing
everything that deals with how an
organization applies for a project to
just better educate them on the things
that we can do the things we've done
stuff like that obviously all of this is
with the goal of getting every camper
who finishes their challenges a project
to work on and so
oh you know we are hugely grateful when
you stick around and are involved in the
community and we're always trying to get
you on a project as quickly as possible
I think it will help that you know some
campers have done they've taken the
initiative and created a camper practice
projects channel and they're in there
working on real things we've given them
a few things that we'd like to see built
when it comes to i use world time buddy
calm and when to meet calm to organize
all of our projects and it would be nice
if something existed that you know
combine those things so campers have
taken the initiative and they're
building that and nothing is stopping
you from from building things while you
wait for a non-profit project and i
think the zipline the new zip line
challenges will only let you practice
even more and be more prepared when it
is time to build something for an
organization so thank you again for your
patience and i would just say that we're
doing our best to get our name out there
and get some projects lined up for y'all
great thank you Michael a follow-up
question chill train asks how is
maintenance of these projects handled
after a handoff yeah so uh maintenance I
mean its case by case basically really
depends what you build but you just want
to keep in mind that your motivation for
building these projects is to have it in
your portfolio so you would never want
it to fall out of use or outdated as
long as you're you know saying that you
built this project so I think some
maintenance is to be expected it's
really just in how you build it up fun
another thing I'd like to add is some of
the nonprofit's may offer you some sort
of maintenance contract or you can
continue to do pro bono work for them
but but we are very hands-off basically
after after the project is done that's
really between you and the nonprofit
stakeholder how you guys progress
and we want to give our campers full
autonomy and continuing that project you
know if it's something that could be
open source for example that's a
discussion you guys can have our our
sole goal is to make sure that you have
a good experience building the project
for the nonprofit and that you have as
Michael said a solid portfolio project
all of this being with the goal of you
getting either an entry level software
engineering job as a web developer or
pivoting your current career in a more
technical direction and being able to
get a pivot job another question we got
also from dad's aster is can we see the
other solutions once we've completed
challenges I think he's referring to the
bonfires and Nathan you want to talk
about that yeah um that actually is
planned functionality the little bit of
a back story a little bit a little bit
of lower if you will we got really
gung-ho about switching everything over
to react well it turns out that it's a
Herculean effort because it's an entire
code based rewrite which is generally
something you shouldn't do but the
benefits outweigh the risk which there
really is in a lot of risk were so we're
still progressing so we revived a branch
where we were doing a lot of the
improvements that are going to be
released imminently um the the ability
to compare yours against somebody else's
or just browse someone else's in general
will be available the functionality will
be when you go to their profile you will
be able to see a link to their completed
bonfires and you will only be able to
see bonfires that you yourself have
completed excellent
great answer and we have one more
question also from Alex Alexander I
don't know how to pronounce your entire
name uh no offense but Alexander he's a
he's a regular and in both our chat
rooms and on our twitch stream and we
really appreciate him also post a lot on
camper news so it's always a pleasure to
see Alexander what you post on camper
news and discuss it and camper news by
the way is a very alive initiative we're
going to continue to improve it we're
going to somebody mention like they'd
like to be able to delete comments that
they made or at least edit them
currently that functional honey isn't
supported but obviously that's something
we plan to integrate we also plan to
create email notification so there's
somebody responds to your comment you'll
get an email so you'll know that you can
go back and respond to them otherwise
the only way you'd know is if you
visited that page again to see if
anybody responded which isn't a very
good user experience so as you guys can
tell there are like a million different
initiatives that we're juggling here and
the development team really is just me
and Nathan and Berkeley who's also here
in San Francisco he's my close friend
and we also have a lot of other
contributors who I want to recognize
right now there's a guy named Christian
who comes on our twist channel a lot
he's been contributing a lot Nathan who
else has been helping a lot James uh mr.
Renner we it's been getting good well
here I will give us a look at how we
actually manage free code camp some
people may be interested in the actual
administration of an open source project
so this is what we see when we come in
and we can look here and see pretty much
holistic contributors so if I go into
this and I want onto a sign at someone
here's who we have that are contributors
or that have contributed um so
Christian is on there Quincy myself
Michael Berkeley Burnett brandon has
contributed a lot of our bonfires um see
James he he had to take a leave but he
helped contribute quite a bit and yet uh
sir charles are our neck neck beard
meteor dev victor and of course victor
yeah here's come on our our stream as
well yes so if and if you guys are
hanging out in our stream and you guys
start pointing out useful things or what
not we can always pull you in on screen
hero and you can basically be part of
the stream and when you're in screen
hero we can share your screen so
essentially you can stream through us
through free code camps channel so we're
all about giving you guys credit for
anything you do as you probably have
guessed free code camps a fully
volunteer effort so really our currency
is not money because there's no money to
be had at this point although we are
eventually confident that we'll be able
to make money by helping campers get
jobs basically recruitment fees which is
is not charged to the camper obviously
it's charged to you know the big
corporation that needs javascript
developer they're routinely paying
twelve to thirty three percent of a
first year salary so once we have money
for that we can actually have a paid
staff and potentially spend money on
things like publicizing ourselves to
nonprofits so we can have more and
better nonprofit projects but in the
meantime our currency is credit for
having written commits for having
managed projects like michael johnson's
doing for having come up with bonfires
and created course where those are all
things that we are actively seeking help
with and if anyone out there is
interested in contributing to that we
would love to bring you on board
and ramp you up to speed so you can
succeed in creating those content in
fact later today I think I'm going to
scream while nathan is getting some
much-needed sleep he's in Korea and I
think it's 1am there I'm going to be
continuing to build our new nonprofit
onboarding flow but I may also stream
some of like me building bonfires just
so you guys can see how easy it is to
build bonfires with our infrastructure
we designed everything to maximize the
ease of building bonfires and you only
need to touch one file and it you can do
it pretty easily I think we can even do
it in cloud nine and just to show you
how easy it is so unless there are any
further questions or Michael or Nathan
if either you want to say anything
further I think we're getting close to
the end of the hour yeah someone asked
how close the zip lines and BASE jumps
already coming online so what you see
here in the left-hand pane is a view
that is ready to accept controller
action here is a controller ready to
accept JSON interaction and we have JSON
over here now it's simply a matter of
wiring everything up so it pipes in
properly and you guys will soon be
starting the new adventure in code camp
yeah and I would just like to add Jason
who's in Seattle has done a great job
managing our twitch feed and it turns
out that you know watching people code
and streaming what you're working on is
a huge recruitment tool for campers for
new campers so what Jason wants us to
all know is that if you're a camper
who's working on a non-profit project
and you'd like to stream when you're
working on it while you're pairing or
just um I would say even to show your
progress for the week team up with Jason
he's Jason Oh fie on in Gator and on
twitch and he'll get you set up
the more we scream the better i mean we
want it going 24seven ideally and with
campers all over the world it's possible
so yeah but that's that's about it i
think this community's grown incredibly
fast and it's changed so much since
November and all in good ways so keep
doing what you're doing and I look
forward to working with all of you on
nonprofit projects in the future thank
you very much Michael um well um
Nathan's gonna get some sleep I'm gonna
get some sleep and we're gonna be bright
back here on twitch and maybe four hours
or so I'll start up the stream again and
if you guys would like to watch some
more please do my parting advice to
everyone is keep coding code every day
and don't thrash if you have trouble
reach out to friends go to the help room
on free code camp and just keep that
forward momentum because as long as you
keep coding every single day and as long
as you keep that forward momentum you
guys will be able to get great coding
jobs that are out there and you will be
able to have really creative exciting
careers and that's our wish for all of
you alright thanks everyone for watching
pending any questions I think think I I
personally it is two in the morning here
so I'm going to have to bring everything
offline alright if you guys haven't
already followed us on Twitter and
you'll get notifications whenever our
streams come on follow us on twitter too
yeah follow us on twitter at free code
camp we'd love to have you help us
spread the word and we'll tweet a lot of
interesting stuff that's specifically
relevant to JavaScript development and
and those kinds of jobs all right
everybody will see you in dinner all
right so you got
get her thanks take our guys have a good
night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
