applications using Express Jas Express
Jas is a very popular nodejs module that
will basically serve as a web
development framework so first things
first let's go back to cloud nine at i/o
go to our dashboard and we can either
create a new app or just use an existing
application that we used on a previous
challenge and we're gonna go ahead and
run this command to install Express
Works which is a node school expressjs
challenge so I want to thank mikaël
retic for doing a lot of the quality
assurance on these node school courses
and making sure that we can run
everything in cloud 9 he had to fork
some of them and tweak them a little bit
in order to get them to run properly in
cloud 9 but it's definitely worth it to
not have to install all these things on
your local system in order to be able to
work through these challenges so now
that we have it installed we can just
run Express Works and you'll see this
familiar interface and we can hit enter
to start the hello word HelloWorld
challenge so basically what they want is
for us to output the text hello world
whenever somebody goes to home to slash
home that path so we can first create a
program j/s file
then we can copy this code right here
and open up program vis and at this
point will basically be able to specify
a path and you guys may be wondering
what a path is this slash is just the
path from the domain so if you go to
google.com the route path is just slash
like google.com slash and that's what
you get when you go to google.com but if
you wanted to go to like google.com
slash mail then that will redirect you
to Gmail so here we're just going to use
the slash home path and normally nodejs
apps are configured to listen on port
3000 that's all this is is a app dot
listen in a port number for example the
port for HTTP is port 80 but here we're
just going to listen to whatever port
node school asks us to and what we can
do is we can use this syntax which will
basically just say whatever port you
give us will listen on that and that RV
all that does is basically look at the
additional arguments that are run after
a program so for example down here we
see Express works verify program j/s
these are additional arguments that are
picked up by the arc V so our v2 would
be program Jas all right so let's go
ahead and see if we can save this and
run it and the way we run things in
Express works is Express works verify
and then we attach the file name which
is a little different from the other
ones
let's run that and it worked it passed
so the expected output was hello world
and the actual output was hello world so
at this point we can just run Express
works again and keep moving through
these quick Express Jas tutorials</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
