everything so for example if array
contains 10 4 5 to 4 the output should
be four there is more than one mode
return the one that appeared in the
array first and if there's no mode
return one this is almost the exact same
thing as the last challenge so look for
patterns guys look for patterns in the
problems and in code um so if he were to
back out and copy the code from the last
solution and paste it in here it would
we could remove some stuff that we don't
need that was letter specific and
literally do the same thing which is we
can sort these and then we can compare
each one against each other create a
group yeah this is actually going to be
a lot simpler because instead of having
a nested loop we're just going to have
one simple loop after we sort them yeah
so we're going to need two variables
we're going to need count and then a
variable that actually signifies the
number so like you know mode mode num
would be a decent variable name mode
would we want the index because we can
just return it from the array I don't
even think you need to at that point I
mean you can just actually put the
number in there
and actually before we even get down
here yep okay so real quick you can keep
typing but so real quick explanation
about this return a minus B if you read
the documentation on the sort function
if you do not provide it a callback
function it will sort them according to
their Unicode value so for numbers we
have to provide a callback function and
if the number is negative it means a was
smaller than B if the number is positive
it means a was bigger than B and if the
number is zero it means a equal B and no
position change will occur between those
two elements we can shorthand that
instead of doing an if and else if and
then finally an else statement by just
returning a minus B if a is smaller than
B will return negative if bees or if a
is larger than B it's going to be
positive if they're the same it'll
return 0 actually we're going to need
another what I was thinking we're going
to need another Hyatt highest variable
here because how do we know whether this
count is greater than the count that we
got for the last mode true true so in
that case count greater than the highest
count highest
count well yep okay so it's important
here because we're using a accounting
variable here like I knew when I was new
to programming I would constantly forget
to reset some kind of state variable 20
if you forget to reset that you'll get
the wrong answer all the time I i
wouldn't even that you can do that yes
that's all right I was just going to say
rather than have all that you could
actually do num equals whatever but yeah
you're doing that's right and we should
now remember we need to account for
negative 1 so if there's no mode well
okay we need a different value to
initialize this width why because what
if the mode is zero okay it would if the
mode is zero then that means it's false
in a true/false scenario right in a
conditional check with zero is false and
any other number is true so you can
return mode num so if modem was zero
then we would turn negative one right
otherwise just returned modem
oh because it's being sorted by sorting
that array equals a race sort yeah but
if it was sorting it I would expect to
not negative one yeah so actually we
shouldn't even well they've got to be
sorted they've got to be grouped
together does sort modify the original
array yeah I think it yeah it sorts it
in place yep yes I ya see length nice
one i plus plus if the element is equal
to the element next to it increment the
count yep so we keep doing that until we
hit a different number if the count is
greater than the highest count 0 because
this returning yeah it's uh so it was
array I so array I in that particular
case should be five so mounam if return
window oh so mundum is actually true at
that point so we should return mode num
otherwise negative one
so but now we need to not sort it and
then keep track of but that's that's
going to break this down here yep so
what I would do right is something like
this all right so let's go ahead and
just do so ver num num count and we'll
call it an empty array right yeah okay
and then in that you can push the well
we might need an object for this so okay
so the the key being the number itself
and then the value for that property
would be the count for that number yeah
and then we just pull the one with the
highest right and we need to keep track
of where it appeared yeah because like
in this example in the description the
five should be returned because it
appeared first exactly so we can do that
it's very easy
where is my mouse okay okay so instead
of an array have an object
oh you know what actually we don't we
don't need to keep track of where it was
in the array because if you push them in
in order right and you sort them based
off their frequency by pushing them in
in order if to we're the same the first
one is still going to be at a lower
index so you can just return the lowest
index out of that does that make sense
yeah that makes sense but we need to get
rid of this sorting here yeah okay so
and then we can just get rid of that
logic because well keep it on the
clipboard one might want it for later
yeah
okay so i don't think we need a railing
minus one anymore no so ya num count
push step push yeah because of objects
well it's an array we want an array of
objects right okay I thought you wanted
one okay that makes sense I but we need
to check if it already exists right well
you can do it you can do it with an
array or you can do it 1 overall object
whichever one whichever method you want
to do I think doing at an overall object
is going to be easier okay so then you
can just do yet num count yep test is
test if it exists I well I wouldn't do
that because we can just assign it right
there right so instead of using the or
which is essentially doing it's making
them count I a conditional if it exists
then if it does exist then add on the
new
because this is going to return
undefined yeah yeah that's right well
okay yep and then let's return that and
just make sure we're getting what we
expect so we should see 5222 11 or so
you have 0 0 10 20 30 40 yep I know what
it did wrong I didn't erri yep
so that's still wrong right because
there otherwise if it exists Oh
so what shouldn't have to do this but I
just want to see if that makes a
difference yep oh yeah I get it now
because we're storing zero in there and
if this is evaluating to false yes
exactly we ran into that the last time
we did this on the other the other
challenge we did remember mm-hmm so we
had to set this to one we set it to one
and then we subtracted one from all of
them yep at the end yep want to do that
again or do you want to sleep on defined
in there let's leave on the fun because
it might be a little more clear the
viewers so okay so what happened here is
what this is saying is this equals and
we're actually doing a conditional check
if this exists then we are just
incrementing its value by one otherwise
setting it to 0 without that does not
equal undefined what that is is an
implicit check that value is always
going to return to zero because it was
assigned 0 if it didn't exist if hit 0 0
is also false in programming so it was
defaulting back in giving itself a value
of zero so we could have added 1 and
then plus 1 and it would have worked and
we would have subtracted one later from
all of the values or we can just do it
does not equal undefined because then
it's actually explicitly checking zero
is type of number it is not type of
undefined not to mention that by having
an explicit check for undefined in here
the overall algorithm is going to be
less computationally expensive because
we don't have to have a loop at the
bottom to subtract one from each of
these that we've initialized
alright so keep hammering down we can
see what we have now okay now we just
have to sort these by the frequency
right so we can do a four aab right step
4 Raj okay well
how is this gonna help us okay so give
me a favor well you'll see how it'll
help us or Hetal okay let me let me type
something here okay no prob Oh num count
yeah sorry about that okay now so how do
you think that can help us well prop
gives us the index and num count prop
gives us the value mm-hmm so we can
wanted to hand roll our own sorting
algorithm then this would help us well
we don't even need a sort because
they're there now in there in the order
in which they appeared so let's get rid
of that one and take some fresh data and
look at it okay so if we put this in
here right run the code well okay let's
let's get rid of the return statement
and just let it loop for fun
why did that sort we met you might need
that an index on there too
instead of instead of doing this right
I'll let you finish the rest okay so
you're okay what you're doing is with
this you want to append it to the object
using this function then well okay so
what I'm saying is no leave that there
because that's what number index is
going to be pushed into okay so you can
actually just do no no no no don't
return to anything out of number index
no okay
so now and this I would put it as an
array because now we have named
properties we can access are you are you
tracking okay as if so essentially we
can check to see if some object exists
that we can get right and if the object
doesn't exist create it otherwise just
increase its frequency by one but with
an array we need to know where this is
at we need to know where that number is
that we're going to be updating should I
still be an object because if we do that
because you can do an object of log
picture it can be an object go ahead
okay I guess I wasn't following where
you were going with the array well
because I was just thinking you can put
it in based on the value of the of the
array okay
ok
i'm going to change this
you
frequency shouldn't have to change
anything else here yeah and you might
want to put its index well actually you
don't need to put it there it's all
going to go there in the new one you're
right it's good and you can just create
a new no no no you're gonna create a new
one create it create a new object that's
that's what I was going to do okay so
why don't you just use the there okay
all right good so what you call it
number index so its value frequency
index and chat verga 32 well you can
leave it at zero sure alright so let's
return that and see if we're pushing in
and correctly to is value to frequency
zero index three well that should be one
right why no no because we had only
occurred once so we don't care if it's
zero for occurs twice wave frequency of
one
let's see if 06 2 so 4 isn't displaying
correctly or now if we can sell you one
yep okay
and the output in care starting to
frequency of one
okay so yeah this looping structure that
we had that I wrote down here isn't
going to work because it's always going
to since we're always comparing it with
the highest frequency it's going to stop
at the first one it's going to stop at
the first value in the object that meets
that criteria
so what gives you what could you do so
if if the frequency is greater than the
highest frequency and index is less then
some kind of index we're tracking ah yep
so I forgot to do actually well we
probably want that lowest index way
okay can't have this at zero I would
just put it at the the maximum positive
infinity because Lightyear would be so
proud to infinity and beyond oh wait
that's the return statement we want this
is the one we don't want to still gets
too so what is our index for two indexes
for for one index is 2 for 2
oh we're not actually updating index
right okay and I'm sure there's some
built-in library function that would
simplify all this but is there oh I'm
sure there is there probably is so numb
prop okay so why don't we just return
that num count prop int index and see
okay so index 2 so index should be set
to be interested in seeing what the
lowest index is of course when it gets
to it should still be infinity yeah well
yeah
I wonder if this infinity is screwing it
up what if I just did something
arbitrary like this nope well we still
have this return here I think it's a to
make the highest index the length of the
array oh yeah oh but we're not using an
array here we're getting past in all
right whatever array is a length o or
array is an array sorry so for ver prop
in Nome camp if we're good c is greater
than the highest frequency oh you know
why if frequency okay so that's true and
then oh wait wait wait there we go let's
try that cool
and it's going to return that because
nothing was assigned so return the yet
so probably the same thing here
oh let's see there's no oh okay it's
it's going to constantly go up so which
one aren't we writing or we're writing
all of them highest nom highest
frequency and lowest index
I don't think frequency would be
throwing it off because I mean you're
using greater than or equal now the
reason why the reason why it's not is
because this greater than the highest
frequency right so if all the numbers
have 0 is the highest frequency which
means they didn't repeat then this is
going to satisfy its true and then any
number that comes later is also going to
be evaluated true because its index is
going to be higher than the next numbers
index so every time the sitter rates is
passing in a new number if there's no
repeats
so for the two viewers that I have which
one of them i think is myself so adding
that in basically ignores anything with
frequency of 0 and then allows us to
still compare frequencies and the index
couldn't we have accomplished the same
thing just by having num count prop
frequency greater than highest frequency
rather than explicitly ignoring zeros
because free weights he has already
initialized to 0 yeah we could probably
rewrite it and do this and I just
thought we were doing this before now so
okay this has to be greater than or
equal to alright the reason why let's
take a look at this okay so we pushed
five in we push to in and one and we get
all our stuff right so now if we run the
code we have five as expected all right
so what this does first is it checks and
it says okay the frequency isn't zero
now I'm moving on to my next statement
in the condition okay yep I get it now
because if we have two numbers that
repeat the same number of times we still
need to select it only if the index is
smaller right so because breaking yes so
we have to add this greater than or
equal to 2 satisfied this is true in
order to start evaluating over into our
third conditional which is is the index
lower than low index and then go ahead
and write it so we have two and it's
this last one that we have to reach in
order for it to to go well they all have
to be true for it to to write
ok
all right you want to leave this up in
case anybody has questions or oh I'm not
sure his motion it doesn't say it
doesn't give me it just gives me a
number for who's watching oh I can see
viewer list ok so I had met Jen CEO and
Alex Dixon any questions I don't think
they do so that's it um so there's a I
mean it's an answer it's a very clean
answer really i mean even if it does
make something i don't know if it makes
it complex but I mean it was kind of
nice to show people how we use an object
or how we make an object and JavaScript
how we would use an object to simplify
so an object is great if you need to
track a lot of different things about
something don't be afraid to put it in
an object and you know we could have
actually considering numbers or objects
I'm wondering if we could do something
like this so let's say array 0 dot
frequency and it's probably going to
complain because there's no doubt
frequency on that equals 1 well if it
doesn't exist I mean it should just
create it right that's what I would
think right at 0 dot
frequency so with any luck this will
return one no it returns nothing because
yeah there is no frequency on array okay
so okay we can get rid of these so maybe
it's just the built-in objects or
read-only well we could add a prototype
but yeah I think I think the yeah i
think the built-in objects are read-only
excellent for you can you can prototype
them and add whatever you want I
wouldn't do that though because then do
we're adding a prototype to like number
itself I'll be right back i'm letting my
dogs out okay
alright I'm back what was saying correct
case zero zero zero one and two-year
output was incorrect so run it on 0 is
the mode and at the bottom here this is
what I was alluding to in the beginning
oh yeah um we need to actually account
for when the mode is zero we can't just
rely on its fall see value well then we
could use something like this right so
the frequency wouldn't equal zero
because that would be three zeros and
then it would be higher and the index
will still be the same so like to see if
this is updated yeah that's what I was
going to say is just a day no no just
add a you get out of boolean flag
because if it reaches here then there's
some kind of mode right so yeah bear
mode found equals false
actually yeah this is a duplicate value
but yeah
so if mud found then returned highest
num I mean we can get rid of mode dumb
now there you go
it's so copied that and then hit reading
so I don't lose it again yeah and then
we'll push it in and that should
probably do it now I'm interested why
for four five six seven eight eight they
say doesn't work
all right and then let's put in 0 0 0 1
2 3 okay and then put in for four five
six seven eight eight eight eight like
that yeah so why is it returning for
that frequency should be yeah it should
be too right yeah so it was frequency on
41 so why is that are reaching it hmm
let's take a look so let's take a look
at eight
whatever alright so
frequency is
oh because the
hold on let me scroll over and see
something here so if it's greater than
the highest three ok and then num count
property index lower than the lowest
index well I think that's it right there
well no that shouldn't oh yeah it does
ok so what's happening as these are
coming true but the lowest index of a is
five and that is not less than zero
you
so maybe if we rather than make this
really really long we could do to ifs
because then if it's greater than or
equal to if it is straight greater than
it and less than numb count or and less
than the index does that make sense yeah
that makes sense so we need to copy that
okay and then come to the end of it if
and then we don't want let me finish
closing that up i miss my mac i really
hate windows shortcuts or my lack of
knowledge thereof okay and we can come
here and we can just put this in did I
not close something oh no it's lining up
it's just saying all these should be
tabbed over
