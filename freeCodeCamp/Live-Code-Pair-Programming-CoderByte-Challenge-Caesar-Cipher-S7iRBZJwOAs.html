string and an argument which is a number
so now we can't know anything about the
arguments ahead of time so thinking back
to the earlier solution that we did with
someone we were just doing something
like this we were iterating through and
then we were using the map function and
we're basically returning string duck
from care code there and then the letter
care code at zero plus one and then we
were doing some checks to see if the
letter was Z then we were just making it
a and you know generally simplifying it
but for this one that method won't work
because we knew we were getting one the
last time we don't know what number
we're getting this on um so the classic
caesar cipher and actually the i think
there's an answer on wikipedia um but
we'll go ahead and make one here so do
you want to start off or do you want me
to go ahead and type and explain if you
want to go ahead and start okay um so
let's see what do we know about
arguments function spaces and
capitalization should remain intact so
we have to we have to maintain
everything except for the actual values
alright so the first thing that I would
do is do something like their letter
case equals and we're making a ray
and the first element in the array we'll
just call a dot care code at zero the
second one will be our upper case a and
a care code at zero preferably not with
an underscore all right um and then
we'll just make a another one called
bear which case and we can leave it
undefined because we're going to find it
later so now let's go down um so we can
just do a simple test using some reg ex
so if it's not a letter up we need to
actually go over our string so will
actually leave that there for now so
return string dot split dot map function
letter okay now we have something to
test it against so if it's not a letter
or if letter isn't a through z or
capital A through Z then we'll just
return the letter um oh and I didn't
close my conditional we got to add
capital A to Z to our regex nobody don't
not with the eye the eye means ignore
case Oh yep didn't see that so we have
that right and then we can do uh
simple modulo operation to keep it
within range so if you're trying to keep
a number within a range or if the the
easiest way to do it is determine the
length of your range and use that as
your modulo so we want the letters to
equal for a 2 equals 0 and z 2 equal 25
that gives us a range of length 26 so
we're going to use modulo 26 that'll
make sure 20 anything if it's 25 plus
one ear as background is 0 and becomes a
so C would become a you know and it for
a plus one if it was plus 5 it would
wrap around and become what D so so now
we know that we should be operating on
only the letters themselves so if a to z
dot test bladder
and else and I'll let you fill those out
sit char code yet scar code char code at
zero yeah zero because we only have one
element now remember before you modular
26 you're going to need to put the range
or subtract it so the letter is in the
correct range um and so it's going to be
subtracting it from this yeah okay that
makes sense now yeah so just as a matter
of style this is why I did the wish case
so um and actually we could do this as a
as a ternary so you could do something
like this which case equals sorry A to Z
right close that out test letter then
its upper case so it'd be one otherwise
zero and now you can just do a you can
get rid of the if-else here and just
return the
but now remember we want to add the
number to rotate it do it do it before
your modulo because adding is going to
affect it and then we we still want to
keep it within our range right yep and
then should probably put these in
parentheses because this isn't going to
evaluate modulo 26 first I think I think
addition I think addition a modulo or
the same order of precedence so I think
it would it would evaluate left to right
in this situation but I do agree it's
always better to use parentheses to
highlight what you're intending for you
know which operation you want to happen
first and then we're missing one other
thing
while we're missing two things but the
one so go ahead and run that and see
what it does with uh with the first we
need to get this back into a string we
need to return these to their original
unicode values and then join them as a
string right so there's a string method
itself that will create you a new string
and it is called Oh looks like I moved
it so okay so you're joining it that's
good so you can join it alright so up
here there's a method called string from
care code all right and then we'll open
that and we will close it back there yep
well that's not at all what we wanted
right so we're missing one other key
step in this so we subtracted letter
case to drop it down so that either way
it would be from 0 to 25 now we need to
add that back in and remember we need to
use our which case in here now
so add so at the end of this ad you're
well it needs to be inside the shrink
from yeah so add letter case which case
back in does it does it make sense to
you why we have to add it back in yeah
okay um I'm just putting parentheses
there segregate those
yeah alright so before you submit that
let me take questions from twitch
I'm just asking chat right now what they
want me to explain a little more in
depth I haven't actually used the map
function before that's just building a
new array right yep okay yeah Matt Matt
builds a new array won't modify your
original array okay um people seem to be
okay in chat so you can probably submit
that and go on one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
