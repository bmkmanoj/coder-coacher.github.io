JavaScript language have the function
letter count take the strength parameter
being passed and return the first word
with the greatest number of repeated
letters for example today is the
greatest Irish return greatest because
it has 2 e's and it comes before ever
which also has 2 e's if there are no
words work with repeating letters return
negative 1 words will be separated by
spaces so that words will be separated
by spaces is pretty key that if you if
you know something about the format of
the data year we receive then you can
manipulate it based off that format so
the first thing that we should probably
do is break the whole sentence up into
its individual words and we're using a
space as an argument to split instead of
the empty string because we wanted to
separate on spaces
and then leave our next step would be to
go ahead and sort these by length
correct um yes okay well no we don't
need to sort them by length because
we're just sorting based on repeated
characters right so the length of the
word should have nothing to do with I
mean you know the letter I has to
repeating characters and has more
repeating characters than what words
does
so we need to go through and tally up
the number of repeated characters right
yep I'm just trying to think of a
JavaScript function that would do that
so we wouldn't have to write a for loop
well
so how could we tell I mean any
JavaScript function is going to really
just give us a loop of some sort but
it's going to be the callback function
we provide to it that's going to do the
work right right so would this be
another application of the map function
so like if if we compare each element to
well if we use the map we can't compare
it to the next element oh right yeah
because Matt gives you the the current
one
so I thought we ran into a problem
similar to this the last time we were
looking for a function that was similar
to map that took yeah but we couldn't
find one Yeah right so do you remember
our solution from last time no I don't
remember exactly what we did so we used
the we abused reduce reduce okay and
then we so we need to go through and we
need to first look at the value of each
letter right do you want me to type sure
ok ok I'm agonist yeah I'm kind of
waiting I'm kind of waiting for you so
go ahead so all right for
we r we going to use reduce on the words
array thought we were going to use it on
each individual it's I was it something
like this this doesn't look right to me
no it wasn't it wasn't that so remember
we created another array to hold values
characters
okay well I don't what are you doing at
comparison or what are you doing a
conditional check against so because
really okay think about what data we
have we have letters and we have really
not a whole lot else yet so we need to
give ourselves more data right I was
going to start another loop inside of
here and iterate over the letters in
their current word okay um I don't know
you can I don't I don't think we need to
do that but go for it okay
just trying to make this a little more
readable ya know we're word
okay I think this is actually going to
be neat this is going to need to be
moved into here right well um I'm kind
of not trekking where you're going just
ok so my idea on this is create the
array with the words how many of our
words they're all right and then create
basically an array of anarres where each
where each can wear each array contains
an array of all its letters right once
you have that then you can iterate
through the you can iterate through
comparing the letters and if if the one
is equal to the next if the first letter
is equal to the next letter then you
have a you have a repeated letter and
the only way that works is if you sort
them yeah I feel like we don't even need
a second array here we really only care
about which one of these specific words
has the largest number of repeating
characters I mean it seems like we just
have an integer value here one for the
index and one for the largest count
right so scroll up just a second so that
I can see the the top ok i was thinking
far largest index
our highest count like this mm-hmm and
then at the end here at the bottom
ultimately we're going to be returning
words largest index and instead of using
a raise we're going to have our count 0
count plus plus and then once we
complete this inner loop or after we
iterate over the characters if count is
greater than highest count high count
oops did I do here largest index equals
I okay
we still have to account for the
negative one so if highest count if
highest count is 0 is greater than 0 we
return this otherwise negative 1 okay
are there any more test cases we can
okay so this is returning negative 1 so
right there's there's one thing you need
to do first before you compare the
letters all right why does hello return
do you think like do you notice a
pattern in the word oh yeah the elves
are together we need to sort the
characters in these words good that's
what my that's why I was saying we too
I'm only doing this adjacent Lee yeah
now you could do it you could do it to
where um you yeah you could split that
and then sort it but then remember okay
so there you go yeah because you're
using yep and you can sort you can use
sort with that one because it's going to
sort them in lexicographic order so good
cool so that works
I wouldn't expect this to change but
well we'd hope not so there we go so
that's that was kind of my thought
process did you have maybe a less
complex now actually um what I was going
to do is just put another array up here
but you're just doing your creating it
on the fly I was just going to make
another array that contained sub arrays
of each word okay so good solution
Thanks I mean I guess kind of the
strategy that I was going for is like
trying trying to keep this as simple as
possible like it's at first I was
thinking about pushing characters on to
an array but reading over the problem
again we really we really don't care
about the letters themselves we only
care about the counts so yeah just went
with integers yeah that's fine and now
if he if we did have to keep track of
what letter it was honestly the the
easiest way is he doing that would be an
object so but is there a way that we can
make this out you know what no we can't
so net gent CEO unfortunately because of
the way coder bite is they only give you
a certain amount of space I don't know
we could try zooming out maybe but you
can see it it's still they only a lot of
certain amount of pixels and then you
have to scroll in it I'm sorry
was somebody not able to see all of our
code they said it's a little hard to
follow when you scroll up and down can
you open it up so the whole code block
code block is visible at once you know
what we can do though is we can do some
ctrl a ctrl C action and do you have
what do you got what do you got in your
computer let's see you got windows 8
that's what you get oh did you want me
to open a circle program you have like
textmate or something microsoft word yet
text made or something text me I don't
have it text me as that is that a mac
app I got oh crap it might be a mac at
diab notepad plus plus yeah okay so and
then we'll paste this just so he can
still get this in my clipboard I know I
copied it to some my clipboard there and
the language will just call that
JavaScript
we change this to a darker mana kai or
something or solarized is a good one
solarized is awesome yeah and then well
Solarize doesn't come out very well in
yours alright so there's the there's a
solution code block so taking the word
or splitting the the string on its paces
to get the words setting up some counter
variables and then looping through
breaking each word up into its
constituent letters and then just
comparing each letter against the next
letter and it's imperative that we sort
on that so we know that the same letters
are going to be right next to each other
and then it's a matter of doing some
logic to to see if we have a next
highest count assigning that and then at
the end we'll just return it if it's
greater than zero otherwise it didn't
have any repeating letters and we're
turning negative 1 as this spec says so
that's a solution right there
