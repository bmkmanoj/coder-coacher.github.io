programming functional programming holds
the key to unlocking many of Java
scripts powerful asynchronous features
for example functional programming is
used to build Microsoft Excel and other
powerful spreadsheet tools so with all
the parallel power that JavaScript
offers and that modern computer
processors offer you can really get a
lot of performance if you use functional
programming Jafar Hussein has a 42 step
interactive functional programming
course it'll familiarize you with
various ways that you can recombine
functions like Map Reduce filter concat
all and zip this challenge will take
several hours but don't worry the
website will save your progress as you
dance through it so first we can see
that at the top there's this big green
button do not click it it'll show you
all the answers and you don't want to
see all the answers you want to struggle
with the actual questions and have to
think really hard and then be able to
solve them that said if you get stuck
you can always go to the next one
there's a Help button on here so first
we can look at traversing an array it's
going to some of the first ones you
actually don't need to do any work you
can just run it and I'm going to skip
those for the sake of this video but you
should read those and then at some point
you're going to reach one where you'll
be able to run it and if you get an
error it'll show you the error output
and you'll have to figure out how to get
it to work if you get stuck like I said
you can just hit this show answer button
and it'll basically insert the proper
text the proper code for you to be able
to pass and then after you've gotten it
to pass that will just show you the next
challenge like I said there are 42 of
these so it'll take a little bit of time
but just be sure to come back as time
permits and finish it and once you're
done you can move on to the next
Waypoint enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
