ok
hey
Jonathan just getting the interface set
up here
okay good for everybody watching and
working on the JavaScript calculator for
a free code camp this is my first time
streaming so if there's any issues with
the audio I've got some music playing in
the background if you the music's too
loud or you can't hear me or something
just say so in the chat and I'll tweak
the settings also if anybody wants to
see the code that I'm working on in a
full browser I'm posting the link and
never mind links are not allowed in the
chat room good thanks for the feedback
John Jonathan links are not allowed you
could go to code pin dot io / Collin
ferry / 10 / j double X Double R P I'll
just paste that end alphabet so you can
build the URL yourself and open up the
code and refresh if you care to see it
bigger or look at something I'm not
looking at at the moment this is what my
calculator looks like I kind of built it
visually yesterday but I'm still working
on the JavaScript portion of it so at
the moment I've got the calculator with
a bunch of rows each holding different
buttons with the the key labels on them
CSS which is editing what it looks like
and then this JavaScript over here where
I'm at currently where I left this is
let's see if I open up the console here
I click the AC button it will show
clicked on the calculator screen so I'm
pretty stoked they got that working
yesterday but what I used is this query
selector code which is looking for
or the term key I've just as I got tired
yesterday realized that that is only
going to work for the first time key
appears in my HTML so now I'm trying to
figure out how to pass the values of the
buttons that are clicked over to
JavaScript and this isn't something
really done before so right now let's
see I do have it yeah it does work for
the first button so I've got this know
for myself that I wrote yesterday yeah
it's just explaining what I just told
you guys
thank you for the compliment let's see
so to kind of get my head on here
basically what my problem is is I I
think I could make this work by creating
a separate function for each button the
way I have it but that would just be
really bloated so kind of the way I'm
thinking about this now is passing the
value of each key pressed over to
JavaScript adding it onto a string and
then when the equals button is pressed
basically parsing out the integers and
the symbols at running the math of a
then returning the calculated value to
the on-screen variable which then should
display on the screen so I feel like
though this is a common thing with I've
learned with coding for the record I
just started free code camp about five
weeks ago I don't really have any
experience with JavaScript before this
so I'm spending a lot of time digging
into stuff like stackoverflow and all
that how to pass values from HTML it's a
JavaScript button
you
so the suggestion is only got one upload
but it's using document.getelementbyid d
that makes sense
you can use let's see so I'm using all
right my HTML i'm using buttons with
classes now this example is using input
with a type of number type equals number
so in my learning process I do a lot of
this kind of stuff where I read some
possible code that would work and I
break it into pieces I haven't like i've
never used an input with a type of
number before so then I just Google that
separately and see if I can kind of
learn something new that would give me a
clue as to a way to get things working
right or an explanation of why what I'm
doing is totally failing so so here we
see okay control for entering a floating
point number
my concern here maybe I could have
different buttons with different types
but my thinking is that they all need to
be the same if I'm kind of sticking them
all into it a string or possibly in a
trade it's another solution I thought of
is just pushing each button value onto
the end of an array and then when the
time comes converting that into integers
and operators
a part of me wants to just paste a bunch
of functions and try to get it working
and then go back and reduce the code I
don't really know what best practices
here
my camera if that was working key value
seven
another thing i was looking at
yesterday's i have this button event
listener and i do believe that if i get
the value to pass here that value will
go into the change screen function as
this and that's kind of something i was
playing with yesterday i never got it
working but looking at some other code
it looks like the value will pass as
long as the actually maybe they can test
that i just call this value equals AC
even though it's not something useful
then when the button is clicked we run
this function the variable called test
should gain that value and print to the
console so let's okay that works so i
click a see the value ascribed to this
button is AC and it got passed into the
change screen function which then
printed on the console down here so
that's great you can also see that the
on-screen variable change to clicks it's
actually plus equals clicked so i
continue clicking it it'll just add
clicks clicks this is kind of where my
thinking is with having it be a string
where I can just plus equals new
characters on to it and it will just
fill the screen as you as it would on a
normal physical calculator that my Clear
button doesn't work so i always keep
wanting to click clear but I just have
to refresh the page
okay so basically i need a query
selector to work
for multiple buttons at the same class
they didn't listen for multiple buttons
the same class name okay nobody is
helping this guy okay maybe there is
what you're really looking for is a
JavaScript event delegation mayor gauge
your button elements which are going to
super button tags yes it sounds like me
now you want to know when one of those
buttons is clicked and then run a
function exactly
huh
not totally following this function
I'm guessing event is a identifier for I
guess it's just a variable and function
never mind
anywhere on the page that button class
equals foo element of Peters clicking it
or any HTML tag inside of it will run to
do something function
I'm still not seeing if this will pass
the value this is right now that's the
real catch for me it seemed to be tons
of ways to get you know you interact
with a button or an input on HTML and
you get something happen on the
JavaScript side but i need to say like
hey also look at the value ascribe to
that HTML tag for the button that was
pressed and then passed that value over
the JavaScript looking at the chat for a
second yeah the music that I'm playing
jonathan is it's a non copyrighted
playlist on YouTube it's not amazing
music I would love to just play my
Spotify but I also don't want to get
free code camp in trouble
AJ is saying input type equals never
seems to work around this is in fly but
you're not as a preset value yeah I
agree that the number seems like a move
on yes I'll grab a free code camp
sticker at some point maybe after I get
my dev certificate but that's a robot so
it's not listening if you touch a jquery
to all the buttons will just be the
button inside the function could you
check the text on that to determine the
action this is in the keyword this
attach the jQuery to all buttons oh you
cannot hear the music okay um cool then
I will Google what you're talking about
nocopyrightsounds I thought I'd tested
this a couple days ago and it in browser
music was playing fine but
I just need to turn it up
I had the volume kind of down because I
wanted to hear myself talk can you guys
hear the music now ok I'll close that
ok
sorry for anyone's really want to see
calculator stuff and I'm sitting here
trying to get the music running on OBS
but se everybody click on this stuff i
thought i already i see the microphone
when i'm not speaking it's bouncing to
the music barely
well I'm not sure if it's press on
something second let's see properties
that's fine device no device is showing
up jonathan grahm I'm just going to call
you John because you're being the most
active in the chat room so yeah no
devices are showing up I'd not what's
what else is interesting is I did a test
recording it wasn't a test stream and in
the recording the browser the music
playing via YouTube in the browser did
record if that gives you a clue but yeah
I need a device the show okay well my
recommendation to anyone watching is to
open your own Spotify or Pandora or
youtube channel and go to town with that
in fact if the music is not working I'll
troubleshoot it later but I don't want
to waste anyone's time who's watching
now and just trying to watch me fail at
javascript so I'm just going to play my
own Spotify I'm not listen to this
terrible YouTube list thank you for ad
for your trying to help out there
Jonathan okay back to this calculator
and Juna kiss is saying how to class
kind of button and add that to all the
buttons and then if you do jquery put
this be the behind you attached it might
be let's let's give that a try
because that would be awesome if that
worked
okay so the idea here is to use what i
believe a be a jquery solution
actually I just going to change this to
button because that's already the class
that's on all the buttons would that be
it going to consult like this
well it did something log skip sorry
this line was too large for a console
you might need to use the browser's
instead and can't seem to access
that's where
so we've got my browsers console open to
see what will happen here oh it's it
might just be passing the entire is that
am I reading this right it's just
passing
yeah I didn't actually that that arrow
function isn't something i've ever used
before i see people use it to make code
look nicer but i guess in this case how
would it need to look
just want an example of what the code
should look like
where did that go
maybe if I start with a function then I
could do something event-specific and I
don't want to use an alert okay that
works with any button seems cool let's
I've got something happening I wonder
can we just reference like this dot
value because that would be amazing
that's interesting
oh it's because I when I was doing
testing holy maybe this does work I
had the value all set the seven because
I was just copy pasting all right seven
eight nine awesome awesome awesome okay
thank you to Judah kiss for pointing me
in the right direction there that really
helps out a lot let's see which it was a
way to see look at people are watching
without reloading this okay so yeah
there's like 20 of you semi paying
attention probably okay cool so what
we've got now is a chunk of code here
that is actually letting the value pass
through so i'm going to go through and
ascribe or assign a value to each button
so that we can play around this more i'm
i'm thinking that i won't necessarily
need to really do much with a difference
between the numbers and the operators on
the button side of things at least
that's my hope because i can parse those
out later from the string or the array
or whatever is determined to be the
easiest way to do this
3 plus
period 0 equals huh I don't know what
this is this final button in the initial
example video here whoops close no
download you can see that the the
calculator in the example the plus
button is actually twice as tall as the
other buttons I like that idea from a
design standpoint but for now I just
have an extra kind of button here for
now maybe I just treat it as another
plus button but uh I've got a lightning
bolt I didn't really know you could pull
this off but you can use unicode to make
icons display so in this case I've got
this bit of code ampersand hashtag nine
eight 8 nine is a lighting bolt so I've
got a lightning bolt button and I think
I might actually just leave it that way
and make that be like a link back to my
portfolio because people will click it
out of curiosity and then it'll go to my
portfolio and it'll be like ha funny so
so this value is hmm I guess those don't
actually need values the AC and the c/e
buttons which I believe stand for all
clear and clear entry maybe I know what
they do on calculators but I've never
actually thought about what the word the
letters mean ok did I get everything
done sit down sit down sit sansa time
yes all values have been assigned okay
so now let's see what do I want to do
when the button is clicked this might
actually render this code unnecessary
which is cool happens to me long
so I've got this variable on screen
which is when the when the page loads
it's just an empty string this is kind
of where I'm planning to dump each
character so in this case maybe we say
on screen plus equals this dog value and
then see what happens maybe we also need
to rerun this code here document dot get
element by ID screen enter HTML super
useful I learned how to use this in some
of the earlier projects for anyone that
doesn't know the way this code works is
it's looking for an ID of screen the
JavaScript code is looking at the HTML
it looks for the ID label screen which
it finds here ascribe to this div and
then the dot innerhtml portion says
anything that you make this code equal
to will get pushed in between the
opening and closing tags that have the
idea of screen so what's happening is
it's basically putting a paragraph with
a class of on screen which that's just
referencing the the CSS plus the
on-screen variable which will be
ever-changing as each button is pressed
and then on the closing paragraph tag so
it's that runs each time a button is
pressed so we update the on-screen value
the on-screen variable and then
hopefully we print it to the screen
let's see if anything happens
oh my gosh my calculators starting to
work for 56 12 30 period equals this
should be a plus this lighting bolt is
currently described as a plus amazing
and then that's currently going to print
a C&amp;amp;C e bit later Willa maybe make make
a separate function or something for
those buttons to just clear what's on
the screen awesome progress okay so i
think this the query selector event
listener is no longer necessary but i
never want to totally delete code but i
also don't like just commenting it out
and leaving it in the middle of the code
i'm looking at because it just clogs my
brain up so i just kind of dump it in a
comment section at the bottom of the
code so i don't have to see it it just
looks a lot cleaner than what i had so
yeah it's awesome thanks again to Juna
kiss for suggesting suggesting that okay
what do I want to work on now I think I
maybe want to go ahead and make the AC
button word because I can kind of see
how to do that so I think we'll just add
a class here called the EC a dad we can
basically copy this and I my
understanding is that anything with a
dollar sign in front of it is
essentially jquery that's my naive
perspective I don't know if that's
correct but I I kind of find myself
mentally referring to like this jquery
so if anyone can correct me on that or
not that's cool what would I just do so
in this case we're going to write a
little function that's specific for the
all clear button so I'm going to say
when the dot AC button is click to run
this function in this case the on-screen
value will just be set to a blank string
again and I guess we don't need this
console log anymore because it's
actually printing to the screen so okay
so we got seven eight nine now we hit
this boom awesome so with that in mind
we can probably do the same thing for
the CD button giving it a
I guess it doesn't need a value at all
that's just dead code but it does need a
class called siiii and we can do this
again when siiii is clicked on screen
how you remove the last character of a
string splice or slice I always get
those messed up remove character from
string JavaScript replace
okay that's if you know the character
remove last character yah chomp slim
trim slice blah blah blah let's see yeah
that makes sense make a substring string
dot substring 0 comma string that length
minus 1 okay so that makes sense so
you're taking on making a substring
starting from the character value of 0
which is the first one and then running
all the way to the one character less
than the end that makes perfect sense so
in this case on screen is going to equal
on screen whoops dot substring yeah I
think that would work let's try it so if
we do seven eight nine hits see the nine
should disappear the night is not
disappearing what am I missing with
substring
the sly syntax is much clearer
how to slice work probably the same way
that's one thing I need to do is just go
and re memorize I got it we live in this
world where I could just quickly Google
stuff them I tend to rely on that
beginning and
that's just for an array but you can
probably use it on a string as well yeah
it's nice and sighs okay a negative
that's what I needed negative I mean it
makes sense a negative number is begins
counting from the end of the so let's
see if that does anything oh that's
awesome sorry for the profanity if
anyone cares I guess I need to do
something with that equals later this is
awesome never been so excited about a
calculator since I learned how to play
games on my ti-83 back in high school
okay so get the AC button and a/c button
working let's see I guess we need to
write a function to convert this string
that we're creating into an actual
mathematical operation so basically all
of this stuff with the exception of the
equals key so maybe the equals key will
run a function and that function will
convert the string to a mathematical
operation okay so let's say
function calculate and only I put the
functions that right under the variables
but I kind of have this desire to put
things in the order they might actually
be run so I don't think it really
matters in this case if anyone knows
otherwise let me know what are people
saying to to change I wonder if I can
just pull this chat out like that
and I can do something fun
not super useful
because it's not I don't want the chat
on screen all the time I know some
people do that but I'm on like a 13 inch
macbook so I need my screen space
and see see is clear error y si si
queria our sets to 0
what
yeah I jump into the chat and I see you
guys saying things that I could have
seen like a couple minutes prior yeah
Leo I actually hated that spinal tap I
remember doing that one there was
something really painful about it so I
feel your pain so I'm fable can you
share the HTML and CSS please yes I can
just I wish you could put a link in here
I guess twitches you know they try to
keep everybody on the site so for Leo or
maybe you're talking someone else I
don't know anyway if you're talking to
me a code pin dot io / Collin ferry co
double li n fe double r y / pen / this
series of letters or if i could just
somehow remove this ok dan had to leave
that to
yeah anyway you can copy paste that you
got the in pace that that code I am now
banned from my own shower for like 10
minutes okay so back to this function
calculates so when I can't just go ahead
do this so the equals button doesn't
need a value we'll give it a class of
equal and when equals is clicked we I
guess I don't need a separate function I
just put the damn thing inside here
on screen alright so I think the best
thing to do might be too maybe push all
the characters to an array now
maybe loop through this the characters
of the string if it's an integer
my brain is not grabbing us right away
there might be a cleaner way to do it
too let's see
let's see
this looks helpful
huh the eval function what is this
huh
well this is exactly why I turn to
Google before I start doing again
sorry for the profanity the there is an
eval function that I'd not heard of
before that will accept the string and
it looks like it will turn an
automatical equation into its solution
let's see yeah that's way easier than
what i was thinkin about doin either
just it evaluate on screen and we'll say
solution all right now on screen equals
the evaluation of on screen which then
should update if that works I'm blown
away 8 x 540 now for bonus points kind
of then add plus 5 equals oh my god that
was way too easy but this is why we
learn how to code I guess because
sometimes you realize you're trying to
build a calculator on a computer my
computers are really really good at math
okay man that's awesome guys so much
easy and what I was going to do here's a
here's a problem and I might just be
okay with this to be honest so you
notice say I have the number 80 and then
I add to it you know 55 siiii should
clear all of 135 but right now the way
my code is it's only deleting that last
character but it's I don't know if I
care simply because it's not going to
hinder any way if anyone was actually
using this calculator to perform math I
wouldn't like if they hit siiii David
intend to clear the whole number and it
would just clear part of it and they
would just click it again so it's a very
small cost I don't know if I feel like
working around that
yeah I don't know if I feel like working
around that okay so what do I need to do
is still does my calculator work am I I
need to do something with this lighting
bolt button but that's about it and I'm
really happy with how much easier that
was and I thought it was going to be
okay so I definitely don't need that
junk code i put at the bottom anymore
you can clean that up a bit the lighting
bolt key let's add that a class of power
and if power is clicked I want to open
my portfolio in a new tab I don't need
it I don't need a JavaScript this is
old-school what am i doing
edge of equals where's my totally ugly
portfolio that i have not even put any
of my projects into debug mode I tend to
when I'm creating links to my portfolio
projects I don't know if this is bad
practice but i tend to link to the debug
page because you get rid of all the
light code pen stuff around it but then
at the same time i understand that
people want to see the code because
that's what this is all about but i
guess in this case they don't need to
see the code this is supposed to kind of
act like a website so and you know
another thing i am weird about i don't
like putting full urls in my code like
if someone's viewing it just makes it
look I don't know longer than it needs
to so I tend to convert URLs into like
bit ly links or something so let's see
how we're doing here calculator dunt
dunt on it's on I haven't check the
modulus yet / or module is 3 whoops well
it worked but I need to what is that for
a link target the equals blank right
let's try that now that wasn't it so i
underscore blank or something um it chef
open your tab open link in new tab
yeah I'd do it I shouldn't even have to
look underscore blank get it together
Colin okay Oh anyway let's try and check
the modulus equals ok so it works ok
good and lightning bolt opens my
portfolio in a new tab sweet I need to
go and put my projects in here I need to
make this look nicer too but it's pretty
much just naked bootstrap right now
don't that down with that clothes
clothes clothes my favorite part of
coding is closing all the times they
don't need any more don't need that
don't need that what are we talking
about in the checks
do you need to display the character
yeah you know I guess I don't actually
need to display the characters that is
something that's kind of non calculator
like and I could change that though it
does it does allow for an added
functionality that you can't do with the
calculator because you can like click
the minus button and then say oh shoot I
meant to click + and you can do that so
I don't know do I want it to not show
the character maybe I do let's just play
with it so if I'd remove the value from
the plus for instance it should
basically do that five plus five well
actually you know I think I need to
carry I need mmm yeah what am I thinking
I think I need the characters or I would
have to create multiple variables and I
kind of not feeling like doing that
right now because what's on screen is
the string that's being evaluated as a
math equation so it's doable but i don't
think the don't think I care I get what
you're saying though let's see there's
something else somebody was saying
call put your entry backspace and make a
new CD but yeah possibly
oh yeah caviar that's that is a good
solution um to clear the last entry sup
with Colin why's your website off the
grid because I i'm currently in utah i'm
in a cabin actually that's heated by
solar panels and has a wood-burning
stove and I'm just out here too I
normally live in san francisco and i
just wanted to get off the grid for a
while and part of that i was thinking
about doing some writing and i had a
blog up there but i just spent almost
three years working in marketing in san
francisco and i didn't want the
temptation to like try to rebuild my
website and write blog posts about
irrelevant things and so I decided just
to you know when I decided I was going
to go heads down mode and learn how to
code I just put my web site offline just
so that if if and when people do the
usual kind of internet stalking you'll
see that and I think it's kind of just
like it's it's true and it's honest and
I think it's a little bit interesting
and then anything i write i do a little
bit of writing um i don't have to
publish right away so there is that but
if you're curious about you know what my
website will be like you know later on
probably in May when I move back to San
Francisco um you can follow me on
twitter or something i'll be posting
updates there when cool stuff happens
and thanks for the correction at is
colin with 2 l's
22
this is not a calculator it doesn't work
like a does calculator that was the
challenge yeah let's see what the
technical rules were don't look at the
code okay I did that fulfill the user
stories can I add subtract multiply two
numbers yes I can but I can't click
these for some reason can I clear the
input field with a clear button yes I
can keep chanting mathematical
operations together until I hit the
equal button and the calculator will
tell me what's correct yes yeah I mean I
feel I feel good about the functionality
here um and I can make a fair argument
that this has even added functionality
because you can undo op clicking
operators which is like on sending email
or something you can't do it on a
desktop calculator so my calculator is
better than a desktop calculator and if
you click an operator and your cat jumps
off the windowed you look over and
you're like damn it that I click the
plus i mean the middle of this huge
operation you can see a visual indicator
that you click the plus so it's better
than a desktop calculator but chaining
operations together means displaying the
operator keys I don't I don't think it
actually does I think that's just my
solution I think chaining together means
you could do five times five and it
would show 25 then you do timeless five
and it would show 125 um so that would
be that would be chaining together but I
can also do but do you like five times a
equals 40 and I want to add some number
to that arbitrarily I can i can continue
chaining as much as i want so one thing
I don't know is what happens if like the
number gets super huge is still probably
start to like drip into the calculators
yeah it just like starts going off the
screen so let's see what if we did like
9 x 9 x 9 x 9 where we at now they would
do it will never switch to
what am I saying it'll never switch to
an exponent I don't think unless
something is built into the eval
function that I'm using to calculate
this ok does that's awesome so I'm going
to be saved by the size of numbers the
computers can handle and it will still
look okay in the calculator cool super
cool well let me jump into the free code
camp live stream if anyone else wants to
stream I'm happy to go on to the next
challenge but I'm also happy to to take
a break and this is I guess it was like
half loaded or something
come on
three code can live coding let's see I
don't even know how long I've been doing
this twitch free code camp can even see
how long you've been streaming I guess
not
I'm just getting myself on a delay is
there a way I can message you and talk
about going off the grid stuff yeah feel
free um if it's if it's long long
messages and you want to really chat
about it you can shoot me an email it's
just my first name dot last name at
gmail com column ferry at gmail I am
putting a lot of time into into coding
and part time snowboarding and stuff so
I I'm probably not going to want to
spend tons and tons of time you know
writing a novel about this kind of stuff
but i'll give you short answers to any
questions you've got you can also tweet
to me which is just at Colin ferry with
2 l's co double li in and ferry spelled
like the boat twitch I just create you
could probably use twitch messaging as
well um this is colin like somebody
already stole my name on twitch and i
didn't have a twitch account when I
started this stream so I just used my
regular like gamer fall back which is
lost gambit you can shoot me a message
here but I don't really get item I've
never really used twitch until today so
I would I would I would say twitter is
probably the best way that's I'm
spending more time on Twitter these days
because I'm kind of digging an attack
and seeing what other people think is
interesting and that kind of stuff so
yeah yeah but feel free to shoot me a
message if you like off the grid and
outdoorsy stuff you can also follow me
on instagram which is also at Colin
theory I post a lot of photos from
travelling and hiking and that kind of
stuff all right
tinted been live for one hour 12 minutes
okay it's cool you can just do up time
that's awesome thank you to the robot I
think was like 75 minutes that's good
enough that's good enough for me I feel
like doing some stretching and sub
kettlebell swings or something cuz I've
been sitting here at my table for for
too long so i will i will say farewell
to the calculator thank you all for
watching if you have any criticisms if
there's anything i did terribly wrong on
the stream this is my first stream so um
if you have any feedback or ways i can
make it better or more interesting or
more educational or whatever i do plan
to continue doing this because i thought
it i had fun and I think talking through
the code helps me become better as well
and it's kind of the goal here so yeah
hit me up with with feedback and I will
see you guys another time Adi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
