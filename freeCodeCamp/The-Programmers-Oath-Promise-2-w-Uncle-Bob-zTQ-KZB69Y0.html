oath the code that I produced will
always be my best work
I will not knowingly allow code that is
defective either in behavior or
structure to accumulate that's kind of
obvious I believe you know you always
want to be doing your best work you
never want to be in a situation where
you have released code that you know is
not your best work and you don't want to
allow code that is defective to
accumulate in the system you may not be
able to prevent it from getting into the
system at first but once you have
produced some defective code perhaps in
a release emergency or or something like
that you don't want to leave it there
you won't allow it to commute to
accumulate and I notice that I put both
behavior and structure in their code
that is defective and behavior clearly
is a problem but the code that is
defective in structure will drive the
productivity of your team members and
yourself down down down until you can
barely get anything done so we don't
allow that defective code to accumulate
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
