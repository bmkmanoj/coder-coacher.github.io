JavaScript code can be executed an
example of an event is when a user
clicks on an HTML element to execute
code when a user clicks on an element
just AB JavaScript code to the on click
HTML attribute if you look at the HTML
section we have the onclick attribute
and there's a JavaScript command right
in here this dot inner HTML equals
serial so I don't have anything in the
JavaScript section over here but still
when I click on what is my favorite food
it becomes serial you'll notice I also
have some CSS here this is kind of just
for fun I just thought it was kind of
cool that you can use the word papaya
whip and your browser knows that's a
color that's just a built in color
papaya whip now besides running a
command right here we can also call a
function from our other JavaScript code
so if we have the onclick event we can
call change color and then pass in this
that means we're passing in this h1 tag
we're passing in this whole thing here
to the change color function so over in
the JavaScript section we're gonna put
this change color function it's gonna
take a object--
and then we're gonna do object that
style that color equals Peru because
Peru is not just a country it's a color
also at least according to your browser
so I've reset this if I click here it's
now changed to the color Peru now on
these two we set the onclick event right
in the HTML however you can also set the
onclick event in the JavaScript so
here's a button here and there's nothing
in this button that shows what happens
when you click the button but over in
the JavaScript I'm gonna put in some
code here first we're going to get that
element document dot get element by ID
my button that's this button over here
and then we're going to set an on click
event right in the JavaScript and the
event is set to change background color
to medium orchid now this is just a
function call that we now have to create
okay here's the function function change
background floor the medium orchid and
we're gonna do document
selector body so that's gonna apply to
the whole body of the HTML and we're
gonna set the style dot background to me
orchid medium orchid is another color in
your browser if I click the button here
it's medium orchid for the background so
that's how you can change the background
of your whole page besides I'll click
you can also use on load or on unload so
that would be something like this you
would normally put it on your body tag
which would be at the beginning and cope
in you don't use a body tag but if you
put an onload event on your body and you
run a function here these events are
often triggered when the user enters or
leaves a page and they often are used to
deal with cookies when you're just using
the onload and on unload but we're not
going to use this right now so another
thing I wanted to show you is on input
let's bring this down a little bit on
input means whenever you input any
characters or anything it's going to
call a function here so here we have the
text box down here and now every time I
put in any letter it's calling a
function I've created the function yes
and now it's not doing anything so let's
create that function so the function is
remove letter from h1 so we're gonna set
h1 variable to document that query
selector h1 that's just gonna select the
first h1 tag on the HTML page which is
this one up here now we're going to find
the h1 text content that's the text
inside the h1 right here what is my
favorite food and we're gonna set that
equal to h1 text content so we're saying
that setting equal to itself but then
we're slicing it passing in 0 negative 1
that means we're just taking off the
last letter of that field now this whole
function is kind of just for fun just to
see what you can do so let's see how it
works as you can see every time I type a
letter another letter from that h1 tag
gets removed also interestingly anytime
I delete a letter something is removed
too because I'm putting an input of the
lead and it's still
removing letters oh the whole text is
gone and let me show you some other
events you can do so here I have a div
and there's an on mouse-over event that
calls this function here and it passes
in the div and we have an on Mouse out
event that calls the amount function and
passes in the div again and we have a
class of box so let me put some CSS in
here to make it look how we want to look
so dot box just means we're setting the
class box to have these things for
background we're using the color Rebekah
purple for some reason Rebekah gets her
own purple and then the color of the
text is light goldenrod yellow one of
the longest text names and then we're
just gonna set the height and the width
the font size and some other things so
let's see what that looks like and
there's the box and right now if we
mouse over and mouse out nothing happens
so let's create these JavaScript
functions that in over and out
okay here's mo ver and we're receiving
this object this gets passed into it and
we're setting that obscene or HTML to
get off me and then for an out which
means Mouse out or setting the inner
HTML - thank you smiley face because you
can put emoji in JavaScript code so
let's see what happens I'm gonna bring
my mouse over over Oh get out me thank
you get off me thank you there are a lot
of other events that you can use to
trigger JavaScript code check the link
in the description to see a list of more
events also in the description is a link
to the code from this video on code pin
