easy to do in eight minutes all right
okay sounds good to me Thank You sex out
of these new series go to code pin Mindy
is jade and sass at all um I'm learning
sass right now we're too you know Jade
and I know a little bit yeah I'm
competent i guess i'm not i would not
say that I intimately familiar with it
okay
so if we start by just adding the
elements and then styling them later
would probably be the smart way to do it
limit yeah I think so too and then we
can just use a for loop in Jade so don't
to make it all oh that's true if you're
like you owe each val and we'll need
let's see how the calculator laid out
think its nine now 7 8 9 6 7 8 9 4 5 6 1
2 3 0 dot Oh No equals so it's just Jade
a nice and in Maine could do that yeah
and then here you can put in SAS to with
that on if you want burbling okay yes
someone told me that bourbon was a good
one to learn yeah I like it a lot is to
li equals thou
now we just all that we could probably
do something like the bootstrap grid
where each one takes up a third of the
available space and notice about the
next one down yeah actually we're going
to do that I mean I makes more sense so
we should probably if you look at div
div equals 0 and now he's one Val
button now
it's not working here
unexpected token oh yeah
thou the polls
sound of it
alright so you can yeah we just need the
bootstrap CDM I find that a quick
ok
now we have bootstrap
to eat sbtn yeah we do want it to be a
button
then do container
whoa
then I'll need to set columns conde 404
I think it would be on each button ruin
it oh you okay i would do that all right
so how about me please
it's not too bad what do the itself yeah
and in just a little corners yeah I
think we could do would be a little bit
smaller well I guess we can't really we
could we could resize the container and
you know whatever the containing element
and that would make it a more reasonable
size yeah so we could have like a
calculator div and that could be a
certain wick aquabell work oh yeah it
did work but I don't want that was four
I did three will remark
yeah cuz in that that's basically the
gutter yeah because how it works okay
let me like an input though input type
equals text
where are all the 16 halfway yeah blows
and a whirlpool it will if you make the
containing row at 12 and then you want
the input to go halfway across I was
going to be all the way oh all the way
would be 12 yeah Oh
oh maybe not that far 11 10
what
I guess I was good enough for now one
ATM specifics but I pools not time like
they go really no it's fine one person's
got a tight pic it's kind of crazy both
people try there's a lot either gifts
what's the inputs or are you thinking
people will type stuff in or push the
buttons push pause we're just to show
the answer to oh gosh yeah okay yes we
can add a little bit of space at the top
container margin cop 20 pixels
Mindless do this over a little bit
that's a little bit better we could just
show the answer like and it did I don't
even think we have to have a form
element to do that you can replace it
with jquery yeah good oh yeah a lot
either way um you know either way you'd
have to click on a button or something
and make a change but you think good do
data ID equals hmm not sure how to do
that with Jayde Jayde can you make it
equal Val an amazing
yes i'm going to try it
Oh
I guess all the teeth bakery that's
gonna need to use anyway query oops oh
you can use angular I didn't know that
yeah that's gonna get a little more
complicated though button quick question
I think I need I know it has problems
for me click
we're going to console.log this see what
we get you just like such button I won't
yeah I want to see if they're okay but
the idea is yeah or class ID seven sweet
all perfect
yes I can just set up a total full 0 I
guess we can just make it simple and
just whenever you click fun it'll just
add to it cross connect later you like a
miner's impulse but instead yeah you can
do that you can make it so that it will
output the answer to you click equals
and you could just have it shove in an
array and reduce it yeah who do that
this data is that working the colors are
weird yeah it is interesting butchart
away
Miller
would you ever personally use Windows
videos to do actually I do use visual
studio at work but that's because I'm
doing net code I don't think I would do
it for node it seems a little overkill
for me the guy in the chat if you
whatever you personally use windows
vigils for you I think it's really good
software though i'll give it up so you
can do a lot of stuff
data right there's something special
Creek data oh yeah its a dot data no
that's right okay anyway then I look
right this data I do
I'm caught reference undefined it's not
a function that's not gonna maybe why
maybe oh oh maybe I need a cuddle maybe
I need this what about just this tidy is
that not work because you think that way
though because it's not actually the ID
it's just a beta idea think okay this
taut appr
and you have to have parents for that
matter parents um yeah I just I was
hoping able to show all of them right
but I mean like do you have to call it
by using matter open clear oh maybe
doesn't this have to be in quotes
somebody says no John knows okay because
if you put it in quotes is going to try
and find an i or an element named this
and we don't want to find the element we
just want to use the element that we
clicked on
and this should work beta e otherwise
not I only got to save
what about prop ID someone's as property
Jim I shouldn't say someone another name
just try to counsel octo for this
oh ok so it did work media was just hung
up on that first one you know yeah maybe
that's probably it so I was thinking too
far that we could do addition and
subtraction in the same equation because
all you do is you do two different
arrays and you reduce both of them and
you just take the difference like do you
see what I'm saying I guess every time
they click plus when you add that to the
positive array every time they click
minus you add that to the negative
already do that as far as equals you
still add up push
so we have to click the button right and
then add in a plus or minus button you
could have you could have a boolean
variable and that could switch back and
forth so whenever they click plus you
know addition or positive or whatever be
set to true and so then the function if
is if it's true you add it to the
positive ray if it's negative Y add it
to the negative ray okay does that make
any sense yeah we got em thanks for
following H is for HLF 1992 to 130 this
plan is they should probably stop better
later on but Austin lives so now we need
to add in a temporary one I think we
should make these strings so that way
you can put in like 25 it can be 25
another student forever that's true so I
don't want to do this and then it
coerces it to a number yeah Steve Barr
as equals and then I'll have to run here
in a few minutes but this is the fun
part this dot beta ID then we'll do
actually no I'm not going to do that I'm
just going to make those themselves
so i can use IDs on them + + against
button 1 minus ok doc button oops well I
really messed that up call the c4
okay good enough so now if
well my P trickier to be the toggle like
how the possum is instead of just making
two different event handlers like plus
click on Zoom
total add 10
I guess the tricky part is with a
calculator if you listen to a click on
the plus you don't have a value to add
until they click the next thing what do
you mean like well unless you're doing
like a financial calculator I guess
works a little differently but like you
usually do two plus three so if you
click plus you have to wait to figure
out what they want to add to the two
well just kind of attitude with the
adder of the ad array so you pay like 25
plus and then add to the array and then
clears it out so you can click the next
ones right but what if you click like
four minus three is it going to do the
minus is it going to put four in the
minus array maybe I'm just not following
let's see what you're saying yeah you
don't have to click plus or minus after
the button well unless you well we can
just make the equal fun work but it like
if it was the last number then use that
equals
can you nest um prevent listener a big
solar event handler
you mean see this'll work total add and
then 10 x equals
I see clearing it out see ya and then
oops I want to be told I want to add Oh
ads eggs then minus then
do
it
I'll just store the dice i'll take a
look up twice RM l equals this data a
deal and if thou equals the equal sign
and we'll do the calculations else
cap plus equals well
like this my video yes sir and then we
need to do reduce our total plus equals
ads that reduce little bit older than
you thought I think you pass in a
function so if your function old new
return 0 plus new yeah you turn old +
new and then bar minus their total minus
those minus the reduce function old new
one is oh I can't use new that's
reserved oh and
they return what Oh minus and and then
just look up how to set that value
jquery input value no I'll answer that
Val total plus plus total minus though
so we have far I think actually you
would do you would sum up all of the
minus ones the same way that you would
subtract it from total plus oh right
stay 5 plus 5 equals do some oh okay if
minus like zero
I'm just going to try and reduce on a
computer ray mm-hmm if total plus length
0 I'll see if voters arrow will set it
to 0 yeah the initial value probably
yeah would be good total minus uplink
yes sir Wow 0 5 plus 5 equals looks like
it's not pushing anything in to be
arrayed I really hate to say this but
I'm already over my time ok so I'll have
to run do you want to switch the stream
over to you or I don't know if I can all
they must be is good enough I don't know
if anything wants to get on we should
save this code home yeah definitely um I
think that I'm loading logged in ok I
did log into mine so I can fork it to
you if you want or I guess you can take
it baby you do I get up I'm just pocket
if you're on the state of her if Nathan
wants to take over or we just continued
on next week whatever anybody wants to
do but we didn't the I reach out for now
if you got stuff to do a whole time yeah
sorry to run on you um although problem
but good to talk to you again yeah we've
got what 8r how many nerds schools makes
five or six maybe yeah once we figured
out vm just using cloud nine
we could probably turn through the
length of the rest of them next week or
whoever wants to do that um so yes yes
that was good all right well you have a
good night and same to everybody else
thanks for joining us I don't know if
there's anyone else coming on but
there's probably pretty good chance they
will still stick around have you heard
from Nathan if he's gonna stream I have
not okay all right I guess it also send
out a message see what else to do again
you've got the Twitter bot working too
so yeah that's good all right well
everyone have a great night as check out
free code camp or on Twitter on the
internet all kinds of noises and talk to
you soon four bucks thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
