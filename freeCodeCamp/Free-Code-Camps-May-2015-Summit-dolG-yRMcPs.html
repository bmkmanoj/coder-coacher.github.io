the call to go over the first four or so
items five or so okay well so let's get
started while Quincy is please don't
okay so let's do uh Michael D 1 and 36
up absolutely so my name is mike johnson
I'm in Washington DC and I am been on
profit get free code camp so I help
manage all of the projects that we've
done so far as well as recruit and a
proxy new nonprofit organizations to
partner with happy to be what is that in
the background I have no idea somebody
watching TV who is on the call right now
I'm here all right this is pinky I'm and
everyone if you would please remember to
mute your mic swear you're not talking
because with this many people on the
call there could be a lot of
atmospherics an author and Justin are
still connected I had said it's a hulu
ed okay so slight echo yeah I got it um
guys and unfortunately this is kind of
as good as it gets so okay close to go
ahead introduce yourself hi everyone I'm
Quincy Larson and I'm a teacher of free
code camp and I also I do a lot of the
curriculum development and I also code
about 60 or 70 hours a week on free code
camp score open source project yeah my
name is Nathan lenna's I'm one of the
lead developers behind the scenes of
free coke camp as well as one of the
teachers
it's open from here okay so do you want
to talk about the yeah I say we take
just a moment I'm sending out a tweet to
remind everybody that we're starting I'm
gonna do that real quick yeah and we can
just kind of gather it everybody wants
everybody who's already in the chat if
you want to briefly introduce yourself
that way we can have a good idea of who
I was watching if your twitch handle
does not match your slack handle for
example that might be a good thing to
point out so that we know who you are
because a lot of us are used to talking
to you in slack Quincy just let me know
in that tweets out and I'll retweet it
for you got it and to everybody in the
twitch chat thank you for joining us on
a Saturday morning afternoon evening
depending on where in the world you are
we're so excited that you guys are
interested in what we're working on and
are here to kind of be involved in the
community and participate in the summit
so thanks for for joining us yeah sorry
guys last minute technical details the
the hiccups it's a it's Murphy's Law
everything sounds good when it's you
know on a piece of paper in a plane and
then things go live and everything
breaks ain't that always the way hey if
it if it worked the first time instead
working we wouldn't really have jobs
right must be honest right so
all right do you want to introduce our
JavaScript curriculum the minions 1500
hour yeah I do but before I do let me I
just for those of you watching who have
twitter i'm just gonna share real quick
hey thank you very much for following
the red sever us and we may not actually
stopped to acknowledge you guys
following us since we'll be in the
middle of presentations and stuff but we
greatly appreciate it and we will
definitely look forward to talking with
you on future streams this one's going
to be a little jam packed but real quick
let me share this let me share this uh
retweet that we just sent out and also
actually should put ourselves on watch
people code even though we're not
actually technically coding we're
demonstrating the product of code so
that free code camp I just shared a
twitter status if you guys favorite or
retweet to share share a word spread
word that we're a live here and i'll
just do launch people code actually
actually if if somebody can volunteer to
put this on watch people code it's the
subreddit if somebody can just put free
code camp I like to our slack that'd be
great oh yeah i'll link to our twitch
channel alright so i'm gonna i'm gonna
share my screen yeah go for it okay and
I should have looked at the agenda again
will for sure just go to good good our
week okay yes so I am Quincy Larson and
i'm going to show you guys our new
curriculum which is live many of you
have already seen it so first of all let
me introduce the challenge map challenge
map is kind of the overworld map of what
you're going to be doing while you work
through free code camp
we this has gone through so many
evolutions but we're really proud of
where it is now and it's it's going to
continue to improve guys so please do
not be upset if you see us adding new
challenges and our goal is not to push
the finish line farther down our goal is
to make sure you're fully prepared for
the nonprofit projects and ultimately
for getting a a junior developer job or
maybe even higher than a junior
developer job depending on what your
current status is within your
organization's so first of all you can
see that today we're 200 days old that
means that 200 days ago we launched
that's amazing yeah it was just me in
the same exact closet I am put this
online and it had to get enough people
to hang out in the chat room so it
didn't look like a ghost guess town and
yeah it's it's really taken off from
there and it's just thrilling this that
was 200 days ago it seems like it was
years ago because Nathan and Michael and
I'm Ryan mom a lot of the other people
you're going to hear from the next hour
have been like working so hard to
improve this community so the waypoints
are basically linear hand-holding
lessons a lot of them come from
Codecademy a lot of them come from
Stanford and we have some from code
school as well and basically they will
give you the basic prerequisite
knowledge that you'll need for the next
stage which is our bonfires which our
algorithm practice so the bonfires if
you haven't checked them out our
interactive they're they're fully
interactive scripting challenges and you
can you know run the code and get real
life error messages based on what your
code did and the main person who built
all the prawn fire infrastructure by the
way is Nathan
who's on the call right now and you know
we couldn't have built all this without
it it's really cool and then Ashley
recently added these links to the
Mozilla developer Network to decline
different relevant functions and stuff
when we built a whole infrastructure she
built the whole infrastructure to be
able to do that after you finish all
these bonfires which are we're probably
going to stable i was around 100
bonfires but right now we have 46 then
you jump into the zip lines the zip
lines are front-end development
challenges where basically you're just
doing hardcore CSS and jquery and using
all kinds of different libraries like
you might use react yes you might use
angularjs that's certainly possible
these are all done completely in code
pen so let me show you guys for example
one that I think is just incredible I
mean a lot of them really incredible but
this one especially in my mind is just
really wow it's a full electronic
calculator it works just like a
calculator you know it's and you can
even change calculations and clear it
and it's just it looks really good if
you look at the if you look at the
quality I mean everything's scales is
all CSS this is this doesn't use any
JPEGs or anything to my knowledge and
like just the little details like it
like this looks like it's actually
plastic nested in there and and that
this plastic is on top of this plastic
and and the the buttons I don't know I
mean I think Jeff just throw back who
built this just did a bang-up job and I
think code pen and he's basically a
front-end development rockstar because
he's been featured on the front page of
code pen three times now in the last few
months which is the equivalent of
getting you know featured on the front
of the Financial Times in terms of the
volume of traffic that the code pen gets
a lot of people may not realize how how
the popular code pin is
but it's rapidly becoming kind of the
next github in my opinion so let's go
back to the map so after you complete
the zip lines then you go into the base
jumps and the base jumps or full stack
JavaScript apps and and we're using the
moon stack development so let me see if
I can go back to build the nightlife
coordination have okay so let's go ahead
and I'll show you guys what the finished
product would look like for this just
just to clarify so we have a finished
project that's a kind of the example and
the campers job is to build these
themselves right like with the copyright
yes and they can do all kinds of things
as long as they fulfill our user stories
which are quite general I don't show you
what those user stories are real quick
I'm in a second but let me just do San
Francisco that's where I live and you
can see that like BAM very fast single
page app but this has a database let's
say hypothetically I wanted to go to the
Black Horse London pub this is like
literally a little bar that is about the
same size as my closets may it serve
beer out of like a big bathtub I'll just
authenticate real quick it'll take me
back and and then I'll have to
unfortunately do this good that's
something I think Jeff is working on
fixing but you can certainly fix so
let's go ahead and go to the black horse
London pub and i've added myself so if
another person shows up they can see
where I'm going and we can see some
people are going to hop water
distribution tonight and after you know
I can remove myself and we can make
further optimization so that's too like
we're at the end of the calendar day in
these sets but it just gives you an idea
of like who all your friends are of them
where they're going so you can decide
which venue you'd like to go to and I
mean this is like for alcoholic
but this could be totally extended to be
like you know which movie theater are
you gonna go see the New Avengers movie
at for example little details like that
so it's a very simple paradigm that can
be extended and it's a good example of
using like a single page application
that has the proper database and let me
just show you what we mean by user
stories user stories to our art for
development and basically as an
unauthenticated user I can view all the
bars in my area very general right it
doesn't say anything about how you
implement that it's just like what I
need to be able to do as an
unauthenticated user as a nun often as
an authenticated user I can add myself
to a bar to indicate I'm going there
tonight as an authenticated user I can
remove myself from a bar if I no longer
want to go there as an unauthenticated
user when I log in I should not have to
search again that's a bonus user story
so we have kind of stretch goals as well
so if you can cook build a whole stack
app that does all those things and
deploy it then you can tweak your link
out and we'll basically do a code review
for you and we've been doing that for a
lot of our campers that may completing
these and by the way this entire of this
entire process you can build these apps
completely in your browser it does not
matter whether you have linux or
Chromebook or Windows any computer that
has a reasonably powerful browser like
and you can do it on a tablet
hypothetically especially if you have
like a keyboard that you can hook up
because I mean everybody knows typing on
tablets of pain but I mean you could do
this on an iPad you could definitely do
this on a surface and it'll never touch
your local environment which means you
just don't have to worry about setting
up your environment and we use cloud
nine ide for the development process and
the one used for roku for the hosting
and it's all completely free to so
that's our basically our curriculum
after you complete all of those
challenges which takes a lot of time but
you're going to be you're going to be
ready to rock for another
prophet projects which we're going to
talk about more in just a few minutes
but like you know these are just some of
the nonprofit's that we have we have a
lot more in the hopper we turn away a
majority of the nonprofit's that apply
because we really want to cherry pick
the very best most suitable nonprofit
projects for our campers so with that I
think we can move on to the next thing
Oh feel ya I'm so the next thing wants
to feel good with no guide so I wanted
to talk briefly about the field guide oh
we have a camper named Alex Dixon who's
he's he's a really sharp guy he's a
Berkeley grad he actually has a degree
in English but he can code really well
in fact he built one of he built the
hardest zip line who built the
tic-tac-toe game and basically he is
maintaining this to of God which is just
a series of questions and you click into
them and you get an answer so for
example how do I get help when I get
stuck you know and this is just like
HTML if you guys want to contribute to
these this is just HTML that we see
realized in JSON and so you can include
styling you can include images
everything so this is this we see as
being a long term way to persist
information within our organizations so
that if you know if you encounter some
kind of ambiguity we can write a very
short article that's like takes a minute
or so to read and and throw it up on
here and this could have thousands of
things and by the way if you guys read
these you'll get a point for each thing
you read so see I got a point for
marking that irritated do you want to
read our privacy policy for example
you'll get a point for it again so you
should get five points for that yeah we
haven't tinkered with any of that stuff
literally everything you do on free
coquina gives you a point at this point
including getting enough oh and posting
something on camper news this is michael
i just wanted to add that how it's built
this all while working on a nonprofit
project with maeda Herschel he's on our
people saving animals project so he's
kind of a rock star camper and
really kind of person we love to have
contribute to three could camp so
anybody else out there who's interested
you know talk with Alex and very quickly
this is quincy again i'll add that alex
is I mean he used to work as a newspaper
editor so he is like the perfect person
to be editing and you know maintaining
these field guts in my opinion he worked
at Berkeley's newspaper and some other
places so um thank you again for your
time everyone I with this with that I
will hand it off to heaven what you I
have no idea what the agenda is anymore
they think initially yeah it's so the
next is the camper news so I'll just
I'll show camper news will bring it back
to my screen all right let's make this a
little bigger there we go so we've we've
changed camper news a little we've
increased the week we've improved the
responsiveness if you get on mobile now
you get these nice tiles rather than
Eddie itty-bitty little links to try and
click on so you know if you guys can't
be in your regular desktop browser and
you still want to contribute or post or
anything you can from mobile we've also
finally enabled search so if i search
for angular you know i can see any posts
or stories that were based on angular
and then go back and discuss got it it
won't remember your search results
coming back that's something we're going
to extend and search works on mobile as
well so if you come down here and you
want to search for tests and any post
that has a or any any posts that have
tests and again you can see where the
search was whole stuff so we really want
people to start contributing to to camp
furnace quite a bit if you
post a duplicate link it it will take
you to the original article just feel
free to vote it or comment and if you
guys think that it's moving too fast
like stuffs to king or you want more
than 100 views you know let us know we
develop freako camp based on feedback
from users so we'll continue to make it
better excellent and Nathan could you
show the agenda again please sure so the
next hour PMI partnership okay well this
is Michael I'm happy to talk about that
so PMI is the project management
institute and this would be a great time
to call Alex by the way so I'm gonna add
him to the call our and it's dialing now
and hey Alex are you here hey I'm here
hey so I was just getting ready to talk
about the PMI so just stand by for a
second so we have been managing all of
the 13 projects we have so far working
for nonprofits by ourselves Quincy and I
run these and we sort of realized that
to scale this up will we're going to
need help and so we we went over several
ideas what you know how can we go about
this should we teach campers how to
manage projects what should we do and in
our research whoever's type in communion
yourself please in our research we found
the project management institute and the
project management institute gives out
certificates for project management
professionals the PMP as well as the
agile certified practitioner pmi-acp and
over the past couple of weeks we've been
in contact with the PMI to ensure that
volunteering on our nonprofit projects
would count as hours of required
perience for those exams so what that
means is we can basically now contact
people who are going for the pmi-acp and
tell them that volunteering with us will
help them get their certificate faster
so we we made post on reddit limpiar
twitter trying to spread the word and
received I think 12 applications this
week one of whom was Alex who I have on
the call now so welcome Alex and I just
spoke without it yesterday so it's
pretty wild that we're throwing him in
the fire and on our Twitter stream right
away but welcome thanks so Alex um I
just wanted to ask you how did you hear
about free code camp I saw this into the
project management except read it and so
I reached out cuz it seemed interesting
okay yeah so the reddit post we made
which is cool and so are you a project
manager already I don't have the PMP or
the certification which is why I'm kind
of doing this to work towards it but I
do project management at work in IT so
this is pretty fitting that's great and
so I guess the kind of answer my next
question but just why why volunteer with
nonprofits I I used to volunteer a lot
and it's something that I'd like to do
again and it's kind of a no-brainer it's
something I can help me professionally
and also give back these projects help
charities and just seems like a great
cost it's absolutely right and I hope
you guys are reeling by realizing by
this point that this project management
initiative we've taken on has a lot of
the same motivations that campers would
I mean campers are motivated to build
projects for their portfolio project
managers would be motivated to get ours
towards their certification so I hope
that it's evident now that we have a way
in a program to scale this up and get
you guys experienced project managers
to help with your nonprofit projects so
I had the pleasure of speaking with Alex
yesterday I think we talked for like 40
minutes he's a great guy and he will be
the first outside project manager we
bring on to work to work on these
projects so a big warm welcome to Alex I
can't wait to work with you and I'm so
excited that we found a way to scale
this up and get all of the campers the
attention and a project experience in
their own right that they deserve after
going through such a daunting curriculum
so that is the the PMI initiative I hope
you guys are excited I hope you can see
what this means for the future free code
camp it's it's very bright and Alex
thank you for thank you for hopping on
the call less than 24 hours later you're
a brave soul and I think you'll fit in
perfectly thanks Michael all right so
we're going to let you go and Nathan
what's what's next on the agenda all
right so next we have fast captions demo
by Justin and Arthur so Arthur and
Justin I'm gonna end you guys into the
call yeah Justin's on the call over it I
just murder and I think Arthur's signed
out because he couldn't get his audio
configured correctly for whatever reason
okay so let me let me go ahead and
introduce kind of set up the project and
will hand it over to to Justin so fast
captions was born out of a nonprofit
organization from Australia that that
contacted us called no more crap shins
and it's the reason it's called fast
captions now is we've actually open
sourced this to the entire community
anybody can go now work on this and the
stakeholder is very excited to have this
is an open source project as well so the
problem that came with us to you is that
they were not satisfied with automatic
captioning on YouTube videos and they
had a proof of concept written in PHP
and asked us to rewrite it in JavaScript
so Quincy and I put tick
they're a team including Justin Rogers
who's here now to tackle this so Justin
why don't you take it away and maybe you
could even share your screen if you want
to to demo the the caption and tell us
how you know what you built sure yep all
right awesome all right so this is a
live site so i can't see your screen yet
let me see this could just be me Nathan
can you see his screen yeah i can see
you scream anything you need ride screen
here off of your desktop or no it's here
it's on my desktop okay i can see it now
yeah okay great yeah okay so the problem
with each you catching is that YouTube
stop like to give a pic actioning so
what we did they have some I think it's
small percentage of our actually
automated automatic straight narrow arm
speech recognition captioning and
there's the ones that we're trying to
fix so if go to the website now this is
the lite version up on KROQ
now showing two things but it uh this is
strange okay um I'm just a move from
there
sorry about that
alright so
so let's show by the way certain things
he wanted to add were shortcut keys for
causing slowing down videos things like
that just to make it easier to caption
to go through and listen a more slowly
and add the captions I also thought the
problem was he also want to add more
captions or delete captions to like this
word to right here that kind of stuff
comes up a lot where it just takes one
word and it was really quickly going
through and you know you it's hard to
caption that or changing like that so we
had a functionality to delete things
like that so basically what it does is
it goes to me it goes to youtube and it
grabs the youtube url off there and then
scrapes the the source code of youtube
site because that's where the actual
captioning link is and it pulls back
that caption and then it puts it into
the manga database in the captions
collection so what other technologies
did you use besides MongoDB to build ah
it was a it's basically node express to
scrape to scrape youtube it's the
request a node quest library and
everything else on the front end I
didn't I'm probably want to go back and
change it to angular now that I've
figured more angular out but it's pretty
much resolved jquery like kind of us
getting mess right now but it everything
works properly the biggest hurdle he
wanted blank captions so in order to
make blank captions you kind of have to
constantly check to see if the array is
array of caption this is sitting there
so when normally the captions come in
from YouTube they're just in this state
of I grab the title you Tarl the
captions just come in with a start time
adoration and the value inside
and it's just a giant array of captions
so I built it so that when it's blank
you can add actions the same way youtube
normally grace and it it pushes a file
out I just sort through it and let's
push it to tomorrow DB if there's no it
first looks in the databases are already
if the URL for that YouTube videos
already in the database looks for that
if there's no URL already in the
database for it then it goes and gets
the it goes and gets the season figs and
catch it on there so it looks for the
match of the captain the detection URL
that they would have on their source
code and I grabs it and it's it takes it
and downloads it and then parses it into
Jason and puts it into the database and
it serves up the video along with it and
if not then it takes everything
creatively quaint captions file and
answers to the video so the the front
end itself it's pretty I mean YouTube
API is pretty flushed out as far as
you're serving videos back if you just
want to embed an iframe in there so that
was pretty that was kind of the easy
part the hard part is the fact that they
don't they really don't want to give up
their automatic speech recognition
captions so that's the portion we have
this kind of scrape out so could you
caption a part of that video and show us
how it works okay so so for instance dr.
right now you can still look down
one change it my screencaps small but
all shortcut keys are up here so just
save current captions so shift control
save it'll it backs it up a few seconds
and then I'm so right there you heard
our top story tonight and so if the the
caption that YouTube had didn't say that
you could pause it and correct the
caption right there great yeah exactly
so down here when it has the des this in
here so so wow you can see just how bad
these captions are I mean they're like
moose judges yeah and this is the
problem that I mean there's so many
accessibility issues all over the
internet right now we faced some with
our dash tutorials that we have the
General Assembly dash that we've gotten
rid of we have a blind code camper who
took exception to those and it wasn't
able to work through them and so you
know for the for the deaf community
people who are willing to correct
captioning are lifesavers I mean this
John Oliver show is amazing they're
short episodes i think it's like
20-something minutes every week and I
mean you can do this with any YouTube
video but there's a real problem that
needs to be solved and is being solved
with what Justin Rogers and Arthur head
have built here and it is open source
and anybody can contribute to this
justin i'm sure you'd love to have some
help there certain things like a you
know we added log in/sign up this is
hackathon starters so you know we
haven't well I basic basic functionality
put into it but certain things like it's
really tedious to make one of these I
think this was one of the more technic
technically challenging projects if not
the most technically challenging project
I've ever seen so but we need to keep
moving just
but thank you so much for showing
showing off this fast captions project
and congratulations for a job well done
and building this all right thanks
congratulations this is Quincy Justin if
you could if you could link to the the
actual github repository and throw that
in zoos way twitch chat that would be
wonderful good yes thank you just thanks
okay awesome okay next we have Ryan with
saved child's heart so Ryan do we have
you in the call no let me we do not do
not screen share with stops sweet one
second guys all right Ryan how you doing
good okay so could you go ahead and
share your screen and give us a demo
save a child's heart yes hold on a
second pausing on twitch stream while
you're doing that I'll just talk about
the organization so sheer size ur from
save a child's heart foundation
contacted us and had this idea this this
vague concept of the hearts for hearts
fundraising campaign where you could
donate money and have your heart show up
on a wall of hearts fort with alongside
other donations it was it was a very
vague just concept she you know she
doesn't work for them full time she's
actually a medical student that started
in London and finished out the project
from Shanghai and spoiler alert here is
what the the vision becoming a reality
and and these guys did a great job so
Ryan why don't you talk about what
you've built here ok yeah so when she
originally presented it I and I think at
some point they had something built
somebody had my windows key
hold on one second okay um so she had
this idea for having the having the
hearts appear on screen in relation to
the donation size and having them appear
sort of Pinterest style down the screen
so that's what we put together we have
you can you click click donate here and
you can pick you can pick the color of
the heart and the style of the heart and
the as you fill in these fields while
the donation amount is what affects the
the final signs of the heart as it has
appears on page to spend more money and
get a bigger hard on the wall yes
exactly that's a clever I didn't realize
that would even be possible to do very
clever so then I visually uh I'm going
to reload this page once whenever
progress meter here in the middle that
fills up when you first load that out so
that's the current status with the
hearts their on-screen and as you scroll
down the page on the back end it's it's
automatically pulling in more hearts so
you have kind of a an infinite scroll
thing going on here click on one of the
hope so right anyway starts you can
click on and see who who donated it who
they did a vacated it too and this one
was this one was just see data so the
message is just a random text but you
can also include a custom message to who
you're dedicating to you guys also made
it so that you could donate anonymously
as well exactly am I think up here of
our famous undefined heart so yeah you
can
you can donate an out yes you can donate
anonymously and but still dedicated to
somebody just to be clear that undefined
is not an air that's exactly for some
reason that was chosen as filler text
for the message yes okay so um talking
about just giving in the integration
with justgiving gotcha okay so I'll go
ahead and fill this full of sin once oh
you can donate in a hit of them that i
saw that i'll have to fix that like you
a his failed okay so when you click
continue the app constructs the URL just
giving has what's called a simple
donation integration so you can just
construct a quarter e to go out to the
site just giving very handily has this
sandbox site that we're currently using
what you have an actual count that will
be that we're ready we're ready for
deployment but we're still working out
some hosting issues on on save a child's
heart end of it yeah so basically to
give these guys maximum exposure and to
raise as much money as possible we want
this this landing page to be a
sub-domain on the save a child's heart
website itself so we're just working out
some last technical coordination to make
that happen and to raise as much money
as possible right so you can see this is
it populates this form with the message
i filled out before i click donate now
it takes us back to the site we're going
to thank you message and then you can
view the heart you just made by click
Buckner that's great this is just
gorgeous that you guys did such a
bang-up job and I think you know this is
hosted at on Heroku if any of anybody
watching and twitch wants to play around
and test it and view it for yourself the
URLs right at the top just hearts for
hearts karoku at calm and this is really
gorgeous I just can't believe from his
vague of a description as we had at
first that this is the end product so
congratulations to Ryan and Chris for a
job well done thank you and that's it's
really not a whole lot else to to
explain and show off unless you want to
get into it well what what technologies
are used to build this um it's Mongo
node Express on the back end I have it
open here you can see for each heart
there's no there's a there's a Mongo
document entry and then the we get a
unique just giving ID back when you
click Submit from the just giving site
and that gets put into the that gets put
into the database so that's how we're
able to retrieve hearts after they've
been made the the you hard in the query
pull this is the this number here
instead of just giving donation money
great and so that's what tells it which
heart you you had actually made yourself
yep exactly that's awesome and I know
one of the late editions you added was
infinite scrolling how to do that ah
it's actually a bit of a hack we're
still loading the entire data may
database upfront and I did some testing
on there and it's even with enough
hearts to completely fill the meter it
was still loading instantaneously so um
on the back end I'm just cutting the
database up to the chunks for the render
for the rendering function it's great
and I mean I kind of have my own opinion
on the answer to this but do you think
building this project and the experience
you gained will help you get a job as an
engineer I believe so I think the code
would need some clean up for it to look
elegant enough to show off to a
developer but definitely odd this
project is live I think it's just just
the fact that it's in use and we'll
definitely look good on my resume as far
as getting a jump yeah and I mean I
think this is going to raise money I
seeing this project develop every week I
am so desperately want to donate to the
save a child's heart on this and
probably will so great job and again
just this was one of my favorite
projects if I'm allowed to have
favorites it's gorgeous and you guys I
know you're probably sick of looking at
hearts after you know 10 weeks or
however long it took but congratulations
and great job thank you so we should
keep moving Nathan what's up what's up
on tap all right Ryan thanks looks
really good man thanks i'm going to go
ahead and and my stream here can
somebody take over the share before we
end then yeah one second best that's
what happened last time otherwise it
kicks me off yeah okay thanks Brian yes
this is quincy thanks so much ryan and
chris for building that beautiful
project all right so we need to get John
and stream and David if we can um okay
i'm adding John now okay Quincy did you
get a hold of david Quincy Quincy you
may be self muted sorry I've been
meeting this is quincy I've been meeting
my microphone over on talking analyzing
white noise oh my goodness um you might
have some interference issues
might one of you you stuff again no it's
John I don't Oh shucks I think there's a
John John can you remove yourself from
the car real quick
Oh
um all right one second guys I'm back it
seems to have stopped yeah I uh well I
ended the call John can can you check
your audio settings you have a lot of
you should text him that too he might
not be watching this stream yeah my uh I
don't know how that was like some kind
of white noise feedback loop yeah he
probably first of all he everybody who
comes on the stream should be wearing
headphones but that is a given in my
opinion because there's just it'll
reduce the atmospheric noise and reduce
the likelihood of a feedback loop okay
all right uh so I'm try and add him
again real quick yep let's try that
again let's see oh and Michael wall were
adding him do you want to get set to
read the feedback I was just logging
into my email so i can definitely set up
John yeah it's still a ton of feedback
um really quickly woody woody your audio
settings set to you are you on the
windows or mac or linux
okay what are you using for a microphone
microphone okay um you're your sound
settings are crazy what's your gain set
to you or your output volume in your
control panel John just makes sure that
your headphones are plugged in all the
way yeah or or try unplugging them
plugging them back in did that it seems
to have stopped John are you still on
the call whoa-ah we'll try to John I
mean it's possible that John might not
be able the demo time razor yeah I don't
want to continue with r.i.p issues for
too long but I'm happy to talk about the
project and yeah i'm just going to cue
this up time razor it is based in Canada
and you're easily I mean I there's
nothing to share it no time razors based
in Canada and what they do is they host
events where they invite local artists
with their artwork and potential
volunteers to come and bid on that
artwork in volunteer hours instead of
money it's a great idea I think it's
just awesome and they this is one of the
only projects that had a pending
deadline we would never usually approve
a project that had a deadline but in
this case we felt as though we could we
could come through on this so what they
want what they did was they would invite
all of these potential volunteers hand
them a piece of paper with a list of the
nonprofit organizations looking for help
they would go around to different booths
and talk to these organizations and at
the end you know they would pencil in a
check box of who they were
interested in volunteering for and hand
it back to time razor so we replaced
that with a nap and John Lucas and David
Alvarado had about I want to say it was
something like six weeks Quincy do you
remember how how long they had it was
definitely a time gap had something like
six weeks some really short window of
time to build all this and write
infested right and and that the deadline
was April thirtieth because that was the
day that four of these time razor events
were occurring concurrently across
Canada so as you guys know that was
Thursday and they delivered in time and
I'm just going to read you the email I
got from the stakeholder on Friday and
hopefully we can demo this for you but
let's just say these guys built the app
to replace the piece of paper so
Stephanie who's our stakeholder says hi
Michael I promise to get back to you
today about how the time razor app pilot
went last night really excited to let
you know that the app worked perfectly
we didn't have any downtime so we're
really glad that we decided to use it
for our Hamilton event the Hamilton time
razor raised 2560 hours five hundred and
sixty hours above our goal a big part of
getting above our goal was utilizing
this new app on a vent night we asked
our attendees if they were inspired to
volunteer for 20 hours over the next
year whether they win a piece of art or
not in our experience only about twenty
percent of attendees would actually take
that pledge usually because they didn't
notice that element of our paper-based
ballot I'm really happy to say that all
but two of the people that used the app
either on their phones we did build a
mobile responsive website or at the
station clicked that pledge so everybody
but two people pledged when they were
used to twenty percent of people doing
that that is fabulous program feedback
to share with our funder
stakeholder and attendees overall I saw
huge improvement on people completing
this ballot which is a key element of
the event in terms of connecting
individuals to the nonprofit
organizations in the room sixty percent
of attendees registered their
connections with us so she goes on to
say a little bit more they're going to
write a blog post about their time with
free code camp she said the experience
of working with free code camp has been
absolutely fantastic the project was
finished in an impressive amount of time
and everyone involved was very
responsive creative and talented in
particular John Lucas and David Alvarado
kudos to them both for a fabulous job I
couldn't say that better myself Quincy
and I are so proud of these guys to
build this on under a deadline and have
it go well they were both right by their
phones just in case something went wrong
on Thursday and this is definitely one
of the biggest success stories for a
free code camp project in our short
200-day history so congratulations to
them both I would love it if they could
demo something so i don't know if you
guys want to give that another shot or
if we're if John's got his audio fixed
but it's just incredible Quincy did you
want to say a few things sure um yeah
I've been talking with John in the chat
and I would like to bring them on we're
near the end of the hour and we really
wanted to keep this to one hour so you
guys can all get out there and enjoy
Saturday and of course hopefully sit
down and get some coding done as well
because we strongly encourage all of you
guys to code a little every day I mean
really it just it makes a lot of sense
and so even on Saturdays don't take a
day off you know it gets some coding
done but I wanted to yet just say
regarding this project time razor that
these guys had a very tight deadline and
they shipped you know and they shipped
in the best possible way where they had
a robust project that worked and it
delivered direct measurable value I mean
this was a non-profit where they had
already set up okay so maybe if we can't
get John's audio working we can at least
have him walk us through it through this
and maybe Michael you could narrate well
I think I'd go ahead and let say you can
MC this you'd be like okay yeah i'll be
happy to do it so um but but actually
deploying code to a real-life situation
this is a big organization they had four
concurrent events at art galleries and
and so this was like a dry run and they
delivered on a deadline and to have
everything work like literally no
technical hiccups and to have it
immediately increase the nonprofit's
bottom line in terms of raising time in
this case raising working professionals
you know lawyers graphic designers
various professional services to to get
them all to donate their time and
actually increase the volume of time
that was donated I mean this is a great
offer this is a great example of code
actually making an organization more
effective and and the old workflow just
to give some perspective into that they
used to be dealing with literally
printed out pieces of paper that they
handed out and hope to get back from the
from the participants at some point and
they had a pretty low collection rate
and now what we proposed was like hey
just just buy some Chromebooks and have
a little setup place where people can
either get on their phone and register
before they walk into the gallery or
they can hop on one of the stations and
go through this quick workflow so
basically we took like a paper process
and then after the paper was printed out
and filled out somebody had to manually
enter it in the sales force so we
essentially like save them from really
tedious error-prone data entry work
nobody likes data entry work and so so
yeah here we are at I'm razor
um so John is piloting this and I'm just
going to go ahead and talk about what
he's doing this is the general workflow
that somebody might have and here we
just have some dummy data these would
actually have nonprofit names associated
with them but it's a you know check all
that apply basically and we can see that
he's checked three different nonprofits
that he would potentially be interested
in contributing his time toward okay we
can go on done as the event volunteer 20
air our their shows hey Quincy I think
you're breaking up a little bit Nathan
can you hear Quincy okay okay i'll go
ahead and take over but that called you
three I had a little from here like it
yeah now you're back to a head okay and
then basically that's the workflow it's
an extremely simple app on the front end
into the user it's almost idiot-proof
intentionally so like really want on it
to be so simple but you know it is
extensible more stuff can be then to
take take all the data closed form and
push it to Salesforce directly like
these guys also the Royal Salesforce
integration so that love basically
there's no intermediary database
necessary basically it just it handles
the JSON and make sure hey Quincy you're
dropping in and out and I was hearing
quite a bit of that but I'm just going
to go ahead and talk through the rest of
it so it is true that you know at face
value this looks like a simple app but
one of the request addresses the
specific need which the not proc but had
and that's the kind of code that needs
to be written a lot of people think oh
we you know you're not hard for unless
you like pie lowers or do
um you know bleeding edge stuff
can you guys hear quince but Quincy
right now I think we just lost him again
yeah we may have Michael go ahead go
ahead i messaged him letting me know
that I'm kind of go ahead and yeah
that's that's the problem with the
fortress of solitude is that sometimes
he gets crappy Wi-Fi man but so yeah
they have a sales force that they've
been using to manage all of their
nonprofits that they work with and so
really what we we did was we built
something for a nonprofit that services
nonprofits and these guys integrated
Salesforce they replaced eventbrite sign
ups and basically made this a one stop
shop it sounds like time razor took us
up on our advice to not only have a URL
for people to visit on their mobile but
also to set up a Chromebook at a station
and let people sign up there so I mean
if you guys were paying attention when i
read that email i know that was kind of
a long email but the numbers don't lie
and and what these guys have built has
vastly improved their conversion to
volunteer hours at their events so you
know i wish i could interview john i
don't know what our audio situation is
like it seems to have taken a dive here
but we're at one o'clock and it has been
an hour and but just a huge huge virtual
round of applause again for time razor
and for these guys yes they've been done
an excellent job under pressure and jon
lucas and David Alvarado I have have
represented free code camp in the best
possible way and our fantastic
ambassador so congratulations guys I'm
so so glad that this went well and I
look forward to doing more projects like
this one in the future um so Quincy are
you back are you on let's I think we
just I am
sorry everybody I was dropping some
packets apparently so I hope you heard
me what I said about like how they did a
Salesforce integration and now it just
works and I like how these this typifies
the type of work that most nonprofits
actually needs done it's just simple you
know API integrations and simple web
forms and stuff like that it doesn't
necessarily need to be bleeding edge to
make a huge difference to these
nonprofits and the causes they care
about that's exactly right so should we
take a couple are you guys okay with
going a little bit over and taking some
questions from the chat absolutely i
mean i added that in right here so
questions from the stream well yeah the
agenda let's do it I guess what we'll do
like a quick we'll call it a ten-minute
QA we might extend over I don't want to
take it too long because it'll just take
it longer to get into YouTube for the
people that may be missed or couldn't
attend so Oh ask away
all right you know thanks and again well
done on well done on the app
ok we'll time razor be utilized with
freako camp for signing up for your own
nonprofits Michael can you answer that I
think time razor is is the the
application is owned by Time razor
essentially you well yeah the answer is
no we don't plan on integrating that but
we do have something very similar which
is that we're changing and we've kind of
already changed over the process of
applying for non-profit projects within
free code camp itself you know we use
Trello for a while we'd like to have all
of the nonprofit's listed on our site
itself and we don't really have an
integration for what they've built for
time razor but generally when when we
built these nonprofit projects it will
be for that organization and the
stakeholder and I guess if it was useful
enough or relevant enough we could
integrate it but in this situation now
we will okay um so the next question is
what are your future plans for FCC so
Quincy and I could talk about that
Quincy do you want to do you want to
talk about it sure well I'll tell you
generally this is quincy generally our
plan is to just make free code camp the
best place to learn to code period and i
know that sounds like a lofty goal but i
think we're making rapid progress toward
that i think that free code camp can be
can have the rigor of like a master's in
computer science or a intensive coding
boot camp but it can still be free and
it could still be convenient for all of
us busy people who have kids and jobs so
that we can potentially still work
through at our own pace a rigorous
JavaScript curriculum and get tons of
experience actually building projects
for real life people and then get
awesome coding jobs afterward right so I
that that's the long-term vision of free
code camp to be the best place to learn
web development specific asst I don't
know if we'll ever gob web development
so technical details about future plans
for free code camp and it may answer
some of your guys's questions
no I'm leaving that open for someone so
the sofrito camp as you see right now I
like to call it free coke at two point
oh it's got the basic functionality that
we actually wanted minus some of the
features going forward we are actually
moving freako camp entirely over to
react not necessarily cos reacts is
better than angular or anything like
that I'm not going to get into framework
Wars but their tools they meet a job
it's because of the way that data hooks
up in the back end our actual plan is to
integrate pairing straight into freako
camp so that if you don't want to use
screen hero you can use a lightweight
built-in version of pairing so that both
you guys are basically hooked up to the
same bonfire you're hooked up to the
same you know whatever while you're
going through it and I will continue on
to the next question and then come back
to to future plans there were MongoDB in
previous challenges where is it now
coincident you want to talk about the
effort to get the MongoDB stuff yeah I
mean I'm trying to this is quincy i'm
trying to work with a MongoDB university
we've just had some very lengthy gaps in
our communication but our goal and I
didn't want to say this publicly because
it may not happen frankly which would be
sad but our goal would be to get MongoDB
courses as part of our curriculum and in
order to do that you can anybody can do
those courses they're free and open but
they're not self paced and really we
like things to be self-paced like we
have hard requirements for all of our
way points that they be one free to self
paced and three browser-based and with
cloud nine that I owe you can
essentially work through I think in
theory you can work through all of manga
TVs courses without ever having that
like actually install a development
environment on your local computer but
we'll see whether that bears fruit I'm
certainly crossing my fingers that we
can get access to those self-paced
courses but
if we can't then we will try to find an
alternative or build an alternative
right okay someone asked about camp
renews as possible will see the arrow
down vote system that reddit uses to
implement with FCC news state school
there already is an up system but it's
not an arrow so we actually talked about
this and camp renews is designed the way
it is specifically so clicking this will
take you to whatever site they linked
and then the discussion will come in and
you can upvote from here the thing is we
don't want a simple arrow up down right
on the front page we want to stimulate
people we want people to go in and
actually read the content and honestly
let's be honest down voting is just
really kind of a troll thing to do you
know you're basically saying a you know
your effort to provide this link sucked
and I don't even want to engage in
conversation I mean if someone does post
a true troll link on the forums we can
pull it off but you know we really feel
that that it's kind of defeating to to
punish someone for going it ahead and
putting in the effort to post a link
that they thought might be helpful where
they wanted to stimulate discussion
about well said Nathan so where would
FCC like to be in a year I think we
answered that kind of you skipped a
couple other ones avro zapper there's
there's no usual deadlines for
nonprofits we don't have arbitrary
deadlines it usually it's on a
case-by-case basis and we work to scope
out the project and then come up with
deliverables each week based on camper
availability and as far as how many
nonprofit projects are currently
underway Quincy do you know how many
have we we have actually going right now
I think currently like several of them
just resolved we don't have that many
honestly we I think we have like maybe
ten concur currently running that sounds
rad we're slowly adding these are just
some of the right way this list is not
exhaustive but
uh we're going to be getting a lot more
one of the main bottlenecks to us having
a lot of nonprofit projects was that
both me Quincy and night Nathan I'm
sorry me and Michael both needed to be
like intricately involved in the project
management of that and now with Alex and
potentially some other agile project
managers coming on board first of all
they can do a better job than with you
we have kind of been under serving our
nonprofit projects we've been doing our
best but we're not professional project
managers nor do we have the time and
energy to come professional project
managers but these volunteers can and
are in the process of becoming
professional certified agile project
managers so they are going to be able to
do an excellent job and we're gonna
we're going to expand the field guide to
include a lot of information for them as
well so that's been a major bottleneck
also a lot of our campers who started
the nonprofit projects who have
approached us and said that they weren't
fully comfortable with the mean stack or
they weren't as comfortable as they
wanted to be with front-end development
and we always plan to increase the rigor
of our curriculum so now that we have
the wavelengths and the zip lines I mean
it's going to be a little while before
everybody completes those and is able to
move on to the nonprofit projects but
it's going to make the nonprofit
projects go so much better and we're
going to see a lot more ambitious
projects as well as as campers who reach
the non proper projects have significant
at building experience right um okay so
uh Eric Douglas yes we do actually plan
on rolling out our own curriculum the
we've talked at length and we feel that
we may be able to present a better
JavaScript curriculum that teaches
people correctly then some of the other
stuff that we're actually in linking to
right now you can you can help
absolutely if you're interested in
helping I'll get with you
upstream we can you myself and Quincy
can talk about that later on Bianca a
scan campers choose technology example
rectangular jQuery so freaked out camp
is meant to be singularly focused and we
want to train people or we want to give
people the material and the skills to
get a job as soon as they finish with
everything is is the goal putting too
much on the plate it's kind of like
going to Thanksgiving dinner and having
ten different side dishes right if you
pick a lot from each one you're going to
get full without fully consuming one of
them so we're going to really track the
job market and find out where the most
jobs are and we will follow technology
and pivot accordingly as time goes on
there there's talk amongst us about
bringing anger react into the course but
then also requires us providing a lot of
a lot of functional programming you know
of course wearing stuff like that that
we just don't have in stock right now
and Nathan if I may as far as the
nonprofit projects go you absolutely
choose your own technology it's best if
we we taught it but some campers have
used react already that wasn't
necessarily in the curriculum and I also
think it's worth pointing out that I
mean three-fourths of the curriculum is
our is our own and it's only the
waypoints that we send you elsewhere so
we're well on our way to having a
one-stop shop to learn to code right and
and I'll just jump in real quick this is
quincy and say that angular dominates
the job market right now if you guys are
curious i've written a blog post which
I'll link to but it talks about the
JavaScript technologies that they're the
most it's if you just Google real reason
to learn the mean stack it's pretty it's
pretty recent I'll just I'll just throw
it in the chat real quick so and week to
see ya excellent question 8400 41 jobs
for angular whereas if I go with react J
yes 150 jobs you know and and granted
indeed isn't isn't over you know it's
not an all-encompassing thing but
actually it is I mean it's it aggregates
literally every job poster so pretty
much it's a and and I think mine is set
for the Seattle area but yeah I mean you
guys can see the difference also well
FCC ever adopt other languages like Ruby
or Python and chris voss s if we're
going to teach no we will not we're not
going to teach Ruby we're not going to
teach Python we're not going to teach C
C++ Java none of that stuff we focus on
on JavaScript and here's the reason why
a lot of companies are switching over to
node on the back end there are other
sites that already teach those languages
very well that lastly with JavaScript if
you learn JavaScript well you can write
javascript in the browser and on the
server and save yourself a lot of time
and and with angular 2 coming out in the
future with react the way it is right
now and some other frameworks you start
getting in this term isomorphic
applications where like ninety percent
of your code is shared both on the
server and the client so you end up
saving a lot of time and the less code
our end you write less code and the less
code you write the less bugs you've
introduced into the system so we're
going to stay focused on JavaScript you
know with HTML and CSS obviously because
you need it and we'll let other people
teach Ruby and Python because they
already do it very well this is Quinn
solution one thing I'll add is if you
already know JavaScript really well then
you can easily pick up Python or Ruby
you can probably fairly easily pick up
java actually I talked to several people
this week because I was curious about
Java because I know that like Google and
some of the other big tech companies use
Java as they're interviewing language
and the people that I know that are both
know there are no developers but they
know
because they had to learn it back in my
college or whatever all said like yeah
you if you already know nodejs and if
you already know javascript really well
you can learn everything you need to
know to ace interviews java wise or c++
wise in like maybe one or two hundred
hours so it's not like learning java is
this huge endeavor if you already know
javascript really well if you know one
language really well it's quite easy to
to take that thinking and move to a
different language so for that reason if
you can just read some books on Java
after you finish working through free
code camp if you really want to work for
Google for example then like I don't see
a reason to build a curriculum around
that because it there are tons of great
java related books that you can just
read and and you'll have the kind of
mental framework to apply all that yeah
and and i would say that if you know
javascript really well there's no reason
learn Ruby or Python there's there's no
reason at all the learn Ruby really high
thought you would only use it for
mathematical or computer science related
stuff and there's Julia there's there's
are there are all these competing
technologies that can do what what
Python can do too so regardless of which
language you learn your ultimately going
to have to learn JavaScript really well
so why not just learn JavaScript
Christie well that's that's our thinking
in and focusing on JavaScript and also
like Khan Academy so many other great
resources are just focusing purely with
javascript and and that's not because
it's necessarily easier to teach
javascript because it isn't there are
certainly languages that seemed easier
initially to learn it's because
javascript is the lingua franca of the
web and it will become the lingua franca
of mobile in a few years um okay so we
should start winding this down yeah so
the last graphs are ready to go on the
tirade the last question I'm going to
take is Ryan there were any plans for
creating our own curriculum to replace
so yeah we kind of set it you know it's
a slow process the thing is the people
who would be right in the courses are
also the people
are actively maintaining free to go
camping implementing new features and
slowly switching infrastructure over and
doing a thousand different other things
so you know we want more people to
contribute you know you guys we like I
said in the beginning we built freako
camp for you guys and we respond to what
you want the more you help us with
contributions and you know little prayer
requests like hey here's a here's a bug
that was you know a typo this and then
the other it frees us up to actually
start doing some other things to bring
you guys more in depth content so well
said so I think that's it we took
questions for 20 minutes so anyway this
is a tear Caleb I AKA Nathan so thanks
thanks for watching guys to all the
people who dem demoed the nonprofit's
they they look really good glad glad or
well I hope you guys got fulfillment out
of it aside from from practical stuff
for your portfolio yeah well we have fun
I mean every week when we have our
project meetings everybody seems to be
learning a lot and having a good time so
can't wait to build even more and
everybody watching on twitch help us
spread the word let's find some
nonprofits who could use our help we
have some success stories now to prove
that we can make real apps for real
people using new web developers this is
