Pomodoro clock a Pomodoro is a style of
working where you work for 25 minutes
and then you take a 5 minute break
Pomodoro is actually the Italian word
for tomato and it's related to what they
call a tomato timer so we can just click
a button and we'll see that our pollen
or accession starts and here we can
configure the length of the break and
the length of the session and I can
click it again to stop it so let's say
hypothetically I wanted to do a double
Pomodoro which might be 50 minutes and
then a 10 minute break the reason by the
way that people use Pomodoro as a
productivity methodology is it's a lot
easier to get started if you just tell
yourself it's ok I'm just going to work
for 25 minutes and what people generally
find is they're deep in their work and
they don't want to stop when they hit
the 5-minute break time so they just
keep going so it just makes it a little
easier to sit down and actually do work
so let's review the rules don't look at
the example projects code figure it out
for yourself use whichever API s and
libraries you need and reverse-engineer
the example projects functionality but
feel free to personalize it there's a
lot of room for style on this challenge
and our user stories as a user I can
start a 25-minute Pomodoro and the timer
will go off once 25 minutes have elapsed
we actually recorded this video for 25
minutes we would hear a sound when the
timer is up and that will signify to the
person who doesn't necessarily have the
tab open maybe they're working in
another tab that they can take their 5
min a break as a bonus user story I can
reset the clock for my next Pomodoro and
I can customize the length of each
Pomodoro so when you're finished go
ahead and click this button and feel
free to tweet it out and tell the world
of your Pomodoro timer and we'll take a
look and give immediate feedback
or we will just give feedback when we're
reviewing all your projects for
assigning you a nonprofit project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
