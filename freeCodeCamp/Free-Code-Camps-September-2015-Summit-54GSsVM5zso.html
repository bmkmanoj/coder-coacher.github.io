do today is talk a little bit about
first of all some recent changes we've
made two free code camp some recent
improvements and we're also going to
show our general workflow how we get
work done in free code camp how are our
core team of developers which is mostly
me berkeley and been here the three
people on on the stream but also
involves you know countless contributors
and other people that do contribute
quite a bit i mean it some people
contribute a whole lot it's not like
it's like a typical normal distribution
of people supporting our community and
contributing so let's go ahead and get
started i'm going to just show a quick
agenda for today basically we're going
to start talking about the new
simplified portfolio pages and then
we're going to talk a little bit about
some things we've recently implemented
to handle people accidentally navigating
away from the code and and some other
improvements we've made on that front
we're going to talk a little bit about
improvements to camper news all of our
contents now Creative Commons license
which I'm going to talk about a little
bit we've built in some loop detection
into our challenges to prevent you from
accidentally creating infinite loops I
know this was an issue for a long time
we also have a new bonfire hint system
using camper BOTS and we've created some
new chat rooms so let's go ahead and get
started first of all let's do quick
introductions for all three of us for
those of us those of you who are
watching who don't know who we are um
I'll start I'm Quincy I'm a teacher
pre-code camp and i spend about half of
every day coating on Franco camp in
another half you'll probably see a lot
of tweets and Facebook posts and things
like that generally I handle a lot of
like
the social media and if you send an
email the team at free code camp com
there's a good chance that i'll be the
one who responds to it and tries to help
you with your issue so i do a lot of
support as well next let's introduce
Berkeley Berkeley Martinez hi i 1 i'm
birthday Martinez I'm responsible for
most of the architecture backend stuff
and the DevOps tough making share the
servers are up making sure databases
respond quickly making sure things
aren't Maggie so it is like you can just
believe me great and then we also have
been McMahon from Dublin hi folks I I'm
been on some beers here with on the
internet one day and decided to start
work in a bit Rico camp and I fix a few
things often I break them too and I'm
mainly responsible for making you change
itself the new course rest of or
suggestions people have for you course
with you can fire a message me and get
it I'll take a look all right wonderful
thank you so much gentlemen for joining
me where is normally we have like a much
more lively live stream normally it's
not just my love on the screen we have a
lot of people but this week we're
focusing purely on like more technical
things so I just wanted to have the main
technical contributors here on the call
we're going to be talking as I said a
lot about our github workflow and
showing you kind of how you can create
issues create pull requests and get code
into free code camp calm itself and just
some general things about how open
source projects work so first of all I
wanted to go over a couple quick
features that we've recently added to
pre code camp to make it a little bit
better what I'm going to do is something
that I hope you'll never do I'm going to
go to manage my account and I'm going to
delete my account thank you to everyone
who gave me lots of brownie points and
things like that but I'm going to I'm
going to delete this account for the
purpose of showing how our new account
system works so basically I can sign in
I could sign in with anything I'll just
go ahead and sign in with I'll sign up
with an email address so I'll just use
my personal email address here which I'm
going to do on my own screen
you
alright so we're doing a live demo I
hope this doesn't break but you'll see
when whenever I login I get the new
approximately eight minute onboarding
scroll scroll through which it does
include some gifts and other things like
that we just wanted to make it a lot
easier to get started without giving you
nine challenges that right up front so
this was our solution to that I hope you
all like this I just leave it as the
homepage because I figure some people
are going to skip it and eventually will
see it and I'll be like well maybe I
should take time to work through this
but you can go to our map some people
have asked about our learn button
functionality we will be implementing
that something like that again once
we've gotten it working one hundred
percent bug free or close to it because
currently there are a lot of issues with
a we just hit 95,000 campers um so
basically our new account system you can
see that like we have this placeholder
art in the upper right hand corner
that's because I haven't liked any
meaningful social media accounts so I
don't have an image there I'm just going
to click link with github and I've
already granted github permission
previously so I don't need to go through
the process but normally I would need to
click I approve github getting my email
address and you may be wondering what
data we get with these different servers
basically we just get your email address
and in some cases like a photo but it
actually I think we'll show you like we
asked for your your public profile
basically so i can add twitter here just
with a single click and it will redirect
me back and now if we go and look at my
profile you can see that I've got a
Twitter account and a github account so
I like there's no more typing uh one
thing that I really don't like is unless
I'm in a typing mode where I want to be
typing something like when I'm type of
code or I'm typing an answer to a
long-form question or something like
that or typing a tweet I really want
everything to be button driven
interfaces so we're going to see that
user experience sensibility a lot more
on free code camp we're going to see
button driven interfaces so I'll just
have my LinkedIn and I'll add my google
and now we can navigate over here and we
can see that I've got all five social
media logins like so so basically these
are logins this simultaneously gives us
what we need in order to be able to show
how to link to say your Google+ page for
example which i'm sure i have a
neglected google+ page here and it also
gives you the ability to easily drill in
and well basically like now if i log out
let's let's sign out a free code camp
which we have this big prominent button
I don't know why you'd want to sign out
because like you probably don't ever
sent out of Facebook or Twitter right
but but we a lot of people ask for that
so we gave them that option maybe
they're using a public computer in the
library or something so now when I try
to log in with google should just take
me to the same account that i was at
yeah so it simultaneously adds all those
and makes it to where you can sign in
with any of the options and you'll get
to the same account a lot of the issues
we've had previously where people have
thought like oh no my lost my data what
happened was actually accidentally
inadvertently created in a second
account and that account had zero
progress so if that ever happens just uh
don't delete your account or do anything
dramatic just just email me and and you
can reach our support team which these
days is just me just by emailing us
right here and we'll get you squared
away a lot of times I'll just go into
the Mongo database on the back end and
make changes directly to help people so
that they don't need to delete accounts
and do all that stuff um so that's the
account creation and the new social
media links and you can see that we
fixed a lot of bugs with our streaks are
streaks are a little bit more generous I
think it's like 36 hours instead of 24
hours just because we know that people
are traveling people are busy they've
got like a really long streak and they
happen to hit like a hard bonfire we
don't want them to to break their streak
just because that another thing I want
to point out is you can actually you get
brownie points by submitting on camper
news as well so if you submit something
to camp 4 News then it'll give you a
point and that will maintain your streak
and you also get a point every time
somebody updates something you have
posted so for example let's let's click
on this is it's always going to open
things in a new tab by default and we
can just scroll up here and somebody
submitted like the 45 best places to
learn to code for free and you know
we're right up here at the top
thankfully they knew about us and they
put us here so if I like that article I
can just click upload and now it's
uploaded like no longer do you have to
click to the second page we still have
this kind of metadata page called more
info we'll probably eventually do
something more with this we remove
comments from this because they just
weren't used very much if i refresh this
should show that it's uploaded yeah so
we're really trying to make camp for
news like a really seamless place where
you can quickly submit links and for
example I can submit a link to our
YouTube page I'll just click Submit
YouTube submit and you can see it auto
populates pretty much everything and
boom we've got that page and now if we
go to all links you'll see that it just
by virtue of it being new it showed up
pretty high any camper news and it
assumes that if you submitted that you
uploaded it and you can see that I did
indeed get a point for doing that so if
you look at my streak on my profile
you'll see that I have two items we give
you 1i we give you one point just for
signing up
so nobody has zero points at any time
you always start with at least one point
all right so camper news is radically
simplified I also wanted the show that
we have creative commons on all our
assets you may have heard that we have
like a lot of digital assets that you
can use if you ever want to use it and
you can see that we have this creative
commons license on here now so you can
easily share it as long as you also
license that content as share alike it's
it's a specific content but you could
even use free code camp content for
commercial purposes if you want it as
long as you include the Creative Commons
license and we've got all kinds of logos
and things like that in here and we can
see st. Peter recently updated this so
basically not only is free code camp
completely open source we are also a
completely creative comments with that I
want to talk a little bit about code
storage so then do you want to talk a
little bit about this been in berkeley
or yeah yeah by the way these are these
are Ben and Berkeley's profiles you can
see Berkeley's here in San Francisco
Ben's in Dublin you may have seen this
keep calm and alt f4 for the non Windows
users what is all alt f4 do alt f4 club
of am a credit open window it's really
bad idea to you we're actually pushed if
you're on Windows vidiians it's
important although most programs now
have a like it look awesome let's see if
you work for it not that bad okay cool
so let's go ahead and let's let's share
your screen been so we can see you can
talk a little bit about the loop
detection that you and Berkeley
implemented and and the code storage on
second
make presenter we're using gotomeeting
here all right and we should have your
screen in just a moment oh no it takes a
moment to to you picked up there we go
okay oh ok am so cold storage code
storage was always parish well for a
long time was proud of the framework and
for whatever reason it was only ever
implemented into the bonfires initially
am and mainly worked but we decided what
we wanted to do was we recently merged
all the code Heinz could you make your
text a little bit bigger sorry in a row
and can you control plus sometimes
thanks maybe another five yeah that's a
good size and so we're nail habits we
now have solutions that will save at the
HTML jquery challenges save as you type
so a few of hello quirky for example and
you hit f5 it will pop back up yes did
make a liar out of me even if you hire
alert which won't let me do but even if
you have reload it'll still pops right
back up with the same solution you have
and this is fantastic particularly
unseen advanced this people who live in
countries where international that kind
of stuff is inconsistent it means all is
not lost if your internet connection
drops you lose power so that's a good
thing and the instant problem you run
into though of that people started using
things like script tags and obviously
because it's scripting for javascript
enhance the people we type in while and
they be like okay good and put this here
and then they'll start doing maybe I
want to do I don't want and not equal to
but the second they type in one that
color would try to execute and would
cause an infinite loop and to show you
what this will do if I open the console
me slightly bigger people and what up if
I did if the page should freeze as you
can see that's my page never frozen I
can do nothing
hopefully the font random think um yeah
you may need it like for skill that tab
your what happens on my computer when i
get an infinite loop is my my computer
fan turns on usually that's how i know i
just triggered it in from the loop so as
you can see this quite annoying class to
go back I have to go back to Chancellor
stuff but we now have in places that
your code we tested before hand
interesting if you've a loop the tests
on pop up she's a bit nine will fix that
and but effectively what will happen is
you'll know straight away if the loop
because would be something like this or
true is another one but the point is
your code will not say from a state and
it was only because I forced in a loop
that there's carbon Ganesha asked i was
doing i did this times over oh right and
so here comes out therefore if you like
ta sa ki ll / ft I am CH are oh ma sorry
about that this is so unprofessional
horrible your post killing he's forced
killing chrome and windows I was near
dead I agree let's bring it back up and
show them again and so the test actually
do work I was lined with her and I work
in it was just the fact the chrome who
decided it didn't want to work anymore
and but anyway long story short this
networks as it should do and test pop-up
wants the Kurds sake so this name means
that your experience overall she will
more consistent and a lot easier to deal
with stuff like infinite loops there
from some isolated cases where it is
still executed but I think that's
cleared up there because Breton
confronted this fantastic system where
all the scripts are versioned so you're
always guaranteed get you one and the
only thing we have noticed and this is
like a small leaf picky thing but I
think it was a camper somebody mentioned
to me that this has wrong code which is
not actually what I thought when you are
typing things in and this is going to
duck humans
as you can see i'm quite slow makes me
horrible everything I do chills dlci me
auntie that ready if you start putting
stuff in here it will actually work as
meant if it runs the code in real time
it just doesn't such a way that if there
is a problem it won't freeze up your
browser so if i have like color blue
they should change that color to do as
you can see that's worked I'm really
great color it's a bit moldy any bread
is quite clear and so that put no longer
runs code well actually does that runs
the test against your code so you'll see
that if I change crush the world the
test doesn't pass straight away that's
her East works not what you have to do
is you have to hear this button and so
actually what it is doing is running the
tests so I think now is like an optimal
time to show you the workflow as to how
you're meant to go to if you notice
something like this or you know it's a
problem anywhere else on the site is
simply enough to wait to get here you go
through github or you can use the book
one either will bring you to the same
page and the long navigation is to hear
your free code camp near you go to
issues you hit you and you'll say a good
descriptive title yeah of course have
not linked copied right but keep in mind
there's also this bug button that you
could be pressing instead of navigating
and copying the link and everything try
clicking the boat in the book the book
what you should bring you straight to
the issue page should bring you straight
to here and some reason decided not to
work on my end not because if you've
really infinitely open earlier and what
that button does bring you straight to
this page that you can fill in your
issue it also auto fills in a title i
think if i remember correctly so that
you don't even have to do this but
really a good descriptive title me into
g she's much like more likely to get
looked at on the dress straight away
because if we can figure out what's the
problem we can ami 6s there and there
and so where i'm going to title this am
I don't know in acct or eggs coffee in
run button I you know your post your
message
noticed on this challenge laughs the
button to run the death still runs coat
and what's really helpful at this point
in time it's if you take a screenshot
now when the cleanup come to talk of
snipping tool shed of the box she looks
like if it'll just do it I tell it to
come over from another screen looks like
that hit you screen kind of goes all
white and you drag a box helps from the
right page you drag a box around the
issue that you think is problem so come
up here because of the way guitar works
you can hit control C or you can do file
copy just somewhere gene do ctrl c you
can pay such straight in uploads it has
a little attachment everyone's preview
my screenshots there so straight away
one of those looking at the issue we can
see the cellophane at the company's run
we can say Oh yet does does everyone
code and I think this should boops knock
Shh there should say run tests submit
your issue oppa go simple fare and grill
them happen is is either it'll be seen
or to be labeled by one of the
contributors of papers access to do a
label that you know like and I booked
and confirmed because you seen it at
that point either it'll be addressed or
another camp will be helpful enough
millipore requests to fix it you know I
think and I don't think that yeah I
think that there might be a good point
for us to hand it over to to Berkeley
Berkeley do you want to do a pull
request and fix this issue
sure yeah if I repeated yeah so I can
tell you that it's uh it's located in I
think the three different show views
show HTML and show japa j/s and maybe
show bonfire I think that's so a
separate view it shows if line so we
just need to change the the copy on that
button so so first I'm going to promote
you to presenter brooke Lee okay so
we'll soon be able to see berkeley
screen to ramp it down with something oh
you can't you can't shout your whip all
right you closed something for you let
me know you can see my screen yep we can
see it often ok so I am on staging I
don't make sure i have latest create a
fork let's call this click submit button
coffee and so we should all be in server
views and in course or solder so if i
search for one code and we want to
change this to run tough to be a little
more accurate correct yes run tests okay
let's change the path that's one down
and we can probably just keep it like
upper case for run and keep the other
one lower case like run tests could be
lower case like we had previously yeah
run tests plural because they're usually
more than one test
hmm so what Berkeley's doing is he's
actually modifying the you'll notice
first of all he's using them which is
kind of an advanced text editor and he's
going through and he's changing the copy
in all of the HTML files which in in
free code camp comms repository we're
using a tool called Jade so he it's
basically a an easier way to write HTML
than writing raw HTML but he could just
as easily be doing these changes in HTML
he's changing the file at the HTML level
where we have this button component or
it's not a component yet it will
eventually become a component but it's
basically these these traditional HTML
views and he's just modifying the copy
there all right it looks like our HTML
views have the updated and test let's
check out bonfires make sure bonfires is
updating in if you run tests and one
more we need to check is the jQuery
challenges there you go raanta okay so
now I verified that my changes are what
I want them to be go ahead and add them
to the to decommit here so i can see i
staged them to be committed so now i'm
going to actually commit so here I'll
add a very good description of what I've
done so we always want to start off with
six add chains just going to set this
current branch to track the remote
branch so origin is my remote branch and
be whoops sorry about that and
because my origin is the name apposite
or ii ill will show up the main
repository but for the folks at home
your origin should be your fork
repository on github right you just just
to stop and clarify what Berkeley saying
whenever you make changes to an open
source project you shouldn't try to make
them directly on the open source project
you should fork the open source project
which means make a copy of it and then
push your changes up to that and then
you can then you can create a pull
request or PR as they're often called a
pull request and then that will be
requesting that the code that you've
just been written be pulled into the
original open source project yeah until
here I'm declaring which remote I'm
pushing to and then I'm going to tell
git which branch a wanted push so I want
to push submit fix or submit let me copy
and I want to push it to a new branch on
the remote repository with the same name
submit button coffee well let's submit
that you'll see here get so let's say
create a new branch on the remote and
pushed our fix a bit blind copy up to
fix submit button coffee and so we go a
free code camp give up it's very
convenient it tells you right away hey
you submitted of the new branch less
than a minute ago and it gives you a
nice shiny button here compared and over
course and you can see here I'm pulling
I'm requesting to have my changes merged
into the staging branch just where you
want your changes to be and it shows you
a breakdown of the changes I've made
I've replaced code here and I Berkeley
just so you know you may need to slow
down just a little bit your your page is
still kind of refreshing yeah there we
go so
you can see on the left is the original
and the right is the updated like so the
left is the state on on our staging
branch on Franco camp staging branch the
right side is the code on Berkeley's
fork of free code camp that he just
committed to yeah alright so here you
can see the title that I added in the
command and this description of the
changes and the issue it cloves in zeros
yeah once you're satisfied that your
changes are ready to be merged and just
go ahead and hit create full request
excellent so now I get CM in the main
repository it links directly to the
issue that it closes a very good
description very good title and then
there is here places to you may comment
one important thing to note is that if
whatever reason how one of us wants you
to change something specifically like
let's say a run Ted we wanted it to be
one test we commented here okay this
should be run test all you really have
to do to update that's poor its life it
make your changes and put the same
branch github will automatically detect
and you've made changes and update the
boulder quick okay quinte your bent you
want to merge the changes that you're
queuing then after you my friend um why
don't you share your screen I'll make
you presenter and you can merge it on
your side sure let me get the ProQuest
open though sure I'm going to make you
presenter and gotomeeting let me speak
shim sham the right screen cool
that's for true now oakley all right
good yeah we could antic and so poor
request this is very much what we'll be
doing bush it's interesting to see how
it works so best practice that will
deals with like you've got you here and
you'll take a look at what the actual
changes were because the scripts you
could say wanting and I could do
something else I'm Adam actually a
problem you can sometimes get where
people will try and fix an initial issue
now go fix over things put subscription
allah mentions the initial things and so
you do have to go through here and look
at that point depending on what it is
and we'll pull it down low key until
check on a.m often times we get change
the tests and challenges are changes to
copy if it's coffee we can read it
normally but has changed to test
particularly they have to be made sure
that a that they work and beat up there
in line with what the challenge was
initially a bitch and put in this case i
can clearly see it's jade so cut
most likely not gonna have a linting Air
Act abruptly and literally github is
myself to highlight the fact that only a
word has changed nothing else so I can
assess quite quickly this safe enough
looks good I'm on a reg full request at
we do the option to change the title
breath I don't think I'll ever done that
you can hit confirm and it's true and we
can now actually if we go back to the
repository and find stash what does one
of the files anyway in the code base
it'll be there yeah course with show
HTML and it's back there run tests and
that is that Berkeley's changed or
whoever will make a change to pull in at
that point then that will not be seen on
the server straightaway so if you see
pull request being merged in and then
you go straight to paging go oh it's
going to be there and it's not do not
panic we don't deploy on every poor
craft merge there and that we done
separately but you'll see every now and
again they'll be like a block that we
are pointing the service to flow in your
love you might not have any week of
their beer warner
two or maybe three things that are
slightly different and I just have
mentioned that to people in case they're
getting pull requests down off and
they're really exciting and I said I
changed their don't panic it's coming
and but oftentimes it's like only when
one of us it's down to go through all
the pull requests or makes a change
yourself that stuff will get pushed to
production if you like and so if
somebody has is able to push to
production I'm shocked I didn't scream
for obvious reasons Capulet know stuff
today and then we'll go and take a look
free coke have two changes so I'm gonna
go to quickly before the thing affection
deployed yeah I can show people it is in
fact the old thing we're not cheating
this is a magic it will still say one
coat and put a freaky maybe if you have
deployed and give me share when it's
done I can reload the page and we can
share the magic yeah how'd you put it on
on the beta website how the data sorry
so beta is effectively please don't try
and everybody go to ish because I'm a
small thing and what it's actually beta
is the early version of stuff that we
use to see will of work I'll sometimes
work locally and then when you push to
actions over to somewhere just because
that's waiting there we should be able
to go here and it will never say other
than one of its b/c run tests and that
is the kind of magic you get yeah thanks
for deploying that Berkeley so again to
clarify what I've been saying just
because your pull request has been
accepted does not mean that will
immediately the change won't necessarily
immediately show up in production but it
will get pushed eventually when we get
around to pushing to production right
now because production Berkeley is
getting ready to do some cool
configurations to free coke am calm the
production site so we just decided to
push the beta instead we will be pushing
new features to beta before they're
available on free coke camp calm if
you're just interested in like being a
beta test
let us know we actually have a chat room
and I think this is actually a good
point for me to to hop over and and show
how we've added some new chat rooms so
thank you gentlemen for this
introduction to our pull requests real
quick before we move on though could we
talk a little bit about waffle that I Oh
would you guys like to see waffle that I
oh I can put look if you want sure yeah
why don't you pull it up real quick so
waffle dot IO is kind of like Trello for
github issues that's a good way of
looking at it's a con bond-style board
for for github issues so you can see
that we've got these different columns
here and all of our 281 most of our 300
plus issues are right here in the
backlog column so you can see these are
submitted by campers we get maybe 20 or
30 new issues a day and we have several
people who are actively going through
and grooming these issues and making
sure that they're not duplicate issues
making sure that they are that they have
all the details so often they'll ask for
they'll ask further questions and then
we'll maybe you could show like
hypothetically if we if we took this
this done thing we've already submitted
it but you know perhaps we could perhaps
we can mark up one of these existing
challenges in lawful real quick are one
of these existing github issues just to
show them that a little bit what it
looks like so maybe just click this top
one doesn't recognize image source let's
just take a look at that sure and I
think about mitsubishi so you get this
knife to the description everything and
it's i press the parties and get up
because it's a bit more stretch my kind
of stuff and put effectively if you
submit an issue it will come here will
be able to view in this kind of
environment
so we can go challenges an issue please
grab reduces pain English cheques para
teachers at work in identification image
shows a bright actually bit ly so he is
provided handily enough screenshot so we
can actually take a look at what gone
wrong and what is going on that is
interesting um I don't see what the
exact issue is here wow dude let's
really let's reread the issue just to
make sure that there is not because as
far as i know from these challenges both
of these images should show up and they
look like they're showing up in his view
yeah i create a new image i guess
correct check marks having to adjust
corrected thing to work I've try placed
the image of a different place each a
surprise is essentially so that if
specimen the red X and so what might be
going on direct like beer up so ah well
here's a CDP no nothing that looks
here's a good look for that yeah a
difficult one field in quite a two DP so
all the chance for people who are
interested in sixty tests and script etc
where you go on the github pages seed
and challenges and that is the list of
challenges I think the head as we have
on their files match the ones in the map
page and you might be slightly different
yeah html5 and CSS right here be able to
find a quick enough so HTML 5 and 5s and
the challenge name is searchable so make
images responsive and images response of
 ago for me make okay so i can let
me do it so wait a sec wait a second i
think this is a bootstrap challenge so
we need to navigate to the bootstrap
ready some file sorry about that today
is right there where the kind of graphic
tees we can sometimes get but you know
everything is that in one place where
the other make there we go i had to work
make another
and so we can see it is in fact a
regular expression for anybody who was a
file of those looking for a
backslash which is interesting yeah i
mean this this could be an issue Nathan
that I was just backslash escaping the
quotes the double quotes so it's
possible that he had single quotes for
wrapping it can you check to see if he
had single quotes know if topic or have
used implodes pippa x su running cats so
at this point because you can't see
straight away besant it is to go to it
and go well can I pass the challenge um
so I to make another image and it's
gonna copy and paste hello copy and
paste okay cool I back to me through
that remove the a from the end the other
thing is it didn't set closed could be
so soon technically technically html5
spec says you shouldn't use self-closing
tags there's no reason to do that like /
so I updated all the challenges already
to reflect that we don't teach that
anymore the other part of this challenge
is to set up so that it uses this class
which we could just pop straight in what
 day no is it worked so we now have
the interesting situation that I can
pass tests but this person cannot and
what we have to know figure out is
whether the case and open close open
close so in this situation it could just
be am a discrepancy as a once-off type
of thing so because it cannot replicate
this I'm gonna go back to press and say
hi there I guess the man so I'm not just
talking to myself copy that in the it's
because you're using a source attributed
to give an href attribute okay good good
i exhaust oh now this sauce it should be
source for the only chick sauce no I'm
sorry I am unable to reputation
this myself can you check gosh you are
still unable to pass this challenge and
report back also oh wait use a question
mark not an exclamation point because
that's a question sorry I'm like oh
you're picking i forget what i'm typing
us and typing it so yeah oh sorry yeah
oh yeah what I was gonna say is like
basically we throw this in the end of
every question like which browser are
using a which operating system you know
also you'd also have a few duplicate
image tag that is supposed to be in the
same a tag no but the wreckage should be
firing is wrong I'm is that the test of
the relics death and it's marking Avant
you shouldn't do you really care of it
like if there's a HTML structure one it
would best be that I'd say but because
of the fact that it is to do a ring it's
not so he says usually moves it right
and so we can label this as blocked all
the blood means that we are waiting for
a response before we can take further
action because I can't replicate this
yeah and there's no he hasn't say a
prayer exact specific like there's
nothing more I can really do to evaluate
whether a vimana this is that we could
have had a poor request a fixed if it
didn't they so this could be an old
issue although was two minutes ago so
that's unlikely but it does happen
sometimes that we have issues that were
fixed that we don't know they're fixed
and which is why we need to stay on top
of the pull request which which is why
normally like the first thing I do when
I go look at the issues is I I look at
the poll requests and see if we can
merge those in is that that way you're
potentially closing a whole lot of the
issues if you start looking through the
issues then you're going to find a lot
of issues that are already actually
addressed by existing poor requests but
you can feed that actually with the
whole of am have waffle worth that it is
no longer in the back lock it was to 288
28 for a there's no one waiting for a
spot which is what we are now waiting
for waiting for that press come on and
say hey dreddit you're gonna do work or
I mean Safari didn't work so very
interesting enough doesn't seem to like
a test suite at all and so that could be
the issue but we don't know because you
don't know our prayers is using and and
yeah so this other variables like that
that we have to watch out for because
i'm using cronin our own works but it
could be a case it's a funny browser
right am j close so another thing about
waffle is you can just like Trello you
can like grab &amp;amp; drag between columns and
these are not like rigorous column like
these aren't rigid we decided to set up
our columns this way if you use waffle
you can set it up however you want and
just to show you just like everything we
do is open source i'm going to open
waffle in incognito mode and you'll be
able to see this exact same interface
like everything we do at free coke camp
is as transparent as possible we want
you to see everything that goes on we
want you two to come back and liked or
the entire sausage factory essentially
and like know exactly what is going into
your sausage because you need a share
your screen sure because i I mean we
believe in transparency we believe it's
a virtue and open source is all about
transparency so share my screen here
show my screen so I'm sharing my screen
with a venom berkeley now so even though
i'm in incognito mode i'm not
authenticated i can still come through
and take a look at all the issues it's
pretty cool app so now that we've gone
through how we deal with issues how we
create issues how we solve them how we
create a pull request how we ultimately
merge them back into free code camp i
hope that gives you some insight into
what happens behind the scenes when you
create an issue and how we deal with
that and
we have a lot of people that are
actively contributing and managing our
issues and if you're interested in
becoming one of those people if you're
frequently hanging out on our issues and
commenting on them and helping helping
us gradually get toward solutions to
those issues or submit pull requests
please please reach out to us reach out
to berkeley and we would love to give
you a little bit more power in terms of
actually accessing and closing issues
down the line but it's basically a
meritocracy basically whoever does the
work whoever shows up consistently and
is helpful and things like that those
are the people to get more
responsibility that's how open source
generally works it doesn't really matter
whether you are somebody who works at a
big tech company or you're just some guy
in this closet if you're coming
repeatedly to do the work and invest the
time and energy then open source will
reward you with the esteem of being a
big open source contributor and I am
proud to say that free code camp has
been a very successful open source
project so far and it's going to
continue to succeed I hope but as of
today we are the 43rd most starred
repository on github period the number
one is bootstrap with 80,000 stars and
free code camp has we see if I can go to
the page real quick we have nearly a
quarter of that so we're getting too
kind of close to the extreme and we're
already passing a lot of other big open
source projects that you've heard about
so um we really appreciate your
contributions even when you're creating
an issue that's a contribution to free
code camp and that's making free code
camp better and the more time and energy
you can put into
those issues the better so let's say
hypothetically I want to create a new
issue if you have time to look at these
guidelines for contributing click on
this and you'll see that bench anchor he
is one of the campers who's been
actively working on improving our issues
this should link to the okay here it is
so we we have an article on our wiki
about contributing issues and checking
checking to make sure that it's a new
issue and not a duplicate issue things
like that like searching for your issue
on github he's written a number of
articles and I even created this little
gift to show you how you can go about
searching for an existing issue we
really appreciate any time and energy
you can put into creating an issue
before you submit it that said we don't
want to scare people off from creating
issues by creating a wall of protocol so
if you don't have time and you think you
genuinely discovered something err on
the side of creating an issue please
while we're talking about the wiki I
wanted to show you some cool things so
I'll let me see if I can pull it up
bonfire wiki template so this is just a
taste of things to come many of you have
already been using camper bot I hope you
all find camera BOTS to be really
helpful I'm actually going to take a
look at the questions I'm sure you you
all have some questions but i just want
to show you very quickly that we plan to
have kind of a hint system for our
bonfires where if you hit a wall you
simply can't get through it you can go
into the chat and ask for bonfire hint
and actually i think i have this open
here so you can see that like campers
have been asking for hints and it'll
will like it'll give some basic hints
right now we're just playing around with
the functionality but this is coming
soon pretty soon it'll actually
give you a series of hints up to the
actual solution to that bonfire if you
really cannot do it you can actually
even pull up the solution and it'll even
have a code explanation so one of the
things we're doing right now is we're
actively trying to expand the number of
wiki articles and you can see that we've
got 357 wiki articles many of these are
created by rafael rodriguez and in new
york and we're going to actively
continue to expand these so that camper
but gets more and more helpful and so
that camper bot is better able to fetch
content for you and we'll be creating
some additional wiki articles on using
camp robot effectively as well very
quickly before we get to questions the
one last thing I want to talk about is
that we have created some new chat rooms
for a variety of things that I just want
to quickly highlight oh these are all
news so they may not be very active yet
but they will hopefully eventually be
quite active the first one that I want
to talk about is coding jobs which I'll
just open right here so coding jobs is a
place where campers talk about getting
coding jobs interviewing all of those
things that are involved and getting a
job that don't necessarily have to do
with coding itself but have to do with
proving that to an employer that you're
capable of coding so yes we do have a
chat room where we we talked about that
and we talked about you know how to read
a job posting we talked about all these
things so we're going to create a lot of
wiki articles and hopefully you all will
help us create a lot of great wiki
articles about this stuff too is
obviously at the end of your study or
throughout your study you'll probably
want to be going out networking and
applying for jobs just get better at
applying for jobs and and hopefully to
get a job early on so that you can work
and continue to learn and basically get
paid to learn that's the ideal situation
another room that we have that has been
pretty
popular is that you can do this room
learning to code is hard and it takes a
lot of effort and a lot of motivation I
mean learning the code is really a
motivational challenge it's much more of
a motivational challenge than an
intellectual challenge because anyone
who can sit down and put in the time and
the effort and really focus on learning
the code in practice can learn to code
you see this time and time again people
coming from completely different walks
of life learning the code going on and
getting a coding job so we created this
you can do this room where people can
kind of come in and talk about their
feelings and any self-doubt that may
feel and just basically keep each other
motivated that's very important and we
even have a you can do this facebook
group as well that I can link to later
that basically people just throw up
these you know motivational articles and
facts about learning to code it's pretty
exciting another room I wanted to talk
about is we have our live coding room
and as you know we stream on Twitch
uh-huh you are probably watching this on
Twitch you may be watching this on
youtube later which is fine but we have
a lot of campers who stream and we're
always trying to get more campers
streaming and if you join this room live
coding you will be able to better
participate in a lot of the upcoming
streams and will even help you will get
will hop on a call with you and help you
help you actually get streaming because
it's not like a snap your fingers type
process it does take a little bit of
time and then we also have the code
review room where you can give and
receive constructive criticism regarding
your code which is pretty fun I mean you
can see Briana was active in here a few
hours ago so there's a lot
opportunity to share your work and just
get feedback on whatever you happen to
be doing we have the halfway Club which
is a prestigious Club of people who have
finished free code camp completely
essentially they finish everything but
the nonprofit projects they finish all
the base jumps all the zip lines all the
bonfires and are ready to start doing
the nonprofit projects then we also have
the wiki room where people can discuss
and coordinate expanding the wiki and we
also have an issues room where we can
potentially talk about issues again this
is a very new room I don't even know if
it's in heavy use we have a data science
room where campers are talking about
using data public data from free code
camp to glean insights about how we can
how we can do things better selectivity
graphing they're actually further up off
i think it was out for a week's period
and one of them had graphed the usage I
think the high stay with juice I think
they found the highest day is Tuesday
that totally jives with what what I've
seen from google analytics I can scroll
up and try to find it but I don't think
it's too far up and you know
approximately when they posted it was it
in August oh yes in August I like to
meet up to fire back I think this
probably cannot expand this but we
forever there was an expandable your
passes was it in grandma's wing Asia
yeah with an image that right was a
photograph that have been rented thank
you could have been a cold pan it was
cool anyway oh that one there the color
payoff from frontier all right let's
take a look at this this is our data in
a wild ok this is activity human
messages in the FCC of channel we've got
a nice graph we can see it's fighting
certain periods of time I don't know why
I was flat here they must have not
sampled that section of data but these
are the khazi I'm sorry what
flac that period I think that's probably
exactly what happened this is when we
were using slack and then we switch back
to github her to get her um okay I
couldn't be happier with that decision
by the way now that we have I mean slack
bought was a pale comparison to how
awesome camera bodies and of course we
had DC to thank and many other campers
who contributed to that if you want to
help expand camera BOTS you can do that
as well and then we have a room to talk
about design in general if you are
interested in doing web design or you
user experience design or visual design
graphic design the other types of
different design out there and
importantly we we have this room called
book club and this is where we're going
to talk about a variety of different
coding books because free code camp is
just one resource there are many many
many excellent resources out there and
we don't want you to think that free
coke camp by itself will teach you
absolutely everything because that
nothing can but but there are just a
huge range of free resources out there
as well so this is just some of them and
they're also some excellent podcasts and
video series in addition to books and so
we've got this list that we published a
few months ago of free resources which
I'll drop in the chat which I'm going to
go to the chat right now actually I
accidentally closed it so unfortunately
i don't have the chat log leading up to
now so if you have a question we're
running a little bit over time but
that's okay if you have a question at
this point i think now would be a great
time list that we for us to to go over
it where's the chat okay here it is
great I'm the last post in book club
okay cool thanks barn black so everyone
watching who has questions about what
we've talked about today questions about
the future of free code camp please feel
free to post them in our questions
section right here
in the meantime was there anything else
Ben or berkeley did either you gentlemen
wanted to talk about and I have I could
talk about my list of work I need to get
an today when the Pope could be new and
upcoming challenges zoom in close to be
honest and so I do have an actual
workflow and I really live here now
so at the moment we have a section on
AJAX that is funded construction you can
see it in Cedar directing on the key
hook and and it is very very young it
needs a bit of work it's effectively
gosh I think this girl then Quincy fed
off at Skelton and I'm gonna have to go
and transform into actual calendar so
for all the people who were confused
upset there's nothing on api's consume
the good news it is in fact going and
after that I was thinking it in a big
more on the base jase section out of it
watching that expands and things make it
it'll probably get more like it'll end
up with exponents of challenges who
knows am but it's currently thing since
in a 56 without looking and Ole Miss
price tesco stood 70 80 90 100 by the
end of the year ending on how much x
plantings cs6 text before in sports
doesn't fear to and the final thing is
the object oriented and functional
programming section which is quite
sparse the moment it's 11 challenges and
all it really is it's the Handy are
jointed methods in social matters that I
found useful when doing the vampires i
think is 11 challenges mental sing like
Map Reduce filter which are critical to
some of them otherwise it's they become
horrifically large loop two nested weird
recursion and so they if you're stuck on
bonfire or you're looking to just get a
bit better and you aren't familiar those
methods that is certainly something
worth checking out and it's soon to get
a lot bigger I hope and but again I have
to do just refreshed for yesterday and I
was also thinking those zip line that's
slightly tinkly doing it's going to be
like a small type of game king and but I
haven't caught much
part a recession today yes that's better
maybe and if people have suggestions
like I said earlier feel free to message
me in Gator and because even if students
suggestion isn't taken with the whole
section it might be stopping with
current challenges there's also talks
about d3.js and I spent the entire day
yesterday looking at the grass that's
not a website because I'm weird like
that and I love those kind of things and
there is a react curriculum incoming
it's currently not being made it isn't
coming though and so people are looking
for go to sorcery act hope you will be
the best one because i don't think the
actually is one at the moment
unfortunately no there there might be
some videos on you to me like some paid
resources but to my knowledge there's no
really good like certainly free resource
and any even if there is is probably not
interactive like the Ducks the best to
be honest the official documents the
mayor a bit daunting to begin if and so
that is for me that's my if you like to
do lift for future if you like and if
people were curious to know what's there
were kind of ETA on challenges from what
planners and so hopefully they'll get
people excited and if people see other
people ask me that the chat you can
refer them to the hotel they must comin
up that is basically my plan to the
recipe if i can to get those kind of
cool challenges eggs that are going to
get people hopefully with a bit more
useful knowledge taking used to base
jump zip lines and we can kind of bridge
that gap a bit better between those in
the bonfires great and just just so
everybody knows um I've been doing the
instructional design up until this point
or up until recently I did one hundred
percent of the instructional design
myself but now been is really starting
to come in and he and I are kind of
working on a lot of these challenges
together and a lot of them he literally
created the JavaScript curriculum like
though I think I created maybe the first
ten challenges and he created the rest
of it and then we just worked together
to kind of refine it and polish it and
it's still being polished our philosophy
is ship early done is better than
perfect
as you may have seen that little thing
in the recent blog post we definitely
feel that way so this is an open source
project things are evolving please don't
panic if you see complete added
challenges behind what you've already
done you can go back and do those if you
want you don't have to just keep moving
but note that everything we're doing is
because we want to make free code camp
better and we want free code camp to be
the best place to learn to code in the
world I think we can get there I mean in
many respects arguably we're already
there so one thing a lot of people ask
me about free code camp before we get to
questions is they say like hey can i
donate money to free code camp or you
know can can I get some arrangements
from for free code camp to be able to
have this resource for free things like
that I really appreciate the goodwill
that everybody's channeling our way if
you're really interested in helping
there are two clear ways that you can
help the first of course is by
contributing directly to our open source
project through pull requests but the
second way that is much more immediate
that literally anyone can do is just
please go out and tell your friends
about free code camp free code camp does
not advertise we probably I mean aside
from our Twitter Facebook and my quora
posts like we really don't do any
outreach at all like the only way that
people will hear about free code camp is
if you tell them about free coke can so
please go out and tell your friends
anyone you know who might be interested
in learning the code and getting a
coding job or even like beefing up their
coding skills so they can improve their
current career which a lot of our
campers do that they get promotions
within their companies because suddenly
there are so much more productive
because they're able to code in addition
to doing what they previously did so
anyone you think that might benefit
please tell them about us please
invite your friends to our campsites on
facebook if you think people in your
city would be interested in coming to
coding related events invite them to our
open facebook groups like literally
anybody can join those groups they're
open and that would be great with that I
think we should get two questions so um
what I'm going to do is I since I
announced the questions I'm going to
scroll back up and we're just going to
go ahead and scroll through here to get
somebody commented that i don't have a
beard my in-laws are in town and they
think they're they're chinese and they
think that beards are unbecoming and
they claim that i look homeless like
homeless San Francisco Quincy when they
see me with a beard so I bowed to
pressure and shaved but I will grow the
beard out once they're gone is it
possible to restrict camera BOTS
responses to be visible only to the user
camp robot is responding to Berkeley
bend you do either you want to talk
about that I I could am but I'm not like
directly involved to the project and
sadly I'd like to do a bit of course you
know chance it's gay and that kind of
stuff but I am the problem with that is
concurrency de moment so there's two
problems River constancy is difficult
enough to have the best times but I
think it could be done the biggest issue
was dynamic that we have where I am the
Gators API is that if they were actually
anything messaged one of those niggas
you Quincy and they said can provide has
gone nuts with the API it's joining a
tails and rims wanna go or something it
was too high daylight anyway so the
issue with a private message is that
each private message you actually your
room was only two people innocence the
way it actually works each room is it's
each pro messages its own individual
room so that would mean camera bus if he
high when camp was booted up if we join
every single room which would easily be
in the peasants considering this 20,000
people in the main chat room and a
ninety eight ninety k recently there in
the free camp overall and so the problem
would therefore be if they
ap I would instigate a lemon cut off
campus and I have that before you have
an issue with a fall once just so people
know at all doesn't work for know if
that works admins if you for trying that
actually doesn't work and but I think I
deliciously like a test see I wanted to
work thanks Pat off nobody got Brandi
points but camera but didn't like it and
I actually thought them ambush yes so
there's issues with throughput and get
event and we don't want to be like
upsetting them by bombarding it with
this automatic thing there is people
we'd like to I know DC wants to have a
so that private messages work like one
for him to be like nice if you hit hint
I just asked you to hint they're sending
you another room but and at the moment
the issue is with joining 20k closed
rooms just isn't something's going to
happen and I think there is a redesign
in progress or like work being done to
make just wait for notifications and use
that kind of workflow but I've not done
yet if it is being done am so you know
we're sorry it doesn't work that way but
there's not much we can really do what
I've changing the way get away moving
arrangements though thanks for the
comprehensive answer so yeah hopefully
we'll fix that eventually ideally camper
wat would interact through private
messages but I mean I I don't think it's
too big of a deal it does make the chat
room a little bit noisier but you know
you shouldn't be ashamed to ask for help
that's that's one of the key things like
if you're asking camper bought for help
or if you're using camper about to pull
up a wiki article to show somebody else
you know we're all about transparency
you've watched me stream and I make lots
of mistakes and and if if I can make
lots of mistakes is a relative you know
relatively experienced developer then
then you can assume that pretty much
everybody makes mistakes so don't be
bashful about asking camper bought for
help if that's if that's the issue um so
I think it's camp about it's fairly
quiet actually it's not the biggest
problem that hot dogs with tanks it's
very quick to correct people ahead
correctly thanks command
am so if you put like even TN KS in
anywhere anything goes by the way you
use after thanks from directing yeah
which is okay it probably could be
returned down but like awesome that is
very much with only 12 speak when spoken
to you now yeah yeah because we don't
want slack but type interaction where
it's constantly messaging people or like
saying things constantly responding an
unwelcome artificial kind of saccharine
way so so yeah we're going to try to
keep camper bot very much like camp
Rogers hangs out and listens for
commands and goes and handles those
commands like the computer you seen Star
Trek I mean the computer in Star Trek
doesn't suddenly start like dropping
interesting tidbits in the middle of
your conversation the computer does what
you ask it to do when you ask it to do
it and that's kind of like many people's
vision like certainly Google's vision
for the future of artificial
intelligence and um the kinds of
interactions and that's how we want
camera BOTS to be so the next question
SID Gupta asked an excellent question
can we skip the projects and complete
the rest of the map first or should we
follow the given order strictly please
feel free to jump around if that's what
you feel so inclined to do of course we
are spending a ton of time and energy
trying to make the challenges flow and
trying to make everything of consistent
difficulty increase like just like a
good video game you don't go and like it
doesn't suddenly spiked in like you have
a ridiculously hard boss and then it
goes back to really easy gameplay like
that's bad right like you want to keep
things consistently increasing in
difficulty at a sane rate and that's how
we're trying to design freako camps
curriculum so if you want to jump around
and just I mean you can go straight to
the zip lines if you want to actually do
the nonprofit projects or if you want to
get the certificates you'll actually
need to complete the required challenges
and for the for the front-end
certificate which I apologize we haven't
implemented it yet we're working on it
that means completing the first
basically all the way up through the
intermediate zip lines if you complete
the end remaining zip lines and all the
things before that you can get a
front-end development certificate the
full stack certificate we're going to
start giving it will no longer require
completion of a non-profit project that
will be optional of course we strongly
recommend the nonprofit projects and
we're starting some new ones right now
but basically if you simply complete all
the the full curriculum that the first
800 hours then you will be eligible for
a full stack certificate of course we're
going to do our due diligence to verify
you didn't plagiarize or anything like
that because it's critically important
that you write your own code on all of
these challenges and we will verify
those things before we issue
certificates um let's take a look at
some other questions do do you guys see
any questions in the chat that jump out
at you at one person was mentioning
let's go try to scroll your window one
press mentioned merchandise someone else
mentioned at your beard again I'm
someone else wants microtransactions
friends microtransactions for hints yeah
there are a lot of there are a lot of
good ideas I'm here we probably will
skip money completely like no
involvement of money no tipping of other
campers just because what we're trying
to create here is what I'll call a
goodwill economy where basically it's
not about money it's about time you're
volunteering your time to someone to
help them in the challenge which room
you know and and you know your brownie
points in many respects is
representation of how hard you've worked
on the curriculum and how many people
you've helped in in the chat room and
you know how many interesting things
you've shared on Camp renews money is a
completely separate thing that we don't
really want to get too involved with but
on the topic of merchandising
merchandising merchandising if you
haven't seen space
there's this hilarious Mel Brooks he's
dressed up as Yoda it's great that's an
awesome scene where we do plan to create
some cool free code camp t-shirts and
sell those and so maybe even free code
camp hood ease and mugs and stuff like
that of course that's just like if you
want to support us and if you want to
get cool schwag we will will throw that
up we have the designer of all the free
code camp assets I think you've ever
seen like everything on free code camp
calm all that art was designed by a
gentleman named Ryan mall who is in
Omaha Nebraska he's quite a skilled a
illustrator and designer and he's
creating some some cool designs and
we're gonna do some exciting stuff with
that next month probably where you vote
for which design should be the first
free coke and t-shirt for example copper
 t-shirts for the win yeah we'll see
camp Ramon may be incorporated but these
will probably be original designs and
we'll just put it to a vote within the
community and then then if you want you
can get a free code camp t-shirt and it
should be pretty cool and that should
give us a little bit of money because
we'd much rather like give you
everything for free preco camps never
going to charge anybody to use free code
camp we're never going to charge the
nonprofit's we're never going to sell
your data we're never going to hopefully
never put up ugly banner ads or anything
like that like if we can have t-shirts
on the side and people can buy t-shirts
and that gives us enough money to keep
our servers spinning and you know the
core contributors like beating burritos
at least like that's good for the
shorter term so that's definitely
something we're interested in doing
let's see what else is coming on upgrade
to Eric Elliot level j/s developer only
two thousand nine hundred ninety nine
dollars that sounds like a pretty good
udemy course if you want to create a you
to me course all you need to do is have
it be free friday and promote it on
reddit and then the next day you just
set the price to two thousand nine
hundred ninety nine dollars and say
thousands of people have taken this
course
you should pay two thousand nine hundred
ninety nine dollars to do so too so at
one good question i saw in festus
christmas contributed a few times
scenario i was wondering how do they get
added to a contributor group how do you
get added to a contributor group well
excellent question berkeley and i have
talked about this a lot berkeley did we
create that document that wiki article
yet or more is huge yes yeah do we do we
create that yet the issue mother humara
andrews wiki okay great let me find that
i'll drop that on a chat wiki let's see
issue moderator oh I'll just searching
just issue dash mom okay so issue mods
so Berkeley off of this 16 hours ago
it's pretty recent so I'll just drop
this in the chat but yeah essentially we
have been a chancre and abuse act or
who's the other boss right right now if
you've been okay so we can add
additional people to that have been
actively helping moderate our issues and
we say moderate basically they're
commenting and getting more information
and they're determining whether they're
duplicates and they're closing issues
that are no longer relevant for example
and they're trying to do so in this
flight a manner as possible that's one
of the requirements is if you comment on
issues please please be very polite keep
in mind that many issues it's like the
person who created that issue it's their
first time to ever create a get up issue
but but I posted that in the chat so you
can check that out can we get time in
UTC of the live stream somebody asked
that's a good question I'll be honest
about eighty percent well about fifty
percent of freako camps campers right
now are in the United States and about
two-thirds of people in the United
States live you
in live on the East Coast so that's why
we do all of our times in eastern
standard time is because like probably a
good forty percent of our thirty percent
of our campers are like that's their
local time so they don't even have to
think about everybody else has to think
about I I mean even though berkeley and
i are in san francisco we still put
eastern standard time and we just adapt
to that we do it for the utilitarian
reason that that seems to be where most
people are that are currently using free
cocaine of course as we grow as a
community that will cease to exist and
it sometime in the future UTC mechanic
better sense but I don't even know what
UTC time zone I'm in frankly I just
don't really use UTC your unique time
time yeah just using unix timestamp then
everybody can go and using unix
timestamp converter actually that won't
address that won't address the timezone
issue though will it because that's just
like a unique time time time time time
their their standard okay we just pick a
number of seconds into the future yeah
so we can do what we can do is like to
not have to use that will just say free
coke camps live stream will start in you
know six 2543 seconds or something like
that yeah definitely there's a widget
and Google for converting things you can
do it whatever so a one thing VMA ft to
gmt and it don't straight away for your
tab don't have to go to his life so i
use this thing you can probably see my
screen i use this thing called figure it
out and it just shows me some different
relevant time zones and all at gmt here
free i have a big butt in like yeah is
that like so is it yeah yeah it's fine
no naka machi united states I think
that's just BS to define BSC is is that
is that the meantime basically is where
is a Dublin Stephanie on gmt anyway con
tu such a ladies um oh my gosh they
don't have UTC in this app okay that's a
that's an issue request or I'm going to
create an issue there cuz they should
we have that so we're like way way over
time uh let's let's just keep going
through these questions real quick I
want to answer as many as possible
anyone have a really hard time with the
bonfires yes that's why we're creating
the bonfires camp rubato hints what
about code we write when working with
another camper well on our free code
camp you you have the option of
including them as your pair and
basically the code will be continued
attributed to both you and the person
who pair programmed on and that starts
with the bonfires and that also includes
the zip lines and the base jumps so we
do encourage pair programming and if you
do it you don't need to like go and have
the other person sets submit a duplicate
thing if you pair program with somebody
and you listed as pair programming then
we're going to assume that you did it
together and that's totally cool it's
totally cool to collaborate on code what
we don't want is you googling like
bonfire solution blah blah blah
mutations and grabbing the solution and
pasting it in and submitting it and
moving on like we don't want people to
do that obviously the solutions are all
over the place we're even throwing the
solutions up ourselves and we're just
having a spoiler alert but you should be
writing your own code it's it's like the
old aphorism if you cheat the only
person you're cheating is yourself and
that's how we feel it free coke camp
we're not going to try to prevent that
sort of stuff because honestly it's it's
up to you only you confirm it cheating
is there any way of elevating my brownie
pool how do i check my brownie points so
if you just go to free code camp column
and if you're signed in in the upper
right hand corner you'll see your
brownie flights and one interesting
thing that seems we put up as a people
as one price of manningham try to
reddish that where they were lamenting
the word that he used about the fact
that people noobs 420 I was here being
thrown into non-profit projects and
taking jobs away from pay developers and
then leaving bad code for and follow up
with and I thought I just quickly
comment on that is that I don't know if
this decay shindig
protect me right here when I'm based on
island I'm amazing 60 because this is
your world that very few people actually
understand why programming is what
developing is what any of this means
there are a huge number of squaw like a
snake oil salesman who claim to know
what they're doing and trash get
ridiculous money solutions that they
don't need or aren't worth as much as
they're charging and they have really
really bad on rent amber code and
there's people who make living out of
fixing these issues I know I've done
free work for people with WordPress
where a developer has done really sloppy
job with the code base and used to go
through regulation try and reverse and
here to fix it and using their sloppy
system so I think dash it leads you to
go into freako camp they have a certain
minimum quality standard because we have
we met you before they go into
nonprofits and then the nonprofit sounds
that are happy with the solution and
that we actually do check if it's not a
steaming pile of whatever am so there is
like a minimum quality guaranteed so
it's not like these people I got they
don't have college degrees they don't
have 20 years experience but what they
do have is they have a good standard of
programming in JavaScript and then else
use note they know how to use bootstrap
down to use all new technologies which
are really common and create a really
nice solution and so that'll be my
response to people who complain about
people being furnished not to mention
that anyone who goes to the boot camp is
technically the same except they haven't
done a nonprofit project for am so and
they regarded as being great so I think
we're guaranteeing a bit more yeah and
just on that note we definitely want to
help nonprofits if you know nonprofits
that are interested in getting some
precoding work done please send them our
way we have a non-profit project page
where they can sign up we want to help
nonprofit projects I just want to point
out though that free code camp is first
and foremost for campers not for
nonprofits nonprofits are a means to
and they are a way for our campers to
get real life hands-on expectable
experience working with either legacy
code or building something from scratch
and doing it in an agile environment and
basically getting the full kind of
sprint by sprint workflow down and it's
two campers working together it's a
agile project manager it's a stakeholder
from a non-profit who deeply understands
the problem that our campers are trying
to solve it's basically the equivalent
of like you know a contract job that you
would get on up work or a project that
you would do working at you know like a
big development consultancy essentially
you're going to have this project and
you're going to do it so it's extremely
good practical experience for our
campers that's why we do it we do want
to help nonprofits but are our primary
customer if you will for the nonprofit
projects is not the nonprofit's it's
it's the campers and we'll look out for
the campers best interest in that and
and for that reason we're extremely
selective about whom we help we're not
going to and we're not going to solve
every single nonprofits problem but we
will be able to solve a lot of problems
for a lot of good proven nonprofits who
know exactly what they want and know
exactly what their end users need so
please do tell them about this if they
just go to free code camp column /
nonprofits or if there's a prominent
button from free coke cans a column if
you're not authenticated let me show you
it's right here my nonprofit needs to
coding help and that'll take them here
and then they can just it takes like two
seconds to fill out this google form and
then there they'll get a response from
us within a few days and again we're
really selective about that so don't
worry all the non profits you're going
to work with or going to be very well
vetted and it's not going to be a waste
of your time we're going to do
everything we can to make sure that's
the case real quick J comic right
Cronkite said that he sees a lot of
other related but unaffiliated
groups that would benefit from knowing
about free code camp please tell tell
your local coderdojo group tell your
local hackerspace all these different
organizations we want to provide a cool
curriculum and a supportive online
community to supplement their activities
free code camp is all about helping
people and just increasing the volume of
people out there that are coding well
and and understand best practices and
feel confident in their coding ability
because we've got this massive skill gap
this massive shortfall of people that
actually are good at coding that is
basically holding back government in
many countries I mean you look at like
the whole healthcare.gov debacle I mean
that's basically just bad software
engineering practices because there
aren't enough good software engineers
and they're not running the place like
they should be so so we just want to
increase the total aggregate software
engineering talent in the world that's
our goal so we are happy to work with
anybody who's also aligned in that
direction and it doesn't matter if they
make money they whatever they do we
don't really care we just want to help
um let's see any other questions they
jumped out at you all teaching fish an
interesting my life yeah I think we've
got a big ones and I someone asked
another one quick and popping at the end
I think we've caught everything but I
think we've got everything so um very
quickly BST apparently is gmt +1 so if
you have British Standard Time that's
essentially one hour faster than gmt for
those who were curious I learned
something there
um all right well I think we've talked
about a whole lot of different things
today just to recapitulate what we
discussed we talked about our simplified
portfolio pages talked about our code
storage functionality a lot of these
things are still being improved actively
camper news Creative Commons licenses
please go hog-wild with our logo feel
free to mash it up with whatever cartoon
characters or memes Luke detection works
thank you very much for fixing that
Berkeley and Ben and bonfire hints are
coming soon please contribute to our
wiki please submit pull requests and of
course please tell everyone you know
that you think would benefit from
knowing about free code camp because
it's just the saddest thing in the world
when people are like oh why haven't I
heard about this like I've been trying
to learn on my own for like the last
year or two or I guess if it was more
than ten months than they wouldn't have
heard about its anyway because we're
only 10 months old but just tell people
about us and send them our way and we
will do everything we can to make sure
they do not have a negative experience
and that they do not regret you telling
them about this if anything they'll
probably be like wow you just saved me a
ton of time and energy so thank you very
much everyone for tuning in to this to
this live stream and we will be
streaming a lot more in the coming weeks
also just a quick note you probably
already read the blog post if you didn't
i'll just post it in here we just really
wanted to come out and thank everyone
for bearing with us last week with the
slowness of the page and some of the
issues we do not plan to roll out
massive sweeping changes like we did
ever again hopefully like hopefully
it'll all be done incrementally
Berkeley's been hard at work creating a
kind of a workflow and deployment
practices that will allow us to rapidly
get code into production so we don't
have this huge bubble of features
waiting to be pushed so thank you
everyone for your understanding thank
you everyone who submitted ish
who helped us quickly detect and fix a
lot of the problems we still have about
300 issues but we have about 30 pull
request to look at two so if anybody
wants to stick around and keep watching
we'll continue to do some pull request
will will turn on some music and we'll
just keep cranking but this concludes
our official live stream so thank you
again everyone for tuning I won't thing
I thought I'd mention quickly before
people go is that I am Quincy's at
Quincy lurex an alligator I'm a Democrat
and 100 and prairies are practically
true and we are on there pretty much all
the time at poor Quincy has a better
trillion messages so he might not be
able to read for them as quickly to me
in berkeley can but if you have like a
pressing thing or a suggestion that you
would like to either take the challenges
i'll take them and also my get it looks
like right now is I need to go through
all this sorry if i'm slow to respond
yes i'm going to go ahead and just post
post those in berkeley true berkeley is
essentially our CTO he's like making a
lot of the infrastructural decisions ben
is a thing mcmahon 100 is a instrumental
to our curriculum development and also a
lot of our feature development and then
me Quincy Larson if you message me I
will respond in fact I do basically all
the support so if you're asking for help
with something chances are you're
talking to me unless you're doing in an
issue went in which case you could be
asking you know dealing with anybody but
I answer the emails i responded the
tweets sorry i haven't been responding
very regularly recently and i also am
available on facebook and certainly on
Quora my favorite place other than free
code camp so thank you all for tuning in
if you haven't subscribed please again I
think followed us click click the follow
button if you haven't subscribe to us on
youtube click the subscribe button and
that way you'll get notifications when
we push new content out so we're going
to go down for about 45 seconds I'm
going to make a pit stop I'll be right
back and I'll start doing some poor
requests
berkeley been your are you interested in
sticking around for that I gotta go I
gotta help my brother move panic room
alright how about you been can you stick
around I got high ranch are ya great all
right well buerkle thank you very much
for joining us Ben and I'll be right
back we're going to stop the stream so
