berkeley would you like to start by
introducing yourself sure hey everybody
my name is Berkeley and I am the
developer guy here at three coke in all
right great and you're where are you
based berkeley i'm currently in foggy
San Francisco sorry fun today awesome I
murugesh yeah hi everyone good afternoon
good evening good morning and i am
rajesh i'm a coating member at free code
camp and i'm based out of pune india
pune india ok wonderful thank you very
much for joining us mortgage so we have
a lot to show case today we've got a lot
of exciting things going on at free coke
camp i'm going to go ahead and pop the
agenda up over here so we are going to
talk about first of all the survey that
we're conducting yep and survey is very
exciting to me especially because i'm a
huge i'm hugely curious about who is
learning to code and how they're going
about doing it and the survey answers a
lot of those questions so what i'm going
to do is I'm going to share in the chat
I'll just go to our medium article if
you haven't read it yet we have an
article that basically talks about we've
got a series of articles one that talks
about how we created the article are the
survey and what the survey is attempting
to learn about people who are learning
to code and another is some of the
outcomes so far so initially we had a
whole lot of people respond that we're
interested in interested in helping
visualize some of the data that we've
obtained from the survey so what I have
in the article is basically very simple
bar charts
that are looking at all of the responses
across the responses and what we'll get
when we get more granular which we're
trying to do is understanding
individuals who responded and so for
example we could look at all of the
people who responded from the United
States together as a cohort and figure
out like specific attributes of them or
we could figure out everyone who had
military service and then we can start
to come up with some cool questions
which i'm going to show you real quick
so if we go to if we go to the survey
i'll go and show the repository real
quick so this is our new cutter survey
repository we have the data in here
which is entirely too large for github
to display it but it's it's six megabyte
CSV file which is a very large
spreadsheet essentially comma separated
values and then if you go into the
issues we have a whole lot of questions
so there are some questions that I've
asked there are some questions that
other people have come forward to ask
just from our community so we can see
for example how much time has a
respondent spent learning to code how
much has the app average respondent who
has gotten a job spent so we one of the
questions we asked is whether you've
gotten a job and how many months you've
been studying and things like that so we
can figure out how long people who have
gotten a job generally have spent
learning to code versus people who have
not yet gotten a job we can try to
identify maybe a point at which people
are likely to start getting jobs
statistically age breakdown / country I
suspect in certain countries that are
younger people like the age is going to
be slightly lower like I know for
example in a lot of Asia and the Middle
East population tends to be younger I
suspect the average respondent ages can
be younger than in Europe and
United States and then we've got a whole
lot of other questions we're asking
salary expectations is one of the
questions we asked a number of
dependents how many kids you have
whether you have chosen to go to a
coding boot camp for example how that
worked out for you we're going to be
asking a whole lot of questions or we've
already asked these questions but we're
going to basically be trying to tease
the answers to these questions out of
our fifteen thousand rows in our data
set so right now what we're doing is
we're cleaning all the data and making
it as easy as possible to work with and
then our goal is to eventually put it
into put it into a sandbox so let me
show you something called DCJS we may
eventually build this after we first
we're going to build some interactive
visualizations but DCJS is really quite
cool because you can basically you have
all the data in here and you can just
transform it you can you can look at
different things than the data will
change depending on which different
attributes you've selected so it's a
very cool way to create kind of an
interactive data visualization that a
lot of people can play with then some
other things we're working on regarding
this are just getting the rest of the
data out and creating an actual website
that will show creating a website that
will show what the data look like so
you'll be able to infer different
properties of the typical person who's
learning the code from these
visualizations
so that's a the the new cutter survey
2016 we just finished it we just
published some of the responses which I
think I posted in the chat i'll post one
more time real quick
yeah I think you can say since there is
a bit of a lag you know people would
have a little bit of a delay in
answering your questions okay this
message nuts and air try again so it
doesn't look like it's allowing me to
send messages well this is like really
not worth watching YouTube is sucking is
what one person said so i'm not sure why
there's so much lag let me make sure
that I'm not dropping frames yep
Quincy's not just like we're it's also
constantly freezing it's crazy I'm blind
as wall okay now i don't know if it's
youtube maybe we should try reduce yeah
listen let's try let's try turning off
some video i'm gonna yep i want to turn
off roguish and berkeley if you can stop
sharing your video what i'm going to do
is I'm going to relaunch OBS I'm just
going to quit it and restart it and
maybe that'll help fix it I'll be right
back
okay so we should be back thank you
everyone for your patience it doesn't
look like it's dropping any frames now
sometimes you just get like a bad
connection or wherever it starts
dropping frames so yeah now that we're
back I would like to hand it over to
Ragesh to talk about our efforts to
simplify free coke camps authentication
yep thanks Quincy so I would though you
know start by sharing the screen yes
please so yeah so if you see okay I hope
you can see my screen yes I can see
perfect awesome so what we have done is
early of you to lick we have we get a
ton of issues with people like logging
in from Facebook or Twitter or other
social channels and they just simply
forget the last sign in method and the
next time they sign in they do it
through a different method and end up
creating a different account so and it's
a and because the user names can be
different the emails on the social
accounts can be different it is really
not feasible enough to you know link
everything together and have a robust
solution to manage all the social
networks at our end so to reduce that
what we have decided is that we would be
doing away with the chill networking
logins and we would just be doing it
through either email or by our github so
the older logins are still available for
people who use them earlier who
initially signed up using those those
those channels and it's available as a
link on the sign-in page if you click on
the sign in page it's still available as
a link and if you click there you can
still log in from one of those methods
the only thing is if you visit this page
now and you click on a link and you
haven't ever signed up using Twitter it
would just simply show you that you are
not allowed to do it anymore and you
should do it in
instead by a github or by email so this
is a change that we have done and if you
go ahead and sign up with github okay
people are saying it's stuck together
let me let me take a look at it so I'm
not dropping any frames I don't know why
it's stuck this time but people are
saying stuff refresh when it gets stuck
okay sorry about that everybody if it
seems to get stuck my recommendation
would be to refresh and that should fix
it I don't know why it's having these
difficulties again this is our first
time doing this on youtube so we're
working out a lot of bugs still so thank
you very much for your patience ok
please continue mortgage yep so what I
was saying is that now you can log in to
get up and sign up through guitar or
just via email and I just sign out once
again just in case anybody missed it so
I will to rear their end I can either
say enough about or 10 today signed up
to get up certain time and it will drive
it to my page and log me in so instead
of the social network King logins we are
now moving into email and get up now we
have also added a new feature that in
case for example in the case of this
account this account does not a female
and associated with its get up get up
profile or the email addresses or the
email address is set privately one thing
which free code camp does is it won't
ever ask you to share your private
details or private portfolio or anything
with us so for that what we have done is
we have allowed you an option over here
that you do not have an email ID you can
update it from your settings page so you
will be getting a notification if you do
not have your email it would be
something like this that you do not have
your email updated and please update it
in the settings you can visit your
settings page click it click the button
over there
enter your email what okay and and when
you click update your email you get a
notification that your email has been
updated set successfully and when you
visit your settings you should have it
right there and you should have your
notification settings for email as well
so you know you can subscribe to those
awesome mails from Quincy and this is
actually really necessary for us because
managing so many users / over the
database is really tricky and we want to
make it as simple as possible for the
users just to log in and save their
profiles save their progress on the
challenges over over over the database /
/ the Free bootcamps website so this is
a change that we have done and going for
what we are going to introduce is that
as you see on the honest I paid as a
sign in page one you can see there are
two links right now for email one is
sign in with email and one another is
sign up with email so here you will see
that there is a feel for the password
you know so there's a feel for the email
and password what we want to be doing is
we want to get rid of this password
altogether so people who are signing up
via email would just enter the email
they would be clicking it there would be
clicking sign in and they would be
receiving a link on their emails which
they can click and sign in once again
they never need to log out because we
will be persisting your logins so you
never need to log out and the only
access that you need are or the only
password that you need to remember is of
your emails you never need to remember
any passwords at all everyone free code
camp this is something we have taken as
an example what / is doing and Quincy
has shared a really good
post on medium about this maybe you
should read it and I guess quince you
can share that in the chat as well yep
so passwords are really boring stuff and
it's really horrible like you just saw i
had my passwords saved in a browser and
it is a it's really not a good it's
actually security threat because if if
something is broken somewhere it's
theoretically possible that people can
grab that password and it's not at all
safe so the best way to get it off wave
of it would be to simply remove the
password all together and just have
access to your email so all you need to
do is enter your email anytime you want
if you are signing up for the first time
you will have to go through another step
of verifying your email because we do
not want users to you know feeding some
fake email and they won't be receiving
the link in that case so if you are
signing up for the first time you will
be entering your email you would be
getting a verification link and you
would be logged in directly if you are
signing it if you have signed out and
the signing up signing in once again
then in that case you would every time
you would be receiving a link and you
can just click that and you will be
signed in once again we would never be
able will never log you out from outside
so the only way you will be logged out
is if you do it yourself like you click
on the Sign Out button or you clear your
cookies from your browser now which
which I tend to feel that very rarely
people do if they are on their personal
machines and in a way this is really
simplifying the authentication process
so that we have more number of users
actually saving their progresses on free
code camp and we have less number of
users who have their accounts abandoned
for some reason or the other because
they just couldn't figure out which
login method they used so stay tuned
we'll be having the password list
feature really short okay great thank
you very much previous for explaining
that so too just to recap what he said
we have a lot of people a lot of people
by far the most common thing that
happens is people are trying to login to
free code camp and the camera boy they
use Facebook or Google or Twitter
whether they use an email address or
github like we have so many
authentication options and if they click
through to the wrong one and its
associated with an email account that's
different from their current email
account that basically makes it to where
you move as you can stop showing your
screen sorry that basically makes it to
where they are unable to to get to the
account and their first reaction is
always oh man like my dad has been lost
what happened but in fact they just
accidentally created it a duplicate
account and and somebody posted this
excellent question on Quora a while back
and it shows like if a password is
stored in a browser if you walk up to
somebody's computer for example it's
unlocked in and you go to facebook com
chrome is going to automatically plug
the the password in there for example
and it's just like all you need to do is
go into its inspect element and change
the input type from password to just
nothing and it'll show their password so
it's it's extremely easy to get people's
passwords if you have access to their
computer passwords are easily guessed
they can be brute force there are all
these vulnerabilities around passwords
how do we fix that we get rid of
passwords completely that's what we're
trying to do at least with free coke
camp so we just don't need to worry
about people I mean you don't have to
worry about remembering the password
some of you use a password management
that's great but what if you want to log
in on your phone you don't have the
password manager installed on there so
this will basically be a very easy way
assuming you have access to your email
you will be able to log in and so we're
shifting all the authentication toward
the phone just be toward email just
because
so much more secure and securities
something we take really seriously a
free code camp by the way if you notice
any security vulnerabilities please let
us know message us and we will we will
attack them with vigor because we're
serious about security so next Berkeley
is going to talk a little bit about some
improvements he's done to the server you
may have noticed that a while back free
coke camp was extremely slow now free
coke camp is not so slow I think you'll
find it it operates quite quickly and
pretty much all of that is thanks to
Berkeley and two major fixes he did over
the last month berkeley would you like
to talk about those sure yeah hi
everybody um yeah so those major
slowdowns are a big pain they caused a
lot of stress and understand it user
experience just suffered so the
warranted a investigation into why that
was happening and it turns out that we
probably weren't using MongoDB to its
fullest potential it's the big to
improvements that we made is we reduce
the amount of data went back and forth
from the database of the server and from
the server to the database that freed up
a lot of bandwidth for the database but
not just in bandwidth it also reduced
the amount of processing that the mongo
DB server actually needed to do reducing
its overhead so that was a big win for
us the second and probably most
important change that we made is we
actually weren't indexing usernames for
some the indexing scripts failed but I
was able to manually add those indexing
and that was an extreme improvement
performance so much so that we do we've
been able to cut our server costs in
half at least our momiji server costs
not only is this occasion proven the
page load speed but it also reduces our
costs which increases our runway for
free cook camp and I think this is a
huge improvement what we used to do and
I think we can probably find a couple
more improvements courses with most
things as diminishing returns I think
maybe there's more to improvements that
we can make that won't see significant
increase in performance we'll see if we
actually go about making those income
soon so far it looks like we're just
cruising along at when we have peak
users me your aren't noticing any
slowdown so do you have the charts that
you were showing before the before and
after charts do you still have those
handy Berkeley ah let me see if I can
find you yeah you can you share your
screen on skype sure just make sure man
yeah I was scrolling through the chat
log trying to find them but if you have
them handy that would probably faster at
least all right so I'm gonna share my
screen I'll be sure i'm not sure
anything we shouldn't be sharing let me
know you can see when ice cream
okay I can see it yeah so I think this
was the meanest double check here I
think this is the index events as soon
as we had indexing see is a huge
improvement here just just huge downward
slope and you see where we're just
resting like this is our new rest so
essentially we've cut down like eighty
percent of what we're using a huge
improvement now I would pull it up on
digital but there are some IP addresses
that we can't show but now we rest that
like ten ten fifty percent even at matt
peke we're only seeing me two percent
increasing and the server processing
load so we could probably cut down the
servers again we might we might not
depending on how much how much how much
headroom want in case of a huge spike
yep that that drop is that drop is
really awesome because we have had
always this thing going on on the
mondays that you know free code can just
simply slows down like everybody takes
about three minutes or so just to you
know get around the pages and I don't
think that's the case any longer
probably after this awesome fixes by
berkeley so he's like the magician over
here it has a ton of really good
optimization to you know keep freako
free code camp running really fast and
smooth for everyone yeah and and people
Mugabe's is fantastic i think it is kind
of scary when you don't know what's
going on you don't really know what is
your background but it has been proven
is battle proven it is a very strong
database wow it's a very secure database
as long as you know what you're doing so
i've spent
so much time reading mommy-to-be docks
because this is just so much learned am
no index is really important
unfortunately are often linked Dixon
failed when I and I had failed to notice
that it failed so when i noticed that i
did fail i was able to add those in
pegasus so index is really important you
searching by user name is something we
do for almost every request yeah so fact
that index was not there yeah so we're
doing it we're doing it several times a
second so yeah yeah it is a pretty calm
actually I guess many people do not know
this like every request there are
there's a ton of stuff going in the
background for example if you just say
thanks to anybody on the main chat it's
going to request everybody and it's
going to search for the username and
then it's going to add the brown brownie
points to the user's profile so for
every request its ton of stuff that's
going in the background and when we
scale that to the proportion of the
users who are like especially on mondays
or you know peak days we these things
tend to happen but it's glad it's really
wonderful that now it has been you know
resolved quite a lot and UK the peak
which we see on birtley screen right now
speaks for itself yeah alright well
thank you for sharing that Berkeley so
next I'd like to talk about something as
I noticed somebody in chat was asking
when is freak okay i'm going to be
teaching things like go go is a very
popular programming well i will say is
very popular programming language it's
increasingly popular I mean there's
probably literally like a thousand times
more JavaScript development going on
right now then then go development but
like languages other than JavaScript how
would freak oh camp go about teaching
them well I want to show you something
that a couple of our campers our core
team members have put together
just open up this tab over here off this
over here so if we go to free coke camp
now I'm just going to go to our wiki and
we'll go ahead and go to a Python
article we do have a lot of articles
about Python here now so we'll go to
let's let's do the Python we can do
boolean operations okay so well we can
scroll through here and we can see that
there's there's a little bit of example
here and we go to another one for
example this Python absolute value so
abs is a is a method in Python let's go
ahead and we can click this button rep
lit and it'll load up our Python and we
can immediately run it in a rebel like
environment so I can just click run and
it'll run all my code and tell me the
absolute value of these numbers for
example so I could I could do another
one I can just do print abs and I'll do
negative 22 and let's run it again and I
did an air what did they do wrong oh I
left at a closing calma will run it
again and we can see that like the
absolute value of negative 22 is 22 hey
that's pretty cool so you can run Python
right in the browser you you can run go
you can run all kinds of languages and
the short-term way that we plan to be
able to teach a lot of these additional
languages is just to do what we're doing
with Python which is to continue adding
wiki articles and allowing you to
actually go in live and tweaked the code
and run it right right in right on the
wiki so just to be clear like
traditionally the only language that can
run in a browser is JavaScript of course
they're like slightly
different versions of some languages
that can run in a browser that are kind
of shem to work with javascript i think
like close your script and things like
that but traditionally you would not be
able to run Python in the browser but we
managed to figure out a way to do that
using a variety of tools and I just
wanted to acknowledge the work fit
Rafael of rough face 2 a2 + RG a logic
is his name on Gator that they're doing
on this in and all the other campers who
were contributing articles on these
alternate what we call alternative back
in languages because nodejs and
expressed jsr still are recommended
first back in languages to learn but you
can certainly dive in and learn
additional languages on free coke
campaign in the future we plan to have
as much on Python as much on go and some
of these other languages as anyone it's
just a matter of us gradually
accumulating a lot more wiki articles on
those and then those wiki articles can
be taken and transitioned into more
featured actual interactive challenges
down the road so so this is the first
step creating the wiki articles specific
to these so with that we've covered all
the things that I personally wanted to
talk about and the Berkeley Andrew gosh
wanted to talk about so I I'd say we
open it up for for questions now in
Raphael's here yeah Usher yeah Raphael
here greetings Raphael so I'm just going
to pop this up real quick pop-out chat
so that'll be the chat and then we can
get our video back up here if you all
want to share your your video so thank
you all again for joining us we're going
to take some questions yep so side of it
guys by the way I say shift talk is here
a nice to see you again I answer right
of ways so the reactor challenges right
so that this question that comes up
often is where are the reactor
challenges we've been promised well so
unfortunately in order to enable react
challenges requires a major restructure
of the framework we use to actually test
test your code test challenges and load
them up currently in the middle of
wrapping that up it's a big change
because now we're doing no type files
I'm going to have multi editors which
you can tab or shift between so it's
almost like we're creating a full ide in
your browser it's not a it's not a
trivial thing to do but we are working
on it and it should be coming up as soon
as we can wrap up the framework way
factor yeah so Berkeley is working very
hard on the framework refactor which
will basically make all of free code
camp at least ninety percent of it I
don't know if we'll immediately react if
I all the account management stuff but
we will react to Phi the challenges and
you'll be able to build more complicated
applications right now you go to free
code camp you get literally a single
editor and everything you do is in that
one text area essentially the one code
editor so just to show you what I mean
so
oh let's go to a quick challenge real
quick so in that single single text area
is great for just working on like simple
jQuery or learning HTML or learning
basic JavaScript the minute we try to do
things like react really want to be able
to do multi files so you can make your
components and in different files and
put them together be able to do your CSS
and separate file and a separate editor
from your HTML and from your JavaScript
well it's gonna be huge improvement and
like I said it's almost like creating a
full IDE your browser yeah and a good
example of kind of what we're hoping to
achieve similar to Mozilla's thimble
which lets go the new thin bowl here and
you can do a lot right in a browser in
terms of getting like managing multiple
files essentially and having them all
get stitched together to build things so
you can see here thimble has this nice
sidebar and you can here's the CSS and I
can do you know color red and it'll
change the color to red in real time and
so it's got this nice preview pane it's
got this and I could switch between like
a mobile style preview and the desktop
style preview so I'm I'm very optimistic
about building challenges in this type
of environment I think that we'll have a
lot more latitude to do things with
react and with d3 and a lot of these
technologies that really do require
ideally multiple files for sanity or
certainly you wouldn't want to be doing
the HTML CSS and JavaScript on the same
file you'd like to break that out into
multiple files so once berkeley's
finished with the laying the groundwork
with this multi-tab editor and the
reactive vacation and everything like
that then it will be then we should in
very short order build out the react SAS
d3 and I think we've decided we're going
to use redux
as our as a key technology that we pair
with react Redux is rapidly becoming the
standard so so we'll be teaching that as
well and we'll try to teach them in an
integrated way since reacting redux go
hand in hand so other other questions I
chat if you want to look at those one
question specifically for fresh answer
yep so thanks because for the question
ah yup that you report a question yeah
I'll repeat the question the question
China's uh what is the scope for web
developer jobs in pune all I see here is
service-based IT companies yep that's
correct and this is not just limited to
Pune it's limited it's it's kind of in
the entire country or in the entire
subcontinent of India the thing is this
is a normal cultural thing that people
who do a IT degree over here it's a
BTech or you know be e in software
engineering and they tend to join one of
the popular you know service providers
service providing companies out here but
the thing is there are a lot of and
actually turn off for companies which do
pure web development for example at my
day job I work on something called as
WebGL I don't know how many of you are
familiar with this it's rendering the 3d
stuff on the web browser so and
everything is in pure JavaScript so we
use a library called as 3gs which is
open source as well and there's this guy
called mr. do who owns their poor
repository on github you should
definitely check check that out and it's
a the scope is really really booming
right
no all it needs is you know a will to
switch to those channels rather than
staying in the safety of what is
established as a normal IP service based
job out here so there are a ton of
companies which are doing this kind of
floor work and for example there there
is a lot of companies who are working on
angularjs who are working on node last
month I actually attended one of the
events in Bengaluru where you know
people had this gorgeous conference and
there are startups who are developing
the Internet of Things solutions IOT
solutions for you know they're making
apps for parking systems you know the
for example the things like you're in a
very crowded place and you need to find
a parking spot so you tend to you know
go in circles in the cities and you know
in the in the lanes to find that place
but if there's a app which tells you
that that's a place which is there's a
spot back back and over here and you can
just go there there are people who are
doing this stuff the only thing you need
to do is go on to some websites for
example product hunt is a good place I
really love hacker news it's it's a
really good place where you can find all
these things and you should definitely
you know branch out of your comfort zone
and look into these these profiles there
are a lot of opportunities which are
actually they're out here I hope you
know that answers what you've been asked
and a good and if you if you're
interested in getting a job angel list
is a place that a lot of people overlook
but is there are a lot of early-stage
startups and middle stage kind of like
there they have not gone public or
anything like that they may be still
have less than 100 employees but they
are hiring and I'll go ahead and have
one thing if you're curious about what
what people are hiring for
let me share this link with you I used
to use this tool called indeed com to
try to approximate what the market was
like sorry my baby's crying in the
background bang yeah sorry for that so I
you see is that but now I use this site
which no it's not this one handle once
again out here so this guy takes the
hacker news like Y Combinator companies
y combinator is the most prestigious
accelerator Dropbox Airbnb a lot of
companies have gone through Y Combinator
ain't which went through there um so
they have a kind of who's hiring and you
can go in here and you can see what like
the comparison of the different
technologies so he he does this if you
think about it like the the technologies
that Y Combinator companies are
interested in are in many ways what all
of the big enterprise companies are
going to be and all the big you know
software conglomerates like Google and
Amazon that those companies are going to
be moving into these things later but if
they're a little slower to to steer
their huge ship and other technology but
if you follow this link you can see
different technologies and stuff and
their popularity and you know you can
you can see comparisons of different
databases if you're interested I
wouldn't recommend learning anything
outside of the free code camp curriculum
until you already have completed the
certifications but if you're looking for
a specific job like let's say you're
you're done with all the free coke and
certifications you really want to go get
a job you might want to pick up a couple
extra technologies along the way and and
you can see their relative popularity
like you can see like Ruby on Rails has
been falling pretty steadily and you can
see
you know I think react is probably been
climbing very rapidly I'll let you play
with this it's pretty fun so yeah I
would not look at a bunch of job
postings and try to figure out what
technology you should learn never do
that thing where oh it's time for me to
get a job I'm going to just browse
around all postings don't do that I
think somebody mentioned in the the chat
here like ninety percent of jobs you
never see the job posting like they
never created job posting or if they
create a job posting it's just because
they're legally obligated to publish a
job somewhere but in fact they've
already made a hiring decision because
they know somebody they've met at a meet
up or somebody who somebody on the team
has already worked with or did an
internship with and it's kind of an
inside recommendation that leads to that
job yeah actually quincy i would i agree
with you because you know i have faced
that personally i won't say when and
where but i have actually faced that
personally like i have attended
interviews and like after waiting for
about a month or two they would simply
reject the profile and just because i
had some friend working there are you
you know something like that and i got
to know like the reason behind it and
then it comes out like okay they have
made the decisions already and they're
just it's just a formality you know to
complete so yeah that's really sad about
the hiring process which people go
through you know i wrote an article if
you're interested about the white
boarding process why poor coding and I
mean they're just some realities about
about the job market in hiring and and
how things are done that you just have
to adapt to it's not letting me send it
we travel with them it's not letting me
send it anyway if you just go to free
coal camp calm sly medium free code camp
com that's where the that's where all
our articles are but it's just a fact of
life that you a lot of companies are
going to require you to stand in front
of a white board and draw out algorithms
and stuff
that's just how they do things even
though that has nothing to do with
really coding I mean real life you'd
always have google you would have an IDE
you'd probably be able to run your code
and make sure it actually runs and you'd
be able to write some tests and make
sure that it gives you realistic output
and things like that but in in practice
you know when you go to interview at and
alone or you go to interview at
Microsoft they are going to almost
certainly make you stand in front of a
white board and draw out a bunch of
diagrams and and draw some like write
some pseudocode or some real working
code depending on who's interviewing you
for how you would do various things with
you know trees and you know manipulate
data structures and things like that so
linked lists winkler thankless yeah I
Berkeley do you ever use linked lists
have you ever used the linked list with
like a javascript is a data structure
I'm sure I have without realizing yet
I'm not sure how JavaScript uses like
arrays internally but have I ever
treated a linked list not available I
have never used anything that required
intense knowledge of algorithms and you
just don't really see that in web
development it's very few aspects like
yeah if you're working on the backend
team at Netflix then yeah that's totally
like a legit reason to be really good at
algorithms but if you're like front-end
developer it's very rarely that you need
to know that stuff you just need to know
like you know not to make some quarians
to just gonna kill user experience like
don't iterate over an array of 100,000
elements you know sequencing cuz that's
just cool that kind of thing no why do I
need to create a linked list to
dynamically render a dom list no this
it's ridiculous you any not like that
yeah so I think oh go ahead Ragesh yeah
I'm sorry to cut you in I think we have
a question is the remote web dev let it
amid carrier I think when see you should
be taking it
no I absolutely like freako camp for
example we're all remote I know a lot of
people like work at github for example
one of our campers works at github but
she's completely remote you know she
flies into San Francisco a couple times
a month or a couple times a year I think
maybe like four times a year the to go
and actually work with people in person
but I know like for example some of our
campers like Rafael he he works
completely remotely as a freelancer and
he's doing quite well with that I know a
lot of other people that work fully
remote so there are a lot of
organizations that are kind of remote
first the most famous is 37signals and
actually somebody wrote an entire book
about working remotely called remote let
me just share this with you um I mean if
you're really curious about it I think
remote is the future honestly I I know
that a lot of people like when Marissa
Meyer took over um yahoo one of the
first thing she did was she said okay
yahoo has a whole lot of remote people
we're not going to allow them to work
remotely anymore they need to come back
and work at yahoo's corporate office
because that because basically what
she's saying is we don't trust them we
don't trust them to do their jobs
without us like standing over them you
know looking down at them and mechanical
so um I would say that people reacted
adversely to that a lot of really good
developers left yahoo they were like
screw this and i don't think it was a
good decision but that was the decision
that was made you need a different type
of person for working remotely than
working in an office it takes a lot more
self motivation like you have to be more
of a self-starter to be able to work
remotely i think how do you all feel
about that I mean berkeley you work for
Motley murugesh you work in an office or
yeah I work at a regular workplace you
know you know you know you know you know
environment where we have to visit the
office we cannot work from remote but
the thing is it's really up to you know
the company what their work culture is
you know for example in my in my case
none of our code can simply go out of
the premises because of the you know
security reasons but in in cases where
people are doing stuff where their
repositories are open source and they
are hosted on github people tend to have
that culture that like for get up is the
best example like many of the developers
of get up they are they work remotely
get up lets them do that they can work
from anywhere so they just visit on the
chat rooms like we have one free code
camp we worked remotely for free code
camp you know that's that's the best
example like many of us have never seen
each other face-to-face in real life so
yeah it really up to the company and the
word culture depends on them one one
thing I'll point out is I don't think
it's I think it's best to start off
working in an office because you learn
so much like in person that you wouldn't
learn if you were working remotely and
it generally like based on our survey
which is you know 15,000 data points
only eighteen percent of respondents and
this isn't just free coke camp like
about half of the people who responded
or free coke campers but the other half
for people from completely other
organizations that like coding boot
camps like podcast listeners all those
kinds of people responded to and
generally people eighteen percent of
people want to work from home everybody
else either has no preference or they
want to work in an office with other
developers like if if I was given a
choice for example and I had the time I
have you being able to work in an office
is almost kind of a luxury because you
hadn't have to do it but you do get high
bandwidth communication there's a very
big difference sitting across the table
from somebody and being able to walk up
on
draw some some things on the whiteboard
and communicate you know in person as
opposed to talking through you know
Skype or some of these other
collaboration tools get her yeah
berkeley you organizationally it is
definitely a luxury because you know i
live in san cisco i get to meet a lot of
people at work in big tech companies
here and I've gone to a lot of meetups
and the meetups here in San Francisco
always a big tech tech companies so I've
been to Google zombies here which is
utterly fantastic and they have catered
like lunches and catered dinner and
catered breakfast it's fantastic and it
is a luxury but the thing body if you
think about it from a business
standpoint it's a huge expense like do
you really need to have all your
developers oh well all your developers
under one roof I don't think so but it
just make like burrata Madhuri between
developers a lot easier to do because
when you work people vote it's hard you
have to like get skype running it
sometimes skype doesn't work or you know
try to get Hank how it's working like we
were trying to get hangouts working this
morning but it is like it is a cool up
trade half I don't think Rico camp will
have offices anytime soon i'm not sure
we should just because it's gonna be
huge cost less and yeah i mean we can do
what we're doing well berkeley and i
even though we live in the same
metropolitan area we only meet like once
every month or two in person and that's
generally pretty pretty sufficient we
talk every day over phone like all the
other tools but to actually be in the
same room with them with Berkeley that's
that's great if we can do it the main
issue with well so I'll just tell you
really quickly there's a huge survey a
huge study done on remote working
Stanford remote sea trip study let me
see if I can find a real quick here is a
Harvard Business Review article that
talks about it which i'll just post in
here I don't actually know the contents
of this so I'm not one hundred percent
sure they talking about the exact
survey the exact study but basically
what they found is people who work
remotely are more productive than people
who work in an office yeah if you think
about that it makes perfect sense
because people who work in an office
generally spend about two hours a day
commuting to and from the office right
and they have to dress up in suits and
do all this kind of stuff that normal
like if you're like I'm sitting here my
freaking camp t-shirt in my closet you
know like I I woke up and I was at my
desk within about two minutes you know
after drinking some water and kind of
like splashes water on my face so you
know I didn't have to get into my car I
didn't have to drive across town i
didn't had to park I didn't have to go
through security at a building or
anything like that and walk walk to my
cubicle or whatever like I'm just here
so people who work remotely generally
are more productive is what this
Stanford study found but at the same
time those people are less appreciated
and when I say less appreciated they are
much more likely to be laid off and they
are much less likely to be promoted and
I think that has everything to do with
you don't feel the same human connection
with them that you would feel with with
somebody who is sitting right next to
you everyday and yeah you know sharing
eating lunch with you and stuff like
that Quincy I don't think we have much
time left let's just take one more
question it's interesting after FCC free
code camp course should be work on a
personal project or under some company
for knowledge whoa well uh Krishna I
believe is the person who asked our
question great question by the way if
you have actually completed all three
certifications and you have started
doing the nonprofit projects I mean
we've always got more work for you to do
and if you finish all of the
certifications and if you finish the
nonprofit projects like you will
definitely be able to get a job will
help you find a job at that point if you
can get that far so so I would say
there's a temptation to like go out and
and try to build your own projects and
do things like that there's that's
totally fine but I would urge you to to
stick with our curriculum because it's
working for so many people hundreds of
campers have gotten jobs after working
through free code camp so it will work
it's just a matter of persisting and not
deviating too much like we're not saying
don't use other resources please do feel
free to read other books and use of the
resources but but I strongly recommend
you do continue to work through free
coke cans curriculum and I wouldn't
recommend diving off onto some crazy
personal project that's really ambitious
that's a great way to learn a lot of
stuff too but it's not necessarily the
most time efficient way freako camps
curriculum is literally being improved
by hundreds of people hundreds of people
are actively working on this many of
whom are already developers at major
companies so so they have a very good
understanding of what what people need
to know in order to be able to work
effectively as web developers yeah and
about working on personal stuff I would
like to bring another point like you
should if you are not yet you should
start working on some open source stuff
and bring your portfolio up on github or
get back I'd or whatever you know
channels you would like and start
contributing to some open source things
because down the lane that really helps
and it really counts towards your
towards your CV towards your portfolio
it show its showcase is that because
that that's something which is going to
be acknowledged by everybody because if
you have worked on some some open source
thing down the line somebody or the
other is going to appreciate it however
small your contribution maybe maybe it's
just a small typo fix in the rate week
or something like that but it definitely
comes so if you are not yet in to open
source please contribute into open
source and contributing the open source
getting started contributing to open
source is very easy I'm gonna see if I
can if it'll actually let me paste this
into YouTube is like truncating my posts
okay it said message not sent
so it's not letting me send these things
for some reason it's a Nelson not sleep
okay yeah we can ping that sounds good
yeah I'll go ahead and send it to you on
skype but that's like your your first
github contribution you can do it right
in github graphic user interface there's
this site called up for grabs dinette
which is a great resource and I've
talked to the people who run it and they
love free coke camping and they're you
know we're listed on here and I think
this is the best place to find projects
that you can contribute to another one
is what is it called it's like a like a
commit or opens beginners only something
like that yeah newbies are beginners are
only new recently I'm sure we called it
so uh YouTube didn't let me plug that
link any there it's just too Wow well
we'll have to figure out we're again so
thank you very much everyone for your
patience with our our YouTube issues
again this is the first time we've
attention to do the stream on YouTube
instead of twitch we're going to iron
out these kinks so this will be
completely exported to YouTube you can
wash it after the fact and you shouldn't
have any buffering issues do you all
want to say anything else before we
conclude just don't forget to be awesome
don't forget to be awesome words from a
true sage we're guess yeah yeah yeah I
would distribute that keep doing what
you are because you know there is
actually no limitation to what you want
to do just keep pushing yourself if you
are not a developer doesn't matter get
started right now and free code camp is
the place to be right on well I would
just echo that as somebody who was 31
years old decided to learn to code you
know four years ago many many many
people told me
silly and then it wouldn't work out and
then I had to go back and get a computer
science degree and all of these things
but you'd be amazed how much you can
learn on your own with all the online
resources so don't get discouraged just
just hang in there and keep coding yeah
all right thank you again everyone for
joining us for this live stream thank
you for for overlooking many of the
issues we had with starting late and
everything will earn those out and we
will see you all in get er and it at
free code camp in-person events coffee
and codes and of course the first
saturday of every month we will have
another live stream so we'll look
forward to seeing you then if your
questions weren't answered no problem go
ahead and ask them in git er chat and
I'm sure somebody will be able to answer
them or feel free to message me directly
I'm Quincy Larson on git er and on most
other forms of social media so take care
of have a beautiful Saturday happy
coding bye everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
