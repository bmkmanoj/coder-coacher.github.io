demo some aspects of the mobile
curriculum that we're working on and
we're going to show a non-profit project
and michael has an exciting announcement
as well it will cover and then we will
go to questions this entire thing will
probably take less than 45 minutes I'm
on top also okay so is the video working
properly everyone I just want to make
sure that the sound is good and the
video is good and we can proceed without
having to stop later okay people in our
campers and the community seem to be
saying everything's okay so keep in mind
there's a 30-second delay between what I
say and when you guys actually hear it
so I apologize for the delay there's
nothing we can do about that so um first
of all I'm Quincy let's let's see if we
can go around and introduce ourselves
real quick on the call I'm NC okay um
okay hi I'm Brianna I'm going to be
doing the mobile curriculum stuff hi I'm
Berkeley and I'm doing all the
development work for the mobile
curriculum as well as the site in
general great well thank you a big thank
you to Michael Brianna and Berkeley for
joining us as you all know that are in
the United States today's and a major
holiday but we decided we wanted to
always have saturday summit on the first
saturday of every month just so
everybody could easily remember we don't
want to change the time or anything like
that around holidays so we're going to
keep that forward momentum so we'll be
here every Saturday first saturday of
the month at noon eastern standard time
just like we are now alright so first
last Saturday summit we announced some
exciting things about our front-end
development curriculum and the idea that
free code camp would grant certificates
well I am pleased to reveal what these
certificates will look like this
certificate was created by Ryan mom the
same designer from Omaha Nebraska who
has done all of the visual design for
free code camp and here it is whew
exhausting yeah so uh yeah let me talk a
little bit about the certificate first
of all this is the front-end development
program which to bring everyone up to
speed the front-end development
curriculum is essentially going to be
the first part of free code camp
curriculum it's already basically in
place that HTML the CSS the jQuery we're
expanding it and then we're moving a lot
of the zip lines over to be at the at
the front of the curriculum as well so
immediately after you learn HTML CSS and
JavaScript us I'm sorry jQuery you'll be
applying those in code pen and building
things and after you've built a certain
number of those zip lines we will award
you with this certificate which of
course will not say John Doe it will say
your name and it's signed by me and by
Michael Johnson our nonprofit guy who's
also on the call and we will have a
similar certificate that may look a
little bit different for completing the
entire curriculum and that will be the
real certificate that's that's basically
awarded if you complete all the all the
waypoints bonfires BASE jumps and zip
lines and you complete at least one
nonprofit project if you do all that
then you are considered a free code camp
graduate
we encourage you to stick around and
continue building non-profit projects
but if you want to go get a job at that
point you're welcome to do so a lot of
our campers who've gotten jobs are
coming back and are interested in
participating in more nonprofit projects
and continuing to contribute to our open
source code base in our open source
curriculum so even though they're
technically graduates they're continuing
to work with us but we will retro
actively award all of them with both the
front-end development certificate and
the full stack JavaScript certificate so
look at the front end development
certificate is kind of the ascent like
it's not actually obviously an
associate's degree but it's kind of like
if you only go to school for two years
you still give an associate's degree
even though you haven't finished the
full four years and then if you finish
the four years that's when you get the
real degree which is the bachelor's
degree that's that's kind of at least
how the convention is in the United
States like a four-year degree is
considered like the terminal aspect of
the degree so that's how we're going to
proceed with these certifications they
will be verified the you will get a
unique certificate that your employer
can follow back to verify that you've
actually completed the certificate and
of course even if you just get this
front-end development certificate you'll
already have a portfolio of at least
three things that you've built on code
pin so they'll be able to get a taste of
your work in your your front-end
development sensibilities now front-end
development of course is much easier to
do generally than full-stack development
that at some organizations they have
specifically front-end development
developers but full-stack incorporates
both knowing front-end and back-end and
is much better compensated and that job
is growing much faster so we're going to
give this out but we want to encourage
people to continue to complete our
entire curriculum so we can take
questions about the front-end
development certification and the full
stack development certification at the
end but right now I want to go ahead and
show you
some of these new jquery challenges look
like so this jquery challenge it looks
very similar to our HTML challenges we
have a simple layout here with two wells
with these buttons inside them and most
of the jquery challenges will involve
selecting these and modifying them in
some way so let's go ahead and do one
now the goal of this challenge is to
target elements by class this is one of
the very early ones so you can see that
we had this note you shouldn't need to
modify code below this line and we'll
actually test to verify that you haven't
gone in and cheated and modified the
code but we don't want you to get
confused and think that you should be
actually doing stuff down here so we
clearly specify that and then we've got
this document ready function which
you'll have set up in a previous
challenge like again the goal is for you
to build out all this on your own and
for each challenge to build on the
previous one kind of like a game of go
if you're familiar with the the Japanese
game go where you place a piece and it
never moves it's always there for the
rest of the game and it kind of shapes
the course of the subsequent game and
actually it's a Chinese game I'm sorry
go is the Japanese name for it so let's
go ahead and tackle this one together so
first of all what do we need to do well
there are some failing tests fear we are
trying to select all the elements with
the class well and these are wells as we
can see right here in the code what you
see is what you get this is a very
transparent system where we don't try to
obfuscate or hide anything from you so
we need to select those wells and we
need to give them two classes we need to
give them the animated class and the
shape class so let's go ahead and try
that through dot well
and the that needs to be wrapped in
quotes and then we're going to use the
jQuery function add class and we want to
add two different classes which we can
do with animated which is going to grant
the overall animate CSS property to it
so these these Dom elements know that
they should be referencing the animated
CSS library which is built in stock into
into our all of our HTML CSS and jquery
challenges and now we can do shake and
watch what happens did you see that it
shook so if I do this again watch very
closely they shake so you can see that
i'm not actually logged in so it's going
to keep popping this up every time but
basically the jquery curriculum will be
very feedback intensive it'll be a tight
feedback loop where you you add a class
and you immediately see a reaction and
you get feedback from these tests over
here so it should be able to the goal of
course is to keep you in the zone where
you're constantly just cranking through
them and where you can go through a
whole lot and once sitting without
getting exhausted so that is what our
jquery curriculum will look like it is
coming along quite well we're also going
to cover JSON JSON API integrations and
Ajax and I've already written a lot of
those challenges I'm creating all these
challenges myself so it's taking a
little bit longer but this point I'd
like to hand it over to somebody else
who's also creating content let's talk
with Fionna about our mobile curriculum
Brianna hey guys so the mobile
curriculum is going to be a series of
really short videos I'm sorry it's my
dog in the background short videos that
really focus on just theoretical concept
especially really basic concepts to
start off with it so this one we're
going to show is measuring data and
probably everybody watching on the
stream is already familiar with these
concepts but there's going to be a lot
of campers that aren't and so we want to
make sure that they have all their bases
covered great and I'm going to go ahead
and start this video this is a video
that Brianna recorded and this is a
sample of what these challenges are
going to be like hi it's Breanna from
free code camp today we're going to be
talking about data size the smallest
size of data you can possibly have is
called a bit now that is i wrote a one
here that's an example of a bit it can
really either only be a one or a zero it
really goes back to that binary that we
were talking about one meeting on zero
meaning off it can either be a one or
zero that's a bit bigger from that we've
got a nibble which is four bits it's not
very commonly used but it's adorable I'm
bigger than that we've got a bite now
this is common referring something in a
bite it is an eight bits put together
now a lot of binary things are expressed
with eight bits like letters and symbols
and one most numbers really can be
expressed that way until you get two
really good ones so our most basic data
sizes we got a bit and a bite but as you
can guess it gets much bigger than that
alright so after we get past the regular
small bit and the first little bite
which is eight bits we get bigger really
fast the next step up is a kilobyte
which is 1024 bytes which times eight is
a whole lot more bits after the kilobyte
we've got megabyte which is 1024 to the
power of 2 which is the same thing as 1
million 48,000 576 bike so since we're
growing exponentially that is a big big
increased after megabyte we've got
gigabyte also known as a GB which is
1024 to the power of 3 then TB terabyte
1024 to the power 4 and pd not peanut
butter it is head of it-- 1020
or to the power of five just to give you
an idea of how big this number is if you
can't see it I almost ran out of room
ready tell my white cord these are some
pretty big numbers we're dealing with
here you probably recognize megabyte
gigabyte terabyte from regular storage
that you've dealt with before on your
iPad your iPod your computer or anything
like that all right just a quick review
bit tiny little either one or zero byte
eight bits kilobyte 1024 bytes after
that everything is an exponent off of
1,024 going from kilobyte to megabyte
two gigabytes terramite all the way up
to the petabyte all right yeah so I
after one of these videos there'd be one
or two just really short true or false
questions and there might even be some
before the video to kind of prime you
for the content not really difficult
questions just enough to make sure you
were actually listening so you know you
got something from it great awesome
that's what I call and the goal of the
long term goal of brianna's curriculum
is for us to move a lot of the
theoretical aspects of computer science
and algorithms and data structures into
a video format that you can use while
you're on the bus or while you're kind
of lying back on your couch just
relaxing and the actual practical
component of free code camps curriculum
where you're actually coding would be
done on a laptop because the reality is
it's very difficult to do coding on a
mobile device but it's mobile devices
are great for working through videos and
Berkeley why don't you say a little bit
about what you think the interface for
this will look like yeah so what we'll
probably have is you will have multiple
choice questions
and the video playing so when you see
the questions you'll have the option of
either swiping right or swiping laps so
they're gonna be very basic true or
false questions but this way it'll allow
you to go through many of them really
fast and kind of just strategizing and
work from there right so um one other
aspect of our curriculum that I'd like
to cover before we move on is that we
will be working much more closely with
node school and using a lot of
additional notes cool challenges in our
full stack JavaScript component that's
after you've finished all the bonfires
so not very many of you are there yet
but basically we're going to be using a
lot of additional resources to learn
things like MongoDB and get an ECMO
script 6 the new version of java script
that's coming out it's basically already
out but it will be in every major
browser soon and so we're going to be
using a lot of these challenges we're
curating them so please don't just dive
in and start working through these
thinking that they'll all be included
because only some of them will be
included but this will give you a lot of
additional exposure and of course our
eventual goal is to build our own
curriculum but in the meantime note
school is really great resource for
especially full stack JavaScript and
using nodejs and Express so we're going
to be incorporating those into our
challenges also a lot of our curriculum
will continue to shift as we're able to
improve certain facets of it so we
appreciate your continued patience as
things change around as always our goal
is to make sure that you are maximally a
prepared for getting a job and that you
have a strong theoretical foundation
which brianna's new curriculum is going
to help you get and that you have a
strong practical foundation which is
what completing all of our
waypoints bonfires zip lines and BASE
jumps will give you and of course the
nonprofit projects and on that note I
would like to show a demo video from one
of our campers recorded it was a team of
two campers maxim and harry and they
built this for a non-profit food bank in
canada so I'm going to start this video
now hello my name is Maksym and today I
will introduce to you the non-profit
project at me and my partner Harry have
been working on for the past three
months Catholic adore is an organization
nonprofit organization based in Toronto
Canada and they approached us because
they wanted to digitalize their entire
workflow they helped poverty alleviation
by sending food packages every week and
they have around 300 volunteers and
clients and there's at the moment that
they had a lot of stuff going wrong and
with the inventory system and keeping
track of which packages have been
delivered and which not so that's what
we have done I'm going to show going to
log in here real quick and go over the
features and then at the end I will
explain the technology stack that we've
used so first off the DES decline um
sorry once again I'm going to see if I
can turn up the volume a little bit it
seems that the video is a little bit
thing so my apologies one moment
stir this all the way up and it will
start playing again thank you for your
patience everyone there are always these
minor little AV things that we want to
work out and desktop audio is pretty
high let me just start playing this real
quick i'm going to back i'm gonna back
it up just a little bit at a lot of
stuff going wrong and with the inventory
system and keeping track of which
packages have been delivered and which
not so that's what we have done i'm
going to show going to log in here real
quick and go over the features and then
at the end i will explain the technology
stack that we've used so first off the
just a client database and this one
because all the clients that of casting
edori and their statuses so when a
client's submit this form digitally
previously was on paper so we've created
an application form for them and when
they do that then the volunteers or the
the stakeholder can't approve or reject
them and this is basically the table and
a needle view of all the clients you can
click on a client and see all their data
their financial information food
preferences also their household if they
have children or other family and then
you can basic just to accept reject
making a client inactive or deleted and
then there's also a princess which you
can generate then you have a table and
yet this is pretty neat for the first
stakeholder you wanted to have that so
you can have a overview you can present
to his volunteers and you can also
export the
data in Excel or CSV format the next
sounds of next feature is the food
schedule this are all the food items
that currently in stock the name the
starting date of the schedule and the
frequency so what it has to deliver
every week or every other week or four
items let that are less frequent like
ketchup or for example sugar then you
can do that every once a month or six
weeks so you can edit that in line
choose a date and I choose a number so
yeah the next feature is the packing
list so after all the inventory has been
so then then the packing list is it's
being printed out for the volunteers and
they also able to to check mark a client
what it to be back to not so and this
packing list basically the algorithm
behind it takes into account the clients
food preferences it takes into account
the food inventories that's in place and
it also takes into account the food
schedule so which items are to be back
this week so as you can see the first
client here only has it has less atoms
at a second one because most probably he
his preferences are different and again
for this table we have a pretty list as
well so volunteers can print it out and
check mark on their own but they also
have access to this part of the admin so
basically the OLAP is has this is the
admin panel but clients volunteers and
donors also have their own section on
this website so and they're based on
roles so volunteers there they're able
to view the packing list and a full
schedule but clients for example they're
not set up on yeah and then you can
check mark off instant packages
and hopefully it's done yeah and then
the inventory this is the place where
all the food items are being inserted
this is mostly done at the beginning and
then you don't have to keep it up to
date because the quantities are
subtracted automatically when a packing
case has been delivered so you have food
categories on the left you can edit them
in line so and food items on the right
you can add a food item or search for
say soda yeah there we have and you can
edit them so of course even delete them
and then next on to the second to the
next feature the driver center also
Simon so these are listed the drivers
and their delivered status what is
complete your pending and if you have
general windows of the delivery pretty
simple and then the route assignments
we've integrated with Google maxing here
so it's so yeah the admin can have our
need overview of all the clients and
their address or addresses on the map
and he can select them based on the
location and say okay these two are
pretty close to each other let's assign
them to smaller and then simonas
assigned to the client so she has she
received the plans on the backend and
she can then proceed on with the
delivery then the volunteer database
this is a list like the same pretty much
similar to the client device but then
for the volunteers and their statuses
and you can see more information on the
volunteer you can assign the driver role
to them so volunteers can use honest
drivers and yeah you can also delete
tenant if you wanted and then the last
is the donor database this is a list of
all the donors the total amount that
they have been made it
and some basic information if you click
on a donor it then it gets see the list
of their donations and the dates and
amounts and the type of the nation and
if you click on your donation together
this model where you can see more
information detailed information about
it and you can also send the email and
tax receipt thank you emo and thanks
receive to the daughter so that he can
he or she took it out for Texas experts
so that's pretty much the features that
we have in here the stack that we have
used as we start off with the main stack
with me boilerplate to film ejs and then
we've used quite a few of third-party
libraries first of all we integrated
with Google Maps API with mantle API for
the mailing systems and with male chip
Jim so that because our current
stakeholder Jonathan most using
MailChimp to keep keep their emails and
names and send up mailing list if you
want so so we've integrated with that so
that you can extract data from the year
and insert it in there and otherwise
other than that we also used a bootstrap
on the front and angular of course part
of the mean stack if used moment changes
we've also used the admin out the new
desk the template you see right here and
they're pretty neat actions and quite a
few others on the backend may have a
note mailer to send out the emails sweet
template you're not using the template
engine that much because we have angular
on the front end of course we're using a
UI router and angular and angular google
maps wrapper so that we makes it easier
to integrate google maps with it and
many many many more too much to cover in
five minutes so
yeah if you have any questions about
this feel free to add some time 2nite
then or quincy and now i'll get back to
you or you can get straight to me you
can find mean accessing chat my name is
maximization or twitter @ underscore
maximization should me feel free to send
me any more message and I'll answer any
question you might have I'll be
delighted smart also if you working on
non-profit project in a future for free
code camp then and your your your scope
of the project is pretty much the same
as ours and you find yourself problems
ask me I will be glad to help because
you don't need to reinvent the wheel yes
sir that's it have a nice meeting after
this i'ma see you soon thank you all
right wonderful um I'm talking and I
hope my i hope the sound is normal
you're not like grabbing your ears and
pain right now um ok so I I would love
to have Michael Johnson our nonprofit
guy talk a little bit about this project
since he oversaw it thanks Quincy um can
you hear me all right yes great so yeah
big round of applause for Harry and
Maxim who have done a great job with has
day Kaduri we work on that project as
maxim said in his video for about three
months and they just blew us away with
the added functionality and features and
their execution maxim was actually able
to get a job right after he finished
this project and so big congrats to him
I think he is working for a pretty big
startup in Sweden right now but he is
still looking to maintain an active role
in the community so we've seen that as a
trend Chris Barrios who's in the chat
room now on Twitch also got a job after
his
prophet project but he's interested in
sticking around and helping other
campers and mentor Brandon buyers who
was featured in our wired article also
decided to come back to the community
after he settled into his job and he's
going to be contributing more bonfires
so really just these projects underlie
everything that free code camp can add
value to your career trajectory or if
you'd like to become more technical in
your career and I just love that people
are deciding to stick around in our
community I'd like to go ahead and move
in and parlay to some announcements I
have Quincy could you your microphone
because i have an echo it's kind of
distracting thanks so much and would you
mind pulling up the the agenda great so
without further ado I guess I'll just
tell my story here you know we have had
a lot of luck lately with the publicity
from wired Business Insider recruiter
calm and other articles I mentioned in
ventureBeat and we keep telling all of
these journalists and reporters how
strong of a community we have but we've
decided to show them rather than tell
them the other day I had this idea of
putting together a collage of all of our
campers around the world I'd like to
collect photos of you guys with your
laptops you all guys and girls with your
laptops or desktops navigated to the
free code camp site I'd like to you know
you take a selfie with your laptop show
your workspace show where in the world
you are and where you're coming from and
what makes you unique in our community
and i want to put all these together
into a collage with a free code camp
logo in the middle and use that to just
represent how diverse and
our community is and show and not tell
so you if you are all interested you'll
be a part of a tangible piece of media
that you know will prove to everyone we
join free code camp before there were
millions of users and I we would love
your participation so as of today free
code can now has an Instagram account
we've been active on Twitter we've been
active on fora twitch and we'd like to
add Instagram to the mix there's a lot
of we believe there are a lot of campers
who use Instagram but may or may not use
Twitter and we want you to be just as
participating in our community so as of
today free code camp is on Instagram it
looks like Quincy's logging in now for
us and what we'd like to do is just kick
it off with we you will post our selfies
to the Instagram account hashtag free
code camp if you don't have Instagram
feel free to use Twitter with the same
hashtag free coke can and I will begin
to collect all of your photos I'm so
anxious to see your work spaces where
you're coming from and I can't wait to
put these together and share with
everyone so it looks like Quincy is
navigated to the Instagram site Quincy
did you want to take the honorary first
selfie sure um I'm gonna one second I'm
gonna actually show as you guys this
shouldn't be a shock to you but I work
in a tiny little closet um I am in the
Bay Area and real estate is tight so
fortress of solitude the fortress of
solitude yes it's a lusion of course to
Superman's place where he goes to to get
his quiet time okay so you can see like
we've got boxes stuff like that around
I'm just gonna see I'll just throw this
in the corner well that's not the right
thing one second
I'm just going to move this so you can
see me for the rest of the broadcasting
and be grateful that your surroundings
are probably a little bit less dusty
than these and now you can see that I
have my trusty iphone 5 1st generation I
have not yet upgraded so please don't
make comments about how dainty and small
it is and I'm going to take an Instagram
selfie so I'm gonna try to get my
workspace in the shot one second so this
is more handsome so let's flip this guy
around all right and um yeah like I have
no idea how you guys are seeing me right
now but I feel like I'm in the selfie
with you to be honest just the way there
so that's good huh alright that's me on
instagram yay we're like a little late
to the party I think everybody's already
using Instagram I think all of us are
using it personally as well but we
haven't done anything with free coke
camp on Instagram so I'm going to choose
my filter here i'm gonna choose a you
know I mean the great thing about
instagrams they all look pretty good
like I'll just choose one at random
there tomorrow um and now if you can see
here I'm going to try to get like nice
and close you can see there's an option
to share it on Twitter and Facebook
which I'm going to try to click by
looking at the camera Twitter
successfully clicked a spoke
successfully clicked and if I were still
if I were using tumblr or something like
that I could also share it there or it
even has Mick see if you happen to be in
Japan the big social network of choice
in japan now I'm going to click Share
and it's shared on instagram so if you
follow free code camp on its ok and
you'll see this photo of me doing a
silly thumbs up in front of my
workstation in my closet and i'll just
add that if you do that make sure you
tag free code camp as a friend so that
see it yes and after you after you do
this sorry I can edit it you'll see that
like I just click the edit button and
now I have this caption box just to
reinforce you should be sure to tag free
code camp and do that before you tweet
it out because unfortunately it's not
going to show up on the tweet but we'll
pull it out of Instagram so done and if
I open this up anyway it was like to tag
looks like to add we're not we're not
being sponsored like mr. Randall is this
seems like a mystery on commercial at
the moment yes it is not an Instagram
commercial it is a I'll call it a free
code camp commercial because we really
want to spread the word about our
community and you guys saw it first you
were here when Quincy took that photo I
wonder I don't want to suffer the same
fate but I wonder if it'll be as
infamous someday as the Kevin photo on
myspace so anyway Thank You quinte for
your help that was very entertaining and
again the idea is that ultimately I will
take all of these photos put them
together shrink them down and you will
become a part of our document for for
media purposes hopefully the next time a
publication like we're comes around in
asus about our community we can show
rather than tell them so thank you guys
in advance for being a part of that and
if you have any other questions i'm sure
we will put step-by-step directions on
the site in an alert maybe we'll throw
it in camp renews and get more people
involved but that's really what I had I
think that I didn't get to share Mike
Symon but the mobile curriculum nobody
really wants to code on their cell phone
so finding a way to stay productive in
every little nook and cranny of your day
when you're commuting to work and you
really just think man my job sucks but i
would love to code for a living you can
feel productive you know if you're on
subway you can open up free code camp
and at least watch some of Brianna's
videos and learn some theory and just
keep keep moving forward and keep making
progress to your goals so if you guys
have any feedback it's a very young
curriculum and we love your help we love
your collaboration but I'm so excited to
have Brianna do that you know she was I
believe the first camper to do live pair
programming on Tuesday nights she joined
Nathan and ever since then I I knew that
we needed to have her as a bigger part
of our core contributors and so I'm
really glad to have you Brianna and
thank you so much for banging out so
much curriculum so quickly as far as the
theory goes and I look forward to
watching all of your videos awesome
thank you yeah I'm super excited to get
some more done hopefully we can get
quite a few videos out and not too much
time and you know we didn't mention this
but brianna is a teacher by trade so it
was an obvious next step to have her
contribute to our curriculum Quincy I
think that's all I have thanks again
everyone for tolerating my excitement
and my ideas you know I thought of that
idea in the shower which is my desk away
from my desk and I quickly told Quincy
and we got to make this collage of
selfies so help me make that a reality
all right well thank you Michael for
dreaming up that idea I think it's gonna
be great everybody can see what
everybody else looks like at their desks
where they spend a large chunk of their
learning time on freako camp and and
other resources so um so one thing that
I strongly recommend you all do this is
if you can't read it I don't remember if
I did this in my selfie but try to get
like free code camp somewhere in the
background so people can see you're
actually using free code camp and if
you're not using social media like or if
you have like rage quit social media for
some reason like I totally don't blame
you I use it a ton
it's a great way to keep in touch with a
lot of people at the same time and if
any of you reach out to me on facebook
or on get her on Twitter like I will get
back to you it may take you know 12 for
24 hours but I will absolutely get back
to you and I think that's the same for
Berkeley and Briana and Michael Johnson
we're all like really pretty accessible
and even as a community grows yeah even
as our community grows well we'll still
be quick about getting back to you i
mean i've heard that even it like
extremely busy people still have time to
get back to people and i'm far from
extremely busy at this point so please
don't feel like you're imposing at all
if you just want to say hi or if you
have a quick question that that you
think I'm the best person to answer so
at this point I think we can probably
start talking questions and take some
questions quick Quincy I saw a comment
in the chat that I just wanted to
address and it was RCW 27 1828 saying
looks like freako camp is going to force
me to sign up for social media so you
are just as much a part of our community
whether or not you are on social media
take your selfie email it to team at
free code camp calm and I'll make sure
you're right near the top thanks Michael
and get er of course works great like
get er is basically the email killer and
if you look if you can see on my get er
feed like these are some of the local
communities you can see how active they
are for example a lagos nigeria has an
extremely active chat with a lot of
people in here talking to one another
and communing and sharing information
and coordinating local events and
helping one another and that's precisely
what we want to simulate with our
campsites our facebook groups and i just
want to point out if you haven't seen
yet
just take a second degree is we've
revamped this field guide entry about
local cities and now it has a link to
both Facebook the facebook group and the
Gator group and so if you've not yet
joined your local communities Facebook
and get her groups you should because
it's a great way to keep in touch with
people in your city and of course freako
camps fully online but a lot of learning
takes place in person hackathons and it
hack nights and just general kind of
coding related events or even
work-related networking events and and
these resources will allow you to
connect with other campers in your city
and build those connections so you'll be
in a good place to get a job a few
months from now alright um let's see
what other questions do we have please
feel free to just any questions that
come to mind chris voss 130 said asked
will freak Oh can't make challenges
related to Jenkins in the future so
Jenkins is a continuous integration tool
a similar to Circle C I Travis CI
honestly CI is really useful but it may
be outside of the scope of our first 800
hours berkeley i think it definitely is
i was having a discussion earlier I'm
the Gator about TD and beauty well it is
a really great tool really great skill
to have I think it's kind of secondary
to getting campers building apps and
putting code out there and that kind of
falls the same for CI writing tests
which you will do as part of the free
coke curriculum that's coming soon that
will be part of it but we may not have
time I mean with 800 hours of
core curriculum and 800 hours of
nonprofit projects like with the
nonprofit projects you can experiment we
have campers building them and react j/s
we have them using mean j/s or a variety
of different mean stack implementations
we may even have campers build things in
meteor at some point but we're going to
teach like a core set of common skills
that are immediately applicable to
everyone and then we're going to let you
pick those additional resources up as
needed now I believe testing will be one
of those core skills and we're planning
to create some bonfires around that and
create some curricula around that but
actually conducting tdv which is still
kind of controversial bdd these are
different approaches to coding that
probably fall outside of like what you
necessarily need to know and fall into
the category of things you can easily
learn on the job or getting prepped for
a job definitely let's take a look at
some of the other questions here some
says his Nathan background now nathan is
not here today so Nathan real quick like
Nathan's still very actively involved in
free coke camp he had to fly back to
Seoul where he's currently stationed
he's in the US Army and he had to move
all of his things from Seoul back to the
US and he's relocating to Washington
he's still he's still in the service of
course and he'll finish his contract
with the army at some point in the near
future and I think in the next year or
so but he's going to continue to
contribute actively to free coking of
the meantime he's been busy the entire
time he just makes time he has a ton of
energy in a ton of time so that's why
he's not on the call today normally
he'll be here so it's a really cool
comment here I'm gonna try to pronounce
this name by probably screwed up showed
eco I think is that backwards anyways
he's saying
I would love to have the ability only
post my favorite last bonfire to the
profile I think that'd be cool feature
like pinning pinning your favorite
bonfires yeah that's a cool feature we
can definitely consider doing that
actually that wouldn't be that difficult
to implement um I'm going to show
everybody real quick live how I would
create a github issue for that so if you
go to our github page which is this many
of you have already created issues
there's that bug button on every page of
freako camp like all of our challenges
and we are so grateful that all of you
are contributing issues as you can see
we have a lot of issues that we still
need to address 161 many of these are
duplicates that's okay though we'll go
through and address them we have a lot
of improvements that are still stuck on
a feature branch that mean Berkeley
we've been working heavily on and we're
going to try to get those merged in as
soon as possible hopefully this week and
that will solve like a vast majority of
these issues but what we would do let's
say we had a feature request is we can
go to the issues and we can click new
issue and in fact this is a hyperlink
directly to that if you want to like
bookmark this or however you managed
URLs um let me just paste this right
into right into twitch this makes it
quite easy for you to submit feature
requests so then you could do something
like is it here so we do feature request
the ability to pin a single bond fire to
the top of my profile so like we could
include that and then we can include an
additional reason I'd like to feature my
best work something like that this
mechanism could be similar to Twitter's
pinned tweet functionality
don't worry about like having the exact
right words or anything just express
this and however you want and we will
categorize it and respond to it in a
reasonable time frame a few days and if
it's something we're interested we'll
move it into the confirmed column will
give it a confirmed tag and will
actually start
14 is me berkeley and nathan and we also
like for our development side of course
we have a lot of other people involved
like michael johnson brianna and we will
actively work on those features as time
allows the priority right now is getting
the mobile curriculum rocking and
rolling and getting all the jquery stuff
ready so we can launch the certificate
program as soon as possible but we're
able to work on these things kind of
along the side or if we need to take a
break from those priorities I'm dropping
frames like a maniac sorry everybody I'm
going to stop the stream on let's
restart it please do not go anywhere
brianna is going to take over the feed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
