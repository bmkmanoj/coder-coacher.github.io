tribute page here's what my tribute page
looks like you can see it's a tribute to
dr. Norman Borlaug who is someone who
has inspired me a tremendous amount he
is a geneticist in agricultural
researcher who during the 40s 50s and
60s pioneered a lot of innovations in
increasing wheat yield which ultimately
helped us produce enough food to prevent
several mass starvation that would have
happened if we hadn't had all those
additional crops so he's often called
the man who saved a billion lives you
can see I have this image here of him I
have a caption and this is all put in a
bootstrap thumbnail actually this entire
page is just bootstrap stock bootstrap
I've made no custom CSS and you can see
a timeline of dr. Borlaug's life which
is an unordered list with some some bold
in here for some of the elements and
I've got this nice pole quote by the
Prime Minister of India about Borlaug
and finally I have a link to his
Wikipedia entry so let's take a look
real quick at the rules for building
this challenge rule number one don't
look at the example projects code figure
it out for yourself very important rule
number two fulfill the below user
stories using whichever libraries and
API as you need and give it your own
personal style
so the first user story is I could view
a tribute page with an image and text
keep in mind this true tribute can be
literally for anyone it could be for
your child it could be for your
great-grandfather who fought in the war
it could be for a famous celebrity that
you really like anyone the second user
story is I can click on a link that will
take me to an external website with
further information on a topic so you'll
want to use the read the read search
asked methodology if you get stuck on
anything and when you're finished just
click I've completed this challenge and
include the link to your project in the
modal that pops up and then you can move
on if you want to get some feedback on
your project you can go to the code
review chatroom very quickly before we
before you get started I just want to
show you one quick thing so normally I
said rule number one don't look at the
example code I'm going to show you the
example code just this once just because
I need to show you something important
about code pen so code pen will normally
override any anchor tags so when you put
an anchor tag in here be sure to use
this code target blank in the anchor tag
so you'll have the href and you'll have
target blank and what target blank does
is it forces the browser to open a new
tab so again if you look here when I
click the Wikipedia entry it opens a new
tab otherwise it will not follow links
because code pen just overrides that for
security reasons also you'll note again
that this is a completely HTML project
there's no CSS or JavaScript there's
just this one line of CSS actually which
just takes the margin down a little bit
which is common when you use bootstrap
to use something like this to kind of
force it down because they assume that
you're going to have like a navigation
bar or something up here
and of course it's stock bootstrap I
loaded bootstrap in using the quick add
button so have fun with this challenge
and good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
