the stories on camper news camper news
is of course our place that we share
interesting links and as you can see it
has a fairly vanilla layout it's not
particularly exciting it's just very
functional but we're going to make
something much more exciting like this
implementation and you can see what it's
doing is for each story it's grabbing
the image associated with it and the
number of comments and a whole lot of
other information and if if the story
doesn't have an image associated with it
it just shows the image of the author
the person who submitted the link so
let's go over the rules rule number one
don't look at the example projects code
figure it out for yourself rule number
two you may use whichever libraries or
api's you need and rule number three
reverse engineer the example projects
functionality and also feel free to
personalize it you do not have to create
this pinterest style tile layout feel
free to implement it however you want
however you think looks most interesting
to you and here are the user stories the
first user story as a user I can see and
browse recent posts on camper news as a
user I can click on a link and be taken
to that stories original URL as a user I
can click on a link and be taken to the
discussion page on free coke can and as
a bonus as a user I can see how many
upvotes each story has so in order to do
this you're going to want to use free
code camps camper news API which we have
a link to right here if you open this up
for example this will return JSON we can
verify this right now and here's our
JSON
so we're looking forward to seeing the
different ways that you implement camper
news and visualize it on your code pin
good luck with this zip line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
