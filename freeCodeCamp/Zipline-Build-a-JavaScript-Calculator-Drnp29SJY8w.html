challenging but we think you'll learn a
lot of JavaScript and also get a lot of
front-end development practice with CSS
so let's take a look at the finished
product this is a fully interactive
calculator I can take numbers 7 x 7 and
click equal and it will do the math for
me I can even do things like 7 times 7
times 7 and it will do the math for that
too so I can change calculations so it's
quite powerful
I can click the clear buttons and all
the mathematical operations work you can
see that Jeff store back who designed
this did a great job with the textures
and the shading and the shadows it
almost looks like a calculator you could
just pick up and use in your hands let's
go over the rules don't look at the
example projects code figure it out for
yourself use whichever api's or
libraries you need and reverse-engineer
the example projects functionality but
also feel free to personalize it there
are so many different calculators out
there that I'm sure you can come up with
a cool looking calculator that doesn't
necessarily look like anything anyone's
ever built before and let's go over the
user stories as a user I can add
subtract multiply and divide two numbers
I can clear the input field with a Clear
button that's a bonus user story and
another bonus user story is I can keep
chaining mathematical operations
together until I click hit the Clear
button and the calculator will tell me
the correct output this will take some
amount of time but it will be worth it
you'll learn the entire time and just
work through any frustrations feel free
to drop in to the help chatroom if you
need some guidance and keep moving
forward
good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
