well you've come to the right place in
this video today we'll be going through
some HTML basics and you're gonna be
making your very first website using
HTML will be going over three things
today
the first is what is HTML then we'll be
going through some basic syntax and
third you'll make a local website that
you can load in your browser
one thing to keep in mind is that we're
not gonna be going through any CSS or
JavaScript today so this website that
we're gonna be making is gonna be pretty
basic it's not gonna be all that pretty
sounds good let's get started now what
is HTML HTML stands for hypertext markup
language it's a way of displaying
information on web pages in your browser
one thing to remember is that hTML isn't
itself a programming language it's a
markup language programming languages
like PHP or Java use things like logic
and conditions to control the content
that you see HTML doesn't do those
things but it's still extremely
important you can actually create an
HTML file on your computer and load it
in your browser it won't be on the
internet so only your local computer can
view it to create your HTML file open up
your computer's file program and windows
that's File Explorer and on a Mac it's
Finder in the program go to your desktop
or wherever you want to put the file
you'll want to create a new file in that
location make sure that the file name
reads index.html on Windows if for some
reason you can't see the file extension
just click on the View tab and make sure
that the filename extensions checkbox is
checked when you have your file all set
you'll want to open it in the browser if
it has a chrome or other browser icon on
the Left you can double click it to
automatically open it if not you can
also right-click and select open with
and then select your browser now in the
browser everything will look blank which
is fine because the file doesn't have
anything in it yet now in addition to
opening the file on your browser you'll
also want to open it in a code editor
I'm using Visual Studio code and we're
going to keep both the editor and the
browser windows open next to each other
so it's easy to make code changes and
view them immediately in addition to
Visual Studio code there's a lot of
other programs that you can use you can
use notepad plus plus
sublime Adam or brackets most of those
are free and I've included links to each
of these in case you want to download
and install them alright now that you
have the index file open in both your
browser and your editor
we'll start writing some code let's look
at some of the basic features of HTML
HTML is made up of tags tags are special
text that you use to markup or
distinguish parts of your webpage
hence the hypertext markup language
these tags tell the browser to display
whatever is inside the tag in a specific
way so here's one example of a tag in
action I'm gonna write out some text
here this is my very first website and
I'm extremely excited exclamation points
and we'll save that you can see that the
words extremely excited are in these be
tags B is for bold so let's save the
file and reload your browser and see
what happens
all right you just wrote some HTML now
let's look at the tag again the tag
before the phrase is called the opening
tag and a tag after the phrase is called
the closing tag you can also see that
the closing tag has a forward slash
before the B together these two tags
tell the browser to make whatever text
is between them bold and that's exactly
what happened now maybe this is obvious
but when the browser loads the HTML the
tags themselves are invisible they don't
show up on the page pretty cool huh one
reason to love making websites so much
is that it's almost like magic being
able to make things appear in the
browser window everything good so far
all right now this line of text that we
wrote is working in the browser because
we saved the file as an HTML file but
for real HTML on the internet we need to
add some more tags to the file in order
for everything to work properly so let's
just make some space up here at the top
and the very first tag that you need is
the doctype tag
doctype HTML this isn't exactly an HTML
tag but you need it because it tells the
browser that this is an html5 document
this tag doesn't require a closing tag
because it's not surrounding any text
it's just declaring that this is HTML if
you're curious other doc types that were
used in the past are HTML four or XHTML
but right now html5 is really the only
doctype used so you won't have to worry
about those other kinds then after the
doctype tag you have the main HTML tag
this tag tells the browser that
everything inside it is HTML I know it
seems a bit redundant since you already
have used the HTML tag tag but this
ensures that all the content inside it
will inherit some necessary
characteristics of HTML then inside the
main HTML tag your content will usually
be separated into two sections the head
and the body the head tag contains
information about the website and it's
also where you load CSS and JavaScript
files we won't be looking at those today
but just so you know the body tag is the
main content in the web page everything
that you see on the page will usually be
in the body tag so we need to move this
sentence into the body there we go
now let's reload the page make sure you
save it first and it should look exactly
the same so we're all good here now
let's go into some of the basic tags
that are commonly used in the head and
the body I'm not going to go through
every single possible tag in existence
so we'll just be looking at the ones
that you're used most often so that you
can get a better idea of how an HTML
page is put together now the first type
that should be in your head is this meta
tag meta and then you're setting the
care set to be utf-8 utf-16 used by
computers you can think of it as a sort
of dictionary translating human
languages
- computer speak now the next meta tag
that should be on all websites is this
viewport tag so you set the name
attribute to viewport then you have a
content attribute and you set it to
width equals device with initial scale 1
this may be a little you know confusing
or computer gobbledygook looking but
this is important for responsive
websites responsive means that the
website can display properly on all
devices computers tablets and mobile
phones the content in this tag is saying
that it should make the width of the
website the same width as whatever
device that is viewing it for example a
mobile phone has a much smaller screen
resolution or size as a laptop computer
this will let the website resize itself
according to what the user is using then
the initial scale sets the zoom of the
website on browsers nowadays you can
zoom in and out making the website look
bigger or smaller we want it to be set
at 1 by default meaning not zoom to
inner out now after these two meta tags
one of the most important tags that
we're going to use is the title tag as
you can probably guess this sets the
title of the webpage if a website has
different pages each page can have its
own title so we'll add the title here my
first website will save the file and
then we'll reload and you can see up
here at the top in the browser tab it
has the title my first website so that's
it for the head tags now let's go into
the body
we'll just keep the previous HTML that
we wrote up here so it'll still stay on
the website most of the basic body tags
are based on things you can do in Word
documents you can create headlines bold
text make lists and even tables in the
days before CSS using these tags help to
organize and stylize your content so
that it would be more easily understood
by your reader not all these tags that
we're going to go into are still used as
much as it used to be
some of them simply aren't needed
anymore because we can now use CSS to
achieve the same style but I think it's
still helpful to at least know what
these basic tags are let's look first at
the headline or header tags designated
with the letter H each H tag also has a
number after the H and they range from
h1 to h6 the h1 tag is the highest in
priority it's generally used for the
title of the page we're going to add an
h1 tag to our webpage inside the tag
we'll put the title of the webpage my
first website save and reload and you
can see here's the title let's now also
add a subtitle using the h2 tag and
we'll put it in an HTML playground you
can see that the subtitle is displayed
at a smaller font size than the title
now just for fun we'll put in all the H
tags up through h6 just so you can see
what it looks like so h3 h4 h5 and h6
now this is a little bit much most
websites don't use all the H tags
usually they'll just use h1 for the
title h2 for the subtitle and h3
sometimes for section titles it's pretty
rare these days to use h4 h5 and h6 tags
now the next tag we're going to look at
is the paragraph or the P tag just like
in word you can use paragraphs to
separate your content into blocks you
can create your paragraph by surrounding
your content with the P tags we're going
to make a paragraph with some
placeholder text one of the easiest ways
to find placeholder text is to Google
for lorem ipsum lorem ipsum text is
nonsense Latin words that are used in
publishing and designed to fill in text
in order to work on the layout so we'll
copy this paragraph
here and we'll put it into a pee tag now
let's make the second paragraph - we'll
copy some more text and put it into
another P tag now let's see what this
looks like so there we have it the
browser automatically adds some space
between the paragraphs and other content
now if you want to separate your content
onto multiple lines but you don't want
that space that comes with a paragraph
you can use a line break or a br tag so
let's get some more lorem ipsum text and
put it into our editor without a P tag
this time now one interesting thing to
note about HTML is that it won't
automatically break lines so if you
press ENTER a bunch of times in the text
you're not gonna see anything different
on the page and the same goes for if you
press spacebar a whole bunch of times it
looks exactly the same what HTML does is
that it will only allow one space
between a bunch of enters or spaces in
order to create an actual line break you
need to add the BR tag so let's try that
here I'll just get rid of this extra
space since it's not doing anything and
we'll add in a br tag so now you can see
that this sentence is starting on the
next line you can even add multiple BR
tags and doing so will add space between
your content you'll notice that on the
BR tags they don't have a closing tag it
doesn't need one because it's not used
to surround text kind of like that
doctype tag at the top these types of
tags that don't need a closing tag are
called void elements void meaning empty
because they have no content one other
thing to note about this is that you
might sometimes see the line break
written as ER with the closing slash
this was a requirement for XHTML but in
html5 we don't need the slash the
browser will still read the tag
correctly but I still recommend writing
these void elements without that slash
the next set of tags we're going to look
at our style tags these tags add styles
to the text they can be bold like we did
in the very beginning and there's also
italics underline emphasized and strong
tags like we said before these style
tags aren't used as much anymore because
now you can use CSS to style everything
it's pretty straightforward what they do
and we'll go through each of them here
now let's use the B tag again and we'll
make this line of text bold and we can
see it's bold now let's do the italics
or the I tag necks I'm just gonna put
this on a new line and the eye tag and
we'll load the page and you can see it's
now italics we'll just keep doing the
same thing for all the rest of these
tags so the next one we'll look at is
the underline or the u tag and it's
underlined then we'll do the emphasize
or e/m tag you'll notice that the
default for emphasize is just italics
again and the same thing goes for the
strong tag
a strong tag is basically the same thing
as the bold tag so that's it for the
style tags now let's look at the
horizontal rule this will create a line
on your webpage we'll just add this in
here and HR is the horizontal rule tag
so let's reload that and you'll see you
know I'm a horizontal line going across
the entire webpage you can see that the
content before the HR tag is above the
line and the content after the HR tag is
below the line
now the link tag as you probably know
links are one of the main ways that we
get around the internet right you go to
one website to look at stuff then you
click a link to go to another website
and so on so let's make a link tag here
the link tag is written as an a tag now
that a stands for anchor because the
link connects the two web sites like a
boat anchor connects the boat to
whatever it's anchoring to first put the
a tag around the link text that you want
to be clickable as we've done here now
in addition to just writing the tag you
need to add an attribute the main
attribute that you need to add in your a
tag is H R if this stands for hypertext
reference and inside this attribute you
want to put in the URL of the website
that you want this link to go to so
let's say we want to link to the Google
home page so we'll add an H R if value
of HTTPS www.h you can see here that
this text is the purple color purple
means that you've actually visited that
link before and if the link is the link
that you've never been to before it'll
be blue text now if we click that lo and
behold it loads the Google home page
let's go back to our website URL stands
for universal resource locator this acts
as an
that will give you the location of the
webpage or the file that you want to
load now another often used attribute in
the a tag is target this controls if the
link that you click will open in the
same page that you are on or if it'll
open a new page or a new tab in your
browser if you don't have a target
attribute by default the browser will
load the link in the same page let's add
a target and we wanted to load in a new
webpage so we'll type in underscore
blank I'll save that
reload it and then now click on the link
again and you'll see that the Google
home page has loaded in a new tab the
next thing we'll look at is images to
put an image on your webpage you can use
the image tag written out as IMG so
let's add that to our website now it's a
blank so it's not going to display
anything on our website if we reload it
similar to the link tag we just did the
image tag needs a URL but instead of
href like the links use the image tag
has an attribute of SRC
meaning the source of the image so we'll
add in that attribute now in order to
put an image on here we need to find an
image let's say on the internet to use
for this example one really helpful
place that I go to for test images is
placeholder comm so let's go there this
website is super helpful because you can
generate an image of any size depending
on the values that you put in the URL so
let's just copy this and then we'll add
it into our source now let's see how
that looks you can see the image is
there I'm just gonna add a quick BR tag
here to separate the image from the
content now like we said on the website
you can actually put in different values
to get different sizes of images so
let's try this let's make it 600 pixels
by 300 pixels 300 and now the image is
bigger
another thing you can do is instead of
loading an image from the internet which
by the way this isn't really a suggested
practice the better thing to do is to
just download that image to your
computer or wherever you're going to
save it so we'll save this image here
and now if we open up our File Explorer
again you can see that in addition to
the index.html file we now have this PNG
file PNG s are simply a type of image
file that you can use so now if we want
to refer to this image that we have on
our computer instead of this URL we'll
simply put in the filename 600 X 300 PNG
and we'll see now that this will load
now there's another attribute that you
can add to your image tag and that's the
border attribute adding the sin will as
you might imagine add a border around
your image so let's give this a shot
we've added a border attribute and put
in 10 as the value we'll reload our page
and now you see that the image has a 10
pixel wide border around it again this
is one of the attributes that you don't
really need to use anymore because you
can do this all in CSS but it's helpful
for you to know that it exists now the
next thing we're going to look at is
lists HTML can create bulleted or
numbered lists pretty easily bulleted
lists are called unordered lists as
opposed to the ordered lists that use
numbers now to create a list you'll use
the list tag either oh L or ul depending
on if you're making an ordered or
unordered list we're gonna make an
unordered bulleted list of different
types of fruits so we'll first put in
our UL tag for the list and inside this
list tag you'll put your list items each
item will go inside its own list item
tag written as Li so we'll add in apples
oranges pineapples mangoes and dragon
fruit just to make it interesting now if
we load our page we'll see that we now
have a bulleted list of all the fruits
that we put in here now just for you to
see if we change this unordered list to
an ordered list you can see that the
bullets are now replaced by numbers but
we just want to work with the unordered
list right now another thing that you
can do is you can even nest lists inside
one another so let's say I want to add
different types of apples under apples
we would create a new list tag inside
the list item in question with its own
list items so within the Apple Li tag
will actually add a new UL tag under the
Apple text then we'll add Li tags each
with a different type of Apple so let's
put in Golden Delicious Granny Smith &amp;amp;
the gala we'll reload our page and you
can see now under apples we have another
child list indented even more than the
original list was this brings me to an
important aspect of writing good HTML if
you put an HTML tag inside another one
that's called nesting not so much bird
type nesting but more like Russian doll
nesting an element inside another one is
called a child element and the outer
element is called the parent so in this
case the apples list item is the parent
item of the Apple type list in order to
organize the parent and child elements
we indent the child element this helps
it distinguish from the parent so you
can see this list of fruits I've
indented the main list items apples
oranges pineapples and so on from the UL
tag then inside the apples list item
I've indented once more to create the
unordered list tag
and dented yet again to put in the list
items for the types of apples doing
things like this helps keep your code
clean it doesn't matter to the computer
but for humans reading your code it will
enable you and other people to quickly
understand what your code is all about
if all the HTML elements weren't
indented at all and we're all in the
same level things would look a lot more
confusing let's just demonstrate this
with the list so I've now uninvented
everything and you can see that it's a
little harder to see that there is an
apples child list using the types of
apples
so it's just better to keep all your
code indented nicely and this practice
of inventing it's considered good
practice not just for HTML but also for
CSS JavaScript and basically any
programming language that's in existence
at my first job in Banting was the first
thing that I was taught during my
training it's pretty important because
there's nothing worse than having to
work on someone else's code and having
it be a complete mess so indenting is an
easy way to make sure that you're
writing code that other people and
yourself in the future can go back and
read and speaking of indenting and
nesting elements the last HTML tag that
we're going to go through use a lot of
that it's the table tables were
originally used as an efficient way to
organize data into rows and columns kind
of like an Excel spreadsheet if you
worked with those before so to
demonstrate the table let's make a table
for a hypothetical monthly budget of a
household now to start we'll first need
a table tag everything else inside the
table will be inside this table tag will
have rows table cells and table headers
for the column headers so let's add in
our first row and this row is going to
be the one containing the column headers
so inside the table row tag we'll add in
a th or table header tag and we'll write
in our column headers now so we'll start
with the month then we'll add in some
budget categories so we'll do rent
utilities
groceries cuz you gotta eat and then
eating out and then we'll do
entertainment because you know you want
to have some fun stuff to do now let's
load that and see how it looks now
you'll see here that we have all the
different column headers listed out next
to one another for the next row we'll
add in some data for the month of August
so make another TR tag for this second
row and the data that we're gonna put in
these table cells aren't headers so
we'll just use the TD or table data or
table cell tag so inside this TD tag
we'll put in some numbers for each of
these different categories first one
we'll put in August because August is
under the month column header then for
the next one it's rent so let's say our
rent is $1,500 per month after rent
we'll have utilities and let's just say
150 for utilities then 350 for groceries
$100 for eating out and then for
entertainment let's just do 50 books
alright let's reload and see how that
looks you can see here that we've
created the second row and everything's
aligned together under the proper column
header so this table you know looks like
it's working but it's kind of basic
looking right well we can style this
table a little bit with some of the
built-in table attributes the first
thing we want to do is add lines to the
table because it's kind of hard to see
what's out here so in the table tag you
can add a border attribute and then
we'll put in one this will add a border
that's one pixel there we go
now if we want to we can make this
number bigger so let's say we want a
border of 10 and here's the table and
you'll notice that the the border that's
10 pixels wide is just the main border
outside the entire table and the borders
inside the table are still set to one
pixel this is just a default way that
tables are displayed in the brown
the other thing you can do is sell
padding and cell spacing so cell padding
controls the amount of extra space
inside each cell from a text to the
border so let's try a cell padding of 10
there we go there's a little more
breathing room now inside our table the
other thing you can do is cell spacing
and let's just do this at 10 to see what
it looks like and now you can see that
between each cell is 10 pixels I don't
want to have any space between the cells
so I'm gonna actually change this to
zero and there we have it it's a nice
neat looking table when you're building
an HTML table one thing that you really
need to make sure of is to have the same
number of columns in each row in the
table otherwise things will get kind of
messed up so let me show you what this
looks like if I delete the groceries
cell delete this we save and then load
so you can kind of see how the headers
have now kind of shifted over and
there's this weird blank space at the
end because there's no table cell there
so let's just put that back however one
thing you can do is you can make one
table cell span multiple columns so
let's say we wanted to break out the
utilities category to have two types of
data one for your water and one for your
electricity will say that electricity is
$100 and then the water is $50 so in
total it's still 150 to do this will
actually create an extra cell in the
data and adjust the amounts of the
utilities so we'll duplicate the
utilities cell and we'll change the
first amount to be electricity at $100
and the second one to be $50 for the
water now just for your own interest if
we reload again we'll see that the table
looks weird because we have these two
cells that we have added so there's one
more cell in the second row than there
is in the first drill now to make both
these hundred and $50 cells be under the
utilities so we'll use an attribute
called call span or column span
so under the utilities table header will
say call span equals to this will make
the table header utilities span two
columns so now you can see that
everything looks nice and neat together
again because utilities table cell is
spanning both columns the hundred and
the $50 column looks pretty organized
doesn't it so in addition to call span
you can also use the row spanned
attribute to make a cell span multiple
rows let's say we had data for June July
and August and we wanted to designate
all those months as fall so I'm just
going to copy and paste again and use
the August data to create June and July
data too so I'll copy this row paste it
a couple times then we'll just rename
this one to June and the next one to
July so now we see that we have three
rows June July and August so to create
the cell for fall I want it to be to the
left of the months so starting with June
I'll go to the June row and I will
create a new table cell before June and
put a fall in it now again we'll see if
I just slow this little the data is kind
of messed up so I'll go back to the fall
table cell and then I'll add the row
span attribute and make it span three
rows because we want fall to be in front
of June July and August so let's say
that and there we go now you can see
that this also still looks a bit
incorrect because there's an extra blank
space here at the end on the header row
and fall isn't under month we want the
month to be on top of June July and
August so what we'll do is we'll add an
extra table cell on the top header so
now if we reload we can see that
everything has the proper number of
cells now aside from using tables to
contain data tables actually used to be
used by web developers to layout web
designs so for example if you have a
website design with a
main content and a footer you could
create you know one big table with three
rows and then you can put all your
content in those table cells because the
table cells can contain any kind of HTML
you know images links text you name it
it was pretty handy back in the day
nowadays tables aren't really used very
often the only common exception that I
can think of is for HTML emails this is
because some older email systems can't
really use a lot of CSS so coding like
it's 1999 is unfortunately the only
option so that's it about tables if you
want to download the site files as well
as a cheat sheet that I've made of the
HTML tag is what we went through today
