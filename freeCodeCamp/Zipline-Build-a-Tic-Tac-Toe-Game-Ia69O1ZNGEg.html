most fundamental games around
tic-tac-toe tic-tac-toe is actually a
great game to build because you'll get
some experience with a lot of JavaScript
as well as some interaction and some
graphics let's take a look at the
finished product here so immediately it
asks whether I want to be X's or Rose
and I can choose oh and I can just click
in a box and you can see the computer
thinks much faster than I do
I'll just go here oh oh I gotta go here
and it looks like at this point I tied
and it immediately resets the computers
just ready to keep going you can play
tic-tac-toe with the computer all day
and you should never be able to actually
win at best you'll tie but if you're
sloppy you'll find that you lose
occasionally so it's it's a fun
challenge to see how many consecutive
games you can tie this simple AI so
let's go over the rules rule number one
don't look at the example projects code
figure it out for yourself rule number
two use whichever libraries or api's you
need rule number three reverse-engineer
the example projects functionality and
also feel free to personalize it here
are the user stories as a user I can
play a game of tic-tac-toe with the
computer bonus user story as a user I
can never actually win against the
computer at best I can't I so you don't
actually have to write a lot of the AI
it could just be randomly placing X's or
OS around the board when it's it's
turned initially and then you can go and
build up the AI to actually think about
what an optimal move might be and as a
user my game will reset as soon as this
is over so I can play again which you
can see Alex Dixon who built this
example app implemented that feature as
well and as a user I can choose whether
I want to play as X is eros again it's
an arbitrary decision but it's still
kind of cool as a user to be able to
choose which
you want to beyond so again this
challenge will take you a decent amount
of time probably several sittings if you
need to help get help but persevere
because this will make you a better
programmer
I guarantee it enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
