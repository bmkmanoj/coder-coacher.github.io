will produce estimates that are honest
both in magnitude and precision I will
not make promises without certainty one
of the biggest problems the programmers
have is that they make estimates that
are considered to be promises when you
make an estimate you have to make it
very clear that it's a guess and it's
not a very good guess if I were you I
would make sure that when you do
estimates you do them in three numbers
best case worst case nominal case and
make sure everybody knows that the worst
case could happen make sure that you
don't make promises that you aren't
certain you can keep because if you make
a promise you have to keep it so when
someone says to you I need this by
Tuesday and you're not sure you can make
it and you don't promise you don't say
okay I'll get it done by Tuesday because
you're not sure you can get it done by
Tuesday you have to say no I can't be
sure I can get it done by Tuesday and
watch out very carefully because someone
might come to you and say well will you
at least try and your answer to that has
to be
I am already trying how dare you suggest
that I am NOT I cannot try harder than I
am trying don't ask me that again don't
say those words but that should be the
effect of what you feel about it
you are already trying your best so
never let anybody convince you to try
harder
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
