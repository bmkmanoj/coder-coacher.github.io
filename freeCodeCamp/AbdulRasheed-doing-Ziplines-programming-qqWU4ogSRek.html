there's a problem oh yeah so it's final
okay yeah its final okay so we have a
markdown library here and the
documentation for the mag down it's
pretty simple um so here if I updated it
text to this dot txt this text area
yeah so right now why i'm doing here is
each time the key goes up i'm updating
the texts that should be here with
whatever I types if i type hello here
how are you doing yeah so what the right
type here gets updated automatically
here so the next thing is on if what if
you want it to be in a markdown form so
for the marks library okay see so the
documentation is pretty simple um you
just have to put wrap it around marked
so once you have this it's going to
convert it to mark down so here I'll
just put mark to fall right before
right here so here to type nor me then
if I put a hashtag three this isn't
working
yeah okay so right now what it's doing
is it's just guessing the code for me so
okay so now that we know this works for
now we'll jump straight into react so
react makes it so much more for those of
you who are not familiar with react it's
pretty cool to use pots it takes a while
to master yeah so simply one being here
is once my up runs going to do this and
right here will see the hello what I put
here comes up here so that's simply how
we act work so react whatever you want
to render you put it at the first
argument and where you want to render it
would be the second argument so I'm
rendering it in the DF code output which
is right here um if you guys are having
problems I can change the j2 HTML but
that's if you want I'll just going to
jail for now so
so the creative class function is
actually creating a tad I could use so
this is rehabbed syntax and each react
stop must always have a render function
so rightly the same thing here and if I
replace this wait just make a shorter
Matt down well run gives me the same
output change this to hello there see
similar boat hello Jeff okay so what we
want the react to do is to get this for
us get whatever we type and then convert
it here so I'm going to have a function
get initial state so all the return text
mt so for here i'm going to do this
state dots checks okay now
function component d-mont function so so
this function is automatic it called
when your stuff renders at first so the
initial time hello dear renders this
function is going to be called
immediately it's part of the reacts
lifecycle out collect so component it
mount so in this function i'm going to
listen to my text area so this is the
same function i read previously so
whenever I type something into my text
area I'll say d stud set state text text
area ducks Wow okay yeah so all wrong ok
so it's currently updating so let's see
so let me find out if it's actually
really doing this something whilst idea
so hey so this is a sad state text to
this
okay so so it says this does such state
is not a function oh yeah cuz are we are
cars is binding mechanism I don't know
if it's JavaScript over yet but if there
is any function you call if you want to
access this which would ask access
normally you have to bind that function
so the current stop so right here yeah
so this is fine yeah so right now I want
to make this marked okay so right now
it's giving me the output in HTML well I
don't want the HTML I want just the text
so and yes
yeah so um react has this code
dangerously set in our HTML I have no
idea why it's called that but then what
is simply does is for example this some
text I have which is showing up here
here you are it would help me convert it
into back into HTML yeah so this is what
auto let's copy this all right here I'm
going to have my div so instead of this
out say dangerously search HTML equals
two curly braces underscore underscore
HTML equals marks this got states no
text so then why run find it's fine put
this here get my h1 escape get my age
too ok and then so for this text box I'm
going to make it larger cause it's so
small so for text area set my Rose
equals let's save twin
so this and then if I want to type code
just like I showed you in the previous
example yeah so whatever you type
becomes very good so the amazing thing
about realities we ought to let you
separate your code so now I know this
smart down is just the output I want so
it's basically saying okay each time I
want to render I am dangerously
certainty in our HTML which is basically
you're putting out what is here and then
you're marking it with the markup and
then outputting it to this area so
whenever I right here it becomes to this
side so let's see how user stories so
first of all it says don't look at the
example projects cold I didn't look at
it fulfill the pillow user stories you
must use both sides and react which I
did you know i can type github flavor
back down which I did I can see preview
it has updated the type which I did and
then I didn't have to
yep so challenge is done then I have
completed this challenge then i copy my
link basic here stop me so now the next
one is the camper leaderboard um on just
a quick note I actually updates my pens
once in a while so increased
functionality and make them look better
so good okay so next challenge is a
comprar leaderboard so what we are meant
to do is to sort of replicate this so
this is an app that one of the campers
build let me get the URL and show you so
for those of you familiar with free code
camp you know that people get brownie
points for answering questions and the
chats and then this one um shows the
activity and the number of points the
person has based on how much help for
the personal spin in the chat rooms and
how much of the work the person has
completed in the curriculum so I'm not
on this list cause I don't know and then
all time
i'm also not on the list yeah so
basically I meant to do something to
replicate this yeah not replicate this
to replicate it so you just have the
person's points in the last 30 days and
the person is all time points so now you
see for the past 30 days it doesn't
necessarily have to be the same as the
old time cause some people might have
been more active all time than the past
30 days and some people might also join
the past 30 days and I've done lots of
work yep so we'll begin so cold pen I Oh
Lord you pin then I'll basically do the
same thing I jquery react SAS bootstrap
then I make a change then this is on I
call it free cold 100 so I'm I don't
want my up to auto-update Oh check that
yeah so now since I have bootstrap how
does jump straight into my nav bar so
first start with a container then you
have one
so have a nav bar now bar default just
for nav so let's run and see ya go see
the number right here let me make the
quarter sir it's actually clear yeah so
so I'm going to try to i don't know if i
should make it look like this but I
think it's alright so i have my color
picker pick color from page going to
pick this color then going to have nav
bar background color this so then for
this you can easily grab the image URL
then
ok so in your navbar depends on how you
want to do it but I check documentation
before so container fluid then have my
nav bar header then a traffic laws
so it should be image source yeah so
this is a free code comp logo right here
it looks really small but who cares um
so next thing is on we're going to have
this so this is what we're going to our
react so we can easily do this why I
prefer to put on my career so first
we're going to start designing some five
hour reacts we need to have to make this
a column loveridge 60 large set
sorry and I'm just put some text here
see just to make sure it's where we want
it to be it's right here so for this one
we're going to have a deep code table
yes so um this is the deef we are going
to render our reactor so reacts can rent
out to any part of the page it doesn't
have to rent out to the whole page so
yeah let's run and show you so texts out
of here yet if give document dog get
element by ID cable have an addiction to
have the world run if there's a problem
so this has ID rendering oh yeah has to
be preprocessed by Bubba yeah never run
and get my hair the world right here but
this isn't what we want we want to have
a table
now we start doing now class yeah one
amazing thing I like to do when I'm
making Foley's at each step and make
sure my code is running fine so I don't
just you don't write the entire code and
then come back and start checking if
it's fine at each step you check if
every update it out of the code doesn't
break your code so here's another hello
world so let's make this a Heather one
tax it will stand out which doesn't work
have an idea why let's have a look
so there's an error somewhere is real
see is not defined thank you yep right
here hello one hellos works fine so we
have a table like this um let's put a
header which is leaderboard and you may
think it's weird that I'm writing HTML
within a javascript file but it's the
future that pre-processing with pedal
allows for so if you have this sort of
code fine so we have a h1 leaderboard
just give it a class of board heading
then we get our table so we say son for
table also use the bootstrap table now
this isn't the table we have here this
is the normal table to convert HTML so
you have a class equals table table
bordered so let's see both strap table
um sorry the table borders right here
okay so we have a head close ahead and
half Rho which would contain column
items and then TD TD that's for hashtag
here so this guy has just follows
and here's + 13 days I Gail up all time
run weird so table classical stable
table bordered I think I missed
something should be th yeah so for each
of this change them to hates run camper
nameless 30 days all time
good for the forehead now we have a body
okay you know this is where it gets
really interesting because all this data
we have to get them from the API so now
for this we are going to use our get
initial state function so we're just
going to return free sent all the time
then okay let's keep it simple for now
okay so keeping it simple now you know
tbody we want to reach on a roll for
each item in our like let me just give
an example copy this i will paste it
here
so this is the data that free code camp
gives us so we want the recent points
right
yeah so we want the guys with the
highest totals to be on top and then the
guys with the law wants to be nowhere to
be found so so simply or we gone to
here's so here's the stage door
let's use the current function
accessory
okay so right here going to return TR so
we have a row right and then for each
row for each i'll have a table data
that's what's TD is called then we're
just going to put it in the X plus 1
now to see if this works we can put just
one item in there isn't an for work fine
recent not current yeah so we can see
the phrase guy with boats we give him
the idea of 160 76 78 points over the
last 30 days yep and 32 older so this is
just false data so right now we really
want to get our data so now companies
mount like I showed you in the previous
this one it's called once your thing is
rendered so if I had no item here then
it doesn't render anything under
you
here there's a problem somewhere
function yeah so now this is where I'm
going to be my API calls to do an API
call in on jQuery you just to talk get
Jason and now copy the URL which is
right here Pacey URL in here and the
start column name it's going to be total
yeah and then if it's successful to
comes with my data now since this is the
recent say this that's set state recent
to reason now let's see what happens
fresh recent is not defined data and yes
that's at state now just like the key up
we have to bind this function so we'll
be able to use do this so right outside
the closing tag of the function you by
since this
fresh yep now we'll see hundred values
one to a hundred press away okay so
reason which wasn't much because we're
using class not class name yeah yeah so
they should be more yeah come by
nameless 30 days all time okay now from
our API will see that we have the
username so right here for the first one
you can do I is your name forget the
part
so we're getting some guy foot of 34 ok
so now that we updated for the username
that's what happens yeah so each one
gets a username so then the last 30 days
should be point recent
yes so they start a point for the last
30 days now so next thing I want to do
is to make sure that when one of this is
created it is active so if i want to see
for the last 30 days i see what they
have for the last 30 days want to see
for all time i see what they have all
time first I'll do the same thing same
thing here for this one is all son we
were gonna sell all time yeah
so we just 4 minus if it isn't ready
yes so we want to differentiate when
this is a given one this is active right
so
okay so let's see
ok so here because octave is not defined
it's false and it shows be so I want to
put here it just car then it is true
nothing then for this one would say
current and recent active and we have to
set a default permission so right here
I'm going to put a recent active to be
true so recent is active and all time is
an active then we're going to similar
for all time well here would save recent
to the active reset this active we don't
want anything or if it's not active
wanna start yeah so let's go today the
shrine right now yep so
yeah for all time so what we're going to
do is we're going to set like a click
event for both of them really sleepy
right now so um see let's see that see
George just going to have the functions
called set previous to set prettiest
we'll just see this set recent
so we're setting to recenter true and
the next one who sit there all
so we have a set to this and you'll see
Josh sets next fall let's see what that
brings see
so um this is as far as off one that's
30 days all time so I'm still trying to
gather all time to work um I brain is
shutting down on really sleepy well yeah
so this is the original up points in the
past 30 days all time point
active ABC
yeah ok so I was a problem was happy to
see
yeah okay so if it's all time we want
everything you have to be a minus so in
our render function if is just a so if
recent is active then take list to
render equals this state dot and the
baby cold a recent else call sign
ok so right here we're going to do
okay right here going to have something
much more confusing so for our column
here if it we're going to have these two
stay put so if a recent is up to we know
that we are gonna have this I'll see
text otherwise I'm going to have this
minus and the other way together we have
let's see turn with a code that Panda is
88 so we're mapping here so we have to
bind this function okay so right here
clap bind this yeah I switched on all
time yep seems to be okay so i think i'm
getting the wrong values for the api's
okay so this is taken but given the same
values for both recent and active let's
even recent photo
so all time should give st. Peter the
first guy
oh yeah hmm meant to render the list so
it isn't a story still a student here we
go to 74 so all time has no values okay
so this is for the all-time list for the
last 30 days so as this works for now I
am going to have a good morning sleep
and Happy New Year guys have a wonderful
night
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
