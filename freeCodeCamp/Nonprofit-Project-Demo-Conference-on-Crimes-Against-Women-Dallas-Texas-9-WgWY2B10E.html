the application my partner Jennifer and
I have been developing for the past
couple months we developed this for the
conference on crimes against women and
it's a three and a half day national
training conference delivering the best
practices regarding identification
investigation and prosecution of violent
crimes against women feel free to visit
their website if you're curious so our
stakeholder approached free code camp to
build a conference management
application for them previously their
solution was to use several type forms
and work to gather the information
necessary for the speaker and it wasn't
there was no way to save it other than
to submit the entire thing so if
anything needed to be saved or updated
you'd need to contact the organizer in
order to change any information and the
organizer independently kept track of
speaker proposals presentation schedules
and information streams in from various
sources like type forms here they upload
things to type forms as well they had
email or phone exchanges and various
Excel spreadsheets so there was a lot of
different places where information came
in from and they had to keep track of
all of it so the stakeholder requested
that we build an application to
streamline the process of allowing
speakers to submit presentation
proposals to create and edit their
profile and submit and view necessary
files and we also built the
administrative side of the application
which allows the administrators to view
presentations all the presentations old
speakers and do the scheduling for it so
I'm gonna go ahead and log in here as a
user first so here we have the dashboard
that the speakers see
we've got an action required field which
shows you anything that you need to do
still so they've got a profile
incomplete here so let's go to the
profile so incomplete feels it'd be
highlight just read see FCC coder is the
job title that's first once you finished
everything you should submit it saves
everything to the database national core
I feel is gone so if you look at that
presentation this is so if you wanted to
create a proposal you can do it from
here but if you wanted to go to an
existing when you click that and here's
the existing presentation they filled
out any kind of errors that were
generated kill pop-ups let's say there's
not a title here in short there if you
had too many words they had a specific
amount of words they wanted to use
because they had takeaways in hand as
they wanted to use and having to cut
things down for them they just require
that the users have a certain our words
so here they got a list of their
presentation proposals they could do
more than one if they wanted to I will
show them their status son's case
pending because there's not funding
approval or denial there co-presenters
they can always add new ones here if you
go to your presentation then you just
find somebody in the list
there's a co-presenter and they'll be a
core presenter your project they can
also create accounts for a co-presenter
which is just like the profile screen
here but in this case they'd be filling
out for somebody so they can fill that
first and last name out in their email
address they don't have to fill anything
else out once they submit that the
person that created it for will be sent
an informative email it's telling them
that they had an account creator didn't
that they needed to fill out the rest of
our information and they'll get along
and information for this website that
they can log in afterwards for now with
so now we see that this speaker doesn't
have a headshot so let's go ahead and
upload a headshot this is the upload
screen there's various pieces of
information they can upload from here
but I'll just demonstrate one of them as
you can see there's no headshot yet so
let's choose a file and then it's just
like a little dialog picker here so you
click
upload upload a little spinner showing
they're gonna upload going on and then
once it's uploaded the image there's a
preview for and this is suppler to that
organizations Dropbox and all the
various files are uploaded into specific
folders in the Dropbox and that way they
can kind of manage everything that gets
uploaded from this application so then
everything should be in order here so
let's go ahead and log out and so this
is the administrator side now and we see
here their general dashboard lots of
information that they need incomplete
forms if there are any they can approve
or deny from here while the pending
approval ones so let's go to press
presentation ever this is the one we
just made click on that and the admin
see is a little bit different
information so the admin fields are
things that the only the admins can or
only the I meant see if you remember
this wasn't here whenever you run the
speaker side and there's just various
pieces of information they can edit here
they can change the speaker's they can
assign people to a slot and they can
make any changes the speaker could make
to the presentation itself as well so
we're gonna go ahead and prove this
presentation from here so now it's
approved and then if you click you can
also click on the speaker's here and
you'll see their information if you want
to have a different headshot you can
always change the URL here and it will
display a different one so now that this
is approved
it'll be listed as an approved session
pending scheduling you can go into the
calendar and this is a calendar view
it's basically just a view of all the
conference dates the rooms that they'll
be in and all the time slots and these
are all a lot of file with from the
manage conference it's pretty much I'll
show you in a minute
so from here you can let's say gonna be
in room two this is the little pop-up
slot this shows all the information
about it best presentation ever change
it and now it's scheduled there so you
can also duplicate it for another day
let's say they want to do room six on
the 21st
that there so no there's multiple places
where they're presenting so so now this
is a schedule presentation and you can
go into the list of sessions to see all
the various sessions that you want to
approve your nice let's just give you a
little overview of it you can click on
them from here and go there that way and
there's a speaker list which is all the
currently active speakers that have
submitted things for this year this is
all just dummy data and then there's
also the exporting field which every
piece of information that a database can
be exported if you'd like let's say you
want look at titled length and width who
the speakers are you said export gives
you a little CSV file and then use your
Excel viewer for choice excuse me your
document here of a choice and you've got
all that information here you can
organize it by alphabetically or however
you want also in the calendar you can
hit create PDF and it gives you a little
summary of the all the scheduling stuff
if they want to export it that way so
now in the manage conferences you create
a conference from here and this is good
for multiple years so if they want to
create it for the following year you'd
say 2018 conference or something like
that if they had a venue internet
address they can modify the conference's
title the venue the time slots they can
add and remove time slots from here they
can add or remove rooms they can move
rooms around make an archive conferences
they don't need anymore they've also got
an administrative panel where they can
add and remove admins and this is just
they have somebody else that's working
on the project they want to add them
they just create an account as usual
like a speaker and then from here you'd
click their name and then they would
become an administrator you can also
clear all uploads and this was how you
reset the database for the next year and
this just removes the uploads like this
head shots and w-9 forms anything that
was uploaded specifically for this
conference here gets removed and then
you can and they'll upload or done you
so now that we've scheduled our
presenter let's log back into their
account
and they've got a new set of information
now there's speaker response form this
is just another form that another
dynamic form that they need to fill out
in order to finish with everything they
need to do and they'll note there's
various things like whether they want
lunch or breakfast on certain days that
are provided any kind of dietary
restrictions you could submit that
additionally they've had a overview here
and this is all things that can be added
on the admin side once they've arranged
travel they have to email the itinerary
to the administrator and that
information has been used north to book
them lodging at the hotel they get their
confirmation number here the travel and
this is all things that the admin can do
on their side and also you can see on
this side that they're now a scheduled
presentation they get their schedule the
date that's occurring on the time and
which room it's in yeah so that's pretty
much it
anybody who'd like to know more you feel
free to visit our github the repo is
that Daniel slash CCW - in any line
briefly go over a tech stack and click
on the packages I chase on here to get
more details but effectively we've got
angular two that we used for the front
end of the application for the back end
we use node Express and Mongoose and as
the database we also used mailgun which
is how we email things so if you forgot
your password or if you created a new
account for a speaker you've enter your
email address here and it would send you
an email with regenerator password and
we used mail gun for that we use Dropbox
the integration for their API we also
use moment and again you can kind of
review all these if you'd like but if
you have any questions feel free to
check my github all my informations on
there
and I'll be happy to answer it for you
thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
