that I hope that was why we cut
spider-man have you done this big fat
spider man has then I think a check to
see if I'm trying that that must be an
emoji there's no way to be type today
yes I just am having trouble scrolling
on twitch chat so no I guess I can't see
it oh it is so Leslie has the mom let's
see here I'm wondering whether oh I
think we're actually live okay okay so
sorry for the unscheduled interruption
there i'd like to blame my cat who was
playing with them playing with the power
cord and took out my computer and both
monitors I'm like what where'd
everything go no it was a catastrophe oh
ok if you not save your progress on the
word strokes in paragraph 1 the last
sentence okay thank you thank you i have
a class from the chat from my end my cat
check my cue yeah can you guys still see
my cat OOP got something that I have to
be on to college am am a brad storage
interface well normally I'm normally I'm
pretty good about doing so there is a
ctrl s now which is very handy oh I
think I skipped one I skipped stand in
line I'll have to go back and do that
one but this is golf code okay st oh it
is fixed isn't it it is it's fixed but
this is not the display is not fixed oh
no here it is here it is oh did maybe i
had two errors and i only fixed one of
them anyway give that person some
brownie points
is this it is John look if someone's
Lucas what's your username on getter /
getting up i think i think it is Junsu
kasam plumbing fanfic person hopefully
that's a real person okay what okay so
I'm gonna continue solving this even
though it's like really scintillating
streaming here i'll just type quickly oh
and don't like your if statements oh
you're really down my me yeah like I
have no opinion works it works well
remember that yet you have to learn it
the wrong way in order to learn it in
the right way no i'm uber pragmatic I'm
so like if you want to push the buttons
and that orders like whatever works I'd
be a cherry pie manager everything be
different ok c plus 1 222222 GTG Oh
Carolyn Hannon just did it using switch
ah yeah did you do well I guess we'll
have to try it um actually if she can
cut and paste her code then i will try
it after i tried this one who except i
can't for some reason the twitch chat
has not come up for me yet it's ok
making fun of you for using double and
single quotes Oh much consistently
change style everybody are you the same
thing yes any reason to do it just I
stuck to what I'm saying yeah ok so
special photo stuff so I actually don't
have to hard code the if on this um
thank you kind and well and in fact I'm
not even going to drop an else on I'm
just going to say go home because really
if you are getting six strokes then
so let me run it and see if I got it
right Oh interesting so for one should
return hole-in-one know ! ah pair coding
right there pair programming all right
okay so as Carol posted her solution yet
yeah unless I think we should make that
looks nice rack up some because I can
just see the onslaught of github issues
of challenges and work I'm UNT flicked
oh no no it's the ! don't forget it you
think I should remove the ! nope just
make like a reg ex that makes it like an
optional oh if it's don't if chip only
be done with the reg ex but just make
the estimation uh it's not a regex
though it's a it's a strict equals but I
could do it I could turn into a test I
leave it then it's too hard yeah I mean
sometimes you have to check for what's
different and sometimes the thing that's
different is an exclamation point it's
pretty clear about what it's supposed to
equal okay well if Carol if Carol does
come back come through with her code
then i will paste it in here and see if
it passed the test because i'm
interested to find out if it does i get
me apparently if you get a warning do
not panic I'll fix that and just reap
aced it in after that I don't know what
to turn on the move are definitely does
not like links actually to know us I'll
just do that she okay however you like
and I might save some issue how do you
make well moderator and no use a regular
sting on doing move us you should add to
get up on craiglist just add them
situated thing girl says there's the
same test twice and she's right again
everybody go give her brownie points I
think we should take oh ok now the
question is the quick yeah how do you
feel about how is your employment
situation okay let me look at and see if
the problem maybe that I just didn't
update the display yet okay so it's
actually testing 52 I just forgot to
update the output but give that woman
some brownie points if you haven't
already we have another em gulf score
four to shoot
which is true it's two on the pie it is
doesn't it for 2 is equal yeah Eagle um
hey that's right that's right equal
three more then why is 52 also eagle and
it's a very good point oh that's an
albatross that isn't it oh the reason it
is the reason is because I think
technically you could have like a double
eagle or something in the double eagle
right hunter but I didn't want to
writing I didn't want to make everybody
have to write every possible solution
and so in fact like there's double and
triple a quadruple bogeys and so on I
think the buggy and then it goes close
an albatross I think it's possible i can
hold it high an amateur yeah i mean so
like getting a like getting two on a par
5 i think would be a double eagle but
the but the main thing is that three
under our bed I just didn't want I
didn't want to have the table be so huge
that it was going to take forever I mean
you saw how long it took for me to type
all this baloney in home to find
somewhere to trimming it trim the fat
yeah I think doble looks fit em
specifically is a witty way say for
another now chairman terminal it's a
double-double too well right killers so
these how it is in reality and then
there is how I've written the code so
you need to conform to what I've written
in this table or you will not pass the
test oh that's what it comes down to so
did we did we ever get Carroll's code I
think she's putting it in again ever I
college plus they're actually coming
today so she's gonna put it in the name
don't bother trying to follow matter
anything just let you chip in there
people give a short the mesh I was kind
of a boy yeah i'm not i'm not seeing it
well anyway i'm gonna i'm going to move
to the not actually technically the next
one but the previous one
which is what i'm calling stand in line
um so yeah okay Leah Ali hello oh hi
Leanne Alicia I can't read that name oh
here we go carol has got her solution
right here hair cut and paste that in
there ah very nice so I don't know oh
let's see but she does have semicolons
that she doesn't need but we can change
that last Kate through the fall actually
yeah and actually well I'm gonna I'm
gonna run hers oh except it's not
console.log its return it's just
thrilled that he gets to fix something
for Carol instead of the other way is it
oh and then we and if we do return that
we don't need the break so I'm just
gonna ignore those like I'm just
pointing out it's doable you guys oh
you're right always right okay you until
you don't have to defend yourself Andy
it passes so once again she has my she's
the queen she is the queen she's the day
on me we mm-hmm be queen see only 17
okay so somewhere in here okay bonfire
shopping list I did I skipped a bunch of
these okay it is so we've got so we
talked about all of the array access
stuff and I've added a new thing about
multi-dimensional race so the shopping
list is you to FAO it's super super
simple what we have them have you doing
is just generating up entries here so um
canta meeting and we're waiting it
dramedy a my actual shopping list we can
put on there okay and uh soda we're
gonna be really that now and we're
getting a six pack
and then we're gonna do Oh soda pop you
Americans in your town here sodypop and
then bread because a man's got to eat
and we're getting too old hello hello
cuz the ladies gotta eat yeah wait but
that ladies eat bonbons right I don't
bum-rush we can do what we want to it's
my first day dude I eat cake okay gotcha
oh yeah happy birthday cake thank you
that's gonna make happy birthday my
chest I want to see you happy birthday
wait laughs wait okay so so the idea
here is just to get them used to the
idea of building string literals with a
multi-dimensional array and we've got a
bunch of test cases on it that go
through and and test everything so we
were validating that each sub string is
a string of the first instance is a
string and that the second is a number
and so like if any of these were not a
number and I run then it fails right so
that's not a number so it fails all
right and if I put anything that's not a
string here then this other one fails
and you have to have at least five items
so if i get rid of that one audio then
it also fails is that what your cake how
do you vote s ! yeah it open boat and
then what you want i put cake I Jenna Oh
coke oh I put real k because I want em
use my birthday man it's it's putting
them coke and some cakes it's not that
kind of birthday I don't know uh any
sort of Pumped you'd like have coke pop
or soda what I ok I guess it's not
working so
okay uh back to the map uh let's see
here oh i didn't i didn't actually
submit my code invalid vote i love that
nice okay so we have word blanks we have
shopping list we have stand in line okay
so this is another array manipulation
one and so we describe a queue i'm
hoping this is an abstract data
structure where items are kept in order
new items can be added to the back of
the queue and old items take it off the
front of the queue write a function Q
which we takes an array and an item as
arguments oh I guess this should be
let's say move the item to the end of
the array and then then remove and
return the item of the front of the
queue so what we're going to say here is
we're going to say our push we're
pushing item on the end and we're
returning our shift I think yeah and
just feel like really be ma invade stuff
it's that display code nothing moves to
the footer at this point or it's not
hard to focus being hand right there
let's so this um this is actually being
um it actually kept i have a function
that captures the console log mm-hmm I'm
spices and I knew but it was more I
thoughtful before having an inference
from here has it's just putting it in
well or you're not using the foot at all
when you make insurances no i'm using
the header in the footer okay but what
I'm doing is I've I'm enabling the
capture of the console log and storing
it in a string the reason that I did
this way it is because I want to be able
to show the before and after to allow
them to enter an arbitrary value right
this allows them to add their own value
to the end or to change this if they
wanted to write so
modified this Lana just maybe it's more
than is actually needed mm-hmm okay I
don't know but it should because see how
it gives this really pretty output on
the left here I wanted that to be
available and there is literally no
other way to do it without some that
work we put in the footer know it gives
you that well I could make it to that
but uh but they wouldn't be able to
modify their code they wouldn't think
right anyway so we we just have some
basic tests here that it validates that
it pushes things on the end of the queue
and so on awesome okay so that passes
and let's go back to the map have you
been teasing the floor question are all
right yet they're they're all on a on my
on a branch on a branch on my my
instance of it we do not pull request
Jess correct not yet no I'm I need to
talk to I want to get this on the live
beta site you're just as a forewarning
all port-au-prince right now at travis's
fan to build everything seems just hate
I'm good on from this the greenkeeper
thing of data dependency and Travis
doesn't like me to penalty I think it
actually said in oil prices and quick
you've made this will break because you
happen to miss compiler mb paint and
then somebody merge just announced their
and but if you look at sawgrass
everything seems like it's a date sale
and because it's I Chi get Kidman he was
streaming earlier and I was watching
them do stuff I actually his poll
request failed in this trap spells news
on the one that was but actually also
aggressive sales yeah no you know what
for golf golf code actually occurs
before I introduce else statements what
change that yeah that's got to get fixed
big time did work well then where the
heck am I gonna put it my selfie ins
I think it needs to happen after the
if-else statements that's what I that's
what i said in my brain but not with my
mouth yes okay oh ok what's one thing no
he's doing requests right now oh i'm
sorry i just want to show you look at
that thing in there hi sentence is oh
I'm confused I don't know is to limit
Ian Garrett like this and creditors
blows my mind I fell wait groaning run
into the end of us do have open the web
stone okay I just kids will you know
what we're almost at the top of the hour
here I'm just gonna make a note here to
move it hi Jeff these are things that
blow my mind good evening well narrative
to be smashed I'm sorry okay I'm not
good enough ok so there's golf code and
then there is counting cards so
everybody would get to learn how to
cheat a blackjack though it's
technically not illegal and this is one
where we can definitely use switch
statements so the way the counting cards
works is that you've maintained a
register I think they call it or a count
and so low number cards are valuable to
you because it causes the the dealer to
to go bust more frequently whereas high
value cards are ones that you want
because they allow you to get a
blackjack more frequently so what we've
got is basically just this table that
you need to check the card value and you
need to add or subtract a value for it
and I just I think the easiest way to do
this is just with a switch statement and
combining multiple things so we do a
switch on card what I just like
everybody she ate those photos of and
forty forty percent so a 40-percent coat
twenty percent invalid vote in ballast
more like how many people said something
invalid Oh Carolyn handed for the wind
received this spelled incorrectly
oh man she's no good kara it's like it
okay and that's one of that's one of my
that's one that I always misspell too
yeah me too but it doesn't make it right
I before I turned out to see except for
this word oh we're sounding as an a as a
neighboring way when you go then brownie
points to Carol Ann Hannon okay weird
where is that word where is the word it
won't see okay so it's sir so what is it
it's I don't know receive or it would
receive a table has to be there's little
I yeah I ve e no no erase that yeah
great I've been going over yeah okay re
SI è i ve sure i don't know i don't
really know yeah that's it just keep
going we're what you call experts okay
so riding a bunch of case statements
here you can hear the air quotes are in
the wood experts I think that should be
the hashtag for this link with the end
quote okay case okay and we don't have
to return or wait we can just have a
default value of zero oh no we're
supposed to return something funky
actually um store back how do i receive
a code card will you spelled it right so
that's a good start well anyone's a
weird letter
oh no count is the left Google hangeth
compression that makes it you can go all
stripy okay JP so count is a global and
so we're going to increment count for
that and then four cases of ten Jack
Queen King do the things you learn DWD
not entertained with Jeff's trolling
wait don't you mean minus minus oh yes I
do pairing Perry Perry Perry oh and then
I need to break bears okay and I don't
need a break on that okay so what we
need to return we need an if statement
here BK so we need to read the rest of
the thing here so what we're supposed to
do is if count is let's see let's do go
blah blah blah pretty high resonation
pair so if count is positive we return
bet so if count is greater than zero
then we return bet now we return the
value count + space bet you she's right
jeff says why not use an object and then
Caroline says Global's don't always work
well with the other bonfires so this
might be a bad habit uh and and normally
they would not but I've explicitly made
this one work I couldn't think of any
other way to do it and also exercise the
stuff so professionally but it's two
friends the default case here inside the
switch case so there isn't really a
default case because the only times that
we want to change count is when the card
is equal to these we
default console on Eric you spanner
you're meant to put in Mumbai card
fighters right but that would mean that
we're writing good code and we're not
allowed to do that here what about seven
eight nine wow that stupid question well
there's zero so for seven eight and nine
we are not modifying the value of count
you didn't say it wasn't us do the
question oh so you don't want to do
anything for seven eight nine so yeah so
you don't do anything you're not
modifying anything okay so let me see if
I actually wrote my own thing correctly
yeah I did yeah so did not make more
sense pass everything in an array of
cars yes but they don't do I know how to
do for loops at this point the Fergana
see that's the middle I don't know yeah
kind of that's the thing that's killed
me about each of these mini bonfires is
I have I can't do it the right way
because they don't know how to do it yet
sure yeah anyway so by the way are we
still good on time because I dug Breanna
you wanna I'm gonna go cuz it's my
birthday I'm gonna go do birthday okay
well you know what if people want to
hang around I'm gonna I'll continue
going to i think i've got one or two
more many bonfires and Bentz here so he
can give me a hard time as a
professional affordable Carolyn has a
lot of work to do because yourself the
she's found like 10 spelling errors and
other thing we should get Caroline on
here well call Carolyn ok Caroline can
you can you uh do you have a headset and
stuff hey let me let me message her on
I'm Betty I'm gonna go eating cake and
undo other birthday things have finally
followed for the background yeah right
here let's see how fun I guess she's on
cleaner with the same username yeah the
problem is that i need to figure out how
to spell her name ooh standing and
spelling equals equals equals heart
okay true I have to find the Hangout she
hasn't said whether she's willing to do
it or not not the muse no I got her no
job did not use what what's not in use I
don't know I think that in response and
oh she's not fond of speaking okay we
then we will not try to drag you in okay
so we have two more mini bonfires to go
through okay so next anything from the
chat going for that okay we probably
don't even need that little thing
anymore but anyway okay so so record
collection so so let me actually talk a
little bit more about the content that
comes before here so we have more
information about how to create objects
just as data storage so we talked about
the dot operator the bracket operator
using variables in the bracket operator
updating object properties and then we
also talked about JSON data so we
actually have some examples of JSON data
like just sort of multiple nested arrays
and an object so the idea here is that
we actually have have you modifying JSON
data so we've got our record collection
here and so this is kind of a this is
kind of a tricky one here so what I've
done is I've pre entered a whole bunch
of sort of items with with fake IDs so
let me read through this so you're given
a JSON object representing a small part
of your record collection each album is
identified by a unique ID number because
it felt wrong for reals well I think you
just need a can on with you at all times
supervise the making stuff I'm not where
have I written because we have to wait
for like the time second latency and
then for 15 minutes for typing on it now
you would into a lot oh I get that
and in the previous one okay someone
probably that oh that Jason what was I
doing that is like could be just rambled
on the bedside could be at the same
point as d and productions like I don't
know if it's been deployed and the last
Ohio well so these need to go up on a
separate database I'll Caroline if you
just want to if you want to message me
in Gator the thing I'll get it fixed
because like I said I don't want to go I
don't want to go all day I don't know
people are dropping off the chat or not
okay let me go nutmeg thing okay so line
record collection here we are okay each
album is identified by a unique ID
number which has several properties not
all albums have complete information
write a function that takes an ID a
property which we're calling prop and a
value for the given ID in the collection
we have three rules here you smell rogue
oh well um okay so the idea here is that
we have to write like an if statement
that that takes into account these
things that we have introduced the has
owned properties you know what Jeff
maybe that's fair maybe we should deal
with that LA Times New Roman get on okay
so can you do me a favor and not give
Jeff a hard time while I'm trying to
type code here okay so if the collection
so it should have the ID so collection
ID dot has now we're not even testing it
the first thing we're testing is whether
value is non blank is not equal to a
blank string so if it's not a blank
string then there's two things that
could happen but if it is a blank string
that we're going to delete it
okay so we're going to delete collection
ID prop I better check for that it would
only be type of value it would accept
that we haven't in we haven't we haven't
introduced type of I'm and I'm
explicitly stating that it's going to be
blank like all of the tests assume that
it's blank so then we have a nested if
statement here we say if let's see if
the prop is equal to tracks then we're
going to push on we're going to say
collection ID prop push our value and
then otherwise for everything else we
just do collection ID prop is equal to
value and so this is definitely a little
bit more complex than then the prior
challenges and I deliberately did that
because my expectation is that by the
time they've gotten here they should be
able to do this they should be able to
understand this I'm hoping I guess we'll
find out how many zillions of questions
we get okay so if i run this uh all of
my tests should should work and all of
the tests are similarly standalone where
I'm I'm like I'm resetting values or
they're actually they are stateful so as
they go or they're not independent
anyway so I don't do a whole lot of
tests on here but i'm pretty sure that
they're that they have pretty decent
coverage so that is when we're going to
find out oh yeah
and the other thing that I do is I
actually have it out putting the
entirety of the collection in a nice
formatted way in the output so you can
do changes to it here and see them
reflected there so I hope that that's
meaningful to people are we there are
people going oh that stinks or date
doesn't seem much reaction to it I'd be
curious to see how many people come up
with a solution now it is kind of like
something that cuz when i was doing
challenges it's kind of a whole thing of
your luck and you get become locked in i
was not the first well it's fairly
because the way people work to become
locked in and you build a test or in
your solution and then people ever go
this doesn't make sense it's hard to see
where they've gone on because you're
stupid resolution your have never sara
lee sometimes I struggle but I think I
think the biggest problem at the moment
is people losing their minds of the fat
guy from line 29ft don't watch I'm from
944 damn they don't touch well I can
search for you for them to make much
difference and but to be a bit like if
you take that function on line to
anything and you just ice like that it's
quite that bad in terms of understanding
it it's dead people stuck on a little
bit still sounds like well just hello
host so normally what I've done is I've
put a set up on top and actually let me
go and modify this challenge seed so it
has that let's see record collection
because what people don't realize that
that's what kind of he gets you a jack
or something what's going on Save button
I just do that something there in there
that's because it's to Darryl yeah I'll
make that overflow so it's like squirrel
work bottom yeah like that or make like
a smaller menu well this other this
needs so much love it's a the font times
new roman and I'll be a very headaches
did you want okay so i've updated I've
updated the challenge seed so at least
that'll be there so hopefully that will
make sense okay one thing I haven't
shown is
at any time we've got example code in
fact let me let me show you that one of
those array like a huge complaint was
like the push and pop so whenever I've
got code in line now i explicitly label
it as an example so i've tried to use
comments to delineate what's going on
mm-hmm i also reduce the complexity of
the push and pop ones and i may want to
reduce them further so rather than being
multi-dimensional arrays their single
dimensional arrays because we get more
questions on pushing on pop than pretty
much any other this is one of those so I
don't ease because I like nothing else
an offense that when you pop something
off an array turns as I need a pump but
actually modifies the array I think
people expect that because everything
else is immutable yeah so it is it is a
bit of a weird it's always going to be a
hard thing to teach in a sense that if
he's going to go okay I'll make sense
I'm happy with everything yeah well so
we'll see I'm where I've tried to make
these more clear everything will change
ocean key chaste wife they've had it
ends up happening yeah yeah so we'll see
we'll start to see with the help what
help birds get new questions and so on
all right here's another example of you
know again we've got like the code is
clearly labeled example and then we have
the set up and then we have your code
goes here and I've kept this pattern
throughout all of the challenges okay so
going to what I believe is the last mini
bonfire which is Caesar cipher and this
one ends up being a really it ends up
being a little bit ugly unless you solve
it mathematically yeah imagine like some
weird dictionary which has the see the
value in the original value a funny man
well and so what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to go and cut and paste my
solution because it takes a long time to
type in but I think that it's worth
doing because it's worth getting people
to think about it and if they want to
solve it a different way
there you know more power to them okay
so here is my solution here so what I
did is I built a big lookup object now
you can do it mathematically right you
can do it with subtracting 13 from the
ASCII value and doing stuff like that
but what I'm doing is just doing a
lookup I checked for has owned property
and I do have a waypoint on has owned
property so you can check to see whether
the letter exists because we want them
to skip anything that is not a letter so
if it doesn't appear on our look up then
it just gets passed through and this is
by far the most challenging of the mini
bonfires I don't know if it's to
challenge you get honestly it may it may
be yeah I feel like gonna be easy
actually to do with with char x 0 and a
little up under that kind of stuff as
opposed to doing like a rope a match
reverse lookup because that if you want
to build a property in cipher which will
normally allow you to set the ER staff
and it makes that direction impossible
to use or if you have to write a local
preach possible select your style um I
actually genuinely think that may again
if you don't have mr. if you do cherish
because we ask you works hey is 97 which
people and ago what happened to dwell
mom too and it's actually 65 because its
capital a so I do a structure yeah I do
explicitly say that all the ladders
letters will be a capital I believe even
still I think China's going to be an
easier one it will be an easy decision
to make well did have to understand her
chair I worked but so the but at the
point of this particular exercise is to
is to do for loops and I wanted to tie
it into the stuff that they previously
learned about using objects and look
which if i use my ugly yeah i know which
is what i wrote it because i was lazy so
i shouldn't probably right up the proper
way but or with the with the for loop
well and should it oh yeah oh yeah I it
so if I could just I mean I could ride
it real quick here right 40 eyes less
than code r dot length i plus plus and
then
again this is maybe not a letters you
know what I'll just set it equal to two
code are I just so I don't have to
change all the rest of my code okay
let's see if that passes and it does so
we have free code camp free pizza free
love and the quick the quick brown dog
jumped over the lazy where it is a
question mark because the idea is that
they need to be able to skip over the
spaces and punctuation and then we just
have we exercise all all 26 letters with
the quick quick brown dog jumped over
the lazy fox okay that's awkward that's
backwards isn't it's the quick brown fox
jumped over the lazy dog I'm gonna leave
it like that just because that's how I
roll it's got character it's our dog a
happy camper from the previous previous
weight like won't put that I don't know
without the all challenges when De
Quincey knew that actually is it is
happy camper from y'all challenges yeah
I think that's uh yeah and it's still in
here one ok so I think that those are
all of the mini bonfires um I didn't
write anything for the random numbers
and I tried to clean these up a little
bit but I pretty much have not touched
them the JavaScript slot machine are
still not included the only reason
they're showing is because we're on beta
but those are ugly and I hate them so
which one's the the JavaScript slot
machines I know yeah baby oh they need
to be the only really worked if you put
them all together which I've also
there's a funny pull request of them all
together than I made last night and half
an hour and I like to see most
jerry-rigged T P you ever seen like
but actually it would work nice if you
had that set up you don't sell kind of
like and yes it's tough enough to the
editors wide enough so I think it's
broke broken on a new line which is tech
trap
section it's awful yeah the challenges
work which looks awful anyway moving
along okay oh i didn't i didn't actually
complete record collection or did I I
did I needed to save it I needed
submitted okay so I think that's
everything that I wanted to cover I
don't know if there's any if anybody
wants to see any more of these like I
said I'm gonna try and get these up on
the beta site and the next uh like
hopefully later today assuming I can get
ahold of Berkeley and that he can get
everything set up in it I like that in
the next later today yes so so we'll
just see if we can get that to go and
then everybody can go and find the
remainder of my spelling errors I am
still offering a bounty if you file an
issue on uh on the frico camp repo
pointing out my my typos and my spelling
errors then i will get those fixed and i
will and i'll try and give you some
brownie points millions of Brandis we're
gonna just set up camera BOTS like
distribution actual that's a good idea
having a baby sister a successful PR
will give you like 20 brains I was
thinking about that but I don't we don't
want a funny like think we don't want to
drive bad behavior no like I like to
point this P like I'm single doing or
jamming your typos so I think you I
think there's a lot to like in here
there's a lot of things like we talked
about global and local scope although
I'm not know convinced that these are
our fully functional yet um okay then I
think I think that's going to be it i'm
just going to finish up the stream right
now so thanks everybody gonna do
questions and answers oh do we yeah sure
yeah if anybody has any questions we can
we can we get take this right now we'll
just get the end of any music for good
or anything thanks be to think of yeah
wait for the delay and where is react
that's a great way react is not here
this is this is just basic JavaScript
the reactants a snowflake that is all
coming it should it should be released
at the same time and it's primarily just
going to be zip lines so the real stuff
of that is dependent on infrastructural
stuff which has still be done and also
the multi file add auditor good god I
can't talk the multi file editor will
take some work after that and what those
are all done and development forward to
think we'll actually be worthwhile and
calm glasses we changed slightly to
accommodate tree seeds and two and three
feet and maybe three solutions off the
tankers made the same framework has done
a really handy dandy way they might just
work with the way solutions are
information made to work with wasting
time because they strengthen our race
and what else would have Celeste for
those that it does just the crooks of
like the real on-site react of the ring
on sites and stuff that is telling James
Bond fires again make any more jazz no
fires nothing I know I have not done any
new JS bonfire so I haven't decided yet
what my next thing is going to be I may
be doing intermediate JavaScript or I
may be going back and hitting the HTML
because I think it needs some love too I
just I honestly don't know i think you
know at least for the immediate future
i'm going to play lots of video games
because i've been spending all my video
game time on writing bonfires I should
like I'm wasting time to understand
doing oh so the bonfire to come after
this are the same normal uh just the
regular bonfires right the meat bonfire
reverses string factorial is a number
and so on I kink the bonfire any good
stage ijs it's quite masses at this
point and the a strike base Jerry
intermediate might be nice like what do
you cover an intermediate because into
be kind of like well what I would see
what we're calling object oriented and
functional programming I think that this
needs to be probably 50 to 60 waypoints
and we need to go into much greater
detail about using functions and all of
the functional programming stuff uh this
is true and your functional stores would
as well because it's kind of like
concepts well it's dragging them away
but i guess like it ok so like people
need to understand how callback
functions can be passed they need to
understand currying they need to
understand functions as first class
objects and callback functions and to a
lesser extent asynchronous stuff so I
might even do some like some set timeout
or set interval examples to prepare them
for the pro maduro really do that for em
well I know you can't you can do it for
no but you can't really do Frank well I
know so it's going to require some
additional test code what we would need
to do is be able to do a mock for set
timeout so we could capture the function
that was passed to it yeah okay yay
don't make that it'd be better yeah so
I've been talking with Berkeley about it
quite a bit but he's I think he's been
doing the reactivation before he starts
working on the additional tests of
structure he's doing this and I refactor
so I think he's busy sniffing yeah and
unjust question on supporting types in
route no probably not but what will
happen is that everything to be ran
through Babel once the framework
refractors done again especially for
because when we didn't we actually have
to porsche jsx but he's stable anyway
and we might as well for that allows us
to es6 chances and that won't be go
what do you win you win the admiration
of your peers um sorry I jump my but
there are extra but you still get a
brownie point for each one of these I've
lost my train of thought I jumped my
thing yeah um juju oh yeah it'll be past
your favorite anyway so reacts will work
ya thinks will work um I think I thought
I'd answer typescript like if there's an
add-on for typescript that you can probe
into variables or conference great
training ass I don't see your language
Peter on zillow they might conflict
isn't enough is it possible to run Babel
in a browser sure why not lies okay hold
on I am liquid a favor and figured
action and I feeling that something that
would have been done and you can use
they able to transpire client-side code
that's what when you're building
reactions of your eye using but that's
happening label but that's happening
server side and that its survey no the
client side code it is a node module so
have to be written in jf affair arlen
right but if it's written using es6
itself then it won't know it's not a
threat using israel with everyone you're
cs5 because we pointed to make something
that compiled server code from er6n es6
because then you couldn't run and
actually the current version of node and
I rjs will run yes Xcode I believe
definitely I'll Jasper's and I think the
new current thing of note does if we
take a quick look at lib we take it yet
jayus hmm weather but anyway that's this
all day that's not gonna happen like any
time that X 5 to 6 months I don't think
that's a longer term is being able to
build react stuff within no I think it
should happen within the next five six
months I don't even X month it'll
probably be it probably the summertime
big releasing would hopefully be and
hopefully be back um
ona any other question time crisis yeah
I'm not seeing any other obvious
question so I think I'm gonna sign off
and I'm going to see about getting these
loaded and and all that stuff so thanks
everybody for coming out and we'll catch
y'all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
