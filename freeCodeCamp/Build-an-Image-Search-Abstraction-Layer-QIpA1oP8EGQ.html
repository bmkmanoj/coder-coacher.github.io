an image search abstraction layer here's
an example if you look at the parameters
I'm passing to this API call we are
looking for the search term law cats so
you can see these are the image results
and I'll just click one and we can see
hey it's a law cat let's take this term
and change it to something else like
grumpy cat and we can see we get a
grumpy cat image so we can see there are
10 results because we have we have some
pagination here we have an offset of 10
if I were to change that to 20 we would
see that we would be getting different
images so this is what's called
pagination where your paging through
results and if we come back here the
other endpoint that we need to create is
the ability to see what the most recent
searches were now we can see that grumpy
funny cat law cats funny
so the user story for this challenge is
I can get the image URLs alt text and
page URLs from a set of images relating
to a given search string
I can paginate through the responses by
adding a question mark offset equals and
then a number parameter to the URL I can
get a list of the most recently
submitted search strings you can get
feedback on your project by submitting
it in our code room and also be sure to
share it on Twitter and your city's camp
site on Facebook have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
