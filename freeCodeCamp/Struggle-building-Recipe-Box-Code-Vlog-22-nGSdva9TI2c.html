my problem right now is simply the order
I'm not sure what should be done after
what saying and when I have a list that
I prepared what I need to do that still
needs to be implemented it's not sure
what should be done after which thing
and this makes things problematic
because sometimes I start implementing a
thing that without other thing wouldn't
work so that's why I get stopped them
and even if I find the solution or if I
know from we are documentation how to
implement a given thing how to connect
the components how to make it and
display despite all these things I find
the moment when I get stuck because the
order was wrong just because something
else should have been implemented fast
in order to make this new thing that I'm
implementing working so this top level
logic on the level of pages of
connecting MFM with storage turns out to
be the hardest point in this project
it is a process and you know them the
more e-coat the barrier will be at it I
hope when I get stuck and I don't know
what to do next so with the cold which
option turns a man what to do and why
are you had a bug like that I reach to
these steps I write down the plan on
paper and I try to write it down with
the smallest steps so what I should do
next what generally should be done
what's the order of these things at
least what I think that the order should
be I talk with other programmers I
consult the things on various forums I
look for tutorials that have similar
projects and look for tutorials that
solve similar problems I assertions that
overflow or I post on Twitter or try to
look for a solution on forums and
sometimes I simply take a break from a
given project from a given problem I try
to go to the next issue that can be
dealt with or I go for a walk and you
what do you do when you have the
problems of focus and what to do next in
your project
please share your solutions in the
comments below
I want to make each image and that is
loaded to the recipe the same size and
to be display the scoffer so this is
another said that I have to take right
now
but now CD is not the fraction what what
does it even mean and how to solve it
to go for a walk or to continue coding
that is a question especially if you are
struggling with some problem for the
last few hours this is my answer
this project is the example of how the
decisions previously made influenced the
time needed for the final implementation
why to give you some examples if I
hadn't decided to implement images I
would save tons of time you have to
resize and crop the images in order to
allow the users to add more recipes
because local storage has their limits
it's not a user will be able to upload
just only a few recipes because of the
huge photo but because I believe that
images are crucial when it comes to
peace and the eating with your eyes I
think that this is another thing that I
will resign from another example of how
previous decisions influence the way
influenced the time you have to default
to implement a project it's using
materialized in this project I used
material life in order to save time but
right now I'm not sure if I wouldn't
have to deal with velocity is not a
function error that is hard to the back
because it is connected with
materialized and what they do I
component that I use from that
I want to finish this project as soon as
possible and make it decent that's why I
will never sign for those things that I
decided that at this stage there are too
overwhelming for me because they add up
to the overall complexity of the project
and they are not in the project
requirements this way I am resigning
from search why can't that work on
search well I wrote down on the tongue
how to implement it
what would be needed in order to do it
and many steps that will take a lot of
time right now to finish that extract
functionality that can be added to later
and some iterations each step from
clicking that search icon to displaying
the results and going to give you the
result you later coming back to home
page or two the result is everything
that should be read fault and designed
and implemented not just on inner logic
but also in the UI that would be
user-friendly it's possible but it takes
time but I don't want to go right now
maybe it's because I'm not best fed up
with this project then when I really fit
in it because it was quite hard but for
the time being search is not needed
sometimes you have to give up in order
to have the power to come back to the
project
specially if it's not for the client
because if you decided that it should be
designed this way you can also resign
from a given point never given iteration
it's something they mean this is how it
looks now I can other recipe as a photo
but the ingredients are structures then
say the recipe automatically it is added
to the list and the list is created
alphabetically so if it was fries its
after B and before age and when I
comment to this recipe I can edit it or
delete it if I edit it I can resign from
tags add some tags
still I need to fight
with this overlap this will be the next
step I can change the photo and save the
recipe if the user wants to delete a
recipe they click delete and when they
reassure this recipe is no longer in the
storage in the local storage and this
fries recipe is no longer here looking
at the user stories from number one and
I can create recipes that have the names
of ingredients yes I can I can see the
index view were the names of all recipes
are visible yes I can it's the home page
I can click into any of those recipes to
view it yes I can and then I go to the
detailed view I can edit the recipes yes
I can this is what we did and I can
delete there's a piece yes we could
delete the recipes all new recipes I add
are saved in my brother's local starch
if i refresh the page these recipes will
still be there yes it's done if i
refresh recipes Astor here
so looking at these user stories while
they are implemented but still the app
needs a lot of work I mean it could be
better it shows that fulfilling user
stories doesn't mean that the project is
done next week I'm going to test this
project once again and to go to smaller
Jas apps and reestablishing my genius
analogy as knowledge letting the code
have to do a lot
self-awareness I think that salsa
khoresht experiment and to choose to try
to take the knowledge from different
sources having a major firm of course
and it's like having the main path that
you follow so I want to go straight away
to the next react free code camp project
because I want to work more with Jas and
stuff for a moment on some solar project
or some smaller projects with JavaScript
to make me stronger in JavaScript and to
make me think clearer and JavaScript
this is what I feel that I need right
now let's check that view see if it was
the right pool keep on doing remember
that learning to code is not a race you
get on your own path your own journey
and take the decisions that you feel
that are good for you at this moment
see you next week
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
