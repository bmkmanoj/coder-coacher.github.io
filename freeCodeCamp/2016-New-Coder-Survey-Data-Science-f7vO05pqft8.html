camp and i'm here to talk to all of you
in the data science room about our
current effort to analyze the results of
our 2016 new code or survey as you may
know we recently polled 15,000 people
that are learning the code and we asked
them 48 different questions the results
of all those questions are available
here in this github repo and we also
have a list of every single question
that was asked in all possible solutions
so they're they're right in here in CSV
format we're still cleaning them up a
little bit but basically they're ready
you can dive in and start using them so
let's talk about what our goal is with
with these data well first of all we
want to create a cool website like stack
overflows 2016 survey results website so
if you look at it basically it's it's an
interactive data visualization and some
copy that kind of editorial eise's what
what's happening in there and our goal
is to basically have a simple static
website which sarong from code newbie is
designing and you just scroll through it
and there are 20 different data
visualizations covering different
aspects of the data so the way we're
organizing everything is we're just
asking a question and then someone from
the data science room can basically jump
on that question and get the data that
they need out of the data set and build
the visualization and then what we'll do
is that data visualization will be able
to embed that into the static website
and then people can just scroll through
the website and learn a whole lot very
quickly just by exploring the data
visualizations so all of these questions
are things that we think are interesting
and useful so one of the questions is
what percentage of people in small
medium and large metropolitan areas
attend coding related events this is
potentially very useful for people that
are trying to organize events in small
studies it might be useful for like the
Kauffman Foundation or rails bridge or
note school or some of these other
organizations that are trying to
organize chapters and groups so this is
this would be a helpful insight so we're
creating a list of 20 of these different
questions and what you would do is you
just dive in and grab the data you need
create the visualization and you would
basically keep us up to date on every
single step of the way so you the goal
is for us to have 20 of these data
visualizations ready by may eight at
midnight eastern daylight savings time
so we have about eight days from the
time that I'm recording this video to
build all these after we finish that we
can go ahead and launch the website and
eventually as time permits we can do a
lot more exciting things with the data
like build this type of DCJS interactive
data visualization where the end viewer
who by the way is probably not a data
scientist but it's probably somebody
who's learning to code or somebody who's
a teacher or something like that so we
should assume that that a lot of like
statistical terminology and stuff does
not need to be included it should be as
simple and clean as possible in my
opinion aim for the layperson not toward
data scientists and statisticians but
you can create something like this where
they could come in and actually explore
the data themselves and and kind of fun
in novel ways but I want to stress that
this is something we should we should do
after we've already shipped the 20 d3
data visualizations so if you have any
questions about this sort of stuff just
come and ask in the data science chat
room remember that the github repository
is the authority on who's working on
what and what needs to be done and we're
going to do everything just like a
normal open source project with branches
and pull requests and all of this will
be open source contribution all these
data visualizations will be things that
you can put in your portfolio later
and that you can potentially share and
embed in other websites that you're
interested in all of the data are free
and open we're just asking for help
organizing enough of it that we can have
this cool website that will quickly give
people a high-level introduction to the
findings of the 2016 new code or survey
so thank you very much for your help
like I said me sir on from code newbie
and evaristo who's in charge of data
science if free code camp we will all be
in the data science room working hard on
this this week and we would love your
help so feel free to ask us questions
comments suggestions anything like that
I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
