taking time out of your Saturday to join
us I know it's early on the west coast
and it's noon here on the East Coast and
if you're somewhere else in the world it
might be evening but thank you I know
for a lot of you this might be the first
monthly livestream you've attended and I
know this because our community nearly
doubled in size in the last month thanks
to thanks in part to a nice feature we
had on lifehacker com so however you've
heard about us we're so glad to have you
here with us learning to code and so
welcome and this is our August live
stream event we'd be this once a month
and we have a lot of great info to share
with you a lot of great news so welcome
and let's get started all right great
thank you very much Michael Michael of
course is our nonprofit guy he is in
charge of a lot of the administrative
aspects of our nonprofits and a whole
lot of other things so that's Michael
also quickly introduce the other people
on the stream if you can see my cursor
maybe not but this gentleman here is DC
ihsan here in San Francisco DC quick
synopsis of yourself I'm a long time
game designer and developer and recently
been working on a lot of apps that use
real-time communication with chat BOTS
and so we have some cool chat with stuff
coming later today great thanks and then
Matt Matt Yamamoto I don't know if you
have a microphone plugged in that do you
want to say something about yourself
yeah great I'm glad to be here no I'm
just jumping into freako camp try and do
a transition a career towards I'll
development so excited to be here great
well we're excited to have you matt matt
is a camper who's going to be showing
some of his amazing zip lines here in a
minute the gentleman to matt's right is
Berkeley Berkeley your camera is like
seriously foggy but we can still kind of
see you it may be the son who knows yeah
anyway Berkeley
tell us a little bit about yourself sure
sure I also transitioned to development
a while back about a year and a half ago
used to be mechanical engineer and I've
know Quincy for a while and I remember
when Quincy started for eco camp and I
just started helping me out just with
advice here and there and a little bit
of coding up and then eventually I got
sucked in um look again now yeah and
Berkeley's one of our core contributors
and and I mean he's basically leading
the way in terms of a lot of our
technical development so thank you all
for joining me for our August live
stream and I'm going to go ahead and
jump right in and show you all some cool
stuff so the first thing I want to show
you is that we have a site called beta
free code camp calm i'm going to make
this a little bigger it looks just like
free code camp right but it is a beta
version I see this sign in what get how
long its have to do this see if it works
live demo did it work it did it's I mean
with linkedin thank I don't think we can
see a screen Quincy and listen yeah I
won't I didn't want to share my screen
because it would potentially crash um
gotomeeting unfortunately so if you want
you can mute the live stream and watch
my screen on the lock screen so let me
show you the map real quick first of all
you'll see that we've significantly
expanded the curriculum we've also added
these little progress bars for the
individual sections so we have
substantially expanded the HTML and CSS
section to include a lot of new things
about the priority of CSS assignment and
color both RGB and hex code we expanded
the bootstrap section to include
actually building kind of a little
app that will be using for the jquery
section which is still in development
but you can go ahead and jump in and
play with it and most of these
challenges are completed and then of
course the javascript section which
everybody's been asking for and then
immediately after you finish the
javascript section will go straight into
the front-end development projects in
the zip lines so we've moved the zip
lines from the back of the curriculum
right before the base jumps to the front
we split the zip lines into two groups
the ones that are relatively easy to do
without a whole lot of JavaScript and
then the ones that involve a lot more
JavaScript like building a tic-tac-toe
game for example those come after all
the bonfires and we've even added a new
zip line Thiago Ferreira in and
scandinavia has contributed this
excellent zip line where you'll build
your own personal portfolio page and
that's actually the first one you'll do
now because it doesn't really involve
much beyond HTML and CSS then of course
we still have our bonfires which we're
hoping to get some additional bonfires
if you're looking for something to
contribute we have done away with the
old object-oriented programming through
Udacity and we're now using node school
courses we're using a lot of notes cool
I hope you all like notes cool it's open
source it's easy for us to modify and
it's going to be a good bridge while we
build our additional content ourselves
we're still doing the functional
programming task although many people
were protesting that that the observer
patterns and all that we're a little
advanced so we basically cut it in half
and and we're just recommending you do
the first 27 steps of
chhapar hussein's functional programming
of course we also have a gate course
through node school and a mongodb course
through night school and the only non
free code camp non node school stuff
we're using right now is a code schools
angularjs course which was actually
commissioned by Google themselves it's
pretty good course and will probably
continue to use it and then we have some
additional stuff that you'll be able to
see when you go in there but real quick
I'm just going to see if I can demo live
demo some jQuery challenges and then
some JavaScript challenges real quick so
we'll just jump right into will do this
targeting elements by ID using jquery i
just grabbed it random i hope it works
ok you'll see immediately like that we
have this nice jquery playground here on
the right we have all of these different
elements here that can be manipulated
this is all HTML and CSS that you build
up in the bootstrap section and then
we're going to apply it in the jquery
section again our goal is for you to be
writing all the code that you're using
and for everything that affects this to
be right here in the editor so what
we'll do ah looks like there's a little
bit of an issue here I'll need to fix
let's go to a different one
alright this one works so we had tests
to verify you're only using jQuery and
not directly changing the HTML and we
have this nice little message you
shouldn't need to modify code Bob below
this line so another thing I'll go ahead
and point out is that it used to be that
we had this button that said more info
and we would just tell you very
succinctly what you needed to do right
here at the top now we just have this
automatically expanded and it's in a
more narrative form so it'll introduce
the concepts and then the last line will
tell you what you need to do so
essentially what we need to do here is
we need to add the function animated and
shake and we need to do that to the
elements with the class well so first of
all we'll use jQuery selector function
right here and we'll type dot well to
select that class you'll note that it's
constantly refreshing so there's
existing jquery here that causes the
buttons to bounce so every time i do a
keystroke that's going to trigger if
it's not having a JavaScript pair which
it is now but if I remove that that
won't trigger a JavaScript beer so now I
can do add class animated shake and
you'll see that now these wells that
that the buttons are within will shake
so i use jquery to add a class of those
and i can keep progressing through these
challenges and then eventually after you
complete the jquery component will just
jump back to the map and we'll go to the
basic JavaScript section this basic
JavaScript section was made primarily by
a gentleman named Ben McMahon who's in
Dublin Ireland and he's been
tremendously helpful in designing a lot
of the aspects of the JavaScript
curriculum and he and I are
collaborating closely
these so in this case you can see a
definition of what a boolean is and it
says now let's modify our welcome to
boolean function so that it will remove
will return true instead of false and
again what we have the function right
here that we're calling and we have the
output and we have the test output as
well and for these we decided to go
ahead and leave the test so you can see
them but whenever there's an error it
will still show you nice human readable
output the value returned by welcome
boolean should be true so we just
decided to give you a little additional
information kind of like we do on the
bonfires here all right well that is the
new curriculum which is live at beta dot
freako can't calm please do your best to
break things and please do submit wiki
issues which the link for the issues by
the way is just free code camp
github.com / free code camp / free code
camp / issues and i'll go ahead and
point out that we have a lot of open
issues and a lot of this is because we
have a lot of changes that we've been
focusing on making and we some extent
neglected the issues but we're going to
go through and clean up a lot of those
in fact I'm going to clean up a lot of
these issues today after we end our
normal live stream I'm going to continue
streaming and we're going to evaluate
pull requests and pull in issues so if
you would like you're welcome to stick
stick around for those as well all right
let's pop our agenda back up and now I'd
like to hand it over to Michael to talk
about our new nonprofit projects thanks
man uh so I actually because I can't see
your screen this will be interesting I
might need we just share my house yeah
share your own screen and navigate to
beta freako
camp calm / nonprofits / directory I
know how to get there so make myself the
presenter okay show my screen and can
you see my screen yes awesome alright so
um I guess the cats out of the bag with
this one but one thing we wanted to talk
about is we have saved nonprofit
organizations an estimated four hundred
and twenty thousand dollars in web
development so far these thirteen
projects were just really a pilot to see
how this would go if it could work we
have proven this method and so now our
goal is to just put it out there and
help as many nonprofits as we can our
communities grown so much all of you
will be finishing the curriculum and
looking for a non-profit project so we
are so excited to do so many more the
this is our directory and the ones at
the top of this list are ones that we've
completed and we've listed in estimated
cost savings as well as when you click
on one you'll you'll see that it's
completed but as of today we have 10 new
projects on here beginning with I
believe triangle Bikeworks you know I
can say a little bit about each of these
there's a lot to cover so i welcome you
to go to the directory yourselves if you
want more in-depth looks but triangle
Bikeworks i spoke with the executive
director and he's got a great program
they get resized recycled bicycles and
provide them to at-risk youth and
underprivileged youth and they do
historical bike tours in actually my
area in the DC region so that could be a
cool project they're just looking for a
basic website we have joined up with
safe hands for girls which is an
organization that seeks to eradicate
female genital mutilation in Gambia
and raise awareness in the US and very
very nice group of people doing some
really important work think kids at mgh
you know I spent eight years in Boston
and it was nice to talk to somebody up
there we have had this project on the
back burner for a while looking to get
it started but they are training
volunteers and certifying volunteers to
work with at-risk youth again and we're
going to build them a volunteer
management system so that should be a
really fun project Milan and you know I
actually can't remember exactly what
they do but that's a really cute photo I
know they're in India there in India it
looks like they want a basic website we
have ranked all of these in 100 200 or
300 our estimates per camper very rough
estimates to you know help you decide if
you are ready to take on a project like
Milan for instance child first Authority
is a part of a school district in
Baltimore again near near where I'm at
in Washington DC and we're going to
replace an unwieldy Excel spreadsheet
for them so that that should be a fun
project and I think they work with I
don't know there's like eight heads of
different school districts and this is
going to benefit all of them so this is
one of those projects that's going to
have far-reaching implications and
benefits for these guys the solace
foundation of Orange County is another
great nonprofit that the B director
unfortunately lost her son to an
overdose and soon learned that there is
a medication that can help pull someone
out of an overdose so her foundation is
dedicated to educating people on how to
use this medication that could possibly
save lives
as well as they have support groups for
others who have lost people to overdoses
on drugs they do some really cool things
there other image they did a paddle out
memorial you know they're on the west
coast and they spent some time in the
ocean they do some really amazing and
creative things compared to you know a
support group with folding chairs in the
church basement or something like that
qet America is an environmental
organization doing some work in Columbia
and they're looking for a multiple
language website so this could be a good
opportunity for our spanish-speaking
campers to hop on to this one I don't
know that you'll be responsible for
writing the content but it would of
course be beneficial to speak Spanish
and read Spanish when you're building
this out for them and so we have three
more and you know I actually have four
calls lined up next week to add maybe
four more nonprofits so we're growing
but these these last three two are
environmentally related the one to one
movement is probably my favorite project
if I'm allowed to have one these guys
tend to not focus on the negatives I'm
sure all of you have seen those
calculators online where you plug in
your lifestyle and how many miles you
drive and then the output is what a
terrible person you are and so these
guys actually take a different approach
which is that you can pledge you can
pledge to say stop using plastic bags
the average American uses something like
three point two plastic bags a day and
so our campers will build an app where
there will be a calculator involved and
you'll be able to track the outcome of
how many bags for instance you're saving
and as people pledge to your idea the
calculator will take into consideration
their pledges as well and and we'll see
that number of plastic bag
saved just grow massively and this will
be a cool chance to use the d3
visualization library this is one of the
more advanced I don't think it'll be I
mean it's not rocket science it's very
basic algebra but this will be one of
the more challenging and unique projects
we have so looking forward to that one
the u.s. climate plan is also based in
Washington DC and they are looking to
build a simple website that aggregates
feeds from different campaigns and and
they're really trying to take a more
policy based approach to getting the US
as kind of a leader in in addressing
climate change and our final one and
thank you for listening to all of these
i am the nonprofit guy at free code camp
and i do this all day this is my life so
I'm excited about all of these and I
hope you are as well but the final one
is the learning exchange and there
another Canadian organization we've
helped to that I can remember how Isaiah
Kaduri and time razor up in Canada and
we're just spreading about free code
camp so the learning exchange is based
in Canada and we would like to do
several projects with them but we're
going to begin with this this very basic
one where we will replace essential
skills Quebec calm with their nine
essential skills so this is all about
improved literacy and empowering people
to understand not just you know
financial literacy and reading literacy
and really preparing people for the
world out there so those are 10 new
nonprofit projects we're excited to
announce we're always looking for more
if you know of a non-profit maybe you're
friends with somebody who helps on the
board at one and they're looking for pro
bono web development please send them to
free code Kent calm and we would like to
get hundreds of these and you know as
you know we do not have an advertising
budget right now so it's word of mouth
only please share what we share on
Twitter will
most of these nonprofits have found us
through Twitter it's been effective but
we want to spread the word and have
non-profit projects ready for you to for
for you to build out when you're done
with the new curriculum so Quincy that's
all I have but thank you for giving me a
chance to share all this with our
community absolutely I just want to
underscore that four hundred twenty
thousand dollars that Michael was
talking about i mean that's money that
the nonprofit's didn't have to spend on
salesforce or whatever enterprise
solutions they would have probably run
too if somebody hadn't offered to give
them some some guidance and build some
solutions for them that's money that
they ultimately were able to put toward
their cause rather than you know
administrative overhead so we're really
excited about that and we're just
getting started um I wanted to go ahead
and talk about our wiki which is an
amazing new development that David DC
kind of spurred me to take a look at so
let's take a look real quick if we go to
wiki so it's not actually located on
free code camp com we decided instead to
just use github we're using external
platforms to the extent possible instead
of creating a groups thing we're using
facebook groups we're using git er
instead of trying to build our own chat
service like I think for us we can focus
our efforts on on the few things that
really matter instead of building out
like the basic nuts and bolts
infrastructure for our community and and
github has an excellent wiki system
right here I'm going to go ahead and
share the link in case anyone wants to
come in and check it out let's drop it
into twist yet so we used to have
something and it still exists on for
cocaine com called the field guide and
it was basically it is basically a
sequence of different articles you can
read and we can render HTML and all this
in here like I built it and I was really
proud of it oh this is great but it was
difficult for people to contribute to it
and I totally understand why now that
i'm using this wiki instead it's so easy
to create a new article which we can do
right now let's go ahead and just create
one for our august live stream and so i
can include a photo let's just pop this
over here and i will just take a quick
screenshot if i can get sketch to open
up so let's just take a quick screenshot
of this we have 446 people watching
which i think is a new record i don't
think we've ever had 446 people watching
our twitch stream co so congratulations
everyone you're part of free cooking of
history right now so I've got into that
twice as many yet so I'll just drop the
image URL in here and I'll just alt text
is supported by default which I love
because we have a lot of campers who are
visually impaired and use screen readers
and other tools to get around websites
so we'll just say screenshot from our
twitch feed on August 1 2015 and then we
can just write about it and cool
Wikipedia cell you know um fact itude so
we'll just say free code camps august
love stream was the largest yet the
agenda
included and then I can just grab this
copy here and believe it or not this is
actually valid markdown these little
dashes are going to be rendered as
bullets and then later I can come back
and add a so this is what it looks like
now you can see that um it includes the
screenshot and everything so let's go
back here and I'll just do the agenda
included and then I can just save this
page and now if i go over two pages here
i can just search and i'll just search
for august livestream and pull it up
there it is it's got its own URL which
i'll just drop into the twitch stream
real quick so everybody can see it and
you can even do these offline if you
want like if you don't like a github
graphic user interface you can clone it
and modify it there but basically i'll
just show you the homepage real quick we
go to home so it's very convenient to
traverse because it's got these pages
we'd love that thousands of pages
because search makes it so easy to get
around and we we just like to link you
know 11 article to another see here's
our article about Gator that I wrote
last night that and it has some helpful
links to get to you know downloading the
Gator app for example which if you
haven't downloaded that the desktop app
or at least tried dinner it's a great
tool that we're working very closely
with the team to improve get ur and
they're very receptive to our feedback i
met with their their founder a few days
ago in person in san francisco so um the
idea behind this wiki is it just makes
it very trivially easy for you as a
camper to come and contribute knowledge
if you want to add some tricks from
bootstrap or so
tricks that you learned about jQuery
that you can kind of sort into the short
modular articles then what we can do is
somebody also come along and create like
a basically kind of a list of such short
articles that will link to a general
list of tips and then that list of tips
will be linked to you know maybe even
our homepage where we say you know
here's here are some places to get
started so we had this new to free code
camp and this is basically all the
articles that were on our field guide
originally including our list of camp
sites which has grown I mean I'm
scrolling really fast here they're like
more than 300 campsites all with their
own Facebook and I get her rooms the
facebook groups and their Gator rooms
like this is one of my favorites yeah
long day um it's a huge group and yeah
I've really enjoyed like talking with
some campers from gallon day so speaking
of chat rooms while we're here in the
wiki let me just show you some of the
new chat rooms we've created see today
so we'll just go to I can just type chat
and its immediate full text search so
we'll just go to official chat rooms and
let me just kind of highlight some of
these new chat rooms in case you haven't
checked out this list yet um which is
also on preco kept calm but the newest
version of this is in the wiki we're not
going to update the field gun articles
anymore in fact I've completely removed
the field guide from beta so this will
be our new kind of go to go to resource
so we created a room specifically for
getting help with zip lines specifically
for getting help with bonfires and BASE
jumps and these linked directly to the
rooms so you can just click that and
it'll open up the room and you can talk
about solving things in here and we also
have a coating jobs room somebody asked
encore recently see what was it
ah here has anyone landed a job after
completing pre-code camp and of course
the answer is like tons of people have
uh but like we had three people that got
a job last week that I knew of so I
wrote this article like somebody asked
me this question on Korra which I'll go
and drop in there but because a lot of
campers are going out and applying for
jobs and applying for jobs is a pretty
tricky task I decided that we would go
ahead and just create a jobs room where
you can just talk all day long with
other campers about interviewing
networking building a portfolio another
room that we thought we needed to
complete create was a motivational room
because frankly like learning to code is
not a technical problem it's not a
question whether you're smart enough
it's a question whether you're motivated
enough so we created that you can do
this room where you can get moral
support and just kind of share your
feelings about learning to code because
everybody goes through a lot of rough
patches when they're learning to code
their development environment gets
screwed up they just get you know error
messages that aren't very helpful and
it's just a matter of like going and
like talking to other people and staying
motivated because if you can stay
motivated if you can keep coding every
day you are going to learn how to code
well enough to get a job like that is
pretty much certain another room we
created is the newsroom where we talked
about stories that are trending on
camper news we also created an issues
room for us to discuss in real time
outstanding github issues our pair
programming women room has been very
popular with women of course women can
pair program with whoever they want but
if they choose to pair program with
other women we wanted them to have a
nice environment where they could
coordinate that another room we recently
created is the halfway club which is for
campers who completed all the base jumps
zip lines and bonfires and are either
starting or have already started the
nonprofit projects so of course in our
curriculum we say eight hundred hours of
basically content that you work through
and then eight hundred hours of
nonprofit projects in practice most
people get a job before they even start
a non-profit project or shortly after
they finish their first one but we
ideally want people to be doing lots of
them we're not going to tell them don't
go and get a job but if they can stick
around and do more nonprofit projects
we've got tons of nonprofits that need
our help we've also created a beta room
where you can discuss changes in the
beta and we've created a data science
room which is basically where we're
going to discuss our data set free coke
camps data set will be anonymised and
basically made completely public to
where nobody can be identified of course
because we don't want anyone to know any
information about you as a person but
campers in aggregate a lot of academics
a lot of researchers have been
approaching me asking for our data set
because they want to write academic
papers about free coke can and it's new
kind of paradigm of teaching people how
to code and getting them getting them
employed so we're planning to join the
open data movement and this data science
room is where if you're interested in
data science if you're interested in
statistics you can go here and we're
going to be taking huge swaths of our
data basically everything we can and
releasing it to the public like
literally anybody any kid on Kaggle can
pick it up and start gaining you know
making meaningful inferences from it so
those are our new chat rooms and we're
really excited about them we also of
course have chat rooms for every single
campsite in every single city which 350
rooms for that keep in mind that because
we have so many rooms a lot of them are
going to be kind of sparse but they will
gradually pick up as we grow and it just
takes a few people chatting in a room to
kind of create that critical mass and
more people will pile in and we've seen
a lot of our chat rooms just really blow
up in terms of volume of interactions so
with that I would like to mention that
we have
some new live streams we recently
created a live coding TV account and
we're going to be streaming a lot of
content here you can see that actually
the issue um Chris and streaming right
now which I'm going to pause but we're
getting some followers here I'll go
ahead and drop this into the stream as
well and our goal is to be streaming
eventually 24-7 straining probably more
game development like we did we had a
huge game development marathon two
weekends ago that was very successful we
had probably 50 40 or 50 concurrent
people watching that the entire weekend
we went 24 7 for the entire weekend I
was even up like it like three in the
morning really groggy doing some like
some gaming related to programming so
because we now have our twitch and our
live coding we also decided to create an
internet radio station which is
something that was very frequently
requested by our campers the idea is
that instead of having song requests on
Twitch we have the ability to basically
anybody who wants can come in and
request music and they've got their own
playlist and I can jump in and DJ so
right here we can see venetia's is
basically playing a song from his
playlist and this room we would love to
get more people in here I'm in here a
lot playing a lot of electronic music
some people play rock it's a good
eclectic mix looks like Earth Wind and
Fire just came on I mean eat there's all
kinds of awesome stuff going on here so
I'm going to drop this link in the
stream as well and i will say that a
plug is great it's free you don't have
to have an account let me just verify
this is if you go and you don't have an
account this is what you'll see when you
try to go to a free code camp I think
you'll still be able to listen to music
so you may have to yet there you go
so yeah it'll play so I strongly
recommend you check out both our live
coding channel and our internet radio
channel and I'll of course add links to
all that in the wiki soon awesome all
right plug for plug yeah plug for plug I
love their product is free it's cool so
with that I would like to address we
have over 540 people watching the stream
right now it's a new record yeah great
to have you all here so we're going to
keep moving with respect to everybody's
time out of respect for every with time
and i would like to reintroduce Berkeley
and DC that are they're both here in San
Francisco with me and they have been
hard at work on something very exciting
so would one of you care to share your
screen Michael could you promote one of
them to from to presenter I sure can who
would like to present I think I'll
probably watch right we want to come on
would ya hey all right send that over to
you bc already should be able to present
soon okeydoke so hello everybody if you
can give me feedback if the screen
sharing is working just while I'm
waiting to see that come online we've
been working on some very exciting
chatroom technology so as you know one
of the great things about free code camp
is the active community that we've got
so let me just run through and show you
some of the things that we've got here
so we've built a chat bot that is going
to help people in a chat room to bring
in all of the other content from free
code camp from the wiki and other
sources that we have so we're just
rolling it out very gently right now
it's live in free code camp on git er I
am in the help bonfires channel so i'm
putting i'm showing the link up here on
screen and you can go to hell
bonfires and try it out so let's just
walk through some of the things that
this chat bot can do so if I go into the
help bonfires channel which I've got
here and basically if you type in help
it will give you a list of commands that
the bot can actually do so for example
you can type find by a topic or and it
will give a list so let me for example
if i type in find j/s it will give me a
list of all the JavaScript entries from
the wiki and then you could actually
click to go through and look at any any
of those so I could type I could just
click on the ternary jst ornery and it
will bring me right into the wiki and
you could edit and add things one thing
that you can also do that's a little bit
knee is right in line in the chat you
could just type wiki j/s ternary for
example and it will bring in a little
example piece of text like that where
there's the first part of the demo
coming its first part of the wiki entry
coming in so what we do is if I just
compare that if i go back to looking at
that in the wiki itself you'll see
there's an h2 tag there's a bunch of
other stuff here I go in and edit it
you'll see there's an h2 tag here which
is that with these one of these double
things and that means that we we only
show it up to the first h2 so I'm just
going to edit this and show how this
works ah see well basically I could put
any like put any funny thing in the wiki
more stuff from here or more stuff on
the wiki itself and then if I hit return
here now we've updated the wiki and in
fact the the process for updating the
wiki still involves me doing one manual
step but we're going to automate that
soon so now if I go back into the
chatroom and i typed help j/s or helping
with here just synonyms for each
help or wiki JS ternary you'll see that
line that I added there more stuff on
the wiki itself so you can very quickly
create things in real time so for
example i think when Quincy was oops
let's just say hey it worked yes I think
when Quincy was doing the August live
screen stream and create an entry for
that I can now do find August and
there's the August livestream and you
can immediately go and find that in the
wiki as well so these find and wiki
commands are very very convenient for
doing things but we've added even more
kind of cool stuff on top of that one of
the other commands is for example well
let me look at i'll show you in the in
the chat itself you can have a machine
is bogging down with all these different
streams and close the twitter stream
there so for example arm we've got a
camper bot testing channel by the way so
don't drive people mad in the main chat
if you can use the camper boat testing
so for example i could type in thanks to
or i could type in about a another
username and let me see if i can find
another user here so about Abbess and
what will actually do is it it looks on
the beta site and it gives you a little
profile of that person so at the moment
he's got 20 stars now let's say he just
helped me and we'd been inside the chat
and he'd given me a lot of help on a
problem that i was having so i can
actually say to him right inside the
chat here i can say thanks idisk very
hardly bring me to pronounce and then it
will actually send these kind of karma
points or maybe we're going to call
brownie points and now you see that he's
got 21 points so the idea is if people
help you inside the different channels
we really want you to you know make sure
that they get rewarded for that and then
in future what we're actually going to
do is archived all of these messages
where people have a
the conversation and someone gets helped
will archive that message and then add
that to the wiki later so it all we will
become actually sir and this is what we
were calling like the real-time stack
overflow and so I've got like a very
first draft of a archive feature someone
else is typing in here so its archives
for testing and so for example I could
click on after using the archive command
and there's actually an archive of all
of the previous chats that actually
happened in that channel as well so
that's some another another neat command
that we've got let me show you some of
the other things and other people have
already started adding stuff to these
wikis since we previewed this last night
so some of the other commands but may be
interesting to people for example you
can say oops my computer's bogging down
with ELISA for things okay so i could
say like ricky bobby tables and it will
actually pull in like a XKCD image this
is kind of just demonstrating that you
can have video and all kinds of stuff in
here you could have wiki I had an
example entry on video and that will
should bring up a video clip there we go
we've got a special Rollem command but
i'll let people try that one out because
that's like a new interesting
commandment we've added actually let me
continue the chat of this inside the
actual help bonfires so there are lots
more commands that are coming are for
example I just showed you there's a
music command which will link through to
the plug DJ and we may add in here kind
of like what's now playing in plug DJ
then we also added like a quick link i
just added this command while we're
talking twitch which will show you it
should show you the kind of content from
twitch maybe that one's still in
progress oh yeah sorry it's helped which
because it's a wiki entry so then you
can actually see a stream of the twitch
inside the chat and basically all of the
commands for this the next thing that
we're going to be working on is probably
bonfires but we're really really
interested in any kind of help and
comments that people would like to add
so just like everything on free code
camp the source for this is actually all
open source so here's the URL and if you
look on if you ask for help from the
chat bot then it will link you through
and you can actually come in and we've
gotta get a room for that as well and so
the next thing that we're probably
planning are like step-by-step tutorials
for the bonfires and some other things
like real-time tagging and then maybe
potential natural language processing
and things like that so the chat that
we're using for the Gila bar is linked
to the actual repo and so any
contributions you'll be able to see kind
of in real time in the repo thread over
here and if people want to pair program
or get joined in to making this chat bot
it's actually pretty simple so I'm
opening up the window here to the chat
bot code itself and if you go into that
repo you'll find there's a file called
bot commands look where it's very easy
to just add new commands so for example
the command in here that i just showed
which was music is literally as simple
as creating a string and returning that
string back to the chat room so in this
bot commands file it's very easy to add
new commands as we go on so that's an
overview of where the current chat bot
is out and I'd encourage people to go
into the either the get a camper bot /
testing channel or on free code camp
help bonfires and you know play around
with the bots and find out where the
chat rooms are and together we can make
this into a really cool thing for the
future of like real time learning so
that's an overview of the chat bar thank
you very much dcn
I just wanted to point out that a camper
Ryan mom is behind the the artwork for
camper bots and he did a fantastic job
he really blew us away yep we've got
some really cool personality to the to
the chapbook sir at fund I know I just
want to give DC you especially and also
Berkeley for helping a lot on the
integration side on freak okay I just
want to give you both a big round of
applause if you all join me in a round
of applause around the world for these
these two gentlemen working very hard at
building out new features good job
fellas I mean this is going to
revolutionize our chat room I just want
to like underscore the magnitude yeah
one feature that's kind of interesting
is if you go in the chat room and if you
type I mean help bonfires right now and
you type like help some random thing or
you could what you could do is first try
and find it may we may have a nutrient
random doesn't look like it so if you
then type like help random um it will
say no wiki entry has been found and it
gives you a link right there that you
can just click and you can just create
it right away and say you know my random
thing and then you could put in a little
h2 and like more random stuff would go
be below there and you'd hit okay and
then I'm just going to unfortunately I
have to manually deploy it right now but
now if I go back to the chat room and
type help random then it should in real
time always love doing live demos there
we go and here is the wiki entry that's
some person just created so we've got a
real-time way of creating documents and
adding to them to the free code count
knowledgebase so everybody please
contribute wiki content if you want a
code help us with code if you want to
content help us with content so sorry
can I said that's just thought it'd be
good to show somebody actually how easy
it is to add to the wiki thank you so
much yeah I'm extremely excited about
the wiki so just let me do a quick aside
about what David's working on here
I often get approached by campers who
are asking for forums and other forms of
asynchronous kind of like content
logging if you will like longer form
conversations and free code camp we're
very big on real-time the web enables
real-time frankly there are so many
people in free code camp we we have like
75,000 campers who are registered and we
have you know more than a hundred
thousand monthly active campers that
aren't necessarily registered but we
made all our content available without
creating an account so a lot of people
just come and use like one off
challenges but we have so many people in
the free code camp community it just
seems ridiculous to like post something
and way today and come back and see the
response when you can get a response
from somebody right now so the big
challenge is like you've got this
torrent of communication going on in the
chat rooms how do you actually curate an
archive all that in a way that like
makes sense to search engines and make
sense to other people that are coming
along later and what DC is working on is
essentially a way to figure out just
from looking at the transcript of the
text what's significant was there a
thank you at the end of it was it are
these questions frequently asked maybe
even create composites of frequently
asked questions so the frequently asked
questions won't be you know human
curated list of frequently asked
questions but literally the questions
that are most frequently asked that are
in a constant you know running kind of
leader board of questions about a
specific bonfire or about a specific zip
line so this will be in my opinion much
more valuable than our forum was when we
use it very few people actually used it
so we retired it but this is essentially
a way of linking the real-time nature of
chat with the permanence of a forum and
of course get ur is extremely gives us a
ton of latitude they archive everything
everything's indexed on google like
we're huge on transparency and
permanence of everything that happens at
free code camp for
or historic reasons for academic reasons
and for the benefit of our actual
campers being able to just get things
done and learn to code more efficiently
and get a coding job more efficiently so
thank you very much DC Thank You
Berkeley for putting all that together
it's amazing and I can't wait until
we're able to roll it out to all of our
chat rooms we are a little bit behind
schedule but I want to hand over the
presentation to this channel matt one
yeah absolutely Berkeley if i could i
just want to give a shout out to get her
team i get her dad i am there have been
awesome and responsible to us and all of
this wouldn't be available if we were
still on slack for instance i just want
to give them a shout out before we
transition to something else yeah all
right and at this point I'd like to hand
it over to Matt Yamamoto who's going to
talk about some of his incredible zip
line projects that he's built over the
last few weeks hey great thank you it's
my screen showing yes I did okay perfect
yeah so I've been having a lot of fun i
finally got to the zip lines which is uh
which was pretty exciting and I think
when I first started doing the zip lines
that which one was the first one it's
really cool to see the new beta content
you guys have because I fly started to
twitch when I felt like the learning
curve was was really steep which which
was fine maybe go work a little harder
but it's nice to see some some stuff
that kind of help people get up to speed
I also really like you know if if you're
listening and you don't follow on
twitter if you're cooking up it's really
nice to see when people finished yours
it plans and the link is tweeted out was
really cool to go look at other people's
stuff and for me that really kind of
inspires me so even before I got to the
twitch tip line I had seen other
people's stuff and I was like man okay
when I get there I want to try to do
that and when I get there I want to try
to do that and even before I got there
in my head I was like okay the one thing
I want to try to do as a challenge to
myself was implement
um kind of an autocomplete because I
hadn't seen out and anyone's twitch the
plan yet so once i started making it you
know i try to build the other stuff the
other people done first so obviously the
first ones where you know have the the
filter buttons and have the ability to
search within the streams and then one
of the tweets i'd seen someone's worked
the very first time i saw was someone
that had the ability to add a channel
which is cool so I thought whoa Calum me
let me see if I can do that and I'm
going to add one that's already on here
actually because I think the one I
checked out um if you added someone that
was already on your list it just didn't
get added but it didn't alert you to
anything so I said why should have
should have some way to alert the users
with the warning and so I created a way
to alert for various reasons but in this
case that a user has already have been
added you know so I could remove someone
and then I don't know why this is always
the channel i tested with so we could
remove them and add him back but the
really cool thing that i was at least
pleased with myself for doing was if you
notice when i was typing in a box here
there's kind of an autocomplete that
begins to go and the interesting thing
is that the twitch api doesn't allow you
to search for like usernames or channels
i'm not super familiar with the twitch
so i kept getting confused between
channels and streams and users so i used
a little bit of a hack and I kind of was
using their search for channels and
would pull back the names and then I
filter out anything where the user
didn't match what the was being inputted
the website and so it's not perfect
sometimes they'll be typing a name that
you know exists and you're not actually
getting a suggestion but it works out
worked out most of the time so I was
pretty happy with that and I would say
that that at this point I was thinking a
lot about I tend to test on my browser
on my desktop obviously where I'm
working right always try to look on my
iPad and iPhone as he was looking like
there because I know how important kind
of having a what you're developing work
everywhere and that's been a little bit
of a challenge for me this one doesn't
work quite well at my iphone yet I plan
to go
back maybe and work with that some more
so after I finished that I was feeling
pretty confident with myself because
this was the first time I put together
all the skills of HTML CSS and the
JavaScript allah jquery and so I was
moving on to the random code generator
and you know I'd seen a bunch of
people's examples of this and I thought
okay well how can I make mine different
you know instead of just the standard
kind of here's a quote and you know
here's another quote here's another
quote and for whatever reason I decided
I was like well it'd be kind of cool if
I had that kind of computer typing out
at you your quote and I said well I'd be
kind of cool if it was actually
interacting with you as if the computers
talking to you and so that was the idea
i went with and at some point I just
thought of would it be kind of cool
feels like how was talking to you and so
I was like I was gonna go pull an image
of the how kind of eyeball thing if I
said well it'd be kind of cool if I
could make then CSS and so I decide to
challenge myself to a little bit of CSS
design and so I got the background
working pretty well but in the end I
ended up with something so it comes in
here and it will welcome you and you
could type in your name and i think i
always used a when i was testing you
know it's it's working a kind of like a
much more limited lower version of the
chat but you just saw you know you could
put your name and a sea-witch like to
hear quote unless let's hear what sure
and it's this was fun for me to do
because it really you know it was like
okay so here's what I want to do is give
them a quote and have them tweeted out
but what's the best way to present this
information to whoever's using the
website you know what's the best way to
kind of get them to understand what's
going on here so it really made me think
a lot about you know not just getting it
to do a certain thing but how is someone
else using it that's not me that didn't
think about how to make this going to
make it work and so you know I still
implement all the things that r asked
about you can still tweet out your quote
you can ask it for help like it out so
early there's a few things they can do
for you you know some of them I can get
the link for the quotes and it will be
an active link so it can take you there
on the screen gets a little full clear
it
I put some fun stuff in there you know
like from the movie maybe we want to
open the pod bay doors but of course and
have that happen so I had a lot of fun
with this and this was a you know a
little bit more work perhaps i need to
do i spent probably about a week with
maybe good three hours a day working on
it and it was really for me as i'm doing
all this free code camp stuff it's i
think of something i want to challenge
myself to do i achieve it but as I'm
doing that I go man okay this is looking
like it's gonna work maybe maybe I can
make it do the next step and you know I
spend hours going on man i can't believe
i decide to sue this no I really quickly
show you what I'm working on right now
so for example i'm now on to the the
weather one and there was two things I I
really wanted to get down and I'm
getting close i'll buy finished this
weekend there's a little bit of markup
here for my layout but the first one I
wanted to do was kind of do some
transformations to get some 3d effects
going because I haven't done that yet
and i feel like my CSS skills are a
little limited right now so that's where
we can you to populate the bag and then
I can't remember the person's name but
there was a camper maybe a week and a
half ago that finished the weather app
and she had a bunch of SVG animations in
the background moving across the screen
was very well done and after I saw that
I was like man I should really look up
some SVG stuff and how that kind of
graphic element works and so I tried to
implement this day meter it kind of
shows you the progress of the Sun
between sunrise and sunset and stuff I
to reload here and while we're waiting
for that reload I'll just say the camper
is Heather trophy and she has some
amazing zip lines as well i was actually
going to have her come on as well with
you Matt but she had a thing with her
daughter but nods to get her stuff is
yeah it's really amazing if you haven't
gone to look at it yet uh so anyway so
yeah I got the graphic I just got this
working Ashley this morning before i
took the gotomeeting call so i was
actually really excited to get the meter
kind of sets the sunrise sunset points
and is actually showing the progress of
the day
I got to work on these words rotations
and stuff but intimate you know for me
that the challenge with the zip lines
isn't to you know do the the stories
that are put forth in the in the zip
line itself it's really okay I know I
can get that done and it's going to
teach me as I do that but really what
can I do for myself that's new and going
to push what I'm doing and its really
you know after doing the twitch supply
which took me I don't know maybe three
weeks as I'm doing these other ones it's
just so much easier so much quick
because it's like okay I want to do this
I know exactly how to do this because
it's very similar I'd to be forward so
it's like I said it's good to see the
new beta stuff I think that'll really
help a lot of the campers ramp up as
they're doing the other zip lines so
that is a zip lines have done so far we
need to get you on a non-profit project
stat that's really good work Matt yeah
thank you um just took just a quick
footnote to what Matt was saying he
talked about how he struggled initially
to try to like build the first zip line
but in the process of struggling he
learned a whole lot of different things
and now it's all downhill in terms of
like it'll always they we always say
you'll never know less than you know now
right like every little bit of
information you you essentially
incorporate into your skill set through
practice will just make you a better
developer and it's great that you're
taking these so seriously Matt yeah
that's a lot of fun you know I am eager
to get through the curriculum but I
think I'm a little bit of a
perfectionist sometimes and so I'm also
here to make it you know meet my own
standards so well thank you very much
Matt um so I think that concludes our
agenda for what we wanted to talk about
and we've gone a little bit long but we
want to stick around and answer
questions and then as soon as we've
answered all the questions the plan is
I'm going to continue streaming and
we're going to go and attack this
massive you know
I think we have like 25 outstanding pull
requests I'm just going to start trying
to like plug through those and verify
whether they're good and like address
them I'm going to do that live on stream
so you can watch that workflow and if
any in it if any of you want a pair
program with me that'd be great we can
do that too but but that's the plan so I
don't know if anybody has been gathering
questions there have been some really
good questions that have been asked and
they just blaze past because there's so
much activity in the chat but um would
anybody like to when curate can somebody
volunteer okay one question that's been
coming up bot is for those trying the
beta site the beta site database is not
currently synced up so it's a very old
version of the database is all about
40,000 bees on that so your account may
not exist on the beta Africa camp com
version another question that's income
github and I'm sorry the Google and
Facebook off do not work currently and
that is probably because the URL is
different and go go on facebook don't
really like that but twitter and github
is working and you could always sign in
with email another question is is there
a timeline for the police of this new
course where's and I think it should be
any day now Quincy do you have any more
insight into that absolutely so I will
tell you that um free coke camps growing
very rapidly we get like more than a
thousand new campers a day coming to
check out the site for the first time so
we want to be very conservative about
actually pushing stuff that could be
like a diminished user experience we
want to be very cognizant and put our
best foot forward so we just want to
make sure that everything works really
well before we move it out so that's one
of the reasons it's taken so long is
like me I just I have like you know
these fever dreams and sweats and just
wake up and like Oh No thank God we
haven't pushed the beta yet because i
just remembered i haven't done this so
it may be another week I mean honestly I
just want to
make sure that we're completely ready to
roll and that you know for example like
all of our press that has come like
we've been in you know Inked Magazine
Time magazine techrepublic lifehacker of
course which has been huge I never would
have imagined lifehacker would be so
much more important than like wired
magazine but it is I mean that's a
people rely Packer especially people
that are interested in learning the code
so like all that has come from campers
like it's been campers who Britain those
articles they just happen to work it
wired or they just happen to work it and
lifehacker so we're not doing any PR at
all and we had no knowledge of any of
those things happening before they
happen we just thank our lucky stars
that free coke camp was in a stable
state and that we didn't like look like
a bunch of idiots that couldn't keep our
servers running you know so um for that
reason I like another good point is this
is like a huge change our back-end is
changing dramatic I drastically we're
also using multiple servers in this new
version there's a lot of things that are
changing we want to make sure everything
is working there's another question here
in the stream if I can find it oh what
Oh campers do that are currently doing
classes are doing a cold school stuff
finally do with new curriculum let's
introduce that's always a very good
question I'll take that one if that's
okay with you so there's always like
this like oh man but I was halfway
through that course and what my advice
is it's like please finish that course
enjoy it like we don't recommend
mediocre courses like I Codecademy has
really good stuff in my opinion it may
not be ideal um it may be somewhat dated
but i will say that um that they work
very hard on their course where um and
same thing with like code school same
thing with Udacity and a lot of these
other resources that were replacing the
Stanford cs101 class is excellent I
recommend you take it if you want but
what we're doing well you're removed
from our curriculum is we're saying
it's not necessarily worth your time and
energy we assume that you are extremely
busy we assume that everybody a pre code
camp has jobs or they have kids or they
have a mortgage and or they're just
hustling and trying to get things done
and we want to be as respectful of your
time as possible which is one of the
reasons why we basically try to make
everything as succinct as possible and
just save you time and for that reason
if we pull some content and replace it
with our own content there are several
reasons for that one we have full
control over our own content we have no
control over Codecademy some of the bugs
we reported the Codecademy have just
gone on fixed they probably have a huge
development team and and all this stuff
but they just can't keep up with all the
issues I guess but we can stay on top of
the issues and we will and we'll make
sure that bugs get fixed make sure that
we have control over that another thing
is we'll have better analytics in terms
of where people have trouble where
people get frustrated and quit free code
camp those kinds of things and people
don't generally quit quit they like quit
for a while and go do something else and
then they'll come back eventually and be
like I need to get back on this but we
don't even want them to like temporarily
take a break like ideally in my opinion
you should try to be coding a little bit
every single day if you want to keep
making progress you know you talk to
like world-famous pianists they don't
stop playing piano and just take a week
off you know like they practice every
day and that's generally the case for
everything that you're passionate about
that you really care about so so we have
the analytics if we have our own content
as well and another thing is it's open
source we now we use node school node
school is completely open source i know
some of the key contributors on that and
they're really cool people and they have
good intentions I don't know code school
just got acquired by a big corporation
pluralsight that is basically enterprise
content I don't know how long that
stuff's going to be freely available
like most of it isn't freely available
the angular course is still freely
available we're going to continue to use
that for now but we just want to
we want to have as much control over the
quality of the content and we want to be
able to fix things and we want the
analytics though those are the reasons
why we're trying to replace with our own
content so let's see does anybody else
want to grab a question from the torrent
of questions coming in yeah I'll go
someone I have just roll up amberlynn
had asked if they were going to refer a
non-profit to free code camp is there a
link that they should give them you know
giving them just free code camp com
they'll be able to find us there's a
call to action that says my nonprofit
needs coding help or something along
those lines you can also send them to
free code camp calm / nonprofits or they
could tweet it as I'm code nonprofit on
Twitter they can also tweet at free code
camp and we'll get the process started
so again please please tell everyone you
know that we're coding for Bono another
question nest have asked how do you feel
about creating short curriculums for
teaching computer science and web
development to middle and high schoolers
so actually a lot of a lot of
homeschoolers and a lot of high school
programs are actually using preÃ§o camp
actively penn state i got like an email
from one of their students that said
they were creating like an informal
learn to code group in like their mba
program so they're using free code camp
like a lot of people are using free code
camp for different purposes one of the
one of the perils of trying to design a
curriculum for a lot of different types
of people is you lose the focus right
now our curriculum is purely focused on
busy adults who are trying to learn to
code for the reason of getting a coding
job and that's how we're going to stay
focused because frankly that's the
biggest underserved majority of people
who need to learn to code are people who
are already out of school and
can't just go and take some computer
science courses in their degree program
can't just drop everything and go to a
coding boot camp those are the people
that we want to help so if we're able to
help home schoolers and high schoolers
and middle schoolers and and MBA
students and all these other
demographics that's wonderful but
there's only so much we can do without
you know kind of diluting our mission
and and we definitely want to make
everything open source want to keep it
well we will make everything open source
everything's open source everything's
free everything's self-paced
everything's browser-based we want to
take away all the excuses for people not
using us or even making an offline mode
where you can basically use free code
camp on a computer that has intermittent
power access and no internet um I have a
friend who basically takes Khan Academy
lessons packages them up on raspberry
PI's and then sends them to Africa and
South Asia where people use them to to
learn science and math and we want to be
included on those so we're going to have
a nice offline mode soon we're serious
about accessibility we want coding to be
accessible to everyone that's part of
our overall mission we want to be the
best place to learn to code period and
we'll get there but it's just a matter
of prioritization so middle school in
high school is not a high priority at
this point because they have tremendous
resources already available to them
however if you're able to use free code
camp for those purposes we will
definitely do what we can to help you so
Quincy someone asks so if we are working
on the original FCC should we switch
just to the baby now that depends on
whether you feel comfortable doing that
the beta you're going to encounter a lot
more bugs and we're still working on the
database situation I can't one hundred
percent guarantee that like all your
completion of different challenges is
going to map directly over to our new
database at this point berkeley's
working on that we're hopeful that we
can get that going but we're just not um
I mean I I just want you to
the most of your time and if you feel
that the best use of your time is to use
the new challenges which are superior in
my opinion I mean I'm sure Codecademy
would argue with that statement but if
you want to be working through our manga
new MongoDB class and get class through
through med school they can still be
completed in the browser but you'll have
to use cloud nine if you want to do
those things sooner rather than later go
ahead and jump on the beta we do want a
lot of people on the beta just because
it'll help us more quickly identify
issues I would say that it's just a
personal decision please note that if
there if you use the beta there are
going to be a lot more issues that will
be need to need to be fixed but you'll
be helping us a lot but in your own
selfish interest you may prefer to stay
on the old site which is stable and will
continue to progress you rapidly a lot
of the main stuff like the bonfire zip
line into BASE jumps haven't
substantially changed so jazz Jed 90 yes
we did cover the new nonprofit projects
on the stream already when we end this
stream we will upload it to youtube and
you'll be able to fast forward and and
look at all the new projects
alternatively you can just go to beta
dot free code camp calm / nonprofit /
directory and you can look through them
yourself also Quincy I saw question
earlier from st. Peter who if you're the
same see page st. Peter from the chat
room you were going crazy last night
helping everyone that was amazing
anyways he asked about the front-end
development certificate I think you had
mentioned that a previous email
absolutely um that will be retro
actively available to everybody who's
completed the first zip lines and the
basic waypoints so basically the front
are like up until the end of the way
points on our beta curriculum that's
what you need to complete in order to
get that front end development
certificate for those of you who have
already completed most of the waypoints
and that stuff I mean that you're
looking at maybe like an extra hour to a
time commitment if you've already
completed the zip lines and that will be
retro actively available as soon as
possible that is a priority for
skipping infrastructure one of the
things is we're probably going to need
to implement some sort of peer review
system because for me to actually
personally look at every single zip line
which I've been doing everybody who
tweets out a zip line like if if you see
people on Twitter like oh great job on
this fix this and this that's me I'm
actually doing all the social media for
free coke camp it takes about six hours
a day maybe which is one of the reasons
it's taking us so long to get the the
features out but it's really helped me
understand what needs to be done and
it's helped me kind of stay in touch
with our campers and understand what
their issues are so we can best help
them so if it's at some point we're
going to have such a huge volume of
people completing zip lines that I
simply will not be able to review
everything and it would be great if we
could create some sort of pure system so
right now we have zip line help which is
our new chat room and we may actually
pipe it in there and you may get
feedback from people in that room from
the people that happen to be in that
room and of course will still be giving
brownie points through our new thanks
mechanism so you'll be able to get
points for helping people and you'll get
the credit that you frankly deserve
because you know Saint Peter he's like
definitely a helper I mean it's
phenomenal to see people just helping
others so much i wish i had more time to
hang out in the help room myself
sometimes people message me with
questions and i'll try my best to answer
that if i have time but please just
understand that i'm spending six to
eight hours a day on communication it's
like email get er and facebook and
twitter so please don't take offense if
it takes me more than 24 hours to get
back you i try to get back to everybody
within 24 hours so quincy we're
approaching the 90 minute mark and I
think we should wind down and and I just
wanted to thank everyone does anybody
else have anything they want to say
before we kind of draw a line in the
sand and switch into code mode in the
coding live stream yes if I could
reiterate google and facebook login do
not work on the beta site your progress
on the beta site is not synced with the
main site
not all the accounts on the main site
are on the beta site so please don't get
worried if your counts are not on the
beta and when we do eventually
transition from our old version to our
new site your status will be preserved
so nothing should be lost just to
reiterate those points because the
people are still asking those questions
in the stream now if someone is asking
those questions in the strange and you
guys please answer Facebook and Google
off for still not working twitter and
github aren't working though we might
want to put those notes right on the
login page of the beta site if we can
Berkeley just like grey out the ones
that don't work so people don't try them
and and will well definitely I mean we
literally were working on the beta site
up until this call like if i seemed like
scramble to the last minute it's because
i was literally sending out the emails
to notify people who were going on up
until like two or three minutes before
the stream started so so thank you
everyone for joining us will go and wrap
up this but please do not leave all of
you who are viewing i'm going to stick
around i'm going to answer a whole lot
of questions we're going to rock out to
our turn to our plug DJ radio station i
hope you'll join and throw some awesome
tunes on as well we'd love to hear what
music you like and we will continue to
stream for probably another two or three
hours so please i'm gonna pop i'm going
to go to a quick commercial break and
stop the screen and then I'll relaunch
so we can actually export that to
youtube so everybody who missed anything
will be able to view it on our YouTube
page if you haven't already followed us
on Twitch please do so while I'm at it
if you haven't followed us on if you
haven't followed me on Korra I answer a
ton of questions core is my favorite
social network and the link for you to
do that is i'll just post some links
right here in the chat
I'm just gonna post them oh yeah here if
you would follow us there twitter is
twitter.com / free code camp the DJ plug
DJ okay somebody's already answered that
feel free to like us on Facebook and and
we're on most social media networks
subscribe to us on YouTube YouTube is
just youtube.com slash free code camp
again we don't advertise we don't do any
PR basically all we do is try to have a
good presence and be helpful to people
that approaches some of these different
channels these different social networks
so um click the follow button and
basically you'll get a notification
every time we start a stream we also
have live coding TV coding TV / free
code camp if you want to follow us there
as well again our entire goal and all
this following and stuff is just because
we want to make it easier for you to
realize that we're doing stuff because
everybody's all these different channels
alright so what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to go ahead and take down the
string for about 30 seconds and then I'm
going to relaunch and we're going to get
some tunes flown and i'm going to start
attacking the github issues and you can
watch me do that live and anybody on the
stream who's interested in joining feel
free to jump on Berkeley David Matt
Michael thank you all of you for coming
this has been a wonderful livestream and
I'm really looking forward to sharing
this on youtube and tweeting it out so
other people can watch and see all the
amazing things we're doing just to recap
all the new innovations real quick
because they're a lot in the last month
we have a ton of new challenges jquery
and javascript we have a ton of new full
stack challenges that we've added and
refined our existing kind of full stack
challenges we have our new wiki which is
i'm extremely excited about we have a
ton of new chat rooms we just want if
you familiar with the concept of a
he drove versus the bizarre please read
that essay it's incredible it's about
open source and we are very much in the
bizarre camp we want to have a federated
collection of chat rooms free code camp
is not any one site or any one place
it's everywhere and we also have our new
live stream on black coating that TV we
have our new station on plug DJ we have
probably the most exciting thing of all
our new free coke am but and then
probably most importantly for many of
you we have a ton of new nonprofit
projects coming online soon thank you
very much Michael for lining all those
up and we're going to have a ton more
there will be less and less delay
between the start of these nonprofit
projects our first 13 projects were
literally just pilot I mean it was
literally to prove that we could do it
because so many people were skeptical I
remember talking to so many
organizations who just doubted that we
could actually get this to work like a
bunch of volunteers building things for
nonprofits we learned a ton during that
process and we're going to apply that
knowledge to feature nonprofit projects
so thank you everyone thanks everyone
happy coding all right we'll be back in
