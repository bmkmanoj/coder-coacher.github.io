personal portfolio page let's go ahead
and see what one of our campers
portfolio pages looks like Tiago
Ferreira is a developer from Finland and
he made this nice portfolio page as you
can see is just a single page that you
can scroll through a very common style
of portfolio page a single scrolling
page you'll also see that at the top he
has a navigation bar and when we click
on different buttons
it automatically Scrolls us to those
points within his portfolio page finally
you'll see that he has these buttons and
when you press one it'll open up the
Twitter page for Chow go or save the
free code camp page and you can see he's
quite active so let's talk a little bit
about the rules for the zipline the
rules are the same as they always are
rule number one don't look at the
example projects code on code pen figure
it out for yourself rule number two you
may use whichever libraries or api's you
need for this you probably won't need
any API s and the only library you'll
probably need is bootstrap which Thiago
used here rule number three reverse
engineer the example projects
functionality and also feel free to
personalize it so please do not feel
obligated to use the same background
images the Thiago used here you can
really use any images or even static
colors if you'd like or textures so
let's talk about the agile user stories
that you're going to implement as part
of the zipline first as a user I can
access all of the portfolios
content just by scrolling second as a
user I can click different buttons and
they will take me to the portfolio
creators different social media pages
which we already demonstrated up here
third I can see thumbnail images of
different projects the portfolio creator
has built and again if you don't have
any of these you can just put
placeholder images and you can come back
and add them later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
