we're going to like the announcement i
just made we're just going to focus on
on building a hugo site so Hugo is a
static site generator and its built-in
go and so we'll get started with that
shortly but do you want do you wanna go
by zur see acts on here since that's how
everyone knows you were yeah there's a
sign okay so so with the zoo CX here
we're going to go over what kind of you
know is spurring this desire to update
his blog and website anyway is the blog
post he did on FCC so I think people
would be very interested in hearing
hearing more about that so I guess maybe
uh what it do you want to just kind of
go through that that blog post in a you
know how it is for you or if nothing
else just show us a little bit about
what it's like to how you go about
building something like this like like
going to learn to like how does your
development process work if government
process it really depends on the project
that I'm working on I mean I often do
the research check out code samples
before I actually start which is I think
something a lot of people would do but
it really all depends on how deep regret
ever the project is organized and what
it is I need to do for example if this
is an MVC project all of your controller
and it just changed something in a
presentation layer that's that's a very
good help for me to not have to wait for
the entire code base just see what I can
dig up on there so what I'm going to do
here is get that blog in front of me so
I can actually see what i wrote down
wait let me actually I'll remove my
headphones so you guys can hear what I
hear and go mad about the extreme speed
that you guys won't be able to follow I
think but that doesn't matter as long as
I can follow it that's good enough yeah
exactly all right that should do it is
that clear enough I guess it is yeah i
mean i can i can hear it it's a little
hard to comprehend but yeah I can
definitely hear it I'd be worried if you
could hump comprehend then I'm gonna
turn you up a little because I
you can't hear you over there screen
uterus reading out the controls through
them it's me that's sufficient so I can
actually get any work done without a
timeout every five so mr. Brendan a
little time I speak all right can you
hear that letter so this is what I tend
to do I work a lot without keys I learn
a loser and NVDA find the NVA's the
screen reader that I wish using that I
link to indy blog post clap again
quickly bring it up there we go is that
the I don't know which say the most
popular one it's the open source and
free where ones so a lot of people who
are sick of the commercial screen
readers try this and it's actually very
feature complete it's actually very very
good what it does for for just being an
open source project I'm not saying open
source is any in any way back but the
people don't have the funding that
commercials free leaders tend to have
and when we compare it converge screener
can cost upwards from eight hundred
dollars or more ok and a Braille display
device that is also use I don't have it
connected right now but I tend to use it
when I have to do some micromanaging
into code checking braces looking for
typos that kind of thing those cost
upwards from 4,000 bucks well because
those things as far as I understand
those are actually just morphing into
the different shapes of the Braille that
are needed at the time period like they
basically what they basically do is they
have so-called cells with with a little
holes in them and beneath these holes
are little pins that come up whenever
new new letters are sent to the to the
device using a USB connection most of
the time it's telling the cells what
pins to move up and what pins to move
down and that way it's a refreshable
line that just changes when it comes and
on the line changes okay so it's it is
it actually pretty uh
pretty fast like it's yeah it's pretty
response if it goes pretty quickly and
you have all sorts of ways to customize
that you can change like how how it sits
like pin hardness how hard the pins are
actually coming out of this device so
how how hard you have to press the push
them back down sometimes people like
them a little bit less pronounced so
it's more like reading on paper and
sometimes people like them extra
pronounced so they can read faster I'm
one of the second group you like to
listen faster and read faster everything
so yeah so and there's also come Akuma
commands and control buttons on it so
you can scroll through the text and even
type in Braille if you really want to
usually typing on a keyboard faster yeah
right imagines I wouldn't how do you
even type in Braille I guess that's is
that on that actual keypad uh brillz
burl cells contain six usually six in
computer real it's 82 note things like
where the cursor is and stuff like that
but usually it's like eight dots and
there's eight keys it corresponding keys
that you press in success in
combinations actually to produce the
Braille letters okay we're like a
typewriter but with only eight keys so
just back to the mvd a screen reader
that you use for anyone that you know
wanted to download that they could
definitely do that because it's open
source for people that are on a Mac if
they're running OS 10 they can just use
the voiceover screen reader virtual
maybe like give it a taste to kind of
see what it's like but do you think that
that's accurate enough for someone that
you know isn't looking doesn't need to
use a screen reader but they're just
trying to get an idea of it because I
know we've talked a little bit about how
the voice-over is not quite up to par is
that what you say it's over voiceover is
good four in number of things voiceover
is good if you don't need too much
granular control of your content reading
so you if you would just want to get a
like a big overview of your application
see if your controls read properly
voiceovers fine if you
more granular testing you'll need to
learn some more voiceover hot case to do
that you'll need to learn how to
interact with stuff and how to move work
our wording shut up word by word and
character by character and once you get
that done you can use that to test your
your stuff on Windows it's a little
easier because moving word by word and
character by character just uses normal
system navigation commands so just the
arrow keys or control arrows to use word
windward so it's a little it's a little
bit less of a learning curve there is a
voiceover tutorial though that that can
be triggered with a hotkey that teaches
you these essential commands so in both
cases you can use a screen or two to get
an get an idea of how your application
or your website reads it's over by the
way can be toggled easily with the
command of five hockey yeah and I've
tried that and but I do experience what
you've talked about like I'll have to
actually I haven't actually gone through
that tutorial that it provides but it is
one of those things where the the key
commands don't come naturally so it's
definitely a learning curve for that
it's kind of nice to hear that the NVDA
tis just a little bit more intuitive
most most like the the the the first
line of navigation in NVDA is just a
system carrot which you influence with
normal ketones tab shift to have your
arrow keys stop using microsoft word
basically and then there's your second
line of navigation called object
navigation which is basically what
voiceover does it takes you from objects
to objects in the hierarchy hierarchical
tree that is generated in every window
so that's how you move from button to
button from area to area that that's how
boys over basically works but that's the
only way voiceover knows how to do
things for NVIDIA has a few modes of
interaction and you will well okay so
when you're screening hero what we were
using right now to to broadcast and to
actually share the screen that I'm using
is I need to do quite some kung-fu to
get the the actual call to connect
because I have to actually simulate
mouse clicks on the controls to actually
get them to take other because these
guys didn't do their accessibility
homework and it's a lot of
messy and very baggage heavy stuff that
I don't need to actually use the
application because there's a lot of
stuff that doesn't work properly and we
had to teamviewer link up so Brendan
could click my share my screen button so
he can see what I'm doing I couldn't
reach the button myself so there is a
glaring accessibility issue right there
yeah we're as a team viewer which is
another thing that free code camp does
recommend as an alternative the the
screen hero works a little bit better in
my opinion but then yeah it's definitely
fall short in this so it was kind of
crazy to have both screen hero and
teamviewer going at the same time just
to get this to to actually work like
your screen with mutton yeah so I like
about what I like about teamviewer apart
from that it's yet that when i'm looking
into a remote computer and that's
something fairly recent teamviewer now
has the ability to transfer audio from
the remote machine to the local machine
so if I if I instruct someone who needs
my tech support to install NVDA which is
a free download and start it I can work
on that computer whereas normal
conventional screen readers would need
some pretty heavy lifting to get that
kind of functionality going properly
because well of course you can be
expected to have a screen reader on the
client computer if it costs upwards from
eight hundred dollars so NVDA is a very
nice alternative there yeah definitely
so I just actually thought of a maybe a
good way that we could I know we can
kind of still go through some of the
stuff with this blog but maybe jumping
in a little bit to looking at the
different themes that you've looked at
for the Hugo blog you're creating and
those two different themes like one of
them that was accessible and the other
one that wasn't maybe even just vision
like for people to visually be able to
see and hear what's going on when you
can't access something when a website
has an element which for that example is
very important it's that the navigation
yes you can find that life side other
otherwise i can I can bring it up on
your on your screen if you want to why
is that even there um I can probably get
there
hey don't move my orders my mouth I'm
turning my myself right now yeah I don't
like it when my mouse is on because I
keep hitting it with my sleeve and it
goes all over yes people I do not use a
mouse butter suitable I try to use one
as infrequently as possible as well
that's very good I thought I lost you
for a second that's the google in dutch
sorry people let's see um man man i
think it was light demo visited link no
i cannot open anyway do you know the URL
by held by Ark enough my heart but uh
let's see uh so if you the way we could
it's if you go search via sense it's
ported from a Jekyll theme so Jekyll
Lanyon if you just if you search for
that let's see how can I help JK like
ll14 bar then you want to do you mean
let's see what it does oh there we go
there we go here this is here we go come
on I see this oh let me turn that down
maybe thats actually been officially
here what I'm hearing right now so I'm
turning down to speed very low I see you
guys can okay that should be enough
perfect level 3 visited Winkle Avenue
they check your thing heading level 1
link introducing Lanyon that's the first
two elements if you will that I can see
there it is let a heading level 3 that
says heading level 3 and visited link
laughing a very exact okay linnean a
Jekyll theme and I think that's a logo
of some kind and then there is a heading
level 1 and level while introducing
Lanyon that says introducing Lanyon i do
not see the navigation button to expand
the navigation bar that I have heard
should be there somewhere at the top
that I cannot see my car or so it off
why shut up i see that i do not see that
button anywhere so that's sort of
interesting if you would move your mouse
to it i would be well do you mind if I
um like I think you have a history link
bar up in the corner are you on the edge
in that article
there you go okay so that now we have
got the full screen so so the nav button
is right here so it just opened up can
you access it once it's open and then
level copy or navigate visited link it
up project positive yes I can see it now
when download link about visited link Oh
Todd a reserve visited link Jekyll theme
that places the utmost gravity on
content with a hidden drawer made by
lincoln go it's literally a hidden
drawer for you yes hidden right Rosie
dog and if I click this button does it
ever go away oh no again I I cannot
collapse this nor expand it so if it's
not there if I this would if this were
happening on a real website I would
assume there was no menu and so you
would only have this one page yep I
would think oh there is nothing else
here I I do not need to click any
further because there is no further to
click and so what this would be what may
scare of blind people from your website
oh and I can totally understand that I
mean how often is it that you're
actually that that is the case that you
cannot access access something um it
happens mainly on on very dynamic pages
that for example the Gator chat room
that we use there is apparently a for me
mythical Scott settings I can that you
can click to to bring up notification
studies and stuff I haven't been able to
find it yet and I've been there for a
month now so well you're not missing out
on too much the notifications I find
because I even use the the OS 10 app
standalone airport and I I try and
setting out of notification specific and
it still pops up random notification so
you're not missing out on much there but
yeah I have the I download that the iOS
app for dinner and that works reasonably
all right but the notification seem sort
of all over the place it just notifies
you randomly sometimes on the channel
when you're not even being mentioned and
I'm like okay what is this supposed to
do yes yeah i mean it's it's it's a it's
a great service but yeah there are some
things like that so okay with something
like the this nav bar I don't know are
you familiar with the terminology that
the hamburger button for navigation like
hidden navigation seem to term I
wouldn't think that it would be exactly
able to replicate the image and say
this is called the hamburger I can
because of this and that but yeah I am
aware of that cologne H and I know it's
used any chrome browser for example yeah
it's kind of a you know a weird
terminology but it's just three bars if
you can imagine that just right topped
like on top of each other and so that's
why I guess it's like a hamburger
because it kind of looks like two pieces
of bun with a hill bombings in a piece
of meat ok I mean very very minimalist
abstract version of that but that's
that's what's become a lot more popular
but so with this one this hamburger
button that what that hides or shows the
navigation is just completely hidden
that's the thing what could they do you
be a pink monkey for all I care as long
as it's labeled proper and so what is it
something simple is it a simple fix like
what I don't know it it looked at this
code and let me bring up the source rock
mad bang bang please and they buy lunch
for 954 bab questioning all site barb 55
or questioning whole site arbab i go
back to ripley in holes wing slash home
slash ax so I see the navigation in the
HTML as it is quick with a friend
quipped a new / do when cook those who
have to talk / but I don't lecture Lisi
oh right that's because wait no we have
to we have to do this differently
because right now I'm seeing it because
you expanded it okay if I think if i
refresh this page heading level 3 and
when you know it's gone so let me bring
up the sauce again I'm gonna give me the
navigation app with quilting whore bath
and when requesting whole site far i
become active ripping holes with / homes
56 57 58 59 blank lines in your code
really engage 666 63 of clothes that I
Park i buy replica link / about so okay
so I see the code like if I were to open
this page in my source editor I would
see these links but I don't see why that
button is not showing I think they're
doing some sort of CSS monkey into I
don't know maybe generate that button
without it actually being there in the
actual HTML source which is confusing
discriminator I don't know what they're
doing here but sitters it's just there's
not there according to the HTML source
so there
not like us just always a simple like
quick fix like tag it with say an REO
tag or in some key limiters an alt tag
if this isn't this is an element I need
to know how they are doing this if this
is like a JavaScript generated button
and yes you can just add a label to it
or an arean label or some other way of
activating it but i'm not sure where
this button is even coming from in the
code I don't see it here but me so I
don't know what they messed up on and
why is this isn't showing this this
button I don't know anybody my bunny oh
there's no buttons in here well is that
is that I guess maybe that's a that's a
clear question if people just use the
button tag for things that are obviously
a button does that mean it's going to be
automatically accessible yes that's that
would just mean it renders as a button
with the label that you put on the
button so in using your semantic HTML
tag section article button are very
important that way had it for as well
yeah so I'm looking at it too and it
does not look like side they're calling
it they have it labeled as sidebar
checkbox but they're just using saw that
yeah i mentioned i saw that check box
but i don't actually see it in a code
for some reason and I think that's
because it's not an actual input control
well I wonder if the label since it's
not in a form if you don't have a few
have a check box with that's not in the
form would that mean it's not accessible
maybe maybe if they put a forward proper
form declaration relative might be
accessible not sure why this isn't
reading I've never seen this before so
it's it's a little odd and I filed an
issue about this but I haven't had any
response to that yet so we'll have to
wait until they to put it bluntly get
off their ass and fix it so and so this
one might be like a just a simple honest
mistake it seem like you're able to get
through this page otherwise you know
what are some what are some do you have
any things or examples maybe of sites
that don't do it do certain things well
like simple things that people can be
doing like using buttons for LOL some
different thankfully this would be a
good segue to i'm moving to our main
source of Elemental I'll go to my own
website oh there you go and it level one
with introducing math and I loaded with
area like yeah what I do how I all see
this is fine I mean well Dutch sorry
about that but I all around this page
here it's all did a little blob here a
little close that content forum that is
supposed to be here kind of pain can
find it no no previous appointment with
Miss visited stop there's all sorts of
fleshy animation stuff going on here and
all sorts of it will call me Papa son
wika hall heading level what Bob it is
Blancas Helen block awesome and this
this contact form was only visible like
half a second ago when I arrow over it
accidentally it suddenly is there but
when that page first loaded it's not so
then this is less this is your current
wordpress site that you have this is my
current wordpress site which will say we
nuked in a few hours most likely so wait
wilds lasts there you go yeah and um so
I'm also noticing it seems that with
what you're following on the screen does
not always necessarily a scroll I guess
it doesn't need to but it's interesting
to see because I know like on voiceover
it will like when I'm tabbing through
things are going through a page with
voiceover on the back it will actually
go with the screen so visually ICS
anyway scroll a divisible content on
screen because it what it basically does
is but it builds a virtual buffer of the
entire webpage and renders that to a
pretty much almost document like word
microsoft word document like structure
so a lot of CSS is actually not being
taken into account here the positioning
of the elements is not being taken care
of there because it's all running from
top to bottom according to the HTML
order so um so that were things like
like one that's actually a very big
challenge for me since I'm when I'm
designing a CSS layout I'm literally
working from dill I've never seen a CSS
layout before so I'm just guessing on
what people are expecting and and how
how is that working for you so like you
you you don't know what it is that
you're
to see how do you create a mental model
that are you building anything that's
that's working inside of your mind to
translate what people have said it is
that you're supposed that a sighted
person is seeing verse like what you're
coding do you have a not a visual but
like do you have a mental I think I
mentioned the chessboard example in my
blog where I don't call matter lab by
Sage station I bring my hood sirico
padlock of a novel Conan yeah I don't
know that's fine please shut up thank
you yeah there's this thing where I say
that I wash where I imagine it's being
sort of a chess board or a or a game
board of tiles and elements take up one
or more tiles on this grid so to speak
that's how I sort of imagine my my my
CSS layout like a header has a full row
of tiles then there's this nav bar on
the left that has two rows of tiles and
then there's the content which has the
remaining six if we're going but a chest
for example we could also do like a 312
39 thing with bootstrap likes to use but
that's basically how I try to envision
things but that analogy breaks when you
bring things like floats and clears into
into it because that doesn't make any
sense anymore in that analogy so that
are those are things that I'm having
trouble with and as well as the z-index
is something i can only conceptually
imagine being some sort of layering
technique with opacity so you can still
see the bottom layers so those are
things that I just have no practical
experience with it's stuff that i can
only conceptualize but not physically
model a' so to speak yeah I wonder if
like I you don't like some tactile
feedback kind of like Braille can
provide like I just think building
blocks I think I mentioned this to you
before to like if there is just some
some way that like someone could could
be there moving some blocks in different
ways or maybe different shapes would be
even more helpful like
balls and different things if it and if
you could like run your hands over them
do you think that that like does that
translate for you like you you would
have some kind of different kind of
mental model if you were to kind of feel
in essence what it is that it looks like
it might you'd have to do some pretty
interesting things with blocks and
showing me the effect a certain bit of
CSS would have on the overall structure
maybe annually clay hmm maybe clay maybe
someone could like mole like you could
have a sculptor right next to you
sculpting with just just a little bit of
raised like kind of like Braille just a
little raised in you know maybe
including the z-index so that some
things are up farther than others and
you just get video tonight yeah and for
example also the you'd have to somehow
define the borders of the page so you
def need some sort of bored or early oh
my gosh I'm muting you haha um you need
to somehow border like an area that is
the page you can just go off screen so
you need to see how the different shapes
interoperate with each other and how
they work together within the set
borders of the page so to speak ok so
then have you done the dash challenge of
the robot the CSS robot I haven't done
the CSS robot yet and because the slides
haven't been transcribed yet um one of
our fellow freak out Gambhir's is busily
working on that right now ok I'll be
other interested to see how that one
person I want to use that one for last
actually to cement most of the CSS
things that I know because they are
based on a shape that I'm sort of
familiar with namely well vaguely
humanoid shape I mean I've been a kid
I've played with toy robots I know what
they're look like sort of so that that
helps in may be mentally visualizing
exactly what it is I'm doing oh ok so
for me like initially I think it's like
oh the CSS robot seems like it would be
you know a lot more intense a lot more
difficult to create a mental model for
but in in some ways it's like well
that's very much so you're just building
with CSS shapes and and like you said
you can kind of imagine what that reason
that is is that he'll like a humanoid
shapes I know what they look like and I
know how they are often portrayed
so that actually helps I've had a
tactile model of this so i know what
it's sort of supposed to look like yeah
totally mixes and the research has found
that tactile understanding does not
match visual understanding it's all
people who have not seen for their
entire life and start seeing have a lot
of trouble with a sort of making those
visuals they see and what they've always
known to agree with each other properly
so that's the thing I know I'm probably
completely miss visualizing everything
but I'm visualizing in a way that makes
sense for me so that's in in fact that's
not a bad thing it's just two different
languages visual languages that are
being spoken that have to somehow
interoperate which I'm in the process of
learning and mastering at FCC actually
yeah so once you build that that
translation model that works then it
doesn't matter if what your model is is
different than the model of someone
that's seeing it visually it's still
gonna it's still going to translate so
do you want to jump into a little bit
more of like getting into the
development of getting this going yeah
or did you have another idea no that's
that's good i'm online i forgiven do
that I'm gonna book my headphones on
again so I can focus a little better on
what I'm doing because I think you guys
have heard enough of my speech since I
so clever now so we're papazilla Firefox
yeah and your face ok let me turn to
write back up to the volume down alright
that's better so what don't need this
anymore and I don't need anymore and
that's geeky enough to stay so that's
fine alright so let me bring up the
stuff that I've been doing I have like
the model that the first scaffolding for
the Hugo thing is here and I content
that I to looks like this ok have you
tried loading it with a hugo server
yeah let me find my little and I guess
for anyone that is interested while
you're getting that going Hugo is just a
it's a static site generator it is
written in go so it's very fast and
that's the benefit of this I've used
Jekyll for a couple years switching over
a site to metal Smith and then I'm also
planning to switch 1 over 2 to Hugo now
and so this is like extra motivation to
Hugo does things slightly different so
to get over that hump of learning the
differences here but if you're if
anyone's interested that is following
along go Hugo io is where you can find
it and if you're on a Mac you can just
do home brew install or brew install
Hugo if you have homebrew and it's the
easiest way to get it going and then
there's no dependencies know anything it
just does everything for you right there
in the command line I think I broke it
well it is there ok so it's yeah what I
what I used to have here was um the blog
post would come first and then after
that it would show the page and then I
started messing about with partials and
moving them about and now it shows this
ok what are your what is your partial
director you look like or you're late I
guess the layouts directory sorry ok so
this is it this is what you have so
pretty much anything they have in the
way that I don't know if you fully got
that figured out but I've been looking
more into the documentation with the the
layouts are it's pretty much the scope
of it so layouts is the first place that
Hugo is going to look and anything
that's in layouts that replicates what's
in the fate yeah and the theme it's
going to just it's going to use that
it's going to crawl out all the way to
the theme folder and then ultimately the
default template but before that so your
index is replacing the index from hide
the hide theme you're using yeah but
what is my
x currently let me check the HTML
because we have the head we have this
content container that I all right I
didn't actually put anything here yet so
that's why it's not showing anything so
how would i I've set this to page i'm
not sure if I'm supposed to do that but
how do I tell it to load this so you
want it to load that if that is going to
be well okay so if you open up that file
that markdown file the home MD hey and
we're back all right you likely lost my
screen though no I still have your
screen here as well so you got
everything working that's awesome
isiliye just were completely killed
screening hero and we started it and
then just does that it's happened
yesterday as well what happens again we
can just switch to teamviewer that's
fine okay let's play at the set up skype
and stuff it's fine I guess oh ok so
right over what we were saying oh yeah
right I was I um I did this here if it
equals page because I was going by the
wordpress analogy post equals posts and
paid you just page I'm sure even if I'm
supposed to do that because what i want
to do was blowed this home view that i
have here yeah that's the last i heard
was the home view I've so what's in that
home view and not much just a minute XO
you that there okay so this is where you
set the this is this is where we get
into like however you set up the
directory is how it's going to hugo is
going to use it and build the site from
and okay so what we have here is in the
in the topple front matter so all that
stuff between the plus we need to know
what the I need to figure out what the
actual syntax is but we need to put the
template that we want to use for that
let me just see if I can figure that out
because pretty much Alisa we also keep
an eye on the twitch Jeff maybe people
are asking quest
as I can see it um yeah let me let me
actually see if I can bring that up I've
been keeping an eye on the in the free
code camp talk but i think i got tweeted
out again so I should probably get into
that chat room noticed yeah i would have
to get a different browser open because
i have flash turned off in general and
it doesn't like that on twitch ok let me
just check something yes people that's a
talking folder so that's so that's your
phone and good yeah that's my iphone
just talking with people here this is
really exploding on Twitter guys how
many code nonprofit is mentioning those
injured between us okay well I wonder
then um I wonder is is it possible that
you can I know it's a little harder free
to concentrate but is it possible for
people to still be able to hear your
screen reader at your regular speed just
because yeah sure just as you do it just
because not at slow speed but just
because like talking to you and watching
you like on the screen it's just like
you're just going through this text file
it doesn't you know not being able to
hear it I can't even tell that you're
not just seeing it but you're just all
right so okay i'll turn it it just music
I think it's like because it's even hard
for me to remember that you're not
actually seeing it yeah that was a date
for you okay so when it's that fast do
you pick up the date to that quickly
like that like does that that I'll
register because I usually look at the
the long string dates and it just I
don't even really pay too much attention
to it unless I actually have to yeah if
I really don't think it's just like the
2015 02 02 and then- time yeah maybe
sure when I exited the thing or 19 or so
then why don't know what they think what
21 oh yeah yo what yo game yo so that's
it don't know what well it's actually
hello later like mon 15 almost but yeah
but why is that you know alright this
one okay cool yeah well that would be a
date and I can go by character
go by word help so I was just with
control left I can go there under
control right legally I ways oh that's
funny like character by character at
that point that's my word actually well
my word it's it's not a word here
because it's like punctuation but if I
will go to go down here to the context
okay I could do okay so well now that
we're focused on that again pretty much
we need to put in the the default
template to use which is going to go to
default in general but the thing that is
I think getting mixed up here is that we
have a home MD file and a index.html
file so what right you can do is call
the home MD file from the index file and
that's going to be one way to link it up
not that I'm a pro it to go by any means
so I'm still trying to get this twitch
stuff set up to so but so pretty much
what we need to do is you can either
keep that if if your home MD you can put
that in a markdown file if you wanted to
easily be editable like that or if you
want to you can just make it that index
file because it's if you don't you can
still pull in I mean it's a static site
but you can still pull in dynamic data
from different partials if you want on
the index.html file but since you aren't
necessarily going to be pulling that
much from different partials or whatnot
for the index page you can just write
the index page as an HTML page if you
want does that make sense studies like
it just like you currently live that I
labeled page I can use to enter some
HTML gumbo well if i go to read if you
go to the index.html there we go so here
you could just put all of your content
within that that div or you have the ID
page you can just put all of your all
your content there because so right now
you have so right now you're missing the
sidebar as well so we'll want to it
essentially work because I see there's a
side bar dot HTML partial and that's
what some some point it gave me an error
about that not because it was sort of
defining there but it didn't work for
some reason but now it did work so I'm
not sure what happened there but there
is a cyber partial that's not being
included we have the header one here and
there's the content container and here's
down here is the footer so i guess i
would include this side are here yep i
think it's i think it goes up at the top
with let me go and see what the default
one is because you're using a hide x
correct hmm you're using my next pyrex
okay extend it expanded theme for my or
whatever yeah so they put the partial
sidebar HTML right under the body under
your body okay so like the way that they
have the the default setup is partial
head HTML or which you have right up
there and then okay so you were also
lining it up a little differently you're
going template partials head did you
enter that or is that how it used to say
theme partials but since I moved stuff
around maybe be good if we just start
from scratch yeah I think yeah that
might that might make it a little easier
these are making a change we're shooting
blind here leather literally I'm gonna
do is just nuke this entire directory
there we don't forget about that one
where is it being used and oh right of
course the server is running to kill it
and quite quick you and now I can delete
that point my point
alright looks like we disconnected again
real quick we'll get that set up again
in just a moment
yeah I got you oh right yep so if you
want to share the connection so we can
get into teamviewer just do that through
text that's not on the screen just so we
don't have everyone watching live you
send it a little tricky is here that the
screen reader will echo to your computer
most likely but we'll see uh easiest way
would be you sharing to me and
teamviewer so let me set that up real
quick and let it ready for ID is it did
you change it now okay then it could not
be is oh okay so can you put in the in
the text field for on oh I get I see
what you mean well here let me just uh
I'll stop streaming for just a second
just so we can get this set up and then
we'll be right back just tonight we
don't have anyone okay so okay I'm not
streaming right now two or three six
seven eight for that's the Eid wait the
essay the idea good 2 or 3 6 7 8 4 to 3
30 25 to 3 6 7 8 42 sorry 0 to 50 25
okay and then the authentication 3 94 93
94 on ok ok I'll start the streaming
again even though right now we're just
going to be audio until I get the twitch
stream set up to this window ok is it's
my screen reader talking to your
computer to me um I I don't think so ok
let me fix that well no I mean I see I
see your screen now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
