where they can sign up we want to help
nonprofit projects I just want to point
out though that free code camp is first
and foremost for campers not for
nonprofits nonprofits are a means to an
end they are a way for our campers to
get real life hands-on expectable
experience working with either legacy
code or building something from scratch
and doing it in an agile environment and
basically getting the full kind of
sprint by sprint workflow down and it's
two campers working together it's a
agile project manager it's a stakeholder
from a non-profit who deeply understands
the problem that our campers are trying
to solve it's basically the equivalent
of like you know a contract job that you
would get on up work or a project that
you would do working at you know like a
big development consultancy essentially
you're going to have this project and
you're going to do it so it's extremely
good practical experience for our
campers that's why we do it we do want
to help nonprofits but are our primary
customer if you will for the nonprofit
projects is not the nonprofit's it's
it's the campers and we'll look out for
the campers best interest in that and
and for that reason we're extremely
selective about whom we help we're not
going to and we're not going to solve
every single nonprofits problem but we
will be able to solve a lot of problems
for a lot of good proven nonprofits who
know exactly what they want and know
exactly what their end users need so
please do tell them about this if they
just go to free code camp calm /
nonprofits or if there's a prominent
button from free cocaine column if
you're not authenticated let me show you
it's right here my nonprofit needs to
coding help and that will take them here
and then they can just it takes like two
seconds to fill out this google form and
then their don't get a response from us
within a few days and again we're really
selective about that so don't worry all
the nonprofit's you're going to work
with they're going to be very well
vetted
and it's not going to be a waste of your
time we're going to do everything we can
to make sure that's the case real quick
J comic right Cronkite said that he sees
a lot of other related but unaffiliated
groups that would benefit from knowing
about free coke camp please tell tell
your local coderdojo group tell your
local hackerspace all these different
organizations we want to provide a cool
curriculum and a supportive online
community to supplement their activities
free coke camp is all about helping
people and just increasing the volume of
people out there that are coding well
and and understand best practices and
feel confident in their coding ability
because we've got this massive skill gap
this massive shortfall of people that
actually are good at coding that is
basically holding back government in
many countries I mean you look at like
the whole healthcare.gov debacle I mean
that's basically just bad software
engineering practices because there
aren't enough good software engineers
and they're not running the place like
they should be so so we just want to
increase the total aggregate software
engineering talent in the world that's
our goal so we are happy to work with
anybody who's also aligned in that
direction and it doesn't matter if they
make money they whatever they do we
don't really care we just want to help
um let's see any other questions they
jumped out at you all teaching to fish
interesting wildlife you know I think
we've got all the fake ones and I
someone asked another one quick and
popping at the end I think we've caught
everything pretty much I think we've got
everything so um very quickly the BST
apparently is
gmt +1 so if you have British Standard
Time that's essentially one hour faster
than gmt for those who are curious I
learned something there alright well I
think we've talked about a whole lot of
different things today just to
recapitulate what we discussed we talked
about our simplified portfolio pages
talked about our code storage
functionality a lot of these things are
still being improved actively camper
news Creative Commons licenses please go
hog-wild with our logo feel free to mash
it up with whatever cartoon characters
or memes Luke detection works thank you
very much for fixing that Berkeley and
Ben and bonfire hints are coming soon
please contribute to our wiki please
submit pull requests and of course
please tell everyone you know that you
think would benefit from knowing about
free code camp because it's just the
saddest thing in the world when people
are like oh why haven't I heard about
this like I've been trying to learn on
my own for like the last year or two or
I guess if it was more than 10 months
then they wouldn't have heard about its
anyway because we're only 10 months old
but just tell people about us and send
them our way and we will do everything
we can to make sure they do not have a
negative experience and that they do not
regret you telling them about this if
anything they'll probably be like wow
you just saved me a ton of time and
energy so thank you very much everyone
for tuning in to this to this live
stream and we will be streaming a lot
more in the coming weeks also just a
quick note you probably already read the
blog post if you didn't i'll just post
it in here we just really wanted to come
out and thank everyone for bearing with
us last week with the slowness of the
page and some of the issues we do not
plan to roll out massive sweeping
changes like we did ever again hopefully
like hopefully it'll all be done
incrementally Berkeley's been hard at
work creating a kind of a workflow and a
deployment
practices that will allow us to rapidly
get code into production so we don't
have this huge bubble of features
waiting to be pushed so thank you
everyone for your understanding thank
you everyone who submitted issues who
helped us quickly detect and fix a lot
of the problems we still have about 300
issues but we have about 30 pull request
to look at two so if anybody wants to
stick around and keep watching we'll
continue to do some pull request will
will turn on some music and we'll just
keep cranking but this concludes our
official live stream so thank you again
everyone for tuning I won't thing I
thought I'd mention quickly before
people go is that I am Quincy's at
Quincy lurex an alligator I'm a Democrat
100 and Perkins are practically true and
we are on there pretty much all the time
at poor Quincy has a better trillion
messages so he might not be able to read
for them as quickly to me in berkeley
can but if you have like a pressing
thing or a suggestion that you would
like to gather to take the challenges
i'll take them and also my get it looks
like right now is I need to go through
all this sorry if i'm slow to respond
yes i'm going to go ahead and just post
post those in berkeley true berkeley is
essentially our CTO he's like making a
lot of the infrastructural decisions ben
is a big man 100 is a instrumental to
our curriculum development and also a
lot of our future development and then
me Quincy Larson if you message me I
will respond in fact I do basically all
the support so if you're asking for help
with something chances are you're
talking to me unless you're doing in an
issue went in which case you could be
asking you know dealing with anybody but
I answer the emails i responded the
tweets sorry i haven't been responding
very regularly recently and i also am
available on facebook and certainly on
Quora my favorite place of them and free
code camp so thank you all for tuning in
if you haven't subscribed please again I
think followed us click the follow
button if you haven't subscribed to
on youtube click the subscribe button
and that way you'll get notifications
when we push new content out so we're
