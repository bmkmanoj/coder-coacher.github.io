here we go the reactants at zipline
build a roguelike dungeon crawler game
so you may not be familiar with this
genre of game let me show you what it
looks like
so basically roguelikes
are very simple games that typically
involve exploring a map and along the
way you can pick up items you can gain
health and you can fight enemies so this
particular roguelike game is very simple
and literally just use this squares as
its only graphical element and you'll
see that actually this is just part of a
much larger map if you want to toggle
that so let's talk a little bit about
this zipline and what its going to
entail first the rules don't look at the
example projects code figure it out for
yourself to fill the below user stories
using whichever libraries and api's you
need be sure to give it your own
personal style there are literally a
thousand different roguelike games out
there I think that you can draw
inspiration from makes you want to do
some research be sure to use both sass
and react for this project now the user
stories there are quite a few of them
basically I have health a level and a
weapon I can pick up a better weapon I
can pick up health items all the items
and the enemies on the map are arranged
at random so essentially a procedurally
generated map I can move throughout the
map discovering items I can move
anywhere within the map's boundaries but
I can't move through an enemy until I've
beaten it so essentially with with most
roguelikes you just use the arrow keys
so you would just keep pressing the
direction into that enemy until it died
and you would just trade you know combat
usually much of the map is hidden when I
take a step all the spaces within a
certain number of spaces for me are
revealed
when I beat an enemy the enemy goes away
and I get experience points XP which
eventually increase my level when I find
an enemy we take turns damaging each
other until one of us loses I do damage
based off of my level and my weapon the
enemy does damage based off of its level
damage is somewhat random within a range
so for example an enemy would typically
do somewhere between six and eight
points of damage so you know if you were
to determine that at random and probably
one out of three times that do six
damage one out of three times they'd do
seven damage with one out of three times
I do eight damage you just use a random
function to determine that when I when I
find to beat the boss I win so there has
to be a boss that you can beat and the
game should be challenging but
theoretically winnable so you need to
make sure that you don't create
situations where it's impossible for the
player to win like sticking them in a
room with no exit for example or not
giving them enough weapons to
potentially go and beat the boss so this
is a big big challenge it's gonna take a
lot of time but it's gonna be quite a
bit of fun and I think you're really
going to enjoy it be sure to use read
search ask if you get stuck and when
you're finished be sure to tell all your
friends about it on the code review
chatroom on Twitter and on your city's
campsite and Facebook
so good luck building this elaborate
roguelike challenge this will give you
some serious react and sass chops by the
end of it
enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
