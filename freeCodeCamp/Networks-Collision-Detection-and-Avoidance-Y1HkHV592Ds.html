collision detection and collision
avoidance so before we do that let's
imagine there's a room and there are
like three different people and when two
people are talking the third person if
he tries to talk the conversation
becomes difficult for the other two
people in the same way let's say we have
three different computers on the same
network now if a was talking to B and C
suddenly transmits data to a there is a
collision and when this collision
happens the original message from A to B
becomes garbage it's of no use anymore
because there is interference so when
there is a collision that happens it
detects it and it backs off before it
tries to send the message back to B
again so this was in the original days
of the networking but later what
happened is they added the concept of
collision avoidance so in that what
happens is C before it actually starts
sending data to a it tries to see if
there is a conversation going on already
before it sends so that's C a or
collision avoidance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
