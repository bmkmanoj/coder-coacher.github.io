to build a random quote machine let's
take a look at the finished product that
we're going to strive for so you can see
that when I click new quote it will give
me a new quote and it just randomly
cycles through a bunch of quotes so the
rules as usual are don't look at the
example projects code it is built on
code pen but don't look at the code just
figure it out for yourself use whichever
libraries or api's you need and reverse
engineer the example projects
functionality and also feel free to
personalize it so it doesn't have to
look like this it can look however you
want with whatever CSS you want and you
can even have different copy and
everything just try to function focus on
the functionality alright and here are
your user stories first user story as a
user I can click a button and it it will
show me a new random quote and then as a
bonus as a user I can press a button to
tweet out a quote so that way you add
some social integration into your code
pen so when you're finished just click
this button and it'll go ahead and tweak
this out and let us know that we need to
review it otherwise we'll just take a
look at it before you move on to your
nonprofit projects have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
