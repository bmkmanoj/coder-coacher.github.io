everybody for coming out and making time
on your Saturday to join us and I'm
going to try to get through my content
as quickly as possible so that Briana
can demo and then we can ultimately move
on to just a general kind of town hall
meeting discussion any questions you
guys may have so without further ado I'm
going to go ahead and click on Nathan
screen and pop up the agenda so first of
all I think we can introduce everybody
berkeley i didn't add you to this list
of my apologies it was late um but why
don't we go ahead and introduce
ourselves i'll go ahead and start i'm
quincy and i am a teacher free code camp
berkeley hi everyone I'm Berkeley you're
breaking up a little bit Berkeley did
you guys do No ok we're going to go
ahead and move on to Nathan hey guys I
think you probably all know me Nathan
Tara kilobyte in the chat room I am a
teacher at freaky camp focusing more on
JavaScript as well as a core developer
all right and Michael hey everybody
Michael Johnson a k-code nonprofit and I
handle most of the nonprofit
coordination and nonprofit projects at
free code kit all right Briana hi i am
brianna and a chat room i'm brianna
marie and also on twitter um I am a
camper at free code camp I'm a music
teacher during the day and i'm going to
be showing my first app that i built
with star Beck awesome and I'd like to
introduce Dan Railly
dan has been a camper for a long time
I'll just command click on his profile
so you can see like his incredible
streak I noticed last night that he has
a great streak how do i think this full
screen so delicious today you can see
that he's quite active and he's very
active on camper news as well so I'm
gonna hand it over to Dan and he can
talk a little bit more about what he's
in hey everybody I'm Dan really the same
in the chat room at Dan really and on
Twitter and I am serving in the role of
content strategy manager and basically
what I'm doing is looking at the content
we are pushing out through our social
media channels to make sure we're
maximizing our returns on that from a
search engine optimization standpoint to
drive traffic to our websites through
our different avenues for that be at our
blogs or through social media channels
YouTube etc and I will also be a project
owner over the field guide section as
well well be writing the code and
content for upcoming articles so you
should see the field guide section
expand exponentially and continue to be
a huge resource of articles for all of
the campers to reference in their
learning and development excellent well
thank you very much Dan we're we're
thrilled to have you on board and I'll
I'll be quick to point out that you guys
may have seen the article on medium the
25 I think its coding explained in 25
profound web comics it's been pretty
popular on medium and that was that was
all ban he he kind of came up with the
idea of putting it to the community on
camper news and in fact I think I'm
gonna see if I can go ahead and show we
have another such event going right now
which is coders worth following so we
have a lot of submissions already which
is great please feel free to submit any
colors that you found on Twitter that
have great Twitter feeds that are really
because we'd love to include them in our
we're going to create a list on
Wednesday of the 25 coders that are
worth following on Twitter it's not
going to be exhaustive obviously they're
way more than 25 coders we're falling
but like the 25 essential canonical
coders that are going to help elucidate
your path toward being good at coding so
I'm going to go ahead and just jump
right in like I said I want to be as
quick as possible so we can have plenty
of time for discussion and first let's
talk a little bit about our translation
effort I'm gonna actually go over to as
you can see we're using our field guide
is kind of slide deck for this meeting
so as you guys know we've been working
really hard especially a lot of our
campers have been working really hard to
translate free code camp into a variety
of major world languages and I wanted to
show everybody some of that progress we
started this effort about two weeks ago
and already we've got quite a few
sections of our challenges fully
translated I especially want to point
out this gentleman who is see if
probably not opening that could you
click on that for me Nathan which one to
expand it like one of these cards there
thank you the this guy right here ah mei
GUI he has been home pretty much
single-handedly knocking down our
spanish translation are our Portuguese
team there are quite a few campers that
are working very actively on translating
free code camp into Portuguese which as
you guys may have heard is our second
biggest language now in terms of the
number of campers and
and the other thing I wanted to show you
is that we've got a nice strong team of
Russians that are Russian speakers that
are helping us translate things and we
even have a gentleman who approached me
we weren't originally going to create
German as a language because you know
Germany has basically the best English
education system in the world I mean
it's incredible how well most Germans
can speak English yet this camper
approached me and said like hey let's do
German I'll be happy to help out with it
and sure enough he's he's uh he's
walking the walk and actually
translating everything which is
phenomenal so we also of course have
campers translating things into Chinese
and we were really excited to get as
much of free code camp translated as
possible as soon as possible so let's
see if this actually takes me to the
next effort article here it's
yeah maybe you could navigate that's
weird i literally just put this together
before we started screaming guys so
thanks for your patience and by the way
I see a lot of people asking questions
we're going to get to all those
questions at the end of this but thank
you just please continue to ask
questions if they pop up and we'll
scroll through there so let's talk a
little bit about supporting languages
that aren't currently supported or on
the road map for support well and in my
mind translation is really an
all-or-nothing proposal there are lots
of languages in the world I mean there
are thousands of languages that we'd
love to support but it's a question
whether we can support them well so
unless we can actually fully support
them in the sense that every single
challenge can be translated into that
language and ultimately we'd love to
also translate the field guide articles
into all the languages that we support
unless we can do that then I don't think
we're going to be comfortable putting it
up on free code camp because we don't
want to have like a reduced experience
for our campers we're like a lot of the
content is inaccessible in the language
we'd really like to make everything on
free code camp in those languages
additionally we'd like to make sure that
we can maintain these languages and that
we don't have decoupling between the
english-language version which I think
all these challenges are going to be
created initially in English that's that
we've been doing it we don't want there
to be a big decoupling along the way so
if you really want us to translate free
code camp into your language and if you
want to get a big effort and some
friends behind that we would absolutely
welcome that but just make sure that
it's something that you guys can see
through because it's not really going to
do anybody good if you only get like
halfway through the challenges I just
want to publicly state that right now
we're not going to be able to publish
languages that aren't complete in terms
of having you know translated all of
free cooking challenge
and if you guys want to get involved in
the process of translating things you
can just reach out to me directly on
slack and i'll add you to the Trello
board the other thing to note is that
you can create little private groups for
example on slack and we've actually got
some we repaired back all of our slack
rooms to just the bare essentials but we
also created language-specific slack
rooms so we hope that those will be
useful for you guys in communicating
with people and and many of you guys may
be asking why are we doing this why why
are we translating free code camp into
all these languages when english is the
language of software development right
it's it's the language of international
business like whether that's a product
of colonialism or whether that's a
product of america's exceptionally
prosperous 20th century I don't know but
I do know that English is critically
important and I definitely do not want
to give people the impression that they
can get away with not learning English
it someone because I think it's probably
one of the most important skills that
you can learn in the 21st century and
please pardon me I know that sounds
perhaps Papa's coming from a native
English speaker I have spent five years
of my life trying to get really good at
Chinese and living in China and I know
how difficult it is to learn another
language thoroughly but it is worth the
effort for English I guarantee it like
you will definitely make good return for
your efforts so let's talk about what
free coke camp what aspects of free coke
camp will not be translated into your
native language first of all the
nonprofit projects it's 800 hours of
collaboration on real-world projects
which brianna is about to demo an
example of this like those meetings are
conducted exclusively in English the
pair programming
associated with them the correspondence
in flac we we're going to keep all that
stuff in English and we've been very
successful with that we've had
non-native English speakers who have
gone through our nonprofit projects and
and had great success despite the
disability essentially not being a
native English teachers kind of
disability at least in terms of doing
these nonprofit projects we've had
campers rise to the challenge do it
anyway so um real quick if anybody who's
on the stream is not talking right now
if you guys could meet yourselves just
to reduce the atmospheric noise so um
anyway we're going to translate
everything in the challenges the first
800 hours into your native language
hopefully and that way you can focus on
learning to code rather than trying to
learn English and learning to code at
the same time because frankly that's
like trying to learn archery while
you're riding a horse it's just not the
logical progression really you wanna you
want to learn some coding and then you
want to stop and maybe study some
English and lunch and more coding you
don't want to try to do this the two at
the same time it'll be a recipe for
confusion in stress and learning the
code is stressful enough so we want to
minimize that hence our efforts to meet
you in your own language so that's all
I'm gonna say about languages I just
want to quickly thank everybody who's
helping with the translation effort and
encourage anybody who's interested in
also participated so next I want to talk
very briefly about our new mobile
experience that we're working on as
you've probably noticed coating on a
phone is pretty tough it's not a very
fun thing to do and this picture
describes probably an hour or two of
your life every day right like you're
commuting either you're writing a bus or
subway
or you're driving you don't necessarily
have the luxury of sitting down and
pulling at your laptop and being able to
actually code so we want to create a
video driven experience so you can learn
while you're on the go now we've looked
at a lot of different data such as this
by Philip ball with EDX surrounding like
the length of videos and it's clear that
the shorter the video is the more it's
going to hold your attention the more
you're probably going to retain but
there's kind of like an optimal length
which is about six minutes according to
Philip coil so we're going to try to
find or create good six minute videos
and then put some sort of multiple
choice interaction at the end so that
you can kind of you can really struggle
with what you just absorbed and verify
that you've learned it thoroughly we
think a natural place to focus this is
interviewing them there is a skill
called colluding interviewing and
basically it's very separate from
actually coding if you go to Google or
Amazon a lot of these places they're
going to ask you a ton of questions like
quick like what's the answer to this you
know how long would this take and you
need to have kind of a mental framework
for how you can answer these questions
and then they're also going to put you
in front of a whiteboard expect you to
solve very common kind of almost out of
a standard hiring playbook type of
questions and actually majority of those
questions come from this one book I
would say if you wanted if if you only
wanted to read one book to learn to
interview you'd want to read you know
Gayle lackland McDowell's book she's uh
she's quite knowledgeable about this so
one of the things we're going to try to
do with these video lessons is take this
book break it down and distill it into
short videos essentially or find
existing videos that describe the
algorithms and concepts covered in this
book so again this book is basically
going to be the playbook for our mobile
experience but that's that we're still
in the process of designing this and we
can include a lot of additional content
our goal is to just help you to learn
more effectively while you're traveling
and while you're away from your computer
which for most of us is ever allowed
today for commuting every day and the
final thing I wanted to talk about which
I'm very excited about free code camp is
going to start issuing certificates this
is not like Coursera where they charge
money they charge you like 70 bucks and
you get a certified track this is going
to be completely free we're going to
create modules of our curriculum and
kind of bound them so that when you
complete that sequence of challenges you
will be eligible for a certificate and
we can what we'll do is we'll probably
email you a PDF and then you can print
it out how you'd like it obviously if
they're free we can't necessarily like
budget the logistics to actually print
nice certificate than selling to you but
you can definitely take them to kinkos
or wherever and print out a nice
certificate if you'd like and I just
want to give you an idea of what these
certificate programs will look like
basically they are going to be built
into our core curriculum we're not
forking our curriculum or diverging mini
way like basically we're just putting
certificate checkpoints into our
curriculum and the first one what we're
going to start off with and what we most
commonly have requested by campers is
front-end development
now you can learn some basic front-end
development very easily in fact if
you've gone through the first part of
our curriculum you've actually learned
quite a bit of basic front-end
development and so we start off with
front-end development and we're going to
restructure our front-end development
curriculum just a little bit to
emphasize a more practical aspect to it
so we're going to do our existing html5
and CSS challenges that I personally
created over the last few months and the
bootstrap challenges and then I'm
working on jQuery AJAX json api
challenges that are also going to be
similar like where you've got the iphone
on the right-hand side and you code and
you can see the changes we're going to
do similar stuff like that and I'm
creating like ap is within free code
camp specifically for these challenges
so these will these challenges the goal
is to actually prepare you to be able to
just sit down and immediately bang out
these 5 zip lines so again we have the
basic instructional content and then we
have the evaluation criteria can you
complete these zip lines and if you can
complete them then will issue you a
certificate and we estimate that like
all of this will take about 200 hours
and this is just our basic front-end
development we're going to have some
more advanced front-end development that
will probably involve angularjs or react
GIS or some other cool of client-side
JavaScript libraries and frameworks so
this is really just kind of the tip of
the iceberg this is not like a terminal
degree if you will but it's something
that you can put on your LinkedIn and
ideally for people that already know
Python or Ruby or PHP or java that are
already using that sort of stuff for the
backend a lot of people don't
necessarily want to learn full stack
JavaScript and we want to make an option
for those other people who can at least
get something on a free code camp that's
very directly applicable to what they're
doing because front-end development
concepts are useful for
read less of what you're doing in my
opinion so the good news is if you've
already completed these challenges don't
worry you're going to be retro actively
eligible and there might be a few extra
ones that you'll want to go in and
complete but this shouldn't be an
inconvenience at all for you guys it
should just be something you can grab on
the way and we're hoping to ultimately
have a JavaScript related certification
and a full stack JavaScript
certification as well so these
certifications are going to be designed
by now other than Ryan mom the designer
who has basically dictated precooked
camps look and feel and did some of the
graphic art you see on freako camp so
we're very excited to announce that all
right well I've covered everything I
want to cover and I'm happy to hand this
off to Brianna so that she can demo her
project Brianna are you ready yeah I'm
ready to go all right take it away okay
so here I'm going to make this bigger is
press here I'm an app that Jeff's
torbeck he's in the chat that store Beck
and I built for the Columbus music
foundation on their goal was to really
showcase the organizations that they
fund including their main one is the
Columbus songwriters association so here
they wanted for big blocks and luckily
the stakeholder was really clear and had
a really clear vision for what he wanted
it made it pretty easy to get get going
quickly off the ground as you can see
there's four organizations that are
really focused on when you hover over it
it gives you a paragraph with some basic
information and it also kind of triggers
more of the slideshow of pictures that's
happening there's also links that go
relevant places if you click this
expands to fill up the screen shows some
social media things that happen there
and you can either Escape key click or
there's a little X in the corner to get
out of that full screen view so it's a
relatively simple webpage um
over here we've got a hamburger menu
that Jeff built these links were still
waiting on some information from the
stakeholder to have those go somewhere
we aren't sure yet if they're going to
go to an outside page or if they're
going to just go to a another page on
this site that'll be a form and at the
top there will be a kind of an image a
logo that he's having designed but other
than that it's really it's pretty much
done it's been a fun fun project this is
michael johnson i I was the one who put
together this project in this team and I
just want to commend Brianna and Jeff
for an amazing job they presented
exactly what the stakeholder whose name
is Joey Hendrickson was looking for and
you know I thought when I was putting
together the team I knew Brianna was a
music teacher and I thought what better
than to associate a camper with a
project like the music foundation so
Joey had come to us and there they were
rebranding they used to be the
Songwriters Association and he needed
help getting that that rebranding
digital and these guys got this done and
I think about two weeks maybe three and
everything to tie up the project they're
just waiting on the stakeholder so well
done Brianna well done Jeff and I can't
wait to work with you guys on another
project awesome thank you um Brianna
maybe I can just ask you some questions
about the site and we you know or we
could look in the twitch chat see if
anybody has questions but what
technologies did you use to build the
site really basic the same frame works
at free code camp uses a lot of the
things that I've learned about this work
from store Beck we used Jade and SCSS
just kind of getting things off the
ground which was new for me and for this
slideshow feature we use something
called VX slider that is it was really
easy to implement we just had a toy
around a little bit other than that it
was really
a good library most of the animation is
CSS animation a little bit of JavaScript
but nothing to nothing to advanced is
really pretty it was a good learning
experience it was pretty easy well
that's the idea and you guys did a great
job i wish that we could show how this
looks on mobile but the hamburger menu
on mobile is perfect and I'm just so
proud of you guys so thanks again for
your hard work and great work on this
project and I just want to I don't have
too much to present today but I just
wanted to give you guys a heads up about
for non-profit projects we have coming
up there's a lot more than that but
we're doing a think kids project for
math Mass General Hospital and that's
going to work with their department of
psychiatry and at-risk and troubled
teens we're going to help them with a
volunteer management system you guys may
have seen earlier this week I tweeted
out we are partnering with safe hands
for girls who are trying to eradicate
FGM female genital mutilation in uh I
believe it's a ghana gambia we're also
partnering with child first authority
which is a school district in baltimore
and a fourth is triangle Bike Works and
they take recycled bikes present them to
teens and take them on historical bike
adventures so works really excited about
all of these I just wanted to sneak that
in there there's plenty more coming I am
on the phone with stakeholders every day
trying to put together projects for you
guys so finish the curriculum get
excited help some nonprofits and you
know grow with free code camp in May our
summit had about 15,000 campers and now
we're just under 29,000 so we've doubled
since last time we did this just I can't
wait to work with you guys keep coding
keep working hard that's all I got
awesome it looks like I saw a question
there for me what we started with images
were actually one of the last things we
got uh Joey gave us a pretty specific
idea of the layout he wanted and so we
spent the first couple days and really
that first week just working up mock-ups
and wire frame so we could get an idea
more specifically before you put
anything into code and then once we got
that nailed down we put in just some
placeholder images and started coding
away Briana what was that wireframe site
you guys used um I believe we use
mockingbird mockingjay something like
that it wasn't anything we could save on
at the time I don't remember exactly it
was something Jeff found okay oh we
could down then I went back and tried to
find find it on mocking mocking Jordan
mocking bird or mocking jay and i
remember we could save then but we can't
save now i think they've changed their
format other side a little bit either
way they looked great so if you figure
out what you used please share that with
the camp and you guys could use that to
to wider frame in the future yeah
absolutely all right this is quincy
Larson I have pulled a whole lot of
different questions out of the twitch
stream and I am going to paste them
somewhere or were we can all see them
actually I'll message them to to Nathan
and he can display them and then we can
we can try to knock them out and we
could probably collaboratively yeah I've
got some questions that I've gotten out
of chat as well yeah I'm offering well
I'll send you my questions and maybe you
can do a quick merge and that
I just I included the preferred ask them
so we can thank you for asking it well
alright so starting from the top sorry I
only just joined in how can i
participate in this translation I would
be glad to help translate it into Dutch
again go ahead so that question was
answered already Chris Voss if you go
into the field guide and you click down
in the languages section you will see a
link to a Trello board you will also see
instructions saying that it just messes
Quincy Larson and slack and he can add
you to a specific language all right and
tasty we get asked 130 copyright issues
with straight up mirroring content from
a book into video form we will make sure
that we don't violate any copyright
issues a lot of these questions we think
are just common it's common knowledge
they've just been kind of accumulated
and put together into this canonical
book but where we're going to make sure
that we don't violate anybody's
copyrights with these same thing with
the YouTube videos will make sure if we
embed other people's YouTube videos that
we attributed all right um so this name
which I won't attempt plants are they
going to be verified or something i'm
assuming that he's talking he or she is
talking about our front-end certificates
yes actually Nathan um the guy who was
just talking a second ago he is building
a pretty awesome ambitious app that will
basically make it easier for us to peer
review these completed ziplines BASE
jumps and other work Nathan I don't know
if you want to talk about that any ik
I'm sure
so okay they're saying my microphone
volume okay so I've started a kind of
looking at oh I didn't want that there
okay um so if i go to Trillo i'm in the
process of planning it out I still have
some technology selections I still have
to knock out some wire frames but
essentially I'm going to be creating a
nap called fabs for a free kill camp
it's the feedback and verification
system so part of it is a lot of people
have asked or shown interest in like a
peer review for their submission of
bonfires um I think it'd be something
neat that would be an opt-in feature so
I want to start building it um fatso is
going to run separate than freako camp
it'll be on a different server and it
will be kind of an invite only thing if
you opt into it for the peer review you
won't see a link pop up until you've
progressed through some of the level
three bonfires at that point we feel
that you could probably give good
feedback to other people so that's
that's it right there the second part of
the system is going to be people that we
trust that have shown ability to help
actually verify all zip lines and pawn
fires that are submitted any of you guys
that have done zip lines are bought or
BASE jumps sorry know that there's a
place where you put in a URL to where
your zip line is that our intent is to
make it a lot easier for the reviewers
to actually find that so this system
will auto-populate it once you put in a
submission it'll pop up in this system
and when the reviewer clicks on it
they'll get your submission as well as a
link they can go check out
the link go through your code and then
provide you feedback and you should get
an email based on that feedback and then
we'll internally market as whether it
was kind of non-profit project worthy so
then the last part of the this section
that that most users will be interested
in is actual nonprofit queue management
so when someone completes all of our set
plans and all of our base jumps they'll
enter the nonprofit queue and we'll use
the system to actually go over look
through all the bonfire submissions all
these zip lines all the base jumps look
at what feedback has been given to you
already you know look at if there was
improvement that was needed I mean a lot
of you guys are rock stars and do great
right off the bat some people like me I
needed help along the way so you know
we'll look at progress and things like
that and then if you're ready for a
non-profit you'll be added in if if not
then the intent is for feedback to be
given on maybe things that you can you
can look at or work on in order to in
order to get there you know our product
is you guys and and we want to make sure
that you guys are ready to to work on
those nonprofits and deliver a quality
product to these organizations that are
in need so but that's the system I still
have a lot to plan on it i'll be
blogging and straining a lot of its
development and if you guys are
interested in working on this system
working on implementing it you can send
me a message in slack i'm at Terok
kilobyte you can also find me on twitter
you can find my blog my emails out there
really easy to get in touch with me
wonderful thanks for going to that
Nathan actually you mentioned that it
involves a lot of like it'll be a
process for evaluating people in their
preparedness for starting the nonprofit
projects and I don't you think I had
time to mention that to to Michael
Michael did you did you catch all that
that was news to me I'm excited I'm like
doing backflips any anything we can have
to better assemble teams and do better
for the organizations that are taking a
chance on us is great and thank God for
Nathan huh indeed this is going to be an
incredible open source project I was
telling Nathan like this is the kind of
evaluative software that like
universities and public school systems
will pay millions of dollars for like
and we're going to be able to open
source it and make it available to them
for free well granted what they'll have
to like customize it a little bit but I
mean this is going to be a powerful tool
oh yeah they want to pop up that
question queue again mm-hmm we still had
plenty of good questions from our more
viewers so the verified we went over
that and introduced a new application
that will be coming out of the frico
camp repository space the stanford
course had a verification URL on
certificate which i thought was cool
yeah there's there's places that do that
a lot will do the same through three
using a uuid on their certificates so a
number of people always be able to query
and say hey did this person actually do
that or do they just make their own
certificate and if you guys are
interested will write an easy blog post
on on how a system like that works it's
not difficult to dull the next one does
free kemp go further into CSS HTML than
the first couple sections you go through
before you get into jQuery
Wesley do you want to talk about that
Kwazii uh-huh some letter it audio
issues I don't know if it's just me okay
currently we don't go into more CSS HTML
than we do we're always evaluating ways
to make our curriculum better it becomes
a fine line for us when Quincy and I and
Berkeley and everyone else talk about
the curriculum development on where do
we focus the effort and where do we
focus the time yes Tara kilobytes in
real life name is Nathan so we are
planning a JavaScript curriculum that
will be in house and it's going to be
pretty in-depth you know we've looked at
the offerings out there and we've always
found ourselves recommending additional
stuff to people you know and and
programming is moving it's a moving
target you know where we're like the
general idea is so we're evaluating and
and making our own JavaScript curriculum
that will start from the basics go
through you know how to do object only
no programming javascript the right way
but then it's going to really kind of
take a deep dive more in towards the
functional programming space it's it's
super easy to do in javascript
javascript is very well suited to do it
because you can do functional
programming pretty easily and then when
it gets really hard and you're like oh
you know this is just getting a little
too little too hairy you can always
switch back and go imperative at any
time you want javascript will let you do
both at the same time so with the
ziplines the base jumps and we're going
to be adding more we plan to add more
bonfire challenges and we plan to
basically greatly increase the length of
our JavaScript curriculum you know
trying to hit that that estimate of 1600
hours and then fit all of that stuff
into that time can be a little bit
difficult so we probably will add
additional resources you know if you're
interested more in the front end stuff
for like advanced HD mental advantage
CSS and that's something that at Quincy
and I and the others would have to
evaluate and it looks like we lost
connection with them okay 13 copyright
issues so oh that's the wrong question
list um I don't think there's a firm
timeline on when the friend answer to
certification is coming out soon
trademark
it will be probably before the next
camper meeting so how can I help with
the spanish translation again you know
go to the field guide article look at
how to contribute what about Punjabi
Klingon and Dutch as Quincy said we want
we want to focus on on languages that
are going to be widely used and also
maintainable so unless we can do it all
are you know it's kind of an all-or-none
thing unless we can translate all of
them into the language that's not going
to be done okay now we can get Quincy
back in as far as Klingon probably not
going to happen and I think we answered
the Dutch question as well we answered
the question on the copyright issues for
the mobile okay how do we how did we
arrive at our 200 hour estimate um
Quincy I can take that one yeah go for
sure so first of all like all of our
estimations are very broad they are not
very precise because everybody is going
to take a different amount of time if
you're watching TV while you're coding
obviously you're not going to be
productive if you are coding through a
screen reader it's probably going to
take a little bit longer you know there
are all these other things that can can
change the amount of time it takes if
you're if you're non-native English
speaker that's a disadvantage that
wouldn't possibly make it longer for you
to be able to code so these are rough
estimates but 200 hours i think is a i
try to err on the side of making the our
estimates a little bit longer just but
we used to actually have our estimates
on each challenge and people would
constantly right
me and say like oh this took a lot more
longer than 30 minutes so we we
ultimately got rid of those so I'm I'm
going to basically say that our 200 our
estimate is a wild guess okay so I'll
talk about this um the this next one so
amber someone asked a question like you
know are we going to teach amber so
right now we teach angular and that
there's not a lot of plan there's not a
big plan to change anytime soon as far
as it like the next big thing that's
coming is going to be the JavaScript
curriculum and we've sat down and talked
about this and we feel that with better
JavaScript with with a deeper
understanding of JavaScript in general
you guys are going to pick up on any
friend and framework pretty easily I
mean they they all have their little
differences and things like that but we
hope to be able to empower you guys to
really learn how to learn you know get
get comfortable reading through
documentation get get comfortable
playing around trying new things ember
is difficult because none of the lead
developers on free camp right now really
use ember so it becomes a question of
maintainability which we find ourselves
asking about about angular you know
angular 2 is on the horizon angular 1.3
is out right now you know should we get
questions like are you going to switch
to angular 2 right now everything is in
a giant state of flux so we find
ourselves in a strange place where we're
kind of held hostage by the by the
programming landscape and and what's
what's out there and what's popular I
mean right now angular is by far the
most popular and we really have to focus
to get you guys you know ready
in order to go out the door do you want
to add anything else to that Quincy sand
issues with Quincy again sorry I was
needed oh no that was an excellent
explanation Nathan and that was way
better than what I was going to say I
can tackle the next one now when is the
certification going to be available we
hope to have it available in June um I
mean that would be like best-case
scenario but possibly July but we're
gonna we're hustling on it I mean it's
one of our top priorities right now okay
so questions for Brianna um I know you
said Briana are you still there yeah I'm
here okay great I know you said that it
took about 2-3 weeks but how many hours
would you say that you have invested
into the project um well between both
Jeff and I I'd say it was probably
closer to between 40 and 60 rather than
a hundred hours and I think but I think
the main reason for that is Jeff is
already an expert in so many of the
things we needed for this project um
anything to do with terminal or node he
was a lot more comfortable than I was so
if this project would have been two
people of my skill level it probably
would have been closer to the 100 our
guess for hours okay and uh someone else
asked you know you guys are using a lot
of CSS transitions and things like that
how the how is the browser compatibility
that's an interesting question it's
something that hasn't really come up yet
uh all of the people working on the
project I don't know which browsers we
were using as far as me and Jeff and
Joey and Quincy and Michael when they
were looking at it i was using chrome we
ever we never actually went and tested
it in a bunch of different browser so if
anybody finds any issues let me know I'm
will fix up okay um
oh okay and then we had another question
at a chat just now that was not that so
a lil ass will there be anything on the
design portion many new coders have
never used a mock-up or a wireframe
again we have to look at where we're
focusing the time that you guys spend
you know mock-ups and wireframes are
pretty easy to to do and a lot of the
stuff will be like the tertiary things
will be in blogs you know we can't give
every ear we can't put everything in
there otherwise our 1600 our curriculum
will grow to 2002 2500 to 3000 to a
lifetime you know which if you're
pursuing any type of career and you want
to be a professional you're always
learning new things you're always
learning ways to do new things so we'll
we'll continue providing external
resources you know and you guys will see
mention a bit and slack when we talk
about it in fact we have a great blog
post on 10 steps to plan better so you
can write less code where you know talk
about the user story to talk about API
authoring and really go into the
planning portions of projects so he half
lifetime FCC well ideally you guys will
finish our are I mean we'd love for
everyone to stick around but ideally
what happens is he has knock out some
awesome nonprofit projects and then you
go forth and get a job and continue
learning and being mentored and
mentoring in a professional role and
then give back to free go camp as you
can so i think i saw another question
flyby that says you know has anyone
completed freako camp i'll be honest no
one's completed freako camp
not a single person and hardly anyone
does and the the reason is if you have
the dedication to get through into our
nonprofits we actually have scheduled in
that 1600 hours is about three or four
non-profit projects no one's there yet
and the reason why they don't is because
they end up getting jobs before they can
complete all of the nonprofit's so that
you know it's it's it's sad that no one
has completed it yet but it's also a big
win because once people complete their
their first you know one or two they end
up going and getting jobs right this is
quincy i just want to add that we are
erring on the side of bigger and rigor
and trying to make the curriculum the
most challenging so ideally it's a lot
harder than what you'd encounter at like
hack reactor or some of these other boot
camps like that that's what we're going
for we want it to be as rigorous as
possible so that like if you actually do
create if you do actually complete freak
okay if it really means something it
really means you hustled not just fill
the seat for 12 weeks or a few semesters
in the master's degree program that
you've actually spent a substantial
amount of time coding and designing apps
and so with that I just I think we're
almost to the end of the hour unless
anybody else on the stream has anything
they wanted to say um all I have one
more thing on especially on the design
because we we have been getting
questions so if the fact of the matter
is that a lot of the best tools out
there aren't free right now that's
that's the state of the market you know
if you want to use sketcher you want to
use balsamiq mockups for free you're
mocking and wireframing you absolutely
can they're free for 30 days and then
you have to pay for him um
we really don't want to try and and push
you guys towards a new product we don't
get feedback or we don't get kickbacks
from any company by recommending their
product like you know we recommend
screen hero for pair programming slack
certainly doesn't give us any any money
for for recommending that you know
Quincy and myself are big jetbrains
users for webstorm and and I I assure
you that neither of us have received a
dime freaka camp does not get any money
based on on our our recommendation of
using their editor versus you know free
additives are out there like Adam so
when when you guys you know are like oh
this tool is great you should teach it
you have to think about it from our
perspective in that we don't want to
tell people to go buy something when
they may end up not using it right so
this is quincy so yes like at some point
we'd love for slack or jetbrains or some
of these big established players to to
give us preferential treatment and we're
hopeful that that will happen sooner
rather than later and that's something
we're actively working on is working out
these kinds of partnerships with these
organizations but will be very
transparent if we do get such a
partnership in place and as always the
objective world wing the same we want to
help all of you learn to code and get a
coding job and that is why we're here
and that's why we're all collaborated
including you guys collaborating on
making free code camp as effective and
hospitable community as possible well
said I say we end on that note all right
wonderful well does anybody want to pick
up the stream after this we have like
191 people washing and would anyone like
this dream development of some form or
just throw on some music and keep coding
um I probably do something actually no I
need a break anyway yes so does anyone
else want to take over well if nobody
else wants to i will i'll be happy to
continue streaming it'll take me a
minute or two to get set up but then
i'll go ahead and start screaming yep
there will be a replay guys as soon as i
end this wait for twitch to do its
twitchy things from the background and
then we'll we'll export this saturday
summit to youtube so thanks for watching
stick around Quincy's going to fire up
the hamsters get the wheel spinning and
he'll pick up the stream shortly thanks
for coming everybody thank you thanks
guys thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
