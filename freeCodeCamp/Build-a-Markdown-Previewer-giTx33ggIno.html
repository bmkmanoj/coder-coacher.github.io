zipline we're going to build a markdown
previewer here's what it'll look like as
you can see there are two panes one of
them has github flavored markdown and
the other has the output so let's go
over the rules real quick first don't
look at the example projects code figure
it out for yourself
second fulfill the below user stories
and use whichever api's and libraries
you need to do so and be sure to give
this project your own personal style you
must use both sass and react to build
this project for user stories I can type
github flavored markdown into one text
area and I can preview the output of my
markdown in the other area and it should
be updated as I type so just to demo
this you can see that this is github
flavored markdown over here the hash
makes this text over here h1 so if I
delete that suddenly this is back to
paragraph form and how do we make h2 in
markdown well we add two hashes h3 three
hashes so you can see that it updates in
real time instantaneously with reacts
binding so I wouldn't recommend you
trying to figure out how to interpret
markdown yourself instead I'd recommend
you use this excellent library called
marked so here's the CDN with the links
so you can import it directly in your
project and you can click right here to
go to the github repo for this project
and read the documentation remember to
use read search asked if you get stuck
and when you're done be sure to share
your project in our code review chat
room and you can also share it on
Twitter and on your city's camp site on
Facebook so you can get further feedback
enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
