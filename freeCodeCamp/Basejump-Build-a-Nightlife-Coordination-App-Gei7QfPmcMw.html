app first let's take a look at what this
might end up looking like so we can
enter our location click go ah when we
see a variety of different bars in our
city so if I want to go to one I'm going
to be prompted to sign in to Twitter and
now it's going to redirect me back to
the app you can see that it still has my
search and everything and I can just
click that I'm going to the top row
there are a lot of other bars that I
could go to too if I wanted to maybe I
want to go to the social study I'll
click going so this way all my friends
can log in and they can click going and
I can have an idea of how many of my
friends are likely to be at any given
venue on a given night let's talk about
the user stories the first agile user
story is as an unauthenticated user you
not signed in I can view all the bars in
my area as an authenticated user I can
add myself to a bar to indicate I am
going there tonight as an authenticated
user I can remove myself from a bar if I
no longer want to go there just by
clicking the button again and finally as
an authenticated user when I log in I
should not have to search again and this
did a great job with that once I sign in
with Twitter it redirected me right back
and my search was already there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
