timestamp microservice UNIX timestamps
are a standard way of measuring time
it's basically the number of seconds
that have elapsed since January 1st 1970
so if we take a date and pass it as an
argument to our service it will convert
that to a UNIX timestamp and it will
also return the natural human readable
date note that even if it converts
certain things in the URL you can pass
it just naturally and it'll work fine
it'll add that HTML code right in there
for you and if you pass a UNIX timestamp
is the argument it will again return
both the UNIX timestamp and the date so
it works both ways
so for each of these base jumps you
should be creating a new github
repository and a new Heroku project and
if you need further instructions
remember you can go to this walkthrough
on that we recommend using Clementine
Jas you're welcome to use whatever you
want as long as it's full stack
JavaScript so here are the specifics
user stories that you should implement
for this base jump user story number one
I can pass a string as a parameter and
it will check to see whether the string
contains either a UNIX timestamp or a
natural language date for example
January 1st 2016 if it does it returns
both the UNIX timestamp and the natural
language form of the date if it does not
contain a date or a UNIX timestamp it
returns null for those properties and we
can verify that that's the case right
here if I just don't pass anything it'll
return the instructions but if I pass
you know gibberish
it'll just return null and null once
you've finished building this be sure to
share it in the code review chatroom and
also share it on Twitter and on your
city's campsite on Facebook have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
