Jones hello it's great to have you here
Alec for those of you watching I just
want to tell you a little bit about this
amazing amazing person Alec is a 14 year
old developer from Victoria Canada he's
currently in the ninth grade
and he has built a chatbot called
Christopher bot that is currently
helping more than 3000 people track
their homework so they can make sure
that they they remember to do their
homework and what they need to do he's
been interviewed by the BBC and now he's
being interviewed right here on freako
camps YouTube channel welcome tell us a
little bit tell us a little bit about
Christopher bot uh yeah so Christopher
bot is he's a homework I always say a
homework tracking bot so what that means
is you can text Christopher bot you can
set up all your classes and all the what
your schedule is like and then um you'll
get text at the end of each of your
classes it'll ask you if you have
homework you can say yes or no tell them
what homework you have and then at the
end of the day he'll send you a reminder
with everything to get done and you can
always ask for for what homework you
need to gather what's what's due today
and stuff so it's very interesting that
you chose to build a chat bot because
there's so much hype surrounding chatbox
right now it's a very new it's not so
much a new concept but that it's
recently become extremely popular to
build chat BOTS why did you build a chat
bot as opposed to like a traditional
mobile app or a web app that ran on a
mobile phone I couldn't laugh I I didn't
I I don't know how and I was I thought
about that and I was like oh I'd have to
spend all this time learning you know
objective-c or Swift and I was I saw I
was like well what's the closest thing
to a mobile app and it's not of a chat
bot because they would be doing the same
thing that the F word and so I decided
to go to the chat pod awesome
what kinds of technology did you use to
build this yeah so I've used it's mainly
built on Ruby on Rails which I don't
think very many chat bots are built on
it's I don't under a common thing you've
built the chat bot with but it's the
language I knew pretty well so I decided
to get that and then I you know there's
um if you notice the home page I used to
boot I got lots of questions about that
and I used a bootstrap template I'm not
a not a CSS wizard and yeah it's just
hosted on Heroku and yeah Wow so that
basically you use all these very common
common tools and you were able to kind
of quickly get up and running you didn't
have to build your own CSS you just use
bootstrap you didn't have to deal with
AWS or try to create your own secure
server you just use Heroku and of course
Ruby on Rails one of the greatest tools
out there for rapidly prototyping an app
yeah sure I'm thankful I didn't use AWS
because I made a big crash the other day
oh yeah yeah well yeah the s3 Adams
effect this has affected us all
including at free code camp all of our
images stopped working which is awkward
but it can happen pretty quickly
AWS only crashes once every you know
year or so fortunately so we tell us a
little bit about Christopher but you
chose the name Christopher bot and I
know that in your article which I've
linked to below which everybody should
go read this amazing article very
popular medium in your article you
mentioned that that you named your bot
Christopher because that's what Alan
Turing called one of his early machines
and and he named it after his friend who
died in childhood why did you choose
this name yeah I think you know when you
sit like that I think a lot of people
like wow that's really deep name and
that really is just it was it you know
postal is one of my favorite movies and
I had just watched it and
I was talking with my dad and he was
like now you're probably originally
there was gonna be a homework bot with
two K's at the end and really and he was
like that's that's not so great so he
had to come up with the name and I just
watched the movie and I was like well
why not do Christopher after after what
he did in the movie yeah and if you
haven't seen it that's just such an
amazing movie the imitation game it's
it's a kind of a biopic of Alan Turing's
life specifically the really important
part of his life when he was helping
crack the crack the Enigma yeah the
Germans were using to communicate one of
the early forms of encryption so at what
point did you realize that you had this
this bot that the people were using a
whole lot and and that this was a
general problem it wasn't just a problem
that you had yeah so you know I noticed
last year and I noticed punch my friend
stinging it you'd go I would forget all
the homework I had I just gone I didn't
have a clue what I had to do and I
remember you know it's you know 9
o'clock and and it's like oh crap I just
I left
all of that and now I realized I got a I
got a go to sleep early because I gotta
get up early and I got to go to school
early to get all my to get all my work
done and I noticed some of my other
friends doing it just sitting there
early in the morning doing the homework
and I was like well I might as well this
build something that could help me out
yeah so so you just looked around just
to recapitulate what you said you looked
around early in the morning and it kind
of clicked like I'm not the only person
who's coming into school early because
I've forgot to do my homework the night
before or I forgot some critical piece
of that whole markets at school and so
you so tell us a little bit about how
your childhood works does it remind you
at the end of the day what you need to
take home and yeah so you definitely
obviously it doesn't work
unless you give it the information so it
does send you a text which not just say
it like it's sending a text but actually
it's a big difference compared to
writing it down in like a notebook
because you still have to remember that
you need to write it down in your
notebook but when you get a text on a
specialist students we always always
have our phones out you know you just
get that quick text and you can easily
respond yes or no and then yeah at the
end of the day a couple minutes after
your last class you'll get a you'll get
a little reminder with everything that
you need to do so let's say that I just
heard my teacher saying assignment and I
just pull out my phone and check -
Kristoffer bottom like oh page 82 of
biology textbook do the vocab assignment
something like that and I just literally
say that to Chris provide what happens
when I send that to Christopher bot
right so when you there's there's two
ways you can like let Chris robot know
you have homework and that's one is to
wait for him to text you or you can text
him saying I mean he's not the smartest
right now so you do have to you know
make sure you spell stuff right but if
you say I have homework for you know X
class then he'll he'll ask you those
questions but yeah so I just built it he
got all this he gets all this
information back on our on the website
there's a table with everything that
you'll have from the previous week and
he killed us keep he keeps that
information for a week until the next
classes comes back around and he's got
to reset your data awesome so currently
how many people are using Christopher
bot we just broke the 3000 milestone Wow
congratulations thank you are most of
them in Victoria or have you noticed
people using it all around that's it
it's funny story so I have obviously the
BBC article which you mentioned that
obviously brought some users in from
Great Britain sounds great but I
mentioned my article
a viral post in Thailand so a Thai blog
I presume they're pretty popular in
Thailand they posted a little thing
about Christopher Wat and information
stuff when we went on Fox 10 so that
last I checked at eleven thousand likes
three point eight thousand shares and
you know three hundred comments and I
like I said couldn't understand any of
them and that so that brought a big
chunk of users from Thailand and you
know I mentioned Kevin Jonas which he
actually just I noticed more people from
the states who joined but yeah it's I
think top three countries are Great
Britain Thailand and the United States
and uhm Kevin Jonas that's something I
didn't I didn't say earlier but this guy
he's one of the Jonas Brothers yeah and
and for people who don't know who the
Jonas Brothers are how would you
describe them um three musically
talented guys I mean one of them I mean
there's Nick who is big and pop there's
Joe who's also got his band and then
Kevin I just I guess he's really into
entrepreneurship and so he tweeted about
I bought which just I was like what and
now now I can say Kevin Jonas follows me
on Twitter which does have some Street
credit to it absolutely how many
followers does he have five point 1
million holy cow that's amazing
yeah the scale I mean the reach how many
people saw that tweet is it's it's
really amazing and I just to put this
back in perspective your 14 year old kid
you're working through high school you
still have to do all the stuff that a
normal high schooler does except you
kind of have this this Fame online as a
result of this chat pod that you built
and the traction that it's gotten how
did you learn how to program I think
that's probably the main question
everybody's asking you're 14 you've been
busy go in high school how did you learn
Ruby on Rails how did you learn be scrap
how did you pick up all these skills so
you can strap them together
- this jackpot product yeah it was it
was a lot of I think it was a lot of
puzzling together so it first started
all that I was been like six or seven or
eight I that's all I start programming
but that's when my dad decided to teach
my brother - do you want him to get him
kind of interested in it my older
brother and they built this little app
that kept track of your mood I thought
it was like I was like wow this is so
cool
I was just I was too young at the time
to get everything you that was happening
so I went back and I think grades good
six I was like I revisited the
programming and I was like I can well
I'm old enough now I can get I can get
these concepts so I started just you
know learning and I started with HTML
basic basic stuff and then I moved on to
PHP and that was a good good challenge
because that's the first real
programming language I learned and I
spent a while with that and then I saw
Ruby on Rails
so I started piecing together a little
bit the code Academy reading articles
you know treehouse just all these little
pieces which helped me learn Ruby on
Rails and I got to the point where I
could you know do it well and I could
just you know if I wanted to get
something I could just go into the
documentation get it all as yeah and
then and then that led me to the idea
with Christopher bot that's that's
really quite remarkable so so a lot of
this was just like your dad kind of
planted the initial seeds in encouraging
you all you and your brother to program
and then you just took it from there
did you take any formal programming
classes you have programming classes
high school no like I Victoria is the
opposite of a tech of you know you got
Vancouver nearby and that's that's
becoming one but I've been doing this
pretty much just all I'm all on like
learning programming just all online and
stuff wow that's some amazing initiative
and I think all of us can be inspired by
your your
can-do spirit and so tell us a little
bit about the prototyping stage like so
Christopher bot didn't emerge fully
formed and with all the features how did
you build it out what did you start with
yeah that's a that's a good question
so it really you know I started I didn't
even know I woke if you don't know
that's fine I know the webhook was I
didn't I didn't get I can't even
comprehend what that was until I spent
yeah I spent quite a few weeks just
learning as much as I could about
webhooks because I knew those were going
to be a big part of Chris errotica you
know you have to get that data back into
back to the crystal rot service and so
that took that was the first step and it
was you know frustrating it seemed when
I read everything it seems so simple yet
nothing was working until I just just
kept on going
you know just kept going at it day after
day until I finally I finally got it to
work and which was you know so happy
just after that little that tiny little
win I've been working on and so that was
good and then I realized I can start
building an actual chat bot so I played
around for a little bit you know
learning how it worked the Facebook you
know api's so I when I did start fully
going at it I knew what I was gonna
handle so the first step was you
obviously have to set up classes so
Christopher watt doesn't work unless you
have class and set up so I built a I
built a forum and I realized nobody I'm
gonna get zero users if people keep
having to type this information and
again and again so thankfully I just
can't buy it's not new I don't think
it's definitely not new but it's just a
forum so you type in your classes for
Monday and most of high school the class
times don't change your classes usually
don't change too much so when you go to
create your classes on Tuesday
the forms just fill with what you are
what you put into the previous day so
that was that was how I got started
there so the website was you know pretty
shaky
but all the classes were set up and then
I learned about a Kron so running tasks
automatically
yeah he's Heroku the scheduler tool for
that yes I did and that was you know I
it seems I was a little annoying at
first because I thought you know maybe
running a cron I wanted to run it like
every minute but I really I was like
that if you for like nope
that's not gonna happen with Heroku so
then I learned you know every 10 minutes
I can run a task which is which is fine
and so I got there and then you know I
suppose in what tax and it was working
still really buggy at the time that I
think most are so I spent a while
crushing bugs getting it all you know
working and then it was just features
from there on so I spent you know if you
if you use Chris robot you notice the
quick replies the yes or no after he
took your classes and that was a big one
because that way it's super easy for
people to tap yes or no said it's typing
the literal message bubbles that send
your text like someone's texting you in
real life that was that was a idea by
mine my dad because he realized you know
Christa watt would send you text after
one millisecond and most people wouldn't
even realize that a new text should come
in right then I used two computers
faster than humans that you're
corresponding with yeah exactly
it reduced like a lag intentionally yeah
which is yeah stuff you all like that's
that's weird but if you don't people
just can't well a lot of people just
can't keep up that fast when you're when
it's going that that quickly and which
yeah you see it like that it's funny and
then I was just you know
Chris Rock building out his you know
witty little replies that he has and you
know trying to he's he's never the goals
never been to treat him like he like try
to get people to think he's human like
the goal has always been just to think
he's a friendly robot and that's the
that's the image and it's just been you
know slowly day by day just getting out
new features and stuff Wow
so it sounds like you've learned a ton
about user experience design emotional
design agile project management and
product development it's just astounding
how much I it sounds like you've learned
from this process yeah I don't think you
know I always I always read and all
those coding you know tutorials and
stuff the best way to learn is to build
something that that you're passionate
about and it wasn't till Christopher
bought that I was building something I
was you know really passionate about
because I'd spent I spend my time really
like a lot of if he's watching this
building pointless just pointless things
to to learn programming and I think I
learned I learned infinitely more when I
wanted when I was building something
that really had my attention and I was
happy to work on it and I knew people
were gonna be using this in the future
so are you continuing to maintain and
expand Christopher bot yeah so the goal
I Christopher bots not the smartest spot
out there that's for sure
so I'm just you know I want them to be
smarter obviously the more users the
better and you know I'm kind of in a
phase right now where it's like you know
I could spend a bit of time maybe
because you're out swagger making him
getting more people to use him I think I
really just want to kind of focus on
making Chris rabat as smart as possible
and then you know if going out and
trying to get even more users
yeah well I'm hopeful that this this
interview will raise more awareness of
Chris or Bob Christopher bot below I've
linked to the article that Alec wrote
Christopher but I've also linked to Alec
on Twitter and he's followed by at least
one famous person huh
so I I started recommend everybody
watching this go and follow him it
sounds like he's got some amazing new
developments in the pipes so you've
still got three more years before you
graduated from high school what are your
long-term plans do you have any at this
point
yeah that's the question people always
ask me it's you know you've done this
what are you gonna do in the future and
I've had I've had some people like reach
out to me and they're like oh you can
tell you're gonna do something really
cool in the future do yo so call when
you have that next idea that next really
big idea and you know that's I don't
know that's the thing tonight is I'm
still I'm still hurting I still have to
get through you know three more years of
high school and I'm sure there's a lot
of people out there that didn't enjoy
high school and high school is not
always the greatest thing but I just
that'll probably that still has to you
know especially when mom says you know
that's got to be your first priority and
that it definitely is and yeah so I
don't have any really long-term goals
and that's a that's a misconception I
think people get is that just because I
built this I got my whole life figured
out I'm just
I really don't well it sounds like in
the meantime you have lots of people who
are excited about Christopher bot and
it's it's a safe investment of your time
and energy to continue to maintain and
expand Christopher bot and like I I will
say this is as somebody who runs a big
open source project I will say that
focusing staying focused and heads down
on one thing for a very long time just
like Linus Torvalds has been very
focused on Linux for the last 25 years I
think that that's the way to go I would
say don't be looking for some other big
idea just continue to incrementally
improve Christopher bot because you've
already got a hit on your hands
yes for sure that's what that's what you
know I think a lot of people have
I think I have gotten that advice and I
like that but Weiss because you know I
think it's you know I came up with this
after you know learn to program for
three years and before that all my other
ideas were so bad and so I don't I don't
know when the next one would even come
all right well thank you so much for
joining us Alec I know you got to get to
school in a few minutes so I have a
beautiful day at 9th grade high school
and remember all of us who are excited
about your chatbot and if you get any
more insights of course about chat pots
or good things you can do with them we'd
love a follow-up article I think a lot
of people would be interested in reading
that yeah definitely I definitely am
interested in in writing you know honey
I think I always like to hear the
stories about oh this happened you know
a year six months ago what what's that
person up to you now and I think I
definitely will write an article all
right well I look forward to reading it
and thank you again for joining us have
a beautiful day of school
yes thank you and thank you everyone for
tuning in alive be sure to again follow
