shortener microservice basically will be
able to pass a URL to our service and it
will shorten it and then we can also
take that shortened form of the URL pass
it in and it will redirect us to the URL
we originally shortened let's try this
right now so we've got this URL here and
I'm going to open a new tab and instead
of google let's do gmail okay and now we
see that the original email of the
original URL is gmail com and the short
URL is this and if we click on this to
go there it's going to redirect us to
gmail
so the specific user stories you'll want
to implement here are I can pass a URL
as a parameter and I will receive a
shortened URL in the JSON response if I
pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow
the valid HTTP colon slash slash WWE
example com format which I think it has
to start with HTTP colon slash slash or
HTTPS colon slash slash and then it has
to have at least one dot in here is
generally how the the commonly accepted
form of a URL if it does not follow that
format the JSON response will contain an
error instead and we can test this right
now so I'll just open up a new tab and
I'll just pass that and it says URL is
invalid that's the error response and
when i visited the shortened URL it will
redirect me back to my original link and
we already proved that by clicking on
the link that was provided so once
you've finished implementing all these
be sure to share them in the code review
chat room and also you can share your
project on Twitter and on your cities
campsite on facebook good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
