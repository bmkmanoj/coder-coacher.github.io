that we think will be interesting to all
of you and then st. Peter and anirudh a
garhwal who is not visible but I think
he's still on the call um they are going
to demo our new wiki and then we will
try to save at least half of the time
for Question and Answer at the end
because I'm sure you'll have lots of
questions anirudh are you here I think I
just asked okay I don't think he's here
right now but but Rex is fully prepared
to demo if necessary he just man what is
this stuff okay so first I want to talk
a little bit about the new curriculum
basically I'll go ahead and tell you the
the front-end component has not changed
at all it's literally exactly the same
and ninety-nine percent of you are
probably still doing the front-end
component to earn your front-end
development certification you don't need
to change a thing just keep keep
powering through it then what was
previously called our full staff
development certification is now going
to be called our back-end development
certification and it's basically exactly
the same as the full stack development
certification except we're going to add
some new API projects so these will be
five base jump projects where you'll
build an API you'll build a micro
service and basically it'll that if
you're worried like Oh API a big scary
acronym all that means is basically it's
an app that instead of serving HTML it
serves JSON and so it gives you data
instead of giving you a web view and API
is of course are commonly used for just
sharing data between machines so we'll
still cover everything we previously
covered on the advanced base jumps or
the advanced bonfires are still going to
be a part of the back-end development
certification we've removed angularjs
from our back-end development
certification and now we are going to
teach react as part of our data
visualization certification sorry these
aren't in great order we were working on
this until about one o'clock last night
thank you for everybody who is up
watching us last night by the way work
on this live so the data visualization
certification will involve some new
projects that will be like zipline
projects react projects where you'll
build an app completely in react Jas and
sass which is a very cool CSS
preprocessor that we're going to teach
you and then we'll have the data
visualization projects and these are
very exciting these we use d3 which is a
popular visualization library it runs
fully in JavaScript and JSON and it was
created by Michael Bostock at the New
York Times and it's it's just blowing up
it's one of the most popular open source
projects of all time and then you'll be
able to get a data visualization
certificate now after you've finished
all three of those certifications we
have the full stack development
certification which is like our uber
certification that you get if you
complete literally everything so what
does this mean well first you're going
to do a Greenfield non-profit project
that just means you're going to start
from you know fresh and you're going to
build something specifically that the
nonprofit organization you're working
with needs so you're going to build two
of those projects and then one of the
most important findings like from us
talking to a lot of employers is you
know a lot of employers don't actually
create a whole lot of new code what they
are more interested in is maintaining an
extending existing code and we call that
code legacy code now my definition of
legacy code is code that you
didn't write yourself it's somebody
else's code that you are maintaining so
what we hope to do is have the
greenfield projects a greenfield being
brand new like a green field where you
build a building it's a term from like
construction that's been imported into
software engineering the greenfield
projects you'll build some greenfield
projects and then you'll take over
somebody else's legacy code another
campers legacy code and maintain and
extend that so it'll be a great great
practice for you to be working with the
kind of random code you would encounter
in the field and then after you complete
two of these projects then you will get
the full stack development certification
which as I said is our kind of uber
certification and we're planning to do
interview preparation as well so if you
want to stick around for the interview
preparation we're going to do critical
thinking interview preparation we're
going to do whiteboard coding interview
preparation and then we're going to have
a series of mock interviews and there's
a good chance that these mock interviews
will be peer to peer where you'll be
basically you'll have like a code
interface and you'll be interviewing
your peers and that will give you
practice taking on both the persona of
interview or an interviewee which is
important because you want to be able to
empathize with the people you're
interviewing with this will also give
you an opportunity to develop some of
the soft skills that come with you know
the actual interview process which
unfortunately in most companies is
completely divorced from day-to-day
actual work like the interview process
is not necessarily representative of
what your day-to-day experience is going
to be however some companies like
pivotal labs which one of our campers
recently joined they do like a pair
programming interview process so you
would just be pair programming the
entire time and that's ideal because
then you actually get to show and what
you can do rather than just talk about
what you can do and draw a bunch of
arcane algorithms on the whiteboard but
the good news is a lot of the algorithms
that you need to solve for these kinds
of job interviews are precisely the
things that we cover in the bonfires in
fact a lot of people will say like yeah
I went into an interview and it was
like I was answering something exactly
from the bonfire and I remembered how to
implement it so we've heard lots of
reports we've even heard reports of
employers taking our bonfires and using
them as tests like hey here instead of
in front of the bonfire here can you
solve this in 20 minutes you know so so
the good news is you're already learning
the sort of stuff that you're going to
need for these interviews for the most
part and we just want to give you
additional practice at it so I wanted to
show you very quickly Oh data
visualization is very hot I mean it's
like white hot why would you include
data visualization in a full static
JavaScript development series of
challenges or curriculum because data
visualization is becoming so important
to virtually every company they need to
be able to visualize data just having
this huge spreadsheet is simply not
enough for most of them it's becoming
kind of a core developer skill being
able to visualize these data and you
don't need to learn a new language or
any real fancy tools I mean d3 is simply
a library a JavaScript library that will
allow you to build things like this so
this is a code pen built by jeff's
torbeck one of our most prolific campers
he works I think full-time at Chase
Manhattan Bank as a web developer but he
also finds time magically to contribute
and and this is a meteor map a map of
all the meteor strikes that we've
recorded and you can even mouse over
them and you can see like the mass of
the meteor aight i guess meteorite if it
hits the grip you can see the name of it
you can see a bunch of other data the
time and importantly you can see the
magnitude as visualized by the size of
the circle so this is the kind of data
visualization like I can immediately
just look at this and say like wow there
have been a lot of meteor strikes you
know kind of in
heartland of the United States and some
of them have been quite big compared to
the typical ones and then so you know
that and there have been a lot of meteor
strikes in the ocean I don't know how we
pick up on those you know and and you
know so this is the kind of thing that
you'll be building you'll take a data
set whether we host data on free coke
camp which you can access or data gov
i'll just show you what that looks like
and i'm going to go ahead and take this
link and throw it in the chat if anybody
wants to play with it so data gov is
another wonderful arm resource the US
government has made available it's just
public data sets on all kinds of
different things so you can grab a data
set from these basically what you'll be
doing is you'll you'll practice data
engineering which is the art of taking
data and kind of shoehorning it into a
state where it can be visualized and
potentially creating ways of storing
data and grabbing new data as it becomes
available and stashing it somewhere
where you can retrieve it for the
purpose of visualizing later and and
we'll even be covering some basic data
science principles and things like that
as part of the curriculum as part of our
Theory curriculum which I would like to
hand over to talk about a little bit
Brianna will be talking a little bit
about that but right now what I'd like
to do is have st. Peter talk about the
improvements to our JavaScript
curriculum st. Peter would you like to
take over I'm going to make you the
presenter okay doke
okay let's see here which is the correct
screen that's the Kirk screen okay uh
let's see here so I've been obviously
spending a little bit of time in the
help rooms helping on people with
bonfires and everybody points and uh so
while I was doing that I I found that
there were what i would consider some
sort of critical gaps in our curriculum
and based on that experience and some
conversations that I had with with
Berkeley and Quincy when I came down for
are the kind of birthday celebration I
ended up mocking up this list of sort of
proposed new waypoints and so this is
really kind of a complete overhaul of
the basic JavaScript refresh so I'm
rewriting almost all of the basic
JavaScript waypoints to some degree or
another uh then I'm adding about 60
neway points that are basically just
going to fill in some gaps that we have
in the curriculum and then i'm i'm
adding this idea of what they're sort of
provisionally called checkpoints so one
of the pieces of feedback that we got
pretty regularly is that when you
complete the JavaScript curriculum when
you go into the bonfires is like oh my
god what do I do there's this blank page
in front of me and I don't know what to
do so we want to kind of ease that
transition and we're going to do that by
having more blank page challenges
actually in the waypoints and so they'll
be kind of like bonfires or maybe a
bonfire light and they will be closely
coupled to the material that has
immediately preceded them so and we'll
talk about variables and variable
assignment and then we'll have some sort
of checkpoint that has you using that
information and then we'll talk about
strings and and the various things you
can do with strings and how strings are
immutable at accessing strings and then
we'll have a checkpoint that
specifically uses the information that
you've just learned
so where we're going to have a little
bit more chunking going on there's going
to be more of a sort of concrete
subsections to our to our curriculum and
while we're starting with the basic
JavaScript I imagine we're going to end
up going through and refreshing most of
the content in this way to have these
sort of mini zip lines or mini bonfires
so it isn't such a shock when you
actually get to the live content or when
you get to where you're suddenly faced
with a with a blank page so i can show
you a little bit of the work that I've
done them maybe halfway through adapting
this curriculum so you can see you know
just gone through and done a bunch of
rewrites as so just simple things now
we'll have an instructions section so
it's really clear what it is that that
you're expected to do in the challenge
or in the Waypoint have a little bit
more explanation with we're talking
about having some let's see here where's
the assignment variable assignment will
have these Italo size things when you
mouse over them or when you click on
them will pop up like a definition
window so we have sort of definitions in
line for people they're not necessarily
familiar with the terminology or
technology but then you don't have to
click on them so we don't have to make
our descriptions really large for for
the lay user you know or for four
experts and then so you can just see on
the right here this is the child genetic
and big thanks to to Ben McMahon and to
Nathan Tara kilobyte who helped me get
this thing up and running so it
simplifies simplifies the creation of
these so we can actually see let's see
or choose challenge and this is the
storing values with the equal operator
and so we can see what the raw thing
looks like previously we had to edit a
JSON file which is a little bit ugly so
what you see here I can actually go and
make a change look a change just hit the
Save button here
refresh my local and there it is and so
if you are interested by the way in
making Corrections challenges or you
actually want to created create new
challenges the challenge ematic
authoring tool is available it's still a
little buggy right now but definitely
usable by normal humans okay I think
that is all I've got excellent thank you
so much for X that you know the
challenge of magic is a huge
breakthrough in making it easier to
contribute to freako camps challenges
and we hope that all of you are able to
take a look at it because it's our
community our open source community
that's creating these challenges they're
like I created a few of them early on
like a creative HTML and the jQuery ones
but like those are going to continue to
evolve and I don't know if any of the
actual stuff I've written is even there
I just laid like a very basic scaffold
and Rex is carrying the torch and a
whole lot of other campers are just
picking up different components of the
curriculum and focusing time and energy
on them in our hope is that we can just
have this really rich collection of
thousands of waypoints and on that note
another type of challenge that we want
to have that will help you so just a
quick aside the waypoints are completely
optional you don't need to complete them
in order to earn the certifications and
the hikes which we're about to talk
about are also completely optional the
waypoints teaching you kind of the
practical how-to of coding and the goal
of the hikes is to teach you more of the
theory behind why things work the way
they do and give you kind of a mental
framework for imagining what's going on
inside the computer and understanding a
lot of the concepts and terminology
you're going to hear a software
engineers throw around when you're in
the workplace so with that I'd like to
hand it over to berkeley and Brianna
to talk about hikes and Berkeley I'm
going to make you presenter
okay so Berkeley should you should see a
screen team all right and firstly gets
his screen set up I'll go ahead and talk
a little bit about what the hikes are
they are just short little videos if you
guys have watched the monthly meetings
on switch before you probably seen us
talk about them they're really short
like three minutes Matt and the point of
these videos is to just cover one topic
at a time and really just give you a
basic idea get the point and then move
on so right now they're mostly are
focusing on basic computer science
concepts but in the future I would love
for other people to contribute and make
their own hikes they don't have to be me
making them it can be anybody just like
there's a lot of people making the way
point on mass design engineering
anything really that it's relevant to
web development at that moment is an
awesome idea for a hike as long as it's
something that can be well explained
it's just one point you can get the
point is that's wonderful brooke Lee are
you able to actually click in and show
what one looks like
okay Berkeley we can't hear you by the
way berkeley if you're muted Berkeley
you may be muted by default when you
join hold on why not hear me yeah we can
hear you know haha alright cool so I'll
saying this is gonna be a very short
demo it's a very simple concept each
hike has a video associated with it and
transcript the video plays here right in
the browser so in this one is the
computer basics you don't just turn the
audio goes off here you can see my
crappy internet it's trying to load the
video and we just once you watch the
video i read the transcripts you can
move on to the questions here it's a
very simple true or false questions true
oh and if you get it wrong it'll give
you a quick tip false and then I'll move
it on to the next question so still a
little buggy we need some changes last
night that brought some things but the
concept is pretty solid and as brianna
said we want to have hikes on all kinds
of concepts brianna is making them on
kind of computer science fundamentals
and computer engineering fundamentals we
want to cover software engineering
fundamentals agile development
methodology product management project
management user experience design user
interface design visual design
mathematics and and data science
principles statistics data visualization
principles like basically everything
that doesn't directly involve coding
that would be useful to know is ripe for
using our hikes challenge type and I
will say that the goal of hikes is not
to give you some you know authority
perspective on something but rather to
give you a very mild acquaintance with
it so when somebody says for example
like oh I think we need
to do a spike here on this project you
know that that means oh that means
something like they don't want to build
the test and they just want to go an
experiment first and then see where that
leads and then decide whether to do the
tests that's like an agile term so what
we want to do with the hikes is
basically just have a whole lot of
chunks that are basically you can just
watch them while you're on the subway
while you're on the bus and it'll
basically be the the key free code camp
mobile experience now we do want to
actually make it easier to code on
mobile and we're making efforts to make
it to where it's easier to code and
complete freako camp challenges on your
mobile phone and that's that's a work in
progress as with our offline mode which
we're still working on to where you can
basically complete free code camp
offline you know we would love for the
new renew extremely inexpensive
raspberry PI's to be able to be loaded
up with all the frico camps waypoints
and all of free coke camps hikes and
just you know like a five dollar device
you can plug it into anything and work
through free coke in like that that
could be possible within the next six or
eight months a lot of this is just
constrained by how much help we have
from our community because we have like
so many different priorities and we only
have so much time but what Briana is
doing she's she's an experienced teacher
she's digesting these concepts down into
these short videos if you have an
expertise in any of the subjects I I
mentioned earlier you know design
engineering mathematics and you're
interested in creating some hikes and
you have you know a decent camera it
doesn't have to be great and a
whiteboard and can do some practice and
get up in front of a white board and
record them just let us know and and we
have a chat room specifically for
discussing hikes which I'll just paste
into the chat get er dot I am / free
code camp / hikes and brianna is pretty
active in there and you accuse the
authority on
hikes I I will defer to her on ideas for
how to make the hikes better and and
everything so definitely ask her
questions if you're curious about that
Thank You Brooklyn you Brianna um next I
wanted to introduce a as I said the the
newest member of free coke camps core
team his name is a barista and he is
currently in the Netherlands as he said
earlier originally from Venezuela and he
is a data scientist statistician he
worked previously as an analyst and now
he's free coke camps resident data
scientists and we've given him access to
all of our data and he's pouring through
it and doing some analyses on it so
evaristo I'm going to make you presenter
and II barista is going to talk a little
bit about himself and some of the
insights he's discovered oh and you're
already presenter evaristo take it away
we you'll need to admit yourself every
step every so are you still connected
okay then your UV yes we can hear you
can you hear me now yes we can verify
well first of all thank you thank you
for the data science title of the well I
questioned myself a little bit more than
the data analyst I think that the
science is a huge trend and I like it
but uh I preferred you to big mothers
with this forum bovis and I prefer to
consume myself of that unless in the
first place how do I have some soul idea
that a scientist Assad science to that
anyway and my experience goes in
different sectors as well so I have been
working a for a public sector 44 private
sector for NGOs and the Academy in the
past and the last key fob they had lost
her relationship to online market
research and since then I have been
really real time data analyst that
analysis and the things related to
marketing also operations but one of the
things that restrain me alone my career
a lot is because I had been half a kind
of interest in the full data life cycle
one of these are happy to stray me a lot
is the lack of rehab personal skills in
the in manipulating all the things and
getting everything you know in one place
and I said that I decided the point that
I wanted not to do that anymore I wanted
to know more about things like managing
the data from beginning to end and
that's a one of the reason why why i am
just part of a free coke and a wife that
brought me here
because the fullest tag and the back end
program that they have in the first
place when I came here I started to just
to have kind of discussion with Berkeley
and unclean see about about how data
could impact positively the freakin
activities and they came to me with a
nice surprise they have plans for the
future to make the open public to make
the data public to everyone and they
found that immediately the data science
room and I have been really active in
the data science room since I can silent
the factor of moderator of this food and
and we have been Rex and brightly have
been actively participating in the room
as well in the past and well maybe i'm
not sure if you are seeing this but you
can see for example the thing that we
have been job and i have been just
policy publishing some kind of weekly
reports about what we have been doing
about activities regarding or related to
that aside the data science data
analysis in this in this room well a
couple of things that we have done
either inside the data science room aura
or as an independent job that i can
mention are two things for example I
recently was doing an analysis of the
big they supply
in the goal pen and we made a kind of
estimation of the time that the Pens are
done and maybe I kind of estimation of
how popular they are and we can see in
this graph I'm not sure if you are seen
it but we can see in this graph for
example Randall Cobb machines one of the
most popular ones take less time while
the assignment gang known as only the
less popular perhaps because it's new
tweeting the written comparing to the
brass ones and also how much average can
take the realization of the food project
in terms of days and these are two bands
between let's say about two and six days
approximately that the people are just
working on this all things that we have
been join as well is I personally make
an index of the siblings in ink open
that you can check and see for example
as they can users are benchmarks to
compare let's say different projects for
router or or if you want your interested
employees they are using react only you
can also see a list of available project
that are marked our target with the
react tag and as a byproduct of all the
abilities we are doing and generally or
independently to the room is a roll
rusev rule where a top 100 which I
believe is one of the most interesting
tools so far let's say in this sector
which you can see also personally can
I can suggest to use as well as a tool
to compare a benchmark in your projects
with the leader want to see how you can
improve your your project as well and
that will be kind of additional juice of
these kind of tools and rule will also
make an interesting analysis of how for
example a is the distribution of the
people who argues a rancor in the in the
in the data set that database he had he
noticed for example that there are only
a few we have asked who are scoring more
than 1,000 points and a lot of people
who are still just doing a lot of their
effort to try to get there so and this
is kind of tainted I we have been
working there and now since so since the
time I was in NC Nazis a while after why
we Berkeley and finally she approached
me and they suggest me to continue doing
the things inside the core team but i
believe the activities that we are doing
also in there in the in the data science
room we continue in the future so i hope
to see students older all of you they're
great and I think that's my presentation
right we hope thank you very much every
so so as you can see every so is not
only diving through the data but he's
building apps that you can use to
consume the data yourself and play with
it and that's one of the beautiful
things about a lot of the technology
that we're using is we can basically
have data pipelines and we can set up
groups that go and get fetch fresh data
so it's it's it's not like an academic
paper where you you have a data set and
you write about it and there it is like
everybody can read your your academic
paper no it's organic its growing its
evolving and it's it's constantly up to
date so these are the kinds of things to
get away she do yes we should have to
add that I have been learning this stuff
in precalc up as well I before coming
here I didn't know anything about apps
anything about no GS and this is part of
my learning and I think I want to share
that with you and I think is a lot
potential if we if you are dedicated and
you are interested to to to to learn
things and uh put in practice thank you
so much every so and and thank you for
all your hard work with these data
visualizations we're just scratching the
surface we have so much data i mean it's
it's incredible for example um this is
going to sound like I'm like we're
boasting but but on Thursday we had
20,000 people use free code camp and one
day and I mean that's just a huge amount
of data for us to go through and like
try to understand like what caused you
know so many people to use free coke
camp on thursday all days like is that
going to be is there a pattern you know
we can kind of detect these things the
different rhythms of people's weeks
there are so many different things that
we could analyze we're just generating
you know gigabytes of data every month
so the last thing I'd like to do before
we go to questions is hand it back over
to Rex and Rex and awesome any route in
in get ur on ur rude argh agarwal who's
based in Singapore they have been
working together on getting free coke
camps new wiki live so I'm going to make
you presenter again Rex
ok
that should be the right screen there
okay uh so let's just talk about a
little bit of the back around here so I
don't maybe a month month and a half ago
we had a bunch of problems with spam on
our wiki and because of that we had to
move the live editing of the wiki off of
the site and instead move it to a
separate repo so if you want to
contribute to the wiki wiki you need to
go to github com freako camp / wiki let
me put that in the chat here and you'll
need to basically submit a pull request
against this but we weren't really
satisfied with the interface that's on
just this sort of the standard wiki
interface and so what we've done is use
this tool called Gatsby and this is
really a annaroo did all the work on
setting this up what it does is it takes
all of the markdown files and it
converts it into sort of a real website
like a static HTML website and so all of
the content that we currently have on
the wiki can be automatically synced &amp;amp;
comes over here we still have a little
bit of work to do in terms of theming it
and adding some sort of search
functionality right now you just have to
use ctrl f but you'll see that the it's
actually significantly faster then then
the wiki because it's a react based site
you just click through these things real
quick and just click around see
everything that we've got here like I
said we're going to add some add some
search features to it so you can just
type and have it searched will normalize
the the look and feel so the work that
we just did recently on and I wrote some
scripts that enables us to essentially
do a one click deploy that it pulls down
all the current wiki information turns
it into the web pages and pushes it live
this is current this is actually live
right now on the beta site and let me
put this in the chat so everybody can
come and take a look at it keep in mind
it is a beta there's probably going to
be some broken links
internal links are mostly working but
not entirely working so feel free to
take a look thank you very much what I
got and thank you very much anirudh or
unnie as we call him uh for for building
all these things very exciting so as you
can see we've got a lot in store for all
of us campers there's a lot to look
forward to as of January first we hope
to have the curriculum the the new
challenges which will be five new base
jumps and ten new zip lines we hope to
have those live and the new
certifications and everything Ryan mom
who's in the chat room is working on the
design for the new certifications the
new certificate design so that should
all be live by January first or maybe
even earlier if we get it done we're not
trying to do this big reveal it'll be
ready as soon as we feel comfortable as
soon as it's stable we're going to push
it and you can start working through it
and now things are going to change a
little bit for example the what's
currently the full stack development
certification track on frequent camp
we're going to make some modifications
to that and that'll probably be within
the next few days and hopefully we'll
get the hikes live within the next few
days as well and some other minor things
like that but we definitely could use
your help Jeff's torbeck is contributing
that nice map based d3 visualization
we'd love to have help with other d3
visualizations just to show you what d3
is capable of I'm just going to go to
the I mean it's just an incredible
library the guy who built it is a genius
but you can see like these are some of
the different visualizations I'll just
show you one real quick like this is one
of my favorites like European debt so
euro debt crisis you can
open it and you can play with it and I
guess this one is an interactive is it
let me find one that's interactive one
second that's called a chord chart I
don't want to spend too much time trying
to find it but but you can see here like
zoomable sunburst so let's see if this
is interactive colossally to be
interactive okay so you can kind of
interact with it but it's pretty cool
let the size versus the count so you can
represent data in all these novel ways
like you don't have to put pie charts
and bar charts in your in your school
projects anywhere you can put like cool
interactive visualizations so let me I
want to drop the link to this in the
chat so you all can check check out some
of these items so basically creating
these d3 visualizations is just choosing
a visualization that you think is well
suit like the first thing you should do
is choose the data set and then you
should choose a visualization you think
is well-suited for it and we're going to
actually recommend specific data sets
and specific visualizations but it'll be
open-ended you know you'll you'll have
some flexibility to choose like your own
data set or even create your own data
set if you have like if you're a teacher
and you have students or if your lawyer
and you have clients that you can
anonymize and you want to create
visualizations based on them you'll be
able to do that so at this point I want
to open it up to questions so my
question is would somebody Brianna or
Rex brooke Lee could you all kind of
watch the chat and pull out what you
think are good questions and stack them
up and all five of us can jump in and
answer any given question
so actually there's this question here
that I that I wanted a specifically
answer we've been discussing so let's
see user subah hang was asking how can
they contribute to free code camp
without sacrificing recording pace and I
can't tell you necessarily how to do it
without sacrificing your pace because
I've essentially ground to a halt on
moving through the curriculum but there
are definitely small tasks that are
available to you I if you go to the
issues page on the free code camp Gator
issues page you can look for help wanted
tags and all of those are very small
tasks that are essential air are too
trivial true trivial for the issue
moderators to handle things like
correcting typos or correcting tap
correcting tests that are in that are
actually you know part of the site so if
you find the typo you can actually make
a correction yourself and submit a pull
request against the site there's
information in the wiki about how to do
a pull request if you just search on
pull request so that's the sort of thing
that you can do in a half an hour or an
hour that shouldn't really take away
from your learning and personally I
found I've learned a huge amount about
how to use git and just sort of that
open source practices creating pull
requests and things like that I found it
to be hugely educational so I see it
well it is a little bit of a sideline to
the material I think that's a lot to be
learned there another question that
several people have asked that i'll go
ahead and tackle if that's cool is um or
berkeley maybe you could talk about this
why did we choose react instead of
angular 1 which is the current rank
angular iteration or angular 2 which is
the spec that will eventually become a
new form of angular sure react it's just
a much simpler API so much easier
concept to learn and to teach and it's a
lot more fun to coding as well having
done angular for about a year before i
started doing react i can definitely
tell you this a lot more fun to write
react code it also lets us do things
like server-side rendering and make all
of you go campin isomorphic app which
you cannot do currently with anger one i
don't know if you can do a thing or two
that's something they're even trying to
support another reason is we we think
that there's a critical mass behind
react if you look at you know Facebook
created reactant and they're very active
in its maintenance a lot of projects are
adopting react I mean the biggest the
biggest recent announcement is that
WordPress is essentially moving to node
and react they just move their admin
panel so far but they definitely plan to
move everything else over eventually if
the community accepts it and it's
important to put wordpress in
perspective like it is literally like a
quarter of the internet like a quarter
of website traffic is to web to
wordpress based websites so i mean
that's pretty incredible like a lot of
e-commerce companies a lot of blogs a
lot of general-purpose websites are
powered and in part at least by
wordpress so if react is going to be you
know a substantial swath of the internet
you can bet there will be a lot of react
related employment opportunities and you
can bet that there will be a lot of
people that know how to use react which
are like those are the two important
things like a huge install base and a
huge number of people that know how to
use it that's what keeps technology
alive and sustains it now angular is
really popular it's much more popular
than react right now but we think that
react will rapidly catch up and and
angular 2 is essentially a full reset
there they're like literally throwing
everything out and starting from scratch
the only thing that's going to be the
same is the name angular because it
already has a lot of brand recognition
but it's going to be a complete reboot
of angular yes we have a pretty
interesting question here will we be
introducing es6 es tu 2015 into the
curriculum and the answer is yes
we will shortly make it usable as well
right now you can't actually pass you
can't actually use it unless it's
supporting the browser in the feature
you're specifically using is used in the
browser but we will be adding Babylon
Uslan to make these things possible in
all browsers so I want to chime in a
little bit unreacted if you if you want
to know why why react just go to the
beta wiki site and see how quick and
responsive that is that's why react it
is really fast we had a question here
what's the prerequisite to learning
react java javascript you know
javascript that's the prerequisite yeah
another question oh did you want to save
him oh is it though I seem Cazale asked
I found many online sources teaching web
development will free code can't be
sufficient enough that I won't need to
go to other sources to fill in gaps and
actually wanted to talk a little bit
about that an answer is is no no one
website is going to be able to be
everything for everyone I think that the
key for the for free code camp is that
we give a solid structure and a linear
path for learning the material but
you're absolutely going to be using
other sites before learning more detail
on specific topics or just for reference
material I don't think we can be
everything to everyone so I mean don't
don't feel like you're cheating on free
code camp if you're going to another
site you know we definitely want to have
as much information as possible and and
that's the sort of thing that I'm that
I'm working on so if you see gaps you
know let us know and Quincy did you have
thoughts about that I mean it's
important to note that free code camp is
moving a heck a lot faster than
everybody else and and the reason for
that is we're open source we have this
huge community of people that are
contributing to free code camp I mean
it's like like Wikipedia at some point
they hit this kind of tipping point
where they had so many contributors and
Wikipedia was just getting better and
better every single day like we we feel
like we're getting to that
and that that hopefully in the near
future free code camp will be as
exhaustive a resource as Wikipedia is
for you know non-structured knowledge
free free coconut will be that that
exhaustive for structured learning
specifically coding at least at first
we'd like to eventually cover other
things as well but javascript is just
such a killer like complicated skill
that pretty much everybody has to learn
now that we wanted to focus on that
first so so yes please do use external
resources in fact i'll send you a link
right here to additional resources we
recommend but we hope that you'll use
free code camp is kind of your core
resource and then a little guide your
learning overall and that you'll be
using these other resources as
supplements to free code camp because
our goal is to create the the project's
first and foremost I have really solid
projects where you can apply your skills
and of course you're going to be using
documentation you're going to be reading
other books and watching YouTube videos
and doing online courses through
Coursera and EDX and all those things
too I think that's good like any kind of
learning is good but when I would be sad
to see is people freaking out because
the project for too hard and going and
doing something easier because there are
no shortcuts there's no like easy path
to learning the code it will be hard
Rafael rough face to a to add a really
good question Berkeley Raphael by the
way is the core maintainer of our wiki
and we are really grateful that he's
helped out with that and contains Delp
out he said since SAS will be added is
there a chance to also add an HTML
processor like Jade or others that are
supported by code pin Berkeley do you
want to tackle that I mean it is
possible is this something that we
should do I don't necessarily think it's
big deals among HTML templates and since
we are we doing react for views
I don't see how it would add to the
curriculum I mean we'll be doing jsx dev
like you'll be building thing component
web components in jsx so you won't I
mean you could use Jade within jsx but
it would be kind of awkward Jade's great
we use it we use it in our code base
you're welcome to use it like we don't
want to tell you don't use different
tools but at the same time we want free
coke camps challenges and like what we
teach our way points to be like the data
has not the nice to haves well the
Quincy I think you've made the point
that a programmer should be shaped like
a tea right have some some wide shallow
knowledge on a lot of topics but then
focus and have really deep knowledge on
other topics and so we've tried to
choose we're essentially curating for
you what are the best or what are one of
the most popular or most valuable skills
that you learn again not necessarily for
today but for tomorrow's job market so
that's why we're choosing react and
dropping angular that's why why we're
going with SAS rather than then well
gosh there's a dozen other different
ones just what we see are as being the
most valuable or the most relevant for
today and for the near future a couple
quick questions I saw from the crowd
first of all donut shall pointed out
that he doesn't think that my statement
about I go to being a complete rewrite
is necessarily accurate um that could
very well be the case by the way I've
got like tornado alarms going off around
me they go off at noon every Saturday in
Oklahoma City so I hope that's not
terribly annoying meal I'll try to cover
one microphone um but what I was you
know can you hear that yeah you can hear
it okay I'm just going to mute myself
and all that you all take questions for
now
sure it's any interesting questions
there was a there was a question I don't
know if if it's something that we can
answer freely but about how many free
coke camp students have gotten coding
jobs is direct result of doing FCC I
don't know if we have hard numbers on
that it's more than a dozen at least we
don't know hard numbers on that because
we don't actually like generally we
don't concern ourselves with actually
matchmaking campers with employers so
the basically we only know about the
ones who've told us but it's probably
more than 100 at this point um it's a
lot of people and you'll see it on
reddit you'll see it on Facebook people
just say hey I got a job so that's one
of the things we don't have a real good
way of tracking because people just go
out and get jobs before they complete
our curriculum which is a good problem
to have i guess that people don't that
people are able to go out and get jobs
before they complete our curriculum but
we hope that they will come back in and
finish so they can be a little bit
stronger in web dev
I have here a couple of questions what
is from Maddie hit-girl about a having
our own group try to monitor the
progress of the members I guess you're
talking about Peggy turns as well well
in principle a belief I to know what
kind of group do you want to do have and
I I think we can help you with this and
and in general you can also have an idea
of the activity of short of how a
participation of the people in eternity
cuz either over that napkin I API and
that answer also part of the question of
someone else asking about four and salt
better about how we go to data yes we
were using an IPA IP IP IP I poor for
forgetting part of the data and also we
do to a responsible scrapping of copÃ¡n
data and as well as a free coke and data
I hope you say another thing all that
very quickly is that to her question um
we definitely plan to have like the
ability to follow people and create kind
of a local leader board where just
within your classroom or within your
coding club you can compare one another
that's a feature that we plan to build
for a while and we still plan to build
that we just haven't had time if anybody
wants to help out with that we'd love
help and I guess I'll mentioned you know
you if if you have a local campsite
that's a great way to meet people that
are really doing the same things that
you are you can meet up meet up with
people and share tips do live pair
programming and if you don't have a
local group it's actually really easy to
to start went up I didn't start my group
but I did start doing the meetings for
them and it you know it honestly takes
like an hour out of my week to do the
scheduling and then all I have to do is
show up and we've just had some great
turnout so really it's you know meet
interesting people there was a question
here from foz bot what happens to people
who already have a full stack cert and
light of the new curriculum so that's a
very good question there's not really
any fair way to deal with this because
we're changing our curriculum so there I
think are 25 people who have the the
full stack certification and I'm going
to be contacting them personally and
apologizing to them for the
inconvenience but basically we want
things to be fair that full stack
certification is going to become a
back-end development certification and
the full stack certification is getting
promoted to kind of this over
certification that includes completion
of the data visualization certification
and of the 800 hours of nonprofit
projects so that's it's going to be the
highest kind of like you know black belt
so to speak of free coke camp so again
if you're one of those people that are
affected I apologize kind of
the price of progress we we are
intending to do these take quick action
with these things and we're like 13 14
months into free coke camp we've learned
a lot during that period some of the
things we've learned our that definitely
more practice is better we see like
every time we add new stuff to the
curriculum the nonprofit projects are
better and better like it's amazing how
good they are now it's just ridiculous
because people have gotten so much
practice and the way you get good at
things as you practice like at the end
of the day it's all about practice so we
wanted the length in the curriculum so
we I will reach out to those people um
the other thing is we're adding a 500
hour or I'm sort of five API related
challenges to the back-end development
certification that we're going to ask
that those people do as well so
everybody like the goal is for everybody
to complete everything and not to have
these kind of like people who got like
suboptimal experiences that have these
same certifications because I mean like
you've all been there right like when
you go to college and your curriculum
gets harder and harder every single year
and yet the people like like your
grandfather's like oh when I went to
college it was really easy why can't you
do everything in like four years you
know but in practice things got way more
complicated and things are constantly
getting more complicated so that said
please do not think that we're going to
make a habit of significantly increasing
our the length of our curriculum I'm
hoping that this is the last time we
change the length of the curriculum and
we just focus on being selective about
what we what we focus on so that we can
try to fit everything into that length
of time which by the way is about the
equivalent of a master's degree you know
if you go if you go get a masters degree
the amount of time you're going to spend
in classroom and outside of classroom
working on your thesis and everything is
about you know 2,000 hours some other
questions that were asked alica asked is
freako camp a good complement to you
city front end nanodegree I have a lot
of respect for you dasa tea and I used
them when I was first learning like they
had some great Python resources I'm not
sure I haven't looked at their front end
development certification or their their
their front end nanodegree recently but
i would say that they're probably not
going to give you anywhere near as much
practices we will they're probably gonna
be focusing a little bit more on theory
than practice so i would say that yes
free code camp should be an excellent
complement to the front end nanodegree
another question subah Hong asked um and
and anybody who wants to answer this can
answer it I'm not going to try to answer
i have found grunt gulp power and yeoman
to be hugely beneficial in developing a
solid workflow isn't free coke ain't
going to touch on these at all they
would they are not development but
tightly connected and hugely beneficial
so let me chime in on that so uh when i
did my one and only base jump before i
got distracted by a help and on free
coke camp I used the yeoman generator
and what I found is that for a beginner
even though I had a bunch of lamp stack
experience they're just incredibly
overwhelming there's such a just a
breadth and depth of content to be had
with those and I actually think that the
move to the you build it yourself
Clementine j/s stack is much better for
a learning environment I think once
you've once you've built a couple of
projects with that then yes you could go
and use grunt or go pour any of those
development tools but I think you have
to establish a foundation first
otherwise you're just going to be
flailing around I think I spent two
months working on my base jump just
because there was such a steep learning
curve to all that other material so it's
not that we're not teaching them it's
that by the time you're ready to use
them you should be able to teach
yourself I agree and and also like
Brianna didn't say
but I think that showing you basic
things about these additional desktop
tools like your local environment tools
will be something that will be within
the purview of the hikes I mean I'd love
to see a hike about grunt for example or
gulp or some of these other tools yeoman
generator these are these are kind of
like the equivalent of power tools like
you wouldn't go to a woodshop class and
immediately grab the power tools they're
gonna they're going to start you off
with like the more basic tools noobs to
ninjas asked what are you used for
continuous integration roughly we're now
we're using Travis CI and my personal
projects I you circle see I there was a
question here about have we done any
data analysis on the effectiveness of
pair programming as a learning strategy
the comparison of our students so
obviously we don't we don't really have
a direct line to our students we mostly
just have anecdotal notes and then I
think there's been plenty of studies
done on pair program that shows how
effective it is in terms of producing
better code and just on a personal level
I spent about four hours yesterday
evening working with ani on developing
scripts essentially pair programming and
I have to say that one of the most
positive programming experiences that
I've had in a long time I mean I enjoy
writing code but working with a pier
where you just have sort of this
complement of knowledge going on and you
don't have syntax there's because
somebody else's effectively looking over
your shoulder everything gets caught
immediately uh I I think that it's an
incredible learning experience to work
just side by side with somebody where
you're you know literally or
figuratively sharing a keyboard so I
don't know I don't know how to prove it
other than wow I loved it and you can do
research I mean you can you can search
the web for further commentary on pair
programming
and as 20 somebody who says how do you
know when you're ready to pair program
and the answer is yes you are you are
always ready to pair program even if
you're just learning the new stuff you
know even if you're doing waypoints
you're ready to pair program I guarantee
it it's it is a collaborative and
learning environment I agree so does
anybody there are some other questions I
think we can probably take questions for
another five or eight minutes or so um
and then we would like to have somebody
come on the stream and afterward I don't
know is Septimus in a stream afterward
he was streaming previously he might be
able to pick it up so so everyone just
kind of I'm combing through the chat how
do you how do you see reddit being used
by campers excellent question I'll
answer that oh so camper news is our
link sharing site it's a collaborative
filtering tool that we've built we're
going to go and react if I it and
continue to use it for reddit there's
this thing called self posts and what we
found was Treecko camps like news wasn't
really getting a lot of comments so we
just ripped the comments out completely
most of them were like great post.thanks
and things like that which we're cool I
mean thanks it's nice that people do
that but it's not really adding a lot of
informational value so what we wanted to
do was just reopen reddit which has
great you know it has a karma system
it's got all this you know moderation
capability and it's it's got like a
discovery mechanism so people can
discover it I'm just going to pop up the
subreddit right now there we can see
what it looks like it's just our free
code camp you see we styled it a little
bit and you can go through and see
people just ask questions so the idea is
this is for sharing thoughts and asking
questions and then everybody else can
chime in and talk about it the goal is
for us to so we have our community
occupies many places
right we've got a twitch of course where
we love to stream live coding and we we
have these monthly summits we have
twitter which I man the Twitter and if
you tweet I'll retweet a lot of projects
the campers build that's the main
function of Twitter these days it's just
showcase campers work we have facebook
camp sites we have 600 different
Facebook groups in 600 cities around the
world and people come together there to
talk about things going on in their
local community like hackathons Tech
Talks and of course getting together for
these coffee and code events which are
really picking up in some areas then in
addition to Facebook we wanted to have
like a place where you could literally
talk to the entire community because
campsites are great because you're just
talking to people locally but if you
wanted to ask a question just to the
entire community we figured the suburb
it would be a really good place to do
that and if you have like some
observation or if you have some triumph
you want to share with the community
like maybe you've got a job or maybe you
just got like a really good contract as
a freelancer you can come in and share
that and people can jump in and ask
questions because what we find is just
there's this tremendous desire to know
but this is such a rich in open field
like they're so little it and it's not
an established thing teaching yourself
to code has been going on since the dawn
of coding if you look at the statistics
like stackoverflow did a 2015 developer
survey i'll show you like most
developers learn to code themselves they
don't go to they don't get computer
science degrees or software engineering
degrees a lot of them do and that
certainly helps but a lot of them are
you know people that have like
accounting degrees people that have
finance degrees people that started at
different field of Engineering like
rexin and locally for example both have
engineering backgrounds but it's
mechanical engineering and electrical
engineering
and not software engineering but if you
look at the the coding like the jobs in
STEM fields the so-called STEM fields
science technology engineering
mathematics sixty percent of them are
coding jobs so we're seeing this huge
influx of people from other engineering
professions and other science
professions that are learning the code
as well but you can see this chart which
i'll just post the link to the entire
survey which is fascinating i recommend
everybody take a look at it this is how
people learn to code they learn to code
on their own for the most part and a lot
of them learn on the job and some of
them have formal education as well and
some of them just do online courses and
the you know a small amount of them also
do coding boot camps which which can be
useful for some people as well if you
need a little additional motivation so
so yeah I guess the original question
I've kind of lost a lot of what it was
but the point is reddit is a great place
to come and talk about what you're
thinking and share your thoughts and I
know reddit can sometimes be a very
aggressive place we're going to do our
best to keep it relatively up-tempo just
like we're doing with twitch twitch
could be considered to be somewhat of a
hostile environment lots of tools and
stuff but I'm like extremely grateful
that we've got these excellent
moderators and we've got just this great
community that is very positive and
supportive and people constantly come to
free coke camp and say like oh I'm so
glad that you know free cooking has this
awesome chat room because I rc's you
know a bunch of people that are like
rtfm and say things like that whenever
you ask a question so
see does anybody else have but I think
there are a lot of questions here that
I'm just going through and looking at we
see there is a question about the Jews
of what was that sorry data science
topics in the future and tensorflow
project if there is going to be any
chance in the future to use it or if
there is a plan from free coke and to to
get deeper into machine learning and
data science the questions by Ali cos it
will probably be a subject that we just
touch on in our hikes um where we we
explain like what is random forest for
example you know what is train versus
untrained machine learning those kinds
of concepts you have a kind of a good
gestalt of what they mean but not
necessarily not necessarily teach you
everything you need to know about them
like they're there a lot of other
programs that are focused on that and
you know software development and
computer science these are an ocean and
if you try to like drink the entire
ocean you're going to get a very big
stomach ache so what you want to do is
you want to figure out like what
specific parts of the water you want to
drink at least what specific water you
want to drink first that's kind of like
an analogy I'll use I just can add to
allah khair said if you have interesting
data analysis you can show up in the
data science room we are trying to us to
use this room ASAP extra-curricular
place where you can ask questions or
three projects or things that you are
interested in maybe idea in the future
issues to gather all the people who are
interested in things related to data
from less I from back to front end
they can discuss projects together they
can collaborate a second so as an
extracurricular activities great well
are there any last burning questions if
you posted a question before and we
didn't see it for some reason there's
been a lot of chatter in here please
feel free to post to the second time so
Brianna captured a bunch in uh in the
chat in the gotomeeting chap I don't
know if you can see that okay let me pop
it open okay great thank you for
organizing these brown uh okay so do you
want to read some off-screen oh I think
her Mike went down oh there's a yeah
I'll be there very expressive yet great
right so there's one question I can
answer when will the addition to the
basic JavaScript waypoints be going live
and short answer is I don't know what I
finish them probably before the end of
the year and we will have them up on the
beta site prior to them going live so we
can get a first pass down on them let's
see there was a question about let's see
big fan of your curriculum and a plan on
finishing the front-end certificate very
soon last month you said about 200
people finish the front-end course has
the this never changed and at what rate
are people finish finishing with this
certificate good question it's
accelerating um I don't want to pass out
Mongo and do queries live but I'm just a
trick oh you're trying to get it ok cool
so Berkeley will actually have like a
figure for you for the front of
development certification another
question somebody asked Berkeley that we
can look up is what person like how many
people have committed to helping
nonprofits through freako camp commit so
right now we only have two nonprofits in
there we have black girls code and girl
develop it
we're going to be adding more code.org
has reached out to us and wants to be
included in there and they do excellent
work for children some other nonprofits
coderdojo may be involved they also have
like in-person events for K through 12
so we will definitely be expanding the
number of nonprofits you can choose to
donate to but we have quite a few there
was a question here about how can people
higher freq code camp graduates and
we're glad you asked because we have a
free code camp job board link in the
chat there it's enough free camp com /
jobs and did you want to talk more about
that Quincy sure so um we have this is a
really awesome job board that brooke Lee
belt and completely in react so you'll
get to kind of see firsthand how
responsive it is compared to the rest of
free code camp and free coke camp of
course is going to be rewritten and
reacted like and web components and
everything soon so the rest of Franco
camp will be this responsive soon but
basically uh you can post a job here and
a lot of them are in person jobs some of
them are remote okay jobs and rather
than get just a ton of jobs we decided
we wanted very high quality jobs from
serious people so we decided to charge
us like a thousand dollars to post here
so I know just the most expensive job
board on the planet so free coke camp is
simultaneously free for everyone and
then employers if they really want to to
find freako camp candidates that can
come here and post on her job board and
several people have hired through our
job board and and had good positive
experiences so this is very new we're
still trying to figure out how to
promote this to employers as with any
sort of new thing there's always like
this long education process
of teaching people what does it mean
when you hire somebody who's completely
free code camp you know what do these
nonprofit projects signify one of the
things that's been very challenging
about freako campus we're doing so many
things that are completely unprecedented
that no organization has ever done
before and I personally am very proud to
be associated with an organization
that's doing these bold and vicious
things that it has the gall to charge a
thousand dollars for a job posting that
that you know has the gall to provide a
full year long curriculum that's
basically twice as long as any coding
boot camp I think and you know we're
going to continue to be extremely
ambitious we definitely don't want to
lose our ambition because every time
we've been really ambitious in the past
we've all come together it made it
happen so ambition pays off ambition is
is great and we're going to continue to
do moonshots like we've been doing and
know our communities coming together to
to make them possible if you look at a
lot of the things that you know great
projects you know like NASA the Apollo
program if you look at wikipedia if you
look at a lot of other big ambitious
projects over time they've succeeded in
part because they were these big
ambitious goals that really galvanize
people and we think free coding
education for everyone will galvanize
people a lot of people don't realize
this but neat you know what percentage
of people in the US learn computer
science and programming it's about five
percent only about one in 20 people
really like put in time like in a
serious manner within like our K through
12 system and in college to learn these
skills and if you look at China do you
know what percentage of people in China
learn computer science and programming
fundamentals
100-percent the reason that they all
learned that is because the Chinese
government has decided this is a
priority people need to know this this
is a core literacy in the u.s. we
haven't realized that but certain states
are starting to realize that and make
coding education mandatory and you'll
always hear this kind of like these
people pushing back like oh you know not
everybody needs to learn how to code you
even hear a pre-poll that are coding say
it but if you look at the transition
like there are several states where
where software developer is now the most
common job in that state I think I think
it's like Oregon for example and some of
the other city like states on the East
Coast I'll try to find it map of us
software developer trucker I think we
tweeted this out recently okay here it
is I'm just going to show you this like
I don't want to go down a rabbit hole
but a lot of people are like well
they're you know we're gonna we don't
need more software developers it's a
myth or whatever it's not true like in
the future software developers will be
as ubiquitous as accountants they'll be
as you dick ubiquitous as truck drivers
and you can see like you know secretary
used to be one of the most popular jobs
and now you look like in these states
right here software developer so a
software developer here so it is
becoming a major career field it's not
anish boutiques John so I just want
everyone to know that people will need
these skills and they're always going to
be detractors and people saying that you
know that this isn't important or that
is important and a lot of people feel
motivated because it's you know it's
sensational to go out and say these bold
things that are counterintuitive like
why wouldn't you learn software
development
the equal skill but people are out there
saying that so I just want to make sure
that if you all hear those sorts of
things in the news media just understand
that it's people trying to get attention
and all signs point to everybody doing
some sort of programming in their jobs
in the next 30 years or so it's it's
going to be a ubiquitous generally
expected literacy for people just like
being able to read today is considered
you know like you just assume people
will be able to read I think people just
assume that you're going to be sitting
down in front of a computer and you'll
know how to tell it what to do and what
is programming is telling machines what
to do I have that number for you quince
tea yes please so front-end development
certifications we have 30 311 issue 311
if you are one of the proud holders of
the of that certification I want to
offer you an Internet high five high
five okay so seriously that that's great
like that shows you the momentum because
a few weeks ago it was only like 200
something I answered a correr question
about it so it's accelerating another
thing Berkeley if you could look it up
just how many people have committed to
helping to every month contributing a
small amount of money to a non profit
each good question so Berkeley's looking
that up were there any other questions
that you all saw that that you think we
should hit sir I thought there was one
that was kind of interesting and
necrosis asks FCC is good for starters
but what about more experienced people
who build one or two nonprofit projects
on their own and are looking for more is
that something that FCC would is is
interested in working with so I mean
obvious question if you've gone through
freako camps entire curriculum
you can do nonprofit projects if you
haven't gone through our curriculum
you're not going to be able to do or
nonprofit projects like we need you to
establish seriousness before we're
willing to trust you with a non-profit
project because what happens in practice
is busy software developers who think
that like oh I'd love to help a
non-profit jump in and then they're like
oh I don't have time for this anymore
sorry I gotta drop and like if you don't
actually work up and earn the
distinction of like I have earned the
right to be on this non-profit project
then you don't have sufficient you're
not sufficiently vested so we've just
decided like we would love help from
more experienced software engineers who
want to come and participate in our
nonprofit projects but you need to get
the certifications first and you need to
qualify like everybody else now a lot of
experience people are say things like oh
you know freako camps too easy I can do
all this stuff well if it's really easy
to just do it real quick I mean my
experience has been I've given a lot of
my friends who have traditional software
engineering backgrounds they have like a
master's degree in software engineering
or computer science and they've worked
in the field for years I set them down
in front of a zip line or a base-jumping
and it takes some hours I mean they're
not easy for anybody they're designed to
be very rigorous and challenging and
really stretch your mind and if you
don't if you don't have a recent
exposure to all the technology involved
and if you haven't built a you know a
crud app recently or an API recently
it's going to be it's going to be tough
so so a lot of times people just assume
that it's going to be easy because
they've used codecademy or something
like that but we're not like Codecademy
we are like way harder in fact i would
venture to say that we're one of the
hardest resources out there of course if
you go to top coder if you go to Kaggle
if you go to some of these competitive
programming type sites those are going
to be the hardest but we're not trying
to isolate the top 1% we're trying to
bring the 99 percent up to the one
percent level
that's what we want to do so that's why
things have to be hard and people have
to struggle I did and I'll just chime in
so just to reiterate that if you
complete the bonfires zip lines and BASE
jumps that's the only material you have
to complete in order to participate
right all the way points are optional
now that's a non-trivial amount of work
but if you really are as good of a
developer as you say that you are then
it should be straightforward do that
work and does demonstrate your
commitment as Quincy said and I've
posted a more a detailed answer to that
exact question which I get a lot from a
lot of great experience software
engineers we really appreciate your your
willingness and eagerness to help but
it's a whole lot of work to run these
projects and we don't want people
bailing out or only half hearted
committed to them so we have 913 pledged
to come see you 913 so if we do the math
like we assume that like even 913 people
are paying ten dollars a month which i
think is the lowest value or is it 50
dates five so it's like it's 5 10 and 25
so if we assume that 910 people are
donating ten dollars a month I mean
that's almost ten thousand dollars a
month donated to nonprofits I mean this
is substantial and right now a vast
majority that's going to grow develop it
we're going to introduce some other ones
but girl develop is a great organization
and though they're probably able to put
on a lot more events and get a lot of
more women into coding as a result of
this so um we're going to continue to
expand it and you know for those of you
who have committed and are donating um
Bravo hey this is the right thing to do
and it we feel much more comfortable you
taking that money and giving it to a
nonprofit organization that really needs
it to complete their mission all right
any other questions we are we are a
little bit over time
alright so I want to thank everyone for
joining us we are going to take this if
you didn't catch the whole thing we're
going to take this and throw it on
YouTube shortly afterward so I would
like to thank every stow for joining us
from the Netherlands Thank You viverito
Brianna from joining us from champaign
urbana in Illinois rec Schrader for
joining us from Sacramento Metro area at
Berkeley from joining us from San
Francisco we are hopefully going to have
someone come on and stream shortly
afterward okay so somebody is going to
take over the stream afterward so please
stick around watch some live coding I
hope you get a lot of coding in this
weekend I hope you all get to learn a
whole lot of things and fight through
some challenges and if you have time
some recommended reading if you haven't
already read it this is the article that
um that talks a little bit more about
our expanded curriculum which we are
excited to put live as soon as possible
so again thank you all for joining us
have a beautiful Saturday and happy
coding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
