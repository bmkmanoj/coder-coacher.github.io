edition of The X yeah almost one month
again and this time and there are even
more question the last time I think I do
it will be a little bit more quiet but
the opposite is true and yeah let's
start with the questions first question
microservices and java ee so i got i
spent some time on the GDK I oh I was
one day in Copenhagen and also one day
at the Oracle def day and 0 pee in
Munich and I had questions like
microservices and Java and what I always
see is like people are searching for
some damn for something which is too
slow or too inconvenient than the last
time someone mentioned yeah but
websphere now Webster is not a micro
service and I mean the older website is
true true but even Webster Webster
Liberty profile is very thin very very
very simple to install and actually very
very fast deployment cycles and this is
very performant application server so i
think the times are over where the
application server are thick and big at
least this is hard to to find our big
application server and usual is the
fault of our ourselves of developers to
that we develop too big applications
which are actually too fat and
deployment takes too long okay I'm
somehow related eyes still hurt two
times actually i do p and and cope and
hung java is not suitable do you know
anything more lightweight and actually
I'm this lightweight its is really
strange term because I think and what I
also am always asked what do you mean by
lightweight does your applications of a
consume too much ram does it consume too
much cpu is the deployment slow or
what's the problem or is the
installation complicated and usually I
don't get any answer it's like no it's
not lightweight it's okay but what is
is it too slow too big download size too
too big and actually there is no answer
so it's like and the last time someone
says I'm PHP would be for instance
lightweight for a micro service and
what's funny I'm back from the Eric's
special days so I delivered microservice
workshops and testing and what was it
the third one I even forgot and people
ask me yes I know ask me there were a
PHP developers who wanted to learn to
learn java years ago and why you are
here you are a PHP developer and why you
are in the java ee course and they told
me yeah because it is really a mess
larger applications are really a mess
and they would like to to learn java and
they really liked it so um so what's
funny now out at the conference is PEEP
you refer to PHP as being lightweight or
or microservice enabled and I see more
and more PHP developers in my workshops
so something strange is going on so um
if someone asks you about lightweight
ask the counter question what's the
problem so define the lightweight and
then let's see which technology will fit
into lightweight okay so this is just
too esoteric things and I also released
to the in simultaneously to the
microservices virtual Munich and
application called porcupine not
applications as very thin library you
can actually go to github to to show you
this the internet is slow again and what
the porcupine application does is it was
the problem with the app it is a
threading library it is based on
concurrency utilities for java and what
you get with this is injectable executor
services what executor services is an
abstraction from threadpool introduced
in JDK 16 or even 15 and the then goes
straight to the code
then it is actually a very small
application it is also in sonatype so
you can look in directly instead it to
your to your to your app and and what
what do you see this is there's just a
few classes and what you get with this
is you can can watch it in a
preoccupying example it's also on github
and basically what you can do you can
inject threat force so it looks at it
looks like this at inject dedicated
executor service is just the usual
executor service nothing special from
Java and with the light you get this is
the name of the executive service it
gets the name light and the other one is
heavy so you get two configurations two
distinct thread pulls and what
interesting is what you also get for
free is statistics is a different one
this one you can inject and these
statistics from the thread port so this
will inject all statistic from the
application all the available thread
pulls and what you can also inject you
can use the same the same qualifiers
there as to ask the previous one and
inject a dedicated settings for your
thread pool coming as with or as Jason
or XML so these are just qualifiers
dedicated is a qualifier on either you
can rely on conventions or you can
specify your own name if you like and
you can of course configure everything
so in the example here I showed you how
to how to configure such a thread pool
if you would like to have custom
configuration looks like this so i would
like to configure the pipeline so
pipeline is the thread pool plus
statistics and all the infrastructure so
i would like to configure the heavy one
and this is actually the configuration
if you don't configure to get the
default then a default is depending on
the and
of course okay and why I did it I use it
for for very long time actually on my
server on my back end and I just
extracted it from the application making
a little bit more cleaner and it's okay
why not open source this and we also
discusses a little bit on the micro
services workshop and by the way there's
new date in May if you like okay so this
was oh we could even try to launch it
let's see whether it actually works I
will try it on Wi-Fi as an attested in
glass station white lie and it should
also run on Tommy if it supports Java 7
let's see whether it works if not so um
this is we can do something light
something heavy so it takes a little
while yeah it was you see nothing so it
was time out Oh what I forgot to mention
what porcupine also causes cares about
the so called back pressure so you can
define you know what happens if the
queue is overloaded should the task be
rejected should the client be blocked or
should exception be erased and basically
I can configure this / / pool and this
is of course standard JDK 16 settings so
and then and we get the statistics
object as you can see is this is the
pipeline light in the pipeline heavy you
can also get it as Jason and you can get
back what is actually working okay what
is what actually happens on the server
so any questions here no questions no
questions so next one
so on this are more interesting one
Leonardo V ask me I think via email I
need to manage sessions to maintain
information and I think you would like
to have something like overview of all
sessions so it doesn't like use the HTTP
session with something more broad and
the question is where to put information
and doesn't like to put information on
the presentation site and actually it
wouldn't be even possible because if you
would like to see all locked in users
you would see in the app just the users
belonging to the app so what you could
do of course you can use something like
eh cash or hazel cast to distributed
data across service you can put the
information to database and of course
fine to have a singleton which caches
the information but if you would just
have to see the logged-in users per
application why not to use HTTP session
or at session scoped it works perfectly
what i would do i will disable
clustering because usually if you enable
clustering for HTTP sessions the
replication happens asynchronously and
if it's a synchronously it cannot be
consistent um yeah beccaria mp3 it is
synchronous and consistent or
asynchronous and not consistent in the
standard default java ee configuration
or jtv configuration so um so what you
can do you can use token install the
information on a singleton but then you
have to know to be aware of cleanups or
whatever I would use singleton beam
which is which is bin manage concurrency
and what you can use a koala well
application scoped beam but then you
cannot use scheduled dates and stuff
like this so the next question is how to
migrate and test control convoluted
swing projects so Java fix so a not to
Java fix both how to deal with swing so
I'm the problem if you just the usual
sweet swing application or the usual
Java fix application is not testable at
all and the problem is the people write
all kinds of code directly review and
then you have to start a view in order
to perform any any any and any tests so
what you can do or what we actually did
so if you I don't know whether I should
do something with this wait a second so
if we create let's say Java app I don't
even know it's a long time ago java
application let's do a java application
UI let's see whether it still works new
perfect jframe and let's say you would
like to have a button and you go to the
source as you properly see as the we
have the button here and the source is
generated in the protected region and
the problem is of course you are now
fully dependent on the generated code so
the question is how to separate this and
what you can do if you have the button
here you could you could associate the
button with the events with the code
exactly and there should be a listener
code and what I wanted to say is the
following you have to cleanly separate
the generated code from from the
controller code how to did how to do
this so in the wizard you can specify
which method is going to be called in
case someone pushes the ok button and
this method shouldn't be here should be
outside the code and it is going to be
outside the code is just a usual method
and from this method you should delegate
the calls to a controller and this
controller becomes fully testable so my
my last project swing project I think
there were 23 years ago were exactly
that so what we did we always separated
the generated code for our controllers
it was this generated code here what we
just did just forgot or someone not
binds events action exactly action
performed yeah exactly what we did so we
get the method generated here and this
method you would say this controller dot
safe so
this class just translates between the
swing events to the high-level events on
our controller was fully testable and
easier to handle and if something
happened to the view I don't know it
just was broke for for unknown reasons
we just threw it away and we just redraw
everything and delegate it to the calls
but there was no business logic here and
it worked perfectly even with non Java
programmers so this was my last swing
projects as absolutely possible and in
larger project it will pay off and in
Java excellent I try to do the same and
and and what happened is I I proposed
the project afterburner so you can
download it works similarly with a
little bit inversion of control okay
let's see still no eske could be a
github is down looks like because they
don't have porcupine I think ok so r 6
also interesting questions or someone
uses Jersey library for s implementation
and obviously Leonardo is using Tommy
which is a great application server and
now's the question should it use
built-in Tommy library or 6f I assume
from the client side to write system
tests and right now i'm in a white fight
project and what I try to do I try to
use for system test the same libraries
on the server so I'm using rest easy for
system test but there is some issue with
connection leaking the switch to Jersey
but I really try to to use the same the
same rest library on the client as on
the server and just to you know to have
more realistic tests and usually if i
use Tommy I would just use what what
Tommy provides and if I were use in
glassfish I am using the library's from
glassfish and white red and white fly
what I think it is not very reasonable
you know too
choose for instance I don't know glass
fish and then replace eclipselink with
hibernate then I would rather use
whitefly and use know that the full
stake white lie just to mitigate the
risks and not playing too much with the
infrastructure okay and the seven the
question number 7 is a classic one oh I
forgot to take a look at a chat here is
nothing and nothing here and also
nothing here so it seems like you have
no additional questions not even a
Twitter which is good so we will be
probably even faster than last time okay
so I've been wondering about using
ochiai for my startups could you give me
your opinion about osgi so on my opinion
about osgi is just I think it was one of
the most overused technologies right now
it is a little bit more quiet with osgi
and we I cannot answer this question
because it really depends what a kind of
start up it is if I would build clouds
or infrastructure like a server farm or
whatever I would for sure consider a shy
or whatever custom technology for
business applications server side
business applications I don't see do you
know the huge selling point for SGI it
yeah for specific cases I would use ohg
guy but this would be no my choice you
know for general business application in
my opinion in yeah I strongly believe in
it that for in for general business
applications enterprise applications
Java is the simplest possible most
productive choice and for more general
choice because it's based on Jase ours
on standards and therefore it cannot be
no perfect in all in all corners so the
question is do you need a solution for a
corner then choose a specific solution
if you building a mainstream application
than Java is just perfect ok then our
really interesting question i have to
admit the first time I didn't
don't even got what's the problem here
is actually a loosely java related but
java ee nicely solves the problem from
critics so let's see so steak overflow
is working what is do it's impossible
soon as like github is down can be so
everything directs get happen so I'm the
question was like this this is some
small this question from from stack
overflow and what what I understood is
the problem is standard Java SE
application and this is time drift
attributes it means there's a start time
and it asked several times you know get
it as possible shipment name or whatever
and it just creates dates over and over
again and the question is how to deal
with this in Java EE and I first didn't
got the questions like what's actually
the problem the problem is that someone
tries to know to to to have multiple
methods which operate on a date and the
starting date the starting date should
be always the same so this is actually
milliseconds I create and the question
is how to solve this Java and the funny
stories Java is sources beautifully why
you could use for instance request
scoped and create the set the date per
request once and you'd be reused and
then you have your standing points at
the request time or you can even use
conversation scope and I have multiple
entry points and so I would say java i
would greatly simplify the code and
would be perfectly suited so there
wouldn't be even a problem here so I'm
so funny enough javi would be actually
simple that simpler and the Olympic
implementation worry of course could do
you can also have a singleton but what
wouldn't be that elegant so I'm so X um
so what you would like to do is you know
to have a request code pin this could be
this event you can inject this event or
even fire inventor let's say you
injecting this and in the in the post
construct method you will create your
date and this is the date of the start
of targeting of the request this would
be the classic example of course there
will be lots of
verga rounds you could equally well
write an interceptor decorator or jax-rs
interceptor but this will be the most
elegant and simple solution if I got
dick did the problem right so no
questions perfect no questions and here
no questions perfect audience oh so uh
huh sting is hasn't very I have to so
the question is is it possible to use
observer security on the rest endpoints
and the answers this is the only
possibility it is impossible to you
something else so web sockets rely on
the j2ee and java is security in fact
they rely on the standard j2ee security
so you have even access to principles
whatever the web sockets are fully
integrated fully integrated with Java
security so thank you hosting for your
question so then the next one it's the
github also done foot down for you this
will be interesting so everything ver
exponent github so people in the chat
please say it's github down for you or
just for me it is would be interesting
to see whether my audience kill killed
github this could be also you know
everyone wanted to see porcupine and
they just overloaded github so let's see
blog the next one the next question so
Daniel I know him from the ax workshop
as an architect ask me sometimes I hi I
say durable is great and sometimes don't
use it or you don't have to use it and
what's the deal with jer able and the
answer is it's pretty simple for me I'm
my applications are rather small so the
deployment times are not an issue and if
this is an issue i try to simplify the
application it is not always
possible so if I would be involved right
now in a huge project you know with
multiple developers deploying on huge
year which I don't believe in such a
project because usually they are just
too bloated but assume I would just
involve in such a project then terrible
with the perfect solution because jared
is not only able to replace a class what
Jer able also does is it knows which
class our classes are depending on this
class and are able to reload the whole
environment okay the next one how to
handle security between my own micro
services and first I I try to to think
about this like what it actually means
the question and as I understood it you
usually has have service this is which
is exposed to the outside world like say
angular ember or whatever applications
are talking to you to your back-end and
this is secured by java ee but what you
can have you can have behind in the dmz
you can have notes so java application
servers we talked to two to each other
when you could use rest so the question
is what to use and there are actually
multiple options the most the most
simple answer is because you are behind
the firewall there could be no
authentication so each microservice
could talk to another microservice
because what micro usually means all the
microservices comprise one application
so there will be like local call between
classes but just we decided that the
classes are remotely using rest services
for communication between the services a
little bit more coarse grained in a
class between services and the decision
was driven by life cycle or team
structure whatever so that usually no
authentication would be perfectly fine
and what you can use standard Java is
security but with standard Java security
you would have in the standard Java
security all the application servers
will have
would have to use the same security
realm or a single sign-on solution and
there is an old solution from sun for
instance open IDM and what it actually
is is a proxy of the realm so all
application servers will share the same
security information so you can use
something like this or of course you can
pass a token and store the tokens are
we're friends in the database this is
what we're using the recent project I
talking about studying databases you can
talk from whatever service you liked so
I would just pass this to chat I hope
the question is answered so
a simple way to test EG bees and someone
asked me so actually there's the
question from the chat so there's a
simple way to test the jeebies I answer
the question multiple times basically it
boys down there is no other hat you can
use just a Jupiter just beau jo's and if
you would like to test them with a good
in a container then you can use
arquillian but in my eyes arquillian is
not use is not needed for the major
majority of our cases and by the way
this is the most frequent asked question
at the beginning of the testing workshop
and at the end the end no one asks again
because it's obvious so and mojito is
just just needed to mock out to mock out
the components it's not needed for
testing and you don't have to to mock
out eight GBS because they are just
poachers so usually I mean there's or
there's no difference between testing
and EG be interesting approach 0 what
could be harder if you are using the
very very old egb so it was 2003 d 12
years old technology that could be an
issue but it was the more modern since
2006 know this everything which is
annotated was at stateless no difference
to testing produce okay thank you for
the question now the next one I have the
problems that with whitefly 82 it seems
that transaction synchronization
registry just as tsr this is this one is
not propagated to asynchronous call
which is which would be a buggy actually
so what it actually means so what I
propagated sometimes or just mentioned
in my book that what you can do you can
use transaction synchronization registry
put to the transaction synchronization
registry some data and whenever you are
in the transactions and transactions
happen in synchronous in synchronous
call you can access the data and because
asynchronous is not synchronous that it
has lost and
particularly if you if you look at the
documentation of at a synchronous EGP
you will find out that a synchronous egb
always start a new transaction that this
is the reason why your data get lost
this is the question from Peter this one
the whitefly behaves actually properly
and glasses would also behave properly
as well so the only solution would be to
pass it somehow to the server so can you
please set up a little demo to run at
the back from netbeans java project on
docker I could but it's extremely simple
so if you just go for instance to the
project porcupine and i would say debug
so what you will see it will restart the
application server or this is here and
what you also see is it will search for
a port address 87 87 so what you will
have to do in Dhaka you will have to
expose the part the debugging port form
application server to debug your
application so in this party I'm running
now whitefly and in in a debug mode so
you will have to expose your part 87 87
with the command minus P 878 spec 87
colon 87 87 this is what you will have
to do so it's trivial and because it's
trivial I won't show it if there is any
problem I'm not aware of we couldn't
talk about but it should just work ok
perfect oh I have to question two times
no no no so the question is most of the
applications of a I will in proprietary
way to start notes for batch processing
and the question is what additional
value J bitch provides on top of this or
someone mentioned I clean the knowledge
mentioned that on weblogic applications
of you can start node managers on the
fly so yes so you can processed batches
so the che batch is more flexible so you
are defining the whole pipeline leaks ml
so you can be configured so you can you
can specify the concurrency and this is
standard so starting notes is a web
project feature but
it does not have to be supported by all
application servers J beta Z is a
standard a standard should be always
preferred because it's simpler and
better documented and they are usually
more resources on the on the web then I
esoteric solution so the answer is j
batch is more complete and it provides
the notion of how it's called readers
writers and middle think some pack
processors so you can do the own
pipeline and you can specify now home
home how many pipelines in parallel
should be active which is an impossible
with with usually with application
servers so and someone watched my NASA
on presentation on my youtube channel
and and said why are what's my opinion
about groovy there was a question from
Avshar L and if you I'm seen there's
what I created a project called green
fire it is a long long time ago yes and
what this project is I hacked my heating
control with the project Oh looks nice
just a guess interesting so they changed
completely d oh and Ben just in the
Jarrah so but the project green fire
what it was what what it is I created in
2006 the project green fire is
intelligent Oh intelligent and allow
allows allowed me to remote control my
hitting it was nine years ago and the
whole configuration was groovy so I was
able to load on the fly groovy scripts
and complete change the behavior of all
the algorithms you know depending on the
sunshine and external temperature and
internal temperature could choose to
know to to to to to turn on the heater
and and all turn it off so it saved
as I would say ten to thirty percent of
the energy so it actually was an
interesting project and I was groovy and
now why I'm using javascript or a nice
one right now and so groovy first what
you should know there is a recent event
so pivotal is the company behind spring
and behind a groovy day I think
beginning with the with March they stop
supporting Teague V core developers so
groovy is going to be and I would say
not commercially supported project which
does make mean anything but still means
that there will be less resources which
actively developing groovy this was
actually not the point why I'm using
John last one so not song comes with jdk
18 so i can rely on it and i use NASA 14
jjs this scripting and in most of my
projects there is a JavaScript anyway
you know one the client usually so and I
try to minimize the total amount of
languages so I actually don't believe in
how it's called polyglot programming
because if you if you think about this
if every develop when your team would
choose a different language you do a
little bit harder to cooperate to with
the extreme and have you but and this is
what I try to minimize actually the
amount of languages and Java is perfect
and for scripting automation at jesse's
nice one and I get syntax highlighting
debarking with netbeans out of the box i
can even create a library project which
just there's a terminal supports
actually without any additional plugins
downloads or dependencies I can use
JavaScript of course groove is nicer
because you can start with groovy with
Java syntax and then make it nice and
nice and nicer and javascript is
JavaScript exact list with with Java
Luke not feel but with Java look and so
group is of course nice effort for java
developers but since we we have to care
about JavaScript as well most of my
project this is why I prefer a nice one
ok I want to learn below things so I got
that which jax-rs along with Jason and
Jax p jax-rs and sprinkle ease and I
should share articles videos for same so
of course if you go to Polly's hopefully
policies
up so please don't crash palace there is
a course for me java a bootstrap and you
get three hours video and with jax-rs
and i build an application from scratch
it is actually a similar to the to the
boots tribbett Munich Airport but it's
online so there are almost or para of
course no questions so this is where
charter I will pass it to the chat so
and of course I think on my youtube
channel i also posted several things
which are completely free I think I i
had to Jack's arrest or something Jack's
as you can see starting with jax-rs
client so there's another video and by
the way jax-rs and jack's b is probably
the simple as possible the simple as
possible starts to Java ease or actually
yeah this is what you can do and this is
xed and I think it is harder to
understand the concepts what what makes
up a good tracks rest service then then
then learning the Java syntax and a
jax-rs and spring I don't know whether
there's a right combination as I
understand the spring people don't like
jax-rs a lot and therefore they still
there using spring MVC as a replacement
of jax-rs so in the spring gland i would
rather use spring MVC then mixing spring
with jax-rs but and yeah this is my
rough understanding so i'm now a little
bit more involved questions so it is
like scalability in web sockets so um so
if there are 10,000 people users and
connecting to one server what's about
the scalability it based and boys down
the question how it works and how it how
web talk is are working this you have
one endpoint which is one instance of
the class per server so there's exactly
one and you can have multiple sessions
and the question is yeah this is
endpoints here like an OD all each
user's a different endpoints
and the question is a little bit
misleading but let's say this would be
at no effort at all you have 10,000
users talking with the application
server on the same time but what happens
if you would pull a data from the
database and send it back to the client
potentially you will need to have 10,000
threats right so if each user would like
to have different information and 10,000
threats will kill the application server
for sure you of course you could cure
the threats whatever what we way too
slow and I don't think I never measured
this but I don't think that this upgrade
mechanism here causes any problem so I
actually nourish made me curious I with
this a little bit but what i did i
tested 1500 concurrent collections and
this was the project and i'm being tuned
goo sky you can look at this this is an
ancient project so don't use the sort of
the code no ancient six years old but I
remember there wasn't diagram here
should be a picture but there was no
picture with my with my performance
measurement and within the picture this
was from j meters i remember i tested
was 1500 clients i will just posted the
chat 1500 clients and there was actually
no impact on the on threading or memory
of the application server of course if
the application server would have to
something to say it would push the
information to 1500 different users so
um so the answers I never tested this
but if I had 10,000 concurrent users
what I would do instead of thinking
about this i will create a simple stress
test it will probably take a half day
and then i have a definite answer which
application server can open how many
threats and users so my question is this
is one endpoint for all users there we
one instance of the application server
and on the tcp i-- level I have actually
no idea how its implemented but I know
the the protocol if you go
web so catch spec the wire protocol data
framing and the fourth is very well
implemented so specified so I would just
look at this and then you can probably
find out how it should behave so the
next question is the following
application asynchronous servlet and the
question is how the asynchronous tablet
behaves and the answers it really
depends on the on the on the application
server in the later application service
you know an atmosphere framework and
later what usually happens if the if the
server blocks there is no threat waiting
the threat is parked and you only need
threats for processing the algorithms to
processing the data or whatever so
question number 18 second level cache
for jpa does it says to maintain good
amount of ram memory of the application
server usually yes so um what are the DD
level so the first level cache you or
you always need it so the first actually
there are multiple levels so what I
usually says I'm counting you have the 0
level cache is transactional cash this
is within the transaction if you if you
invoke entitymanager find by ID I would
expect to get stell the same reference
to the entity all the time this is the 0
level cache cache the first level cache
would be the call would be between
transactions the second level cache
would be there cash between persistence
unit or entitymanager instances and the
third level cache would be a distributed
cache this is my number Inc but this is
what he could some some people start
with one and some with 0 so I'm so what
it actually means if your if your cash
is going to be distributed if you would
like to use for instance hazel cast for
this you would need less
REM because hazel cars will introduce
something like sharding so the data will
move across the network for you so I'd
say no the customers starting from A to
D will be on one node and and e to
whatever so this is called consistent
hashing absolute different story but if
you're interesting in this this is an
accident this is what we will talk in
this workshop persistent distribution
was about such algorithms if you're
enters in caching distribution or
whatever but in this particular case is
hazel cast you will need less Ram if you
would use a brute force cash let side
which is not distributed you we will
need more ram by the way i bought some
ram again for my application server for
my hardware i'm just upgrading the
server and I thing has spent 160 euro
force for 32 gigabyte of RAM so it's
incredible how cheap it actually gets
yeah okay i hope i answered the question
right but if you distribute the cash
they always the question to know if you
get a cash it you will have to go over
the network to fetch the entity and you
have the network trip close to
civilization this realization what i
will check for sure whether i know a
straight database call is not faster
than a distributed network all so
someone observe today music ed injects
instead of each a busy as it is simple i
always use at inject instead of EG bees
and i would only use EG bc inject
doesn't work anymore what it actually
means and its specific or additional
information like GI named remote
interfaces name and so on so forth and i
get the question multiple times the
people are waiting for java 7 like real
world java applications reloaded i like
that title actually reloaded if i would
write a book i will completely name it
otherwise i get issues and amazon again
they merge the emerging all my books to
one book and i got all the reviews you
know like the very first book i think
nine years ago i got comment like the
content is ok but the formatting is not
quite right and I then fix the form of
formatting three years ago but it still
the old know
comments so what is the answer I didn't
even started to write a book but I have
lots of ideas so either i will read a
new book or rewrite the old one but they
are still okay so from the contents
absolute known you know state of the art
so there is no J batch for instance
described by the architecture but even
funnier what I did in this book in this
Java patents and the and the Java in
night x I actually described
microservices without knowing it so in
the in the blue book excerpt the x-ray
project is a micro service but back then
there was no such password okay and I
get one reaction 1 comment here and this
was whether I jeebies become dependent
now we are injecting is the proxy and
the proxy could be depending so what you
get is one proxy / instance but the EG
bees are dispatched depending on load so
EG bees are not scoped except session
scoped stateful session beans okay and
now I got one question in chat what do
you suggest for jax-rs documentation I
suggest swagga s.w.a.g ger is perfect
just use it but I never use maven never
use the the jax-rs extension just write
to Jason statements / hand is a easier
faster and no external dependencies so
and now oh man this allow this is one
communicated with the enterprise
firewall with other J applications via
jax-rs is it best to share the service
interface model classes via jar was jus
consumer or is generally better to have
the clients manage their own model
classes to consume the endpoint and this
is a very interesting question so why do
I a second I will should do something
like this who can watch the question
read the question and the the answer is
this more about politics so if you
provide the stops it looks like you also
know take the responsibility for the
star
implementations like you know the jax-rs
dependency whatever and which is really
hard to assure and what i would say in
Jack's arrest I wouldn't do this I would
just expose jax-rs interface and they'll
be consumed in whatever whatever fashion
the the others developers like to and
just giving them the business delegates
or these tops is like you know of
providing a good will to them start with
this but leave me alone from now because
what you will also have to do if you
provide them the stops you also have to
care about life cycles so you have even
know have to do push them to upgrade to
take the newest stops and you are you
say you gave them the version 10 and you
are now already inversion 20 so you will
have to try to move them to use your
recent step and with just plain jax-rs
you are just more how it's called more
flexible and agile I hate the word a gel
more flexible okay no height is just
overused ok any questions if not we are
in 50 minutes minutes 80 questions 18
questions is quite good is there a
simple application architecture to see
how to start with micro services yes
whatever I talked in the recent two
years was a micro service so what a
micro service is in my eyes is a simple
focus application developed by a small
team according to conway law so small
team produces small war so you get very
thin application this is what we
actually did for several years and in
one point of time you will have to split
this war in multiple Wars for unknown
reasons and you get 10 micro services so
microservices for me is not top down hey
we would like to have micro services and
now create 50 words and distribute them
so for me is more like is a conscious
decision now we have unfortunately we
have to split you know our beautiful war
into multiple smaller Wars and because
of some trade-offs like life cycle
whatever we have to use micro services
for me is my
services not a feature is more like I
know an answer to a tour to a
requirement yeah life cycle this is
actually what in my current project we
are using micro servers architectures
but my developers don't don't know it so
I never mentioned microservices we just
decided to do this and yeah we building
what we always built small Wars deployed
on multiple application service now even
we started with Daka but yeah in one
point of time I will mention we have
microservices but no one actually cares
yes swag a XF this is what what
the what they said said but again
probably I will record one session about
this so I again don't use the maven
plugin because you will have to use
strange annotations to annotate your
your Jack's arrest resources and don't
use I forgot today they have found
another way to extend from jax-rs
application look just and addie what the
plugin generates on the ND jason this is
very very simple you can fairly easy
create with one file per get post put
delete or whatever proper method a JSON
file and this works as well and it
worked perfectly for me and thankfully
micro servers or mac services jax-rs
services are not that fine grade so you
don't have ended up having enough 500
rest calls it is actually usually a view
calls / war so the question is from
Abdullah zzz I hope it was a spur right
what is the alternative of web socket in
asynchronous client server in esco
spencerville alternative web socket is
long polling jax-rs very simple to
implement I think even troll there's
multiple times in in the X TV in the my
youtube channel so look at this that
would be properly long polling and in
the project porcupine if you go to the
sample application I combined jax-rs
with thread pools and completed future
which we
this is what we can get and of course
don't forget JMS GMS is still very
interesting protocol and with servers
like most of the application servers you
can replace the protocols and even in
case of white fly you can use amqp or
stomp so very fancy protocols Wow now
the chat woke up i use arquillian to
test my database and persistence logic
and test the cascade configuration of my
entities do you have another alternative
of course i have so i will type this to
everyone so to the chat actually so our
persistence create entity manager
entitymanager and I T dot create entity
entitymanager factory manager factory
cat entitymanager and then am get entity
transaction and these are two lines of
code where you get where you can boot
your persistence without oh you can you
can you can test your professor
persistence without putting our Killian
and on that note if you go here and you
search for maven project from archetype
come in a hex oh it's not synchronize it
maven project from archetype yes come ax
so then fetch the the maven definition
yet but if you there would be a there
will be a archetype called pc archetype
and with this you could you will also
what i did i implemented integration
tests with with without arquillian and i
use are killing for different purposes
but the oh now it fetched from the
intern
this is the BC archetype and it's a
persistence so do this at home and you
get the answer so you what you will see
how to test a GPS without Arcadian and
with cherry test and how to tests
persistence without Arcadian with aunt
Ida manager and how to test I don't know
what I tested but I tested something
with our Killian as well there's
actually all possible tests here so and
there would be one module called
persistence and this open and look at
this okay perfect no questions no
questions then I would say thank you
goodnight to you or good morning all
were actually interested in which time
zone you are you are living so for me is
almost good night and see you in one
month or an upcoming conferences
workshops so there are a new bunch of a
hex admitting airport in March and in
may and the microservices was just
overflowing i would say took a lots of
questions about microservices and yeah
and or even projects and I have some
ideas actually the question how to test
web sockets made me curious and probably
a new open source project will arise
from this but yeah see you see you next
