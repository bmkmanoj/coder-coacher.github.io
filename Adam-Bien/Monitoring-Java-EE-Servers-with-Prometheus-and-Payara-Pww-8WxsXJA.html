would like to show you how to use
Prometheus and graph Anna to captured
application server statistics and I will
use payara as an as an example and for
instance are just using the rest or HTTP
monitoring endpoint and let's say we
would like to know the total number of
rollbacks and this is the path and it we
just use d jason we will get information
as jason and if you look at this you see
that what's actually interesting here is
the extra properties dot entity dot
rolled back count and then the key count
so this is the value we are interested
in if we will take a look at the
committed count it would be very similar
situations or the the path is a little
bit different but we see here extra
properties entity committed counts of
the only thing that changes is the
committed so let's try to monitor that
and the idea is to use a tool called
firehouse it is already on github and it
is able to extract information from from
there and this is a sidecar micro
service and convert it into prometheus
format so let's stop this the payara
here and what i would like to do is to
launch the chain and i would like to use
the docker compose for that and this is
a very simple docker compose file it
launches payara firehose and payara fire
hose is payara with enabled monitoring
then it exposes these ports that it uses
Prometheus fire hose and the Prometheus
fire hose exposes port 1990 and it needs
payara fire also does the link
dependency and graph on on its
Prometheus firehouse and we have
something interesting is the
configuration loader and what the
configuration loaded Oz's on startup it
just configures fire hose with with the
payara
extraction scripts and what are this
these scripts so let's
look at the para monitoring logger it's
just a start-up singleton and what it
does is it relies on payara firehose 88
it was the port 8080 and there are
several scripts problematic five of
three problem at rollbacks average
processing time and so forth and and
what it does is it reads from the local
from the local folder it reach the
scripts so let's go and see the number
of roll backs and as you can see it
extracts from the Jason dimetric extra
properties entity rolled back count and
count and then creates the meta data
necessary for Prometheus and exposes
then that to the outside world also used
heap similar script and what it just
does it configures and startup so it
says hey invoke this array of the
application server and use the script to
to fetch geometric so that's all this is
just one class okay so and all the
images already available in Docklands so
we have payara fire hose it just uses
just with enabled monitoring everywhere
and what also happen the fire hose
extractor is deployed as I sidecar and
what also happened so this is just
fetched from from github and we have
additional listener which can be used
for monitoring purposes in our example
we just rely on port 8080 so the
Prometheus image is just Prometheus with
scraping from should 8080 doesn't matter
in our case should scrape the Ori 8080
and fire a fire hose resources matrix is
the URI we're all matrix we configure
become available and what we also have
we have stock graph an ax and this is
just graph on are completely unconvicted
okay so let's try to launch it so docker
compose up and we can launch it in
foreground so what we'll do it will
start everything so it will launch the
payara fire hoses and
and paya Rogers was the sidecar then it
would launch Prometheus configured graph
fauna and another service which reads
the configuration and pushes the
configuration to the to the service so
it looks ok so let's see whether it
actually works so what we could do we
could switch right and see localhost
let's see 8080 it should be firehouse
and just pull the metrics and it looks
like we got the metrics so what we can
also do is the port 1990 and this is
prometheus and all the metrics are
available so what I could do I could
just
for instance gate rollbacks count and we
will get a graph with the rollback so
there are no road bikes because
everything went well so works well and
what we also have is graph fauna but the
graph fauna is not configured so we will
have to configure that and I would have
to set up the data source and the data
source is Prometheus and Sonam is
Prometheus and the port this is the
localhost 1990 known local house rather
than Prometheus firehouse hopefully and
just use the direct and add data source
added so does it look good or not it's
hard to tell
so this looks good let's
okay so we have proxy connection to
Prometheus firehouse so this looks good
right now and I would like to have a
dashboard so let's create the dashboard
and at a graph and we will have to
configure the graph so go here and what
I would like to do is to use a metric
and let's say no this is a little bit
boring metric
let's do with something like this and I
will switch to here and and as you can
see now we are able to monitor in real
time the bytes of Prometheus of payara
and I can of course add additional
graphs additional it's a additional
metric so what else how how many threads
are currently busy also interesting
information so just go with that and now
we should have both so there is there's
just one thread busy and it doesn't
makes two sense to display both because
you know we have here 100 million bytes
and just one thread so this is we won't
see it but this is fairly easy to
convert whatever information you like
from payara GlassFish to to Prometheus
or or Graf Anna so this were just a
technical matrix or you can easily also
do is to expose business matrix so what
you will have to do for this for the
purpose just expose your own matrix or
or sensors via JSON or HTTP and gather
them with fire hose so thank you for
watching
and see your upcoming conference
projects Java is a groups meetings or if
workshops at Munich Airport or exit i/o
so thank you for watching and bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
