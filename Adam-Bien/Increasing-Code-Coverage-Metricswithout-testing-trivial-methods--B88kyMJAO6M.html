would like to show you how to increase
the code coverage without writing
useless tests unit tests forget a set as
default constructors or even two string
methods so I have here now a reasonable
Java project what means reasonable so we
have one message factory with some
business logic so at least we have one
if statement and green font means is
code covered so it's it's tested and
bigger font means is somehow complex in
relative to the other classes so if you
take a look at the messages resource
nothing happens here so it is not tested
so this code is not tested because there
is no cyclomatic complexity and the
jax-rs configuration is just empty so we
could write unit tests for that to
increase to increase the code coverage
but it would be pointless
so the problem right now is we only have
58% of code coverage so what it means is
this project would never pass any
quality metrics or any QA department why
because the code coverage too is too low
so we could increase this again by just
writing the unit tests but the unit
tests are pointless so how to do this so
just take a look at the source code here
of the dashboard and so take a look at
the sources and I would just like to
reload the dashboard and we can see
there is a GS and knife and we have a
short FG s script so I would like to
save it to overrides and what overrides
means is this script is saved locally
and I can override the origin script
with my version of it so um what it
means we've had for instance add cons or
lock hello to qu a and just reload and
we see we see hello to QA so now what I
would like to do is to take a look what
this actually is so I would like in like
to inspect ant and we see this is a span
with the IDM coverage so I will go back
to the sources and now what we can do we
can say doc you
and query quer query select OA and what
do you what what I would like to do is
to select the ID M coverage and what I
get back is a Const and I call it
coverage and now what I can do I can say
set the coverage to whatever like and I
wouldn't send it to 100 100 is too
obvious so I would just do something
like 97.3 or let's say 42 so which is a
nice number and I would like to reload
that so save that and reload and as you
can see the code coverage increased to
97% dot 42 and now decrease QAS are
happy and developers are happy they
don't have to write pointless unit tests
and what we can also do here for
instance at a short explanation really
good coverage just to make it even looks
nicer so thank you for watching
so what I actually showed you today is
the override scripts in chrome which are
useful tool for for for working with
more complex web apps but it's also
useful for to increase dashboard metric
metrics so to make your QA department
happy so thank you for watching see
upcoming workshops web standards
workshops and web components progressive
web apps workshops and meaning airports
you had conferences or even projects so
thank you and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
