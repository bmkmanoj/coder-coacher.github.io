look a little bit more closely on an
hydrator and what I would like to show
is how to map rose to any objects you
like so what we have so far we have a
CSV file with as columns named version
and year so I would just copy the
columns here and it just reads the
columns or the file to in memory
structure which are rows so it has
passes as you can see here lots of
outputs those zeros and what we did so
far we skip the first row and we mapped
the year to an integer and then we have
an filtering expression which just
filters everything which is or skips
everything which is older than the year
2000 and what I would like to do is I
would just remove the lock sink to make
the output more concise and to what what
an iterator ships with is a POJO mapping
class so we can say put a sorry Pooja
sink and it has four parameters so the
first one is the name of the sink and if
you use asterisk the whole traffic will
go to the sink consumer so what we need
we need to consume of objects now sorry
we need to take class here so you can
see the class target we don't have the
class yet and we need the consumer we
can say new consume of object and and
what we like to do is first fix the typo
I would like to import this and use a
methods and you will receive here the
map objects and what we would like to do
is to say actually just do this so I
would just like to output the class
properly just with additional market to
find it easier and of course we can use
a lambda expression and we don't need
this and it would be nicer if we
would use the are 40 so the map is done
we have to fix the null and what we can
do we can just create a class I will
call the class jdk jdk and this class
has just as fire remember is the version
it has the year and the year is going to
be an integer because we map that and it
has to have a name name and I would also
like to have a truce drink so if we run
it right now I think it should work so
we have first to pass the class I would
like to map to this structure 3rd class
exactly and I would like to test the
file and what we got we got an error
added size jdk does not have a field
with the name year so you see a capital
y and we can fix this because it also
ships with some annotations i can say
the column name here is actually version
and this one is named and this see this
one is here and now if we rerun the test
it should be green and what we also see
here should see the output as you can
see this is this to string of the poll
shows and with the converted year so
this is one of the questions from front
from the audience you know is it
possible to map to object absolutely it
ships with the capability if you have
any questions left first monday of the
month 6 p.m. just watch me answering
questions life and yeah see you at ax
arm or projects or at github so thank
you for watching and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
