like to present you a new version of
line fish so night fish's small Java 7
application which runs within GlassFish
v4 and is able to monitor the GlassFish
v3 and v4 applications with Java 6 and
Java 7 applications and so on how it how
it actually works on how to down how to
start with light fish the best is to
just go to the page light fish dot
adobe.com and there's a download button
and you will be able to download the
recent release a war just drop it to to
GlassFish 2d deploy folder and it should
work so the Start screen listen Jeff
application so you can use that if you
click for instance and start it will
record every two seconds the the all the
matrix tour tour database but even more
interesting so there is a Java FX
application and you can use that to
monitor applications or light fish
exposes all the API through restful web
services and Jason so I could just
activate the monitoring and for instance
start capturing every two seconds so I
clicked on start and what should happen
right now
yeah it captures the values from the
applications you see here the heap size
the thread counts to pick thread count
there are also arm transactions so we
see there's a couple of commits going on
Paranormal Activity it's also nice what
it actually is you can see whether the
application service overloaded or not so
you see here the number of queue
connections errors and and how many
threads are actually busy busy
performance commits per seconds so robux
per seconds you shouldn't be proud of
and you can monitor the number of HTTP
sessions and of course the pools but
even more interesting in the version one
three what do you you are able to
monitor the ejbs
and application components so what I
would like to do is to monitor light
fish itself so I can just go through the
beans and you'll see here number of
created beans is one and destroyed also
one there are no threads waiting and
there's also no no I number of threats
and what you can do you can find out
what are actually the slowest methods so
I we will see here to get bin statistics
seems to be the slowest method of the
bean because it takes 500 milliseconds
and yeah there is a configuration store
is probably the most interesting one
because it saves every two seconds now
all these statistics to a database so
you see here that the method safe takes
about you know four milliseconds in 33
milliseconds in total so um yeah right
which is really useful for stress
testing and and now with this extension
you can just monitor your applications
without any plugins or our tools is just
runs out of the box on GlassFish before
so thanks for for watching and see you
one of the upcoming conferences
workshops or even EXO thank you and bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
