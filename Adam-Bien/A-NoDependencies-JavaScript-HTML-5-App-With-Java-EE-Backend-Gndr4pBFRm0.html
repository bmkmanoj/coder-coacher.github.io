implement and plain html5 JavaScript app
without any dependencies and connected
to the width G Java EE beckoned and the
Java back-end is already implemented so
it just runs on payara and emits an
array of three strings and it's
available under the early numbers
resources numbers so numbers is the path
numbers is the name of the application
what I also did I installed the course
filter which is just one class and the
whole war is about 5k okay should work
so let's try that whether it work so the
application server payara in this case
runs on port 8080 numbers resources
numbers was the URI and we see the
output it works we just remember the
output and what I would like to do is to
render list of items here so how to do
this first let's start with the hardest
part I would like to start with the
client Jas but before I start with the
client I will just briefly explain what
what what is they actually D the entry
here so I have an HTML page which is
very basic so it just comprises the body
with and if ID app which is empty and it
references a JavaScript file jar it
stands of course for JavaScript archive
there are no dev dependencies so means
no frameworks here nothing and the web
pack web pack is configured that way
that the entry index yes is going to be
transformed into a jar and what it means
transformed I configured a loader called
es2015 so what it means I can use the
current JavaScript syntax actually it
should also work out of the box because
of the recent Chrome but yeah this is
what happens behind the scenes
again no frameworks involved so let's
see whether it actually works so console
dot log and let's try with Luke and so
we have the Duke so it works the whole
system works behind the scenes so let's
start with the client so I would like to
export this class client
class client and this class client will
have a constructor constructor and
within the constructor I would like to
remember a string or E and this URI or
worry has this URI just copied from the
browser and what I would also like to do
is to implement a method numbers and
this method mountain numbers defines a
result which is going to be a promise so
we would like to work or to fetch the
data asynchronously from the server so
and how promise operates so we usually
have to register an on most function
resolve reject this is the conventional
names and what I would like to do is in
the resolve I would like to call or to
pass the result and we don't have the
results yet therefore I would like to to
instantiate this XML HTTP request and
the request has to be opened and what I
would like to open is the get request
and pass the aureum so it looks good and
then I can say requested on ready state
change so call back I can register and I
will use a unknown anonymous function
again and the request has response text
and this is the raw result and what I
would like to do I would like to have T
Jason or presentation and this can be
converted with the built-in function
Jason to parse
and now I'm done
what I only have to do is to say
resolved this is my call back and pass
the result Jason
so looks good it won't work
why not because we forgot to send a
request so I call sent so nothing
happens because this class is actually
not used so to use the class I will just
import that import client from from
client and I would like to create a
class list and within this class create
a constructor and in this constructor
I can now instantiate my client what I
would also like to do to reference this
div here how to do that very easy I can
say I would like to have a root element
and this root element has get element by
ID there is a Dom method available in
all browsers and app so now I have to
reference to the Dom and then I can just
say this client numbers so and then if
you are done then please pass the
numbers to a method render number we
don't have the method yet but now we
have it numbers and these numbers is
actually array of strings or integers
does not actually matter but it's a
number right so what you can do we can
say for each number in the array create
an element so so how it look like again
we can say for each number in the array
converted to an element and I would like
to have element a div element or with n
so and now we need define an T function
L with name and content and the document
is able to create the elements and I
would like to create a element with the
name let element and the element element
has an text content and this is content
and then we can return the element so
this is the freshly created element so
it looks good now we have the map we
convert in a map of numbers into into
map of diffs with the text content of
the number and then we can say ok now
for each now of the icon for each
element we do the following we can pass
this to the route and say hey this dot
root dot append child e and we only need
so would look like this and we have an
problem in the client right now expo
default class client and it says on
ready state change so we have here the
function resolve reject and
looks good okay now the client is saved
and now we can say new list and you see
the output here and the interesting part
this our this so we can say we would
like not to dis rather than I don't know
peace so we have to peace so what we
created and dynamic html5 apps which
communicates with the backends with no
external dependencies and just using
javascript and html5 and yeah we could
even attach listeners and click handlers
or whatever so for simple things
actually no no html5 frameworks I needed
you could just go with the straight DOM
and JavaScript API so thank you for
watching see you on upcoming workshops
in Munich so react angular and html5 and
JavaScript and at conferences workshops
and enjoy java javascript and html5 so
thank you and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
