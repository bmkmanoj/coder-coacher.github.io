like to show you how to validate JSON
objects in jax-rs so and Java is 7 of
course so I would like to start as
always with simplistic maven project and
call it J validate Jason validate it's
nicer and so and then just start with a
single resource for the date boundary
messages boundary and this resource only
need the path so I call it messages and
a single method safe with a JSON object
as a input and just go with post and
doesn't really matter and this so and
now I'd like to validate is an input so
what I can do
simply I will create a validation
constraint and call it valid message and
I would like to validate Java X JSON
object okay and this is a the annotation
and I would like to use just up to to
apply the rotation of the parameter D
valid message valid data so what I would
like to do here is to remember the
annotation as a field so we will use it
later
and now just implement a very simple
validation like the value has to contain
a string for the key message and the
string should contain of course our tube
so there is nothing is valid without a
Duke so and then of course we can put
a valid message rotation and then try it
so I would just run it and just choose
PI R at this time and so it's deployed I
will just pick the Ori and then try
something here so I would like to
initiate the post and I have to set the
setter at the header content type
application Jason and the payload which
has to be sent is a message and the
content of the message is the Duke and
then I will just say resource sis
messages and I will CD see the error so
what's for our just forgot so no contact
actually great news so as you can see
input message Duke and now try something
else not message Duke rather than
message nuke and we get bad requests so
it seems to work so now what we can also
do we could say okay the valid message
annotation contains an expected string
and the expected string can be now let's
say expect it nuke so we just change it
and this is the reason why I remembered
the annotation here because now you can
say value gets drink message contains no
Duke but we can say whatever we set in
the annotation so what it is now means
now
not found I would have to be deployed
now the nuke is varied and the Duke
shouldn't be vetted so just run it and
our Duke is invalid and the yoke is
varied so the Duke produced 400 and the
other one to 204 so it's as fairies in
Java 7 to validate the input so we could
you know make it even more generic to
validate JSON objects and in Java 8 and
bean validation to always probably is
getting even better than this so thank
you for watching see you and upcoming
conferences workshops Munich Airport
yeah exit come or projects and don't
forget the first Monday of the month and
I will answer your question so I'll
gather the questions the whole month and
answer me at the first Monday of the
month so thank you for watching and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
