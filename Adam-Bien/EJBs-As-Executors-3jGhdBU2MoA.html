would like to show you how to start or
enables from an eg be so why it's
important because in Java is six prior
Java 7 it is actually the only legal way
to do this so I would like to start with
and move an archetype from the air hex
group ID and I call that a JB rivals and
create the project now it fetches the
archetype from maven central and creates
the project on the fly I will start with
an EJB without an interfaces and this
egb is going to start any runnable you
like so runnable executor and we'll call
that package a hex is just fine and the
stateless is the annotation and the
method is going to execute runnable just
plain tribal and then know this runnable
run so now we have a delegate and now
the delegate becomes a decorator so it
should be decorates the runnable with
some asynchronous behavior so i would
like to create a surplus to expose the
egb runnable tester and just try that
and now inject or is it here the
runnable executors are e and ejected
with that inject because we have Java 7
I don't have to create a pin 6 ml in
Java is SEC 6 I would have to create and
pin 6 ml I don't have to create a pin 6
ml because run runnable execute
is annotated so it's don't have to so
now I would create this re and say
execute or is it execute new runnable
and just implement some heavily heavy
lifting in dear honorable so how to do
this thread sleep so sleeping is
actually forbidden in Java 6 but we do
it just for demonstration purposes as a
placeholder for any an expensive verb to
do so runnable test time so it looks
fine so just run the project and we can
just start what is the name of the
tester runable testa we could just start
runnable tester and as you can see it
executes very very fast so it is far
faster than 1 second so it seems to work
with an EJB so um I describe this
example in my book rethinking best
practices so if you like just just just
just grab it and you can lend it for
free if you have Kindle so thank you for
watching and see you one of the of
upcome upcoming projects conferences
workshops or even the X at Munich
Airport of Munich Airport so thank you
for watching and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
