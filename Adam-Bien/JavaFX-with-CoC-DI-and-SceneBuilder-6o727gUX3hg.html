would like to show you how to start with
convention over configuration dependency
injection with Java Vic sent maven three
so what I created I created a small
archetype wave an archetype which is a
kind of wizard and you can access that
by using maven archetype generate plugin
so it works with maven two or three and
what happens now now the maven archetype
generate plug-in pools aldi are
archetypes for maven central and what we
need we need an artifact at the
beginning with the group ID comics so
you could also use filter to to speed it
up so this is this one come ax and the
name of the artifact or the wizard is
igniter so the idea is 18 so we just use
8 who is the latest version the group ID
i will use cone AIX artifact ID is di
and TLC with java ethics so very concise
artifact ID and the version is 10
package and let's create it so we have
here the project this is actually a
simple mapping project so we can just
build that with maven clean installed
and builds the java fix application
packages everything and bundles and
creates one app and i will use an alias
this is j eight so it's actually just an
ideas for GD k 18 why that because Java
fix classes are in class puzzle in jdk
18 which simplifies things but you can
you could also use equally well jdk 17
so I'm j 8 minus jar and we'll just like
to start at target and the name is di
this one so and it created the
application so i can launched it ok from
tower so it works some tower in it and
ready to take off now what actually
happened so to show you this
I would just launched my ID so that
means and I would like to open the
project so open project di it's just a
maven project and so what it is is
actually a simple Java X application the
name of the application is follow me and
the component is flight control is a
tower which is actually a simple pojo
with a post construct method which gets
invoked if so this tower that in it this
is actually d the output here and ready
to take off so it's invoked as in in
case aunt something someone pushes the
button and yeah what we have here we
have a view which is actually extends FX
ml view it is fully defined here in d f
xml file and you see here what we also
have here is the controller already
registered follow me presenter this is
this one and the controller here gets
injected a label and with inject the
tower and the method lunch invokes the
message that said text tower dot ready
to take off and we could also start the
syndulla and with the scene builder you
see here the definition of the page and
here is the code behind the the button
is something called lunch it's a method
called lunch so what we hear hear what
we have in the presenter is a method
called lunch so we could easily extend
this but this would be probably
interesting for another podcast so thank
you for for for watching and enjoy java
fixing with convention over
configuration and dependency injection
and see you soon in one of the upcoming
upcoming conferences workshops or even
he hacks so thank you and bye
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
