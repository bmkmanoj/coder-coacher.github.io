would like to to implement a Java a7
application as talk Java 7 implication
which runs in central 7jd q18 and forced
a class 55 and which is Java 8 reference
implementation and then use and then
push it to the dock up and from there
from docker hub use pull it from rock up
and wanted as an as an as an cloud
service on Oracle container cloud so
this is the D public registry my public
key X registry which is publicly
available so all the definitions are
here but let's start with the service
definition so I would like to implement
the project and call it first I will use
my own archetype so stock travei seven
project I would use it I will use the
name clouds finish takes a while because
it fetches the archetype from maven
central so this is exactly the same
definition I use for micro Service Cloud
projects and stock Java seven projects
is not no no difference there I was rely
as possible on only one single Java 7
API dependency okay and now create the
rest endpoint and this is going to be
clouds in Ex clouds it's going to be
boundary and clouds resource is the name
of the endpoint and then I would also
use the path with the same name clouds
and it would be nice to have a method of
course which returns let's say Oracle
Duke Java and then I will mark it with
cat and this is just as simple as
possible Java 7 app and then I would I
also need to do is to implement a docker
file and I would like to inherit from
already existing GlassFish image and
then copy
the and no that is maven so there's a
target folder and the name is clouds war
and I would like to copy it into
deployment there and the deployment air
is a environment variable defined in the
super image M so this is all we need and
now switch to to the M to the project
and what I would like to do is to build
this first good maybe and then I build
it with the name a X slash because the
tech name clouds dot so um this is the
initial build so I'm still fast so what
happened now it the maven project was
build with the thin war and then annex a
to executable image with with glass 55
was was built and then I would like to
push it to the public registry a hex
clouds and hence I don't use any perfect
critics here it means it will use the
public docker registry as you can see it
pushes around 10k to the to the docker
registry and why it so quick because the
glass 55 is or it was already pushed to
the registry and therefore only the
Delta is push this only possible within
Wars or Java 7 because we have
deployment model and the application
server has to be pushed on the ones and
in the nd and the thin Wars are just
pushed as the last layer which is very
quick so um now let's go to the to the
to the Oracle container cloud and what
happened before so I created a machine
the smallest available machine and then
with I can log into the machine which
also happens here and here I can contain
add a service so I won't use any
predefined services so you see that did
some experiments so there's this class
which we five
ready testy as a executable image so I
will there create a new service and the
service name is clouds and this would be
clouds on GlassFish v5 scheduler doesn't
really matter availability the pool
image is air hags clouds is the image
name no commands everything is prepared
and ports so we need a port mapping and
this is a TCP mapping pod 8080 is mapped
to 8080 so save it and then I will save
it as well and then I have to try to
find my own service or clouds there is a
clouds I can ask it to deploy the cloud
so ok deploy it and now it pulls the
image from from the from the Oracle
cloud and it runs so this was all we
need to run the service what's
interesting here we can find out here so
we have here the path we have here the
environment entries and what we also see
there is a public IP address so what I
could do I can go here and say 8080 and
this is our GlassFish and with clouds
resources clouds we see our Oracle give
Java from Oracle cloud deploy it with
full stack class 55 without any
optimization there's no web profile is
full stack and yeah Oracle container
cloud is an interesting alternative and
what you can of course can do you can
also you can also connect to your
private registry so they are not
restricted to use the public registry so
why would we also click quick because I
pushed the central 7 in glass 55 and JDK
1 8 before this exercise and this is
also real world
because the GlassFish images don't
change very often only if we get a new
religion or new patch and what
frequently changes is the is the thin
war is the answer but this is tiny as a
good as I saw 10k which is very quick so
thank you for watching and see an
upcoming ax conferences or projects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
