like to show you I a an interesting
feature in which comes with porcupine
spy in the version of 004 so I'm
porcupine is the injects the threat
point here and what we see is is a
resource with the name of parts this is
from the earlier example and we have a
get get invocation here and we have also
hear statistics resource so let's see
whether it still works so i will just
invoke the sparks so as you can see
after 500 milliseconds I got the
response here so this was this one and i
would like to fetch the statistics and
you get a statistics here however the
statistics for the two fetching the
statistics you will have to implement
your own resource with water or they
actually did they will have to inject
the list of statistics and expose this
which is not very convenient so what the
what the porcupine edition does so we
are will have to use the 04 version and
this pie edition so I would just
redeploy the app and rerun the example
and you will see something interesting
hopefully so right let's repeat the
tasks so this is the parks but what I
can do right now I will show you the
hennas as well as you can see what
porcupine is able to do it injects for
each thread pool this is the name of
this thread pool into HTTP header all
these statistics to all resources so or
what you can do for debugging for
instance during stress tests just add
this pie ending and what you will get is
the HTTP headers will be automatically
enhanced with the key is the name of T
of the thread pool and the value are the
statistic as Jason it comes a little bit
too
cause of performance because yeah
because some civilization work has to be
done so and this is implemented with a
single class and the single class is a
writer interceptor in Java so if you go
here to porcupine spy you will see the
single class which is called HTTP header
static injector and this class injects
the HTTP headers the statistics into
HTTP headers so I'm enjoy the pics and
porcupines and see you on upcoming
workshops a hex or in projects thank you
and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
