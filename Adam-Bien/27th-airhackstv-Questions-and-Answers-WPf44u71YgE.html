some questions and answers and topics so
let's start with Erics news this is the
mailing list and what I recognized is we
have 700 subscribers so over 700
subscribers and i sent i try to send at
least once a month or at most once a
month a male with with meter contents
like about upcoming events and
conferences java user group meetings and
stuff like this okay what's also
interesting there is a workshop for
october with react and what what I just
accidentally cognized is that it reacts
reacts reacts default architecture
called flux is very very similar to do
after burn ethics and i will probably
record a screencast or or write a small
demo it is so there is very similar
which is which is somehow funny so um
the ax news this was the OD what I shown
before seven hundred subscribers is if
you like subscribe as well and even more
interesting i think at wednesday i'm at
java user group known back and i think
this is the right the right link and
they are already 48 registrations i have
no idea what the upper limit is and but
what I were going to do is I would like
to to show you how to implement web apps
in 2016 with nothing but javi and and
some daca and stuff and I hope I get
lots of questions so I'm really looking
forward to this event so if you can come
by it is a the Wednesday 8 jun at six pm
and prepare questions as always and yeah
it will be lots of fun of course this
event is completely free so um this was
interesting and of course next week
there is the classic a hex in munich and
i get daily registrations and if you can
if you like you can register as well the
next round is going to be in december or
even next year but i guess in december
and yeah and this course is also filling
up this is testing and microservices
okay now a little bit more technical
stuff so this was just fluff no stuff
and now come back to to do something
more interesting so what i did there is
a prototype of headlands when what
headlands is is a how to call je cache
exposed by arrest this would be the the
most appropriate description of
headlands and what it does it exposes
entries as key value pairs I use it on
my servants several projects already
recently is all the cash changes are
streamed via web sockets to external
clients and how it looks like is the
following I can just run it and it
should launch the tea white lie this is
the server tested with and yes looks
nice so it starts headlands on hazel car
so it takes a little bit longer because
it tries to find you know the the the
cluster participants so now it's booted
and what I also did I wrote a small
reacts app which should listen to events
and i will just connect to this
and now we'll just perform some system
tests and the system tests will create
caches and and change the caches so this
is the old system test so and if we go
back to the browser will see the
beautiful really beautiful minimalistic
react app received all the all the
events so it works really nice so I
committed all the code from the
headlands but not I will release it soon
with the new features and and headlands
is also used for configuring
microservices so I use it a lot for
different purposes is almost like a no
sequel database in which which stores
the data in memory and an older project
so this was some interesting news from
from from the github but I also did I
delivered or I created a new version of
Porcupine which is it's not released yet
but the code is there which is more
resilient and what it actually does if
you miss configure the thread pulls you
get an error from porcupine and not from
executors from Java util concurrent it
happens to be a little bit more cryptic
because it's just throws
illegalstateexception without any
content so a porcupine is going to be a
more user-friendly or we could also say
more resilient okay and what I also did
it is related to one of the questions
from today I implemented a new version
of service mock which is going to also
be released soon and and what it
actually does is it's the following
there is a smoke detector which is an
interceptor with injected pojo and
injected event and I'm going to use this
to test the DD service for smokes tests
at the application service Java 7 or
Java 8 and there is one related
questions in the two days a hex so as
always if you have any questions ask via
Twitter or via via the chat so
I would just look at a chat so busy chat
and I got the first question on Twitter
I think it was yesterday and the
question is how to pick at links single
sign-on with ssl jdbc or a more not on
Wi-Fi 10 and this is a very easy answer
from phone Philip is the picket link is
I don't know what it is deprecated but I
would suggest to use key cloak and if
you just search for key cloak key cloak
jdbc you will find the answer so you can
this is just use jdbc si si realm or
user store and with different databases
so the answer is I don't use pick a link
use use key clock okay so we have we
answered the very very first question
and now back to to java 8 News and
before I start with my blog post oracle
moves in strange ways which happened to
be extremely popular it was like ten
thousand reads in 24 hours which is
unusual for a fluffy topic it was not a
technical one I would like to tell you a
funny story so I think it was nineteen
ninety eight so I've worked for a very
large German company and I remember
someone evaluated korba this is common
household common common request broker
architecture and object request broker
architecture and someone evaluated the
decor Brown it was in early Java days
1998 and there was a developer and then
after a few weeks or I think even month
of evaluation he came out and and set up
a meeting to discuss the results and the
meeting was very short because the team
lead said while actually evaluating
korba we using an old decom for a month
and decompose the microsoft counterpart
of of korba and the funny stories they
completely forgot the guy in the room so
he evaluated for himself carbine there
was there
disappointed because at the end the
whole effort was worthless and this is
how you know big companies are sometimes
working so no one knows what the other
does doing so it's not like a large
companies are evil there are somehow
somehow chaotic but what what what I
brought is a post about my opinion on on
Oracle in activity in Java 8 and this is
actually evident so I'm what I also did
I prepared a pointer to a mailing list
and this is the official Java 8 mailing
list and this is the official answer
from from lynda de michael and she says
as most of our team members are still
currently on other assignments and which
cannot give you an estimate on this so
on what what what what is what what is
already admitted is that the AG's and
all these packets which are employed by
oracle are assigned to other tasks so
they have no more time to work on java
ee which is a little bit strange this is
why i've wrote d post the blog post why
it's so strange so basically is the
following so I'm I think Oracle earned
some money with weblogic and what logic
weblogic happens to be a java ee server
and what what happened before javaone i
was asked by different clients from all
over the world what why weblogic is so
slow with the adoption of java ee and
everyone or everyone most of my clients
were extremely unhappy with the pace of
weblogic adopting newer standards why
there were so eager to to to have the
new standards and I guess is if you know
if if nothing happens in a space is a
really bad sign for a product so they
were just curious about the future of
off wls and so after java one or at Java
12
2015 weblogic was certified being a java
7 server and everyone was happy again so
declines were happy so they had fresh
application server and the developers
could use some more api's so and now
what happens right now so oracle has
weblogic java 7 Certified Application
Server and now Oracle's peg leads have
no time to contribute to Java e8 so what
what it actually means what did what it
means is if Oracle releases new weblogic
at one point of time and there is no
java 8 they will they will properly come
with some new features but this features
can be only proprietary and in my eyes
so my eyes means I have only experienced
in bigger Europeans companies origin or
all Europeans companies another worked
actually I never had a project along the
projects in USA or in other parts of the
world but what it basically means is
that the clients will have to rely on
proprietary weblogic features and I have
to say to tell you I don't think it will
happen because what happens over time
the clients try to implement or rely on
standard and why this because even
between releases the application server
can change which is a little bit
dangerous and with Java EE you are only
relying on the relying on the standard
and whether the application server gets
a new release or not the API just cannot
change so that cannot be a change in the
API what can also what can always happen
are of course a bark like implementation
of the API could be different so in my
eyes just you know dedicating the
resource resources somewhere else is is
a not that wise if Oracle is still
interested in earning money with
weblogic and if not probably they have
other strategies like you drop weblogic
completely and do something else like
you know focus on clouds and hope that
the clients will migrate from weblogic
to the clouds which a thing is would be
also hard to convince no paying
customers to drop weblogic and move to
the clouds without java ee so to be
pretty completely depending on
proprietary api's so what I did in the
post i just remembered in the early days
of weblogic there was fire services and
it disappeared in one point of time and
we had to migrate to some to something
else this was a small thing so this is
basically the the the blog post and it
is not like criticizing Oracle why they
are inactive is just I don't understand
why they are inactive and because with
java esupport you could sell weblogic a
lot better why does because if they have
some cool features and they have
actually cool features like
multi-tenancy monitoring is huge and you
know you can run weblogic on Java
Mission Control very nicely with with
nice monitoring capabilities then their
clients will appreciate and actually the
business logic is not depending on the
proprietary stuff but they could use the
proprietary stuff on top of that and I
think this is good thing it's not like
you know everything has to be
standardized but if there is no
standards I think this is how Java
started and this was a huge mess okay
this is just just additional opinion on
this and yeah if you are if you're if
you have your opinions just put it drop
it to the chat or write a comment in my
blog even better then then there is some
more stuff there so let's go to d
someone asked me how do you find clients
or do you have a gto go after tenders
yourself I don't find any client so
usually what happens I I get requests
via email I have no accounts and licked
a linkedin facebook the only thing I
have is my youtube channel I have no ax
TV and DD one thing is i started with
java in 1995 and became independent in
1997 there's a long long time so I
gather lots of clients so I'm just
overloaded with java ee work this is
what what happens to me and I cannot
give you advice whether you should
become independent or not because
is really it depends on the person
heavily okay so this was off topic
questions but good one so we have so
this was the the Oracle moves in strange
ways what what also happens some more
news is the following where is the my
notes here there is a new release of the
security spec for java 8 and this is
quite interesting it's called Soteria
you can use it right now you can just
check out the sources and build it it
was a huge contribution phone phone
Arian from from from from from ZF from
the community and the interesting part
is you can use it right now and again
lots of questions about you know custom
stores or whatever and you see the
implementation here so this is the is
the aryan teams and there are several
authorization schemes like mmm based and
DB and custom and what i did i just
check it out and build it was move-in
clean install and builds immediately and
this is a really a nice work with if
you're interested in security and i got
lots of questions about security give it
a try provide feedback create issues a
poor request and if you would contribute
to know just let aryan know and Ariane
is a outside hyperactive guys like he
working i think day and night and
cranking some code and a greatcoat so on
thank you for this does this was the
shot area okay another one another good
one is repeatable annotations that is
actually good stuff so what will happen
some specs and this was also form from
from linda de michael she said okay
repeating annotation are going to be
addressed not by all specs because she
has no influence on all these pecs but
at least on the common annotations my
snow release and and yeah this is this
is a good news for for for java ee why
this because no at least something
happens so we get some little changes
like
I ate support in Java e8 so and so
what's also interesting the if we go to
jsf spec and we go to the I actually
forgot worthy this is Mahara github it's
the mirror yes its protective and why
it's active because the community is
active and as you can see another
hyperactive guy below see it actually
working with Ariane so you see Ariana
and button below stay they are cranking
code like crazy here and are going for
GSF they are supporting jsf so I'm
actually also great story how community
can help Oracle so if Oracle doesn't
have does not have enough resources to
support java 8 were community community
can step in and yeah this is the GSF
story and what else we weld is also
released so there is a new alpha release
from wealth and there should be worst
days weld 30 alpha alpha 6 is released
this one and what I searched for 16 yeah
and this was it's released and there is
even newer one saw it on the weld
website a great news they also working
there are lots of caught lots of lots of
activity going on so so we have wealth
we have jsf and repeat of annotations so
far it's a good for for java ee 8 news
and now start with the remaining regular
questions so any questions from us like
no questions here and chat is also
quiet so then go back to the questions
so we covered the Oracle stuff and the
first question is the Interceptor class
and what happens here we have an
interceptor with injected bean and this
didn't work for Jay paranda and my
answer was it should work so I brought
him an email which is exception usually
I don't answer technical questions
anymore I expect to file the questions
here and and what I did I enhanced
service Moke this is what I showed
showed you earlier so this is the
exactly this and this is also an
interceptor with injected pojo and this
poggio can be a man in gb as well or
something which is scoped and this
always worked for me so it seems like
I'm back from the application server in
the in the case of of Jay parranda so I
would say try out the service mock the
recent code and it should work if it
doesn't it's probably server back so we
cover this question okay now it gets a
little bit more interesting so there is
a jax p implementation of and he asked
me problem with a single single slotted
lists or collection so collection with
single size they behaved strangely and
the problem usually in glassfish is the
built-in jettison and jettison had not
is a back or feature but if if you
rendered something which is single
slaughtered list it was rendered as an
object not as an array which caused some
problems on the JavaScript side and
therefore usually what we did in the
past with glassfish was we we tried a
Jackson which worked fine and in the
recent pyara I think there's eclipsing
moxie already built in so the answer is
use Jackson should work out of the box
and if it
doesn't instead of glassfish what you
should use is pyara so there is a payara
fish and what pyara fish is is glass
fish with with commercial support from
from the payara cometas which are again
hyperactive so this is my github account
as you can see you know they are just
spamming my timeline I don't know how
many commits a day they perform but this
is a crazy what's going on here so just
try pyara and see whether whether they
still get the the problem because class
fish is not very eager so what what's
also true is the GlassFish v5 is like
there is no activity at Oracle site and
they'd also done not not accepting any
any extent external contributions right
now so I would say glassfish dddd future
of glassfish glassfish is unknown but
the future of pyara is bright law right
now looked really great and I know lots
of customers who actually using pyre and
they are very happy with it so I'm to
answering question from we can actually
close this and close that from from
Stewart is try pyara first then look at
Jackson and Jackson solve my problems
with which this realization and even I
use them I think it was Jackson provider
Adam bean I even made it work with Tommy
and this was two years ago and why I did
it because I had exactly the same
problem with with the with the
collections as you had okay next one
questions are regarding headlands and
this is why I actually show you
headlands because as related the
question here and and what he asks me
I'm using a start-up singleton in
headlands and why I'm doing this I could
also use application scoped and this is
very true and I just change it because
it doesn't actually matter and the
benefit as he says is
testability so what I did I change the
initializer and it is no more at
singleton its application scoped which
which boots itself so it looks a little
bit differently in the case of egb you
will have to start to ride at singleton
at startup and in case of application
scope you have to dilute this you can
say observes initialized application
scope and you have to pass an argument
of course which does not matter in my
case so I would say the egb way is a
little bit more concise because we can
write startup and and and not and then
post construct and not descriptive stuff
but this I don't need each ibiza at all
and and and it is easier to test with
for instance delta spike so I don't need
any specific any special egb support to
write integration tests for that and
this was actually the question so I
changed that is committed so thank you
for the hint and why I did it because in
I think I did it anyway in marina for
Gino jc2 in mid-2014 configuration
client I did the same so it's these are
older code from me so i'm from january
and i already used this approach say
okay if someone asks about this we just
initialize headlands in the same way as
does this as this project so arm it's
just matter of style i would prefer this
one and the other one is a little bit
more cryptic but easier to test so i
will go for the photo cryptic for now
and now his question is multiple threats
could enter the cash and create a new
cash yes but it really depends on
implementation but this is idempotent
call because the cash name and
configuration
are the same and with the same
configuration you would get you know the
same result so nothing should happen and
what will happen in in future I will
split the initializer and the manager
the two classes I was just too lazy for
this okay so Michael thank you for the
hints and and yes I changed their coach
to your suggestions and now I will
probably write a short blog post about
this and now the next one yeah this is
the Moxie dependency in glassfish and
the answers here look at pyara and on
pyara server or try with jackson and in
the newest glassfish releases moxie
should be should be enabled anyway okay
so i think we covered right now
everything so we have the single element
which we covered this we covered the
concurrency and we also covered is the
issue with moxie and glassfish so a
little bit more interesting or a bit
more interesting controversial is about
local and remote interfaces an
anti-pattern and this is an interesting
one so I just worries my here an old
blog post from when 2009 and seven years
ago there were lots of articles that
having local and remote interface is for
nany gb is an anti-pattern and no one
actually said why so it's like you
shouldn't do this and and I could never
the answer why not so I've wrote
actually the post and saying this is
perfectly fine to have in local and
remote interfaces and actually use this
pattern frequently and what I did I
exposed by a remote interface you know
the coarse grain stuff and via local
interfaces like a friend relations to
other comp oh
and yeah and it worked fine so but what
happens now seven years later is I don't
have remote interfaces anymore why not
because the main communication channel
became jax-rs so it is easy enough and
you can you know on the other side you
can you can have angular react or
ember.js clients on actually HTML
clients or IOT clients or whatever iOS
IOT Android which are talking to us and
the funny story is or the good story is
if you don't need remote interface we
can also skip the local interface
because all public methods are actually
the comprise the local interface so my
ejb don't have any interfaces right now
and I would argue having local or remote
interface is an anti-pattern right now
because we don't need them remote should
be forbidden because first we get the
serialization errors and second only
Java classes can access jar java clients
can access the back end and and then
Java clients are not that popular
anymore I would say you know html5 or
native mobile clients are more popular
than then korba based or mi based
communication there are some mi or
serialization flows in Java so remote
you should use this and if you don't
need remote the ozone don't need a local
because all public interfaces comprise
the local interface so this is the story
behind local and remote and yeah and I
hope I address the question and and but
the actual question is is there any
penalty to use a remote and the answer
is if you would use remote without any
further configuration there is a penalty
why because you would force the
application server to copy parameters
and return values or another copy to
clone them because it specified that way
and I think
I also write a blog post to actually
forgot about this annum and remote
optimization and this is I think how is
called in glassfish I think it was a
call by reference seems like so and two
years later call there is an
optimization all known application
servers and you can do this in the
proprietary diploma descriptor from egb
jar and this is called like called by
reference but in glassfish I think call
by reference glassfish pass by reference
exactly and this pass by reference if
you put this you can you you will have
the same performance of for ed remote as
at local still don't use it I think
jax-rs it should be the preferred way to
as a communication channel in 2016 but
yes there will be no performance penalty
if you're using this so now this is also
interesting so what ND did he wrote a
property resolver which reads properties
and makes them injectable and this is
actually very similar to to marina which
makes the headlands cash injectable it
is interesting for micro services and he
has the question and this is like
strange behavior like on deployment and
second time he will find the properties
but the first time not and if you uses
the web interface it always works so
what ice what I think is the fault what
happens the following I don't know which
ide and he's using probably he is
deploying via ID and
and in exploded format and just if the
application that property didn't change
the ID ID didn't copy the application
those properties or whatever and then
was just not pick up by d x by x wife
rides a bus or whoever I just in my case
I never had such a problems but what I
often do is I use the command line
interface to gauge to get sure to deploy
the things and if you and I'm being
white fly deploy CLI so then for
instance this one and if you use the
command line interface it's a far more
convenient then then the D web page and
then you should always find the
properties so don't rely on the IDE rely
on command line is the best one or what
I do right now I use docker for this and
da creek or my doc image always contains
the whole application server plus the
war and there was never such and never
such a problem so what I think what
happens in your case is you're using
proprietary deployment of the IDE and
and at the second time you know the IDE
just recreates everything and then why'd
they finally or eventually finds the
application properties this is what I
think what happened so don't think is a
fault from your from your property
resolver rather than the problem is your
deployment process so i would suggest
try the command line interface and then
let us know whether it work for you or
not okay now let's see what happens here
it's oracle dropping support for
netbeans as they could broken glass fish
in the download no I don't think so that
this our DD first what means support
what I think there is no commercial
support for netbeans available yet what
a glassfish Java is the recent glassfish
for is still the valid java 7
implementation so it is perfectly valid
for netbeans to ship glassfish
but what it can also do you can just
download pyara and replace glass fish
with pyara so this is what what you can
do and actually if you go to my NetBeans
where is it and this is what I always do
the GlassFish year one of the glass
fishes is from NetBeans with ships with
with netbeans I guess this one and pyara
looks like glass fish but i just
installed it separately and pointed
NetBeans to pyara i just say it add
glassfish server and just a search and
and then i just edit the payara one and
i have different a glassfish instances
because of my of my clients ok so and
yeah and jdeveloper so I my
understanding is jdeveloper comes with
many NetBeans components and ADF no idea
about the future of ADF so so Andy the
real project use docker and copies the
war over in diploma for the White House
can see fault and deposit it does also
not work that's interesting so on what
end is saying I probably is the ND from
from the from the github guests that the
rule project used Dhaka and it does not
work the first time this is really
curious what it actually be means if you
if you repackage the docker image if you
recreate the doctor mentioned and
started the second time then it works in
the first time not so I cannot imagine
that so if it doesn't work in Dhaka then
is something problem then is something
wrong with the code i would say ok what
could be where a second where you are
testing this property resolver post
construct where I using this actually
now there is no use what could be that
you are injecting your properties into
for instance and ejb and the the the
property gets cached
and if you if the egb is recreated you
get the fresh value something like this
this this could happen okay also very
interesting so our video in 2013 and and
you are saying okay I'm relying on
Eclipse entity boundary control pattern
this is this one it's an action not not
from eclipse oh it's very old I think
BCE object pound let's see boundary
control entity book something with
objects no nice and this was either mr.
rum something like this no sorry from
yes or push
it's an ancient stuff but I just cannot
find a book anymore there was an like
object-oriented design by Grady Booch
let's try this object-oriented Grady
Booch book
okay cannot find it I have someone and
somewhere and in this book the entity
controlled boundary pattern appears
first and why it's so important because
this book is older than you AM L itself
so and the employee in pact is all known
drawing tools are supporting this
pattern so this is the this is the
background of the story and I just have
to go to the gist bank and he's asking
me it seems like the control is always
mandatory and my variation of the
pattern says you can control is fully
optional so I'm what you have to know is
what was my motivation to reinvent or
two to find the BCE pattern and and use
it again and the motivation is simple so
I actually have wrote up chairman book
and this was like Java EE patterns
patterns and I'm being not this one it
is the for software and supports of the
air support old one hmm forgot actual
meta title from the book just do it this
was German ones we just try it in German
yes the enterprise architect one was the
first one and there was another one
called Java e5 patterns I think you see
this was ten years ago java-- fiber
architectures so in this old Java five
architectures book I introduce my own
layers so it was like facade service and
domain and it worked well the problem
with that was it was even older it is a
it is nine years ago the problem with
this is in all my projects I had to
justify why this name so why I'm calling
the first lie if I said anode service
layer and or service for said or
whatever whatever I chosen I was always
wrong and and what I did two or three
years later is for the orange book and
after for a green book the english one
would you probably know this real world
java reward patterns is this one and in
this book are starting with the orange
one in 2009 two years later i said ok
the semantics are the same but i tried
to find a standard and the ddd most
closed standard i found was BCE and
boundary control entity and since then
it just took off I never had to justify
the names because I always say no told
told the story about Grady Booch and the
control boundary control entity story
and so that there was since I think I
can't remember any meeting just trying
to justify the name there was one
conference in Poland who someone
approached me why the names I explained
the names and yeah and then I never had
you know to explain the naming again
and but i would say feel free to modify
it a little bit and what I don't believe
is in very restrictive in very
restrictive rules where you can say no
you always have to to implement control
in fact last week one of my clients we
had the discussion I performed a code
review on on a startup project and they
always use control and the impact was
the the boundary was sometimes empty
just tell agates to the controller say
okay don't do it this way if the
boundaries empty just delete the
boundary and make the control the
boundary some I would say it is really
it is really important that the that
controls are optional and not mandatory
I hope I hope I explained it oh and he
likes the microservices workshop what is
it is java ee microservices this is the
workshop and he likes it so thank you
this is this 155 episodes about Java
microservices or thank you for for the
hint and now three hours ago there's a
new one no this is a 12 hours ago what a
thousand oracle application development
framework so my understanding is there
is a new release and I my understanding
is that Oracle so I'm not I never used
ADF I have to admit but Oracle is
investing a little little bit more is my
impression in oracle jet which is html5
JavaScript framework and this one looks
interesting and reasonable and my
understanding is this this ADF is is
becoming a little bit more less
interesting in but I have really no
experience with ADF
and this is interesting I envy you
saying it's advertised as a Java
framework but speaking frankly I fail to
see the Java apart beside the fact you
need a weblogic server to run an ADF
application so this is actually what I
would I said Oracle moves in strange
ways because if something like this
happens in my project it becomes no more
interesting for for larger projects does
ADF play a role are all in your projects
not in my projects so i never used ADF
in my projects and never saw a project
with ADF but i know that is such
projects exists but this is probably
they i won't get hired if someone would
like to have ADF okay so Robert asked me
he likes the video so there's some I
think a hex I oh and these are all
videos i recorded so far this is a
bootstrap effective java testing and
microservices or I equally popular
interestingly and they are watch from I
don't know 50 plus countries so it's
really amazing how popular Java gets do
you have plans for more yes I'm thinking
right now I'm just thinking about
recording I am not so Java 7
architectures this is a virtue by the
ipod munich and i don't think it would
work as an online version because we
have lots of discussion here and if i
would just talk about this topics here
via i'm in online in an online way i
think it would be completely boring
because i would just say no you don't
need transactions go with rest and
everyone will say but what if and this
is what if happens at munich airport
where we discussed no transactions for
one hour so i think I'm enough I don't
think it's a good idea to record the
online variant of the of the or online
version of the Java architectures what
I'm thinking about is more JavaScript
one and common javascript is 2015 or no
more modern JavaScript probably react or
something like you I html5
something like this and topics like
probably persistence or security or
something like this does what I'm
thinking about adjust have several
agendas but didn't started to record
anything why because are too many
concurrent projects right now which
witch is which is which is good so okay
so I think this was the last question
from from from github so let's see what
happens here so there are no questions
in twitter so andy says the beam is the
beam it used properly resolver and then
singled Anichebe maybe the producer are
not ready it's initiation time I don't
think so but if you would like to go
sure make it at startup annotated with
at startup and then it should be ready
at that time and it's strange problem
you have i expended a lot with
configuration and always worked in my
case so on so our Stewart says you can
run ADF English but only glassfish 31
and have the ADF essentials library okay
and didn't even knew that so thank you
stuart for this it's very slow but nice
for cross-platform mobile okay so if you
need so you have no experience with this
is what's two hours to art is saying and
he see he seems to be an ADF expert so
brehm says so i have to come to munich I
think so for architectures you will have
to go to come to Munich and by the way
we have at Indies from India Costa Rica
Brazil and whatever so actually whatever
sorry but I forgot it this is what
whatever meant so there are some there's
actually the attendees so lots of undies
from all over the world and Dubai Greece
Saudi Arabia is crazy so you can
absolutely come and actually the Germans
were always in not minority but about
fifty percent of the of the attendees
so no questions then thank you for
watching see you and in Munich a hex
calm see you online workshops if you
like and keep asking so i will set up
tomorrow this gifts for the 28th a hex
TV and so i will write some blog post
about the topics from from this ax so
about the initialization startup versus
application scoped and topics i show you
right now and also announced the
releases of headlands porcupine and
serve a smoke so um thank you for
watching and see you next time next
month the first monday of the month at 6
