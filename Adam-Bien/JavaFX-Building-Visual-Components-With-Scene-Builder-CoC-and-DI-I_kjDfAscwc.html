would like to build a simple java fix
component from scratch so I would like
to use a maven archetype so call me a
hex it's the name and I would like the
igniter and the current version is 1/8
so just use the latest one and I would
like to call the project a component so
what happens right now it creates a very
simple application called component
which is actually set up as a making
applications which is actually ready to
go and it comprises a flight control
backend component which is actually a
proxy to the application server and a
front-end component called follow me and
so let's try to build another component
so I would just like to start it for you
from dick second of course wait I can of
course build that so I will fill it with
maven it's actually a standard bird
built what I'm just doing I'm using GD
k18 because Java pics classes are in JDK
1/8 and JDK 1/7 updates 45 and I just
used JDK 1/8 and now I can start the
application j8 is my ally s target
component app gotcha so as you can see
it somehow works so let's do something
more fancy I would like to build another
component and just displayed somewhere
here on the screen so how to do that so
I would start would like to start with a
package and I will call the package so
we have follow me let's do a pushback
another vehicle and because convention I
would like to create a view called push
back view push back view
and the pushback view has to extend from
F XML view not yes
extends F XML view just to be done no
the view is good then I would like to
create an F XML file and it has the name
has to be good Frank
like the name of the folder so it says
push back and I would like to use a
control and in a create new one called
not controller but presenter push back
presenter and we don't need any CSS but
it would create a CSS for you so this is
just and once more think what I would
like to do I would like to put the push
back a fix ml in one place here so
everything sticks together so the idea
is that you will get presented view the
F XML CSS and resourcebundle in one
folder like it is here so it's just
easier to work with
so um actually we are ready to go so in
XML of the presenters registered we have
one view and we have the presenter and
what I would like to do is to integrate
this view into the follow me view so how
to do this and I just launched the scene
builder this is a free tool is well
integrated with NetBeans IntelliJ or
Eclipse and I would like to use a split
pane so I would like to introduce a
split pin here so now we have two paints
and I will just move and I would like
just to move the label and D button to
the anchor or the first one and the
button as well almost almost
so now it looks almost okay so we have
the anchor pane and this one does split
pane the split pane I would like to fit
the parent so we have our application on
the left side usually you would create a
standalone view and I would like to
the the pushback on the rights on the
right side so how to do this how to
achieve that
so I'm actually easy so I would like to
name the anchor pain here I would like
to end campaign right right pain because
on the right side and as you can see I'm
already warned by by the symbol though
that it does not exist but I'm going to
present a and would like to inject an
ankle pain right pain and use FX ml for
that and then I would do the following I
would create the push back view or just
say push back view just create with new
and then let's integrate that right pain
get view excuse me
push back view push back you get a few
and I would like to trend review as you
can see is just a parent and then I
would like to create to put that parent
to the ant to integrate the parent with
the right pane so it looks good the only
thing I would like to do I would like to
do something here so us nice control
just go with the label and I will just
write something here like pushing like
crazy and nothing happens so so we have
our wonderful view of course it could be
interactive so just put the pattern here
so and now let's write out so again we
can fill that
and start the application and if I will
launch the view you see pushing away
crates and nothing happens so we can
create the views dynamically or inject
them as you like and yeah the framework
framework I call that class work behind
the scenes is called afterburner but
they are just two classes is actually
very very simple so thank you for
watching see you in one of upcoming
conferences workshops projects or even
ax actually will spend several hours
talking about UI architectures in one of
the upcoming ax so thank you for
watching and yes you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
