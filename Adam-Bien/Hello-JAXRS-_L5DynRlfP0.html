service from scratch with jax-rs Java 6
and GlassFish so I would like to start
with a maven project so it just would be
maven web application and content
hello rest and its GlassFish java 6 web
profile sufficient and what happens
behind the scenes it creates a maven
project with meeting archetype and I
would like to start with a simple java
class i could also use some wizards but
i will just get rid of that just use
plain plain Java class call it hello
resource the ending resource is actually
a convention so I won't use the here no
rest and now what I need to do is to
specify a path I will just use path and
say this class has to be bound to hello
and we need a method which returns
something which can be converted to a
string in our case this is just a string
and I'm this method has to listen to get
requests and it produces it produces
explain thanks playing just a text and
it returns
pittsburgh's so you're almost done as
you see there is one warning so on this
warning is because NetBeans recognized
that we need some rest configuration we
could use a wizard but I would just
would like to create it from scratch for
you and I call the class rest rest
config it's just my personal convention
rest config extends a application the WS
are a score application and I have to
specify a path this is actually really
important
so I use the resources right now in
project as sometimes sometimes I use
here a version number so um we are
actually ready to go so I will save
everything in just one day application
which causes the application server to
start this is GlassFish in our case and
deploy everything using maven and it
should open a browser yeah right now and
I will just put resources and hello as
you can see it seems to work so thank
you for watching enjoy Java 6 and
restful web services and see you one on
one of my upcoming workshops or
conferences so thank you I
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
