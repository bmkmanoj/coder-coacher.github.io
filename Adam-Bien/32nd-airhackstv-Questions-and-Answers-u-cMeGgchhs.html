start with the content and the show so
something interesting happened and I was
approached by Monsieur Alexander gurkha
and he is a student at school in austin
and said our teachers awesome and the
teacher really likes java ee so and it
is actually a fanboy of a hex TV and
it's ok no problem so let's cover a
teacher and this is the mr. Thomas toots
and he's interest in Java EE and he made
the students excited about javi so now
is your job so this teacher will have
his birthday soon so you have to send
him some wishes and at least follow him
he's just 21 followers which is our
shame so after the show it should has at
least 100 or more and everyone funny you
should should send him a best wishes and
it seems like Monsieur toots Thomas
toots is the best java java ee teacher
ever and this is really important I just
remember my study my time I had really
great teachers and they were they made
me really exciting about C and C++ back
then and yeah and this is why I still
enjoy programming so kudos to teachers
like Monsieur stutes &amp;amp; you should follow
him so as like oh I have to sign up so I
will do it after the show so I will
follow mrs. usha toots and this also
your job to follow him so this was this
and big thanks to Monsieur Alexander
gurkha mentioned in his teacher is
unusual what's interesting is his class
is like 5a which is usual and I suppose
H is like who shul is high school and I
f is for informatics I think okay now
what happens in India hex land so first
I'm announcing a new workshop in Munich
webapp essentials why this so I'm after
the reactant angular courses and what I
did the first two hours were almost
identical because i introduced the
concept of egg mass 6 the javascript and
so forth and i hate about talking about
the same content twice so what i did i
extract it whatever nessa
sorry to understand alone course we just
covers no frameworks just dumb
javascript and CSS hands-on so just
hacking just coding without any
additional frameworks and the and the
idea is to show what's possible without
any additional framework so i won't
mention the basics about JavaScript
basics in react and angular courses
anymore what's also interesting happened
there were some attendees who attended
both the angular 2 cores and react
afterwards and i have to say all the
attendees like three a lot more than
angular width yeah everyone he said ok
react is a nicer to use an easier to use
i actually like both but reacts of
course easier if you're building jazz in
a single page app react seems a little
bit yeah nice and cleaner ok so this was
this and then I got idea most requested
course ever javi performance so I'm the
only problem is we probably don't have
the largest room and I put the six
anymore so the the audience a little bit
smaller so I'm what I think in this
course what we will do we just focus on
performance and robustness and
scalability no back hunting memo leaks
hunting bottlenecks synchronized static
whatever exciting in Java EE world also
with the agnostic monitoring actually
forgot a thing to mention monitoring in
the agenda implementing monitoring and
usage of tools like Java Mission Control
and memory analyzer and and visual vm
and whatever so this is this and this is
the workshops i mentioned n of course if
you like come in december so we get
daily registrations we have the largest
rooms that there shouldn't be a problem
so now back to twitter and i got the
nice the first question is use system
guitars property or create string junior
resource and inject via resource and I
got the question several times and what
strikes me many people don't even know
that you can use Jan di for for
configuration you could do this the
problem I have with that is usually
there is no nice way to to administer
this on application servers so what I
would prefer is not even
system.getproperty so what I will
resist what I did here is environment
entries so just make larger this is from
the JC to project and why environment
entries because then you made the map
injectable or it doesn't have to be a
map you can just use no individual keys
but the nice story is you can configured
using docker from outside and and and
this is I think they're the way to go so
this is the what I suggest user system
property is the easiest possible way
just just go for it if you're on docker
environment entries might be even better
and by the way there is no better way I
would ask you know what is the easiest
possible way and then I will choose
properties or environment entries over
jndi properties but if you already have
in our nice tool available how to
administer jndi properties then go with
the tool so it really really depends
what you are would like to do okay and
by the way I described this in the green
book real world java ee patterns and and
how to bind the gin di properties as a
possible way to configure applications
so i hope this question is answered and
by the way the JC to project what it
basically does where is it here is it it
makes injectable je cache properties and
so you can just use for instance hazel
cast or or je cache and and or je cache
oh it's called infinite span and make
them available for for for injection i
also describe that in the java ee micros
my java micro-services workshop services
java ee micro-services workshop and
somewhere you will find this life so
there should be a video how to how to
inject properties service configuration
with environment entries and dr. so if
you're curious about this look at that
okay so covered so what happens in
Twitter nothing Chet busy yeah the
Beretta cos he was in Munich and he had
as a remember Brett he really liked the
growing wine at the airport Munich
and yeah so Brett Worcester from USA so
actually I don't know why there are lots
of attendees coming to Munich from USA
and we had the last air hex even from
India so um yeah I'm I'm really glad
that so many people come from all over
the world to Munich so so long and the
funny story is I thought I can just do
it in German and what happened was the
very first a hex in Munich there was
actually no German so from there they
came from all over the world so so thank
you for this ok so we had this so with
other topics do we have so let's start
with the regular show so first the first
one is the longer description but is the
question and this is should we focus on
just mark make the font a little bit
larger should we focus on servlet like
servlet filters security or CDI state
and whatever so should we we should wish
where should be the focus should be the
focus on web security or is it better to
focus on CD I security and i would say
it really depends i remember java
projects where we had to authenticate or
authenticate it was instance-based roles
so what basically meant depending on the
data set in the database we had to
decide whether the users authenticate or
not so what we had to use this we are to
have JP a specific security so this
would be even deeper than then suggested
here but he's right usually you could
just focus on on the servlet and and
jax-rs security this is what what
usually happens is my project right now
with react and angular by the way I'm
involved 50 50 50 of my JavaScript
projects are reacting fifty percent as
angular tues it's not like you know i'm
just-just to just angular 2 or just
react and and all of them we just focus
on on usually token-based security and
if there is something more to implement
we use key cloak so i think there will
be another question soon though we are
we use key cloak for more evolved
security
so and and he asked a now contain a cold
application code what I also tend to do
sometimes is to mix both so i use the
container code for authentication and
the custom code for authorization and i
even wrote an article and i did it in
several screencasts so let's see what I
will find it java magazine java ee
security and adam bean this should be
this exactly it's a three years old
article and what i did there is i just
use the authenticated user the principle
as key and and exposed my own principal
which was looked up in a database and
then I was completely flexible so this
is what I also did in the past okay so
we have this hopefully covered and the
next one is so the shy guy says many
thanks for this great work so actually
I'm not working as a lots of fun and by
the way there's this deity the guy from
Ostia was the only this dude is the
first example the another example was
javaone someone approached me there was
the Java user group from Paraguay and
they liked dije XD so does like a
phenomenon you know a great time-saver
for me because i only have you know to
answer the questions once a month but
people seem to like it so and now the
question our connection pool is more
reliable than cmp container manage
persistence application server data
sources in enterprise applications so
what I think what the question is arch
GDB see more reliable than this police
are are the times we're running exposing
a web service ok there's different
questions the first this one I think my
my my opean didn't change a lot so I
consider to use cases the first use
cases you are interested in the
individual rows in a table like you know
user blog entries articles whatever but
there are cases where you are not into
rested in the instances you are more
interested in the data and one example I
can give you is I think archive Adam bin
da da let's see exactly so this thing is
generated so this is actually the
contents of my whole block and this is
generated by an iterator and SPG so what
it does is the end iterator connects
directly to database it reads as a
stream the D table converses to Notre
all set and converts that to adjacent
stream which is transformed with SPG
that is like a JavaScript template
engine so you can just just look at that
here so this was the n hydrator and this
n hydrator is its project for imports
exports where you are more interested in
the whole table not the individual data
set and is used a lot i also use it and
there is no or m no cmp nothing also you
can use it on server and it's actually
even using in some commercial project so
if you go to my block and search for
interviews you will find some so um so
why that because yeah because I'm more
interested in this just you know too
fast read the data and convert the data
in place to a HTML page I would never
use che PA or MS for this because will
be a huge overhead so I would have you
know look at the table generated JP
entities then converted jpa entities
back to Jason without any added value so
I hope your question is answered and
this is the same in my projects in one
of my current subprojects we are we are
accessing directly start procedures at
the host system so there is no or em in
place we just use plain jdbc and and we
are done in other projects we use jpa
because it's faster and easier so before
we you know fiddle with with jdbc
rosettes and result sets jpa and
entitymanager is way faster and easier
okay I hope I answer the question so our
twitter is quiet
okay qualification when would you
recommend going to the jazz big way to
do authentication if you have some you
know if the default is no more enough
then use just because oh I know some
customers who used just speak because
they have custom how it's called the
authentication service and they plucked
in this with Chesapeake so are and if
going that route what would be the
advantages here you have the total
flexibility with Chesapeake yeah but
before before you look at Chesapeake
look at sotiria and it is like a
reference implementation of Java 8 which
already runs on Java 7 so Roman 81 asked
me did you have a highly loaded network
projects in Java using net framework not
but I think Twitter is based on Nettie
and as you can see is pretty stable
right now or so we are streaming right
crazy no Twitter don't crash so does not
crash so um twitter is based on on
Nettie to my knowledge and I used in one
project it was a no it's not used now
when a second is called I have to blog
about this I forgot actually from forgot
to announce the project what it is the
three years old it's a ftp server which
runs on javi is it could be based on
Nettie but it isn't it what did actually
use our forgot it actually it uses an
apache software think and have to be
serviced later second it was on apache
ftp server no it not it's not based on
Nettie so that is not high performance
stuff and they will scale I didn't use
it recently I thought I use it now but
it's based on ftp user so I'm put is
based on on Nettie to my knowledge ok
perfect so now go with the next one by
the way you remember the last text my
system crashed and had the reason for
this is the first time in history
of X I used keynote slides and what
keeno did it changed the frame per
second settings so my screen capture
tool couldn't capture the screen which
was black and this was the reason why
the whole screencast cached crashed so
by the way there is a saying you know a
slide don't crash in my case they do so
usually nothing happens if I code so it
was stable except the last Java one
session everything was way too slow I
dont still don't know why but it was too
slow but I will never open a keynote or
PowerPoint in my presentation because it
really crashed my machine so be careful
with slides so we cover this we cover
that and i lost my list of questions so
back to this so are the times we're
running exposing a web service on the
JVM are more robust better than on
application server say why throw pyara
so um I think we have a different
opinion a bit about the application
server so I'm usually not using
application server because it's faster
usually why you should application
server be faster than JVM it is a JVM
app I'm using application server because
they are more convenient so like no
deployments already set administration
done logging done nice UI done and with
JVM you will have to do a lot of
plumbing to get the same result so i
make sure lea regardless how simple the
applications my mmm projects are i'm
using usually using a full-blown pyara
or a full-blown whitefly so don't even
consider the micro options usually and
the only reason where I we choose JVM
over application service let's say this
I like you know high security project
and you would like to reduce the how
it's called attack attack surface so if
you just have JVM you know there's less
less to attack than the application
server but then be careful because if
you're just running a JVM and then you
will know pool half of the internet of
libraries and then you will get you know
the same problem again
so they might be you know but I don't
know any scenario where JVM would be no
more whatever than an application server
because if you actually on my youtube
channel here I recorded some let's I it
should be memory uses of java ee 7
application servers running on dakka and
the overall application service if
you're interesting look at this so I
compared to the application server to
JVM and this was in my eyes almost no
difference in regarding the heap size so
just look at that okay and by the way
because they already open this is also
one of my topics so what I did I
recorded some screencaps with
long-standing open questions and Hellas
checks on docker someone asked me this
on only hacks and also prior and my
granddaughter will later to this so what
I did I create a docklands image with
pyara micro and and use pyar microbe for
deployment and show the difference to
full-blown pyara so if you are there was
several questions about this we come
back to that and I was invited to
conferences high load in Minsk and I did
this high-performance Java EE the talk
was uploaded and building mobile first
services with the killer micro service
platform of course is javi and so it was
in bucharest in romania ok so back to
the questions i hope is answered yeah
Monsieur rots cash def read cash death
is quiet so he's seems to be happy
twitter it's ok so i'm really curious
whether Monsieur said that that's a ha I
think German that's e or something
completely different that's evil each is
I and that's English sure but he but he
mentioned something I mentioned on the
Java one talk in your Java one
presentation you talk about using the
automatic House Resolution their dhaka
so for instance con and prop and as you
said you are using your local
application server to develop and not
dr. eyes instances but what if you
develop in to services at once so he
asked me what happens if I have multiple
services and ones do you just edit your
hosts file time to resolve the host if
you are working in condom from the same
time so the issue is what we can do with
with Daka there's also a screencast but
I know it's still there there should be
there should be a screencast about
staging external external resources with
docker eyes java application so if you
are interested in that look at this this
is exactly what what he's talking about
so um so what you can do with daca if
you if you start dhaka image you can you
can pass an entry to atc hosts file and
doctor will resolve that so it will
resolve this host we would ever like and
he asked what happens even multiple such
resources so first if you think about
microservices the idea is you have micro
services in one data source is really
not that common that the micro service
will access no five data sources so
usually what i have is one-to-one
relations in my current project is a
oracle database in different projects
elasticsearch my current project so
there is no tissue there and and before
this there was an one postgres instance
and the other micro servers are doc
arised so you don't have you know the
issue all the time but if you will get
to such worries then you get two entries
and but i don't think you will get more
than two so I don't even know what the
issue is but if I would develop two
instances twice at the same time to
micro service at the same time what I
would do I will create two domains on my
pyara or white lie and launch them a
different parts on my machine to have
more realistic scenario and by the way
it is not exactly true what I said
because what I said at javaone is
usually are not I'm not running the
application server on dakka during my
development time but in my current what
if this is true in the first face so
what happens usually is in the first few
weeks we're working like crazy with Java
EE and then the work is basically done
so you don't have to touch the
applications of a lot and then I push it
to a docker and done then I
spent all the time in NPM yarn or
whatever just to develop the JavaScript
fondant so this is this is the
difference so if you know if the Java
Eve work is not done I'm using the stock
applications of my machine more often
but if it's table I just run docker
because more convenient and it's are
more repeatable usually a mess up you
know my my local instances always
because I create a lots of proof of
concepts and samples so they never work
my local application service a good one
don't let's see here a cool someone from
Greece on Ecuador so this is like a
global global audience so um thank you
for watching crazy so this is a good one
could you tell about deployment pipeline
it's trivial to build docker images on
continuous integration but how to do you
update it in production do you ssh to
production servers and run script
already stored on prod server never so
this is the reason why I created the
document stuff and the document project
is actually more or less what I do in
production so have one image we just
comprises the operating system in Java
another image here let's say pyara where
is it let's say pyara fool inherits from
from the java and then i have let's say
pyara pink which would be the
application image and this is just the
application now the thing is this image
is going to be rebuilt in case there's a
java java patch or operating system
patch the payara thing has to be a image
has to be rebuilt in case there is an
pyara pitch and this is rebuilt several
times a day so what it basically means
if you have a critical critical park in
production you will have to rebuild if
it is operating system back this bar at
this image then this image and then you
can launch this image on different part
read out the traffic and kill the old
one it's like rolling updates so this is
what happens and actually I had a
conversation several times with the ops
people they always told me a week
we can now patch you know our our
operating systems like really you can
patch everything without restarting the
server signaled everything but we could
do this okay with doc is even better
because you really could do this with H
a proxy you can swap the instances in a
running system so this is real world so
and this is a you know a a simple
version of this and this is actually
Docklands from github so if you go to
github and search for Docklands so you
will find all the images here and there
are some new images so what I had
elasticsearch I have Kabana is not
announced yet on my blog no time for
that and pyara micro we'll come back to
this so there is Empire micro image if
your interests in this so you see seven
days old and on that note what was it I
think hop hop docker dot-com I think its
user and X a X cool so I'm this are on
all the images from docklands in binary
format so don't even have to build them
you can just download them this is all
the but it's already used a lot you can
see x java was pulled 114 times which is
not bad because this had didn't mention
it too often so it's like you know
hidden project okay cool I hope you got
that so what did basically mean is not
like you have one huge image with doc I
you you have several images which depend
on each other and the cool story is your
javi built is then crazy fast because
Java clearly separates the
infrastructure from the from the
business logic and therefore is a
perfectly suitable for for running on
dakka okay cyprus and kazakhstan crazy
so we have to count you know the amount
of countries here okay now yeah someone
asked me a question and if you write man
male sec please re ask you because it's
good question and I don't have time to
answer the questions via email anymore
so but when no one has
it says the times or emails like crazy
to do to answer a question properly
having the option between multiple
docket containers versus multiple PI our
micro instances which would be
preferable what do you lose again lose
gain with each one I had the requirement
to use PI or micro and set docker
containers but figured out I could as
well just use PI or micro by itself so
first what I did I just prepared Empire
a micro image and what it does is it it
is based on the X Java and just
downloads the pyro micro and the huge
benefit of pyara micro is there is no
installation you can just launch it with
Java minus charity pyara and the killer
feature of pyara micro is there is still
diploma in place so we are not forced to
build the uber jar fetch our or whatever
it's called so what basically means is
you can still do something like this so
you can say i'm using pyara micro but my
sub image just comprises the pink which
is properly 5k or something so this
build of this image is crazy fast and
pyara micro has only be built in case
the pyro micro changes itself so that's
a great story of pyara micro is still
there is a diploma in place so what's
the benefit of running this in dhaka so
the benefit is the docker image just
exposes port 8080 always and you can run
multiple instances from outside and and
and mapping the ports what's watch
another benefit is you get to know a
package which will always run and and a
huge advantage in my case there will be
no more Java migration projects because
you can launch the payara micro images
on different JVM versions and on the
host machine there is nothing installed
so this is just no clean machine without
any knowledge of Java it only dhoka host
is installed and everything is clean d
managed by by by Daka and you get and
you get the statistics from Dockers i
think you know ddd advantage is huge
even the whole build system is is great
so at it now if possible i always would
use docker / / running natively on the
on the server so this is docket for me
is like you know combination of my even
maven maven and get so like you get
everything one place and the packaging
format is specified so you check in this
into your repository your image pushed
to our registry I can pull from the edge
3 registering just run it and if you
would like to run multiple incised
instances just run it multiple times if
you would like change the environment
entries you can do it what miss minus e
a flag or you can add house so it you
get great flexibility with that and the
bill x is like crazy so if we go here to
Docklands let's see what I will find us
and it was micro so there's a build file
so if you just build the image this is
this is all so the image was built so
the payara will take longer but now I
could run the image so what is actually
the name dr. run minus D minus P let's
say eight to eight to port 8080 and name
let's say micro a hex it was pyara I
guess micro pink cool docker PS and it's
running so darker locks Mick so in the
FG locks so I mean is beautiful it's a
lot better than then running in without
the doc abstraction in my eyes ok so no
port conflicts nothing so if you would
run it on blank without Dhaka you would
have to configure pyara micro
differently to run a different different
different port so you will have to have
a script or whatever and with docker you
you have that ok cool so now we build
and run even during a hex a payara micro
image so so to summarize this for me
it's important that the micro stuff has
a deployment in place if there is no
deploy I'm not interested in
more because the war will contain your
business logic past the whole
infrastructure and you'll have to
rebuild everything also just a fraction
of these changes and this doesn't make
any sense to me so um so what is better
soul our elasticsearch so to my
impression is elastic search is a bit
more popular both are very similar and
both are based on leucine the solar is
advantage of solar isn't a pure Apache
project the elastic search is a actually
company called elastic having that said
I usually use elastic right now in all
my projects and that solar but both are
very comparable and I yeah so this is I
would say pick whatever like my decision
to use elastic was is in my eyes is a
little bit my perception is a little bit
more popular and there are more books
let's see trends right google com is it
cool a lass dich search versus solo I
think hopefully this is d in F data I
will have to compare it I will remove it
and see a lass dich search yes you can
see elasticsearch was this is gets more
and more popular interestingly here both
were not very popular what was it o
Christmas Christmas locations but then
you know elasticsearch take is more and
more popular and soul are just remains
the same or the popularity even a
decreases a bit a bit there's also my
perception and yeah ok so I hope it was
a object
opinion this is a good one so uh someone
approached me during the Java user group
and say look we use docker and the doc
has a memory limit and does seems work
strangely with Java and we use solar and
it does not work properly and it's like
the minus X amex settings in Java and
the docker limits do not work properly
so what state was what was the problem
and my answer was I don't have any
problems or my server ever many
instances and everything works fine in
the world about us and of course I heard
about this but there's nothing to do
with daca and and I will try to find Jai
prepare is it something to do with RSS
linux Java so there is a resonant memory
set and this resident memory set is hiep
shreds tags shared object code cache and
off hip usually so there are multiple
components so and if you specify JV n
minus X amix it's just a heap and in
this particular case someone use water
and solar users are off hip memories or
what it means memory my buffers so they
they store stuff outside the heap but it
still counts as total memory so so
therefore the the the Java Virtual
Machine memory consumption can be
significantly more larger than then the
Linux perception and by the way I
mentioned it several times it's the same
problem you usually get the Linux if you
start several several hundred threats
you would get you could get out of
memory error also it looks fine on with
top because top top will show just you
know DeeDee heap and not the fool you
will have to know to ask Linux to show
you the RSS which is RSS which stands
for our resident or was it forgot the
the acronym now and and this is the
resident resident
Harris s mamaw redefinition Linux
whereas residents head size this is the
residents head size and this is what
dhaka or linux considers a total amount
of memory and minus XM mix considers
just the heap and therefore you will
have to add more memory limit to dhaka
then you assign to java and actually is
nothing to his daughter is more about
linux ok this was a good one so it was
asked to me Java user group meeting in
poznan and it's important a great one
and I answered it right now by myself so
I'm exactly a similar question leucine
elasticsearch Orsola leucine is used by
both solo scene is now the the absolute
basic I wouldn't use a leucine stand
alone anymore in one project we use
hibernate surgery is also based on
leucine so it's like you have the full
text search with with jpa or hibernate
or hibernate so in several current
project is elastic search is great great
API and what why also elastic search is
more populist because elasticsearch is a
part of the elk how it's called stack
not stank yes tech is this elastic
search it is elastic search log stash
and cabana and therefore it is very well
known in the whole microservice movement
ok there is a elastic search log stash
and Cabana ok cool so I will just close
that also get let's see what happens
here with the Twitter lazy Twitter cavan
will not back or liens Pakistan crazy
Venezuela nice so we have already ten
countries
like this so let's so someone from
Brazil asked me my questions what do you
study read and and and what are you
references nowadays huh what do you
recommend for building Java
microservices was darker beside yours on
demand workshops how'd it be a better
java developer so i think i'm the better
java developer i think it is easy so
with java ee we have the unique chance
to write simple stuff so i would say
there's the less code you've right and
the simpler the code gets that the
better java developer you become i think
the verse would I saw is no wine java
class with 500 annotations because we
can so be a good developer hola which
would say for me it means right simple
code and you know play in leisure not no
not at work and how to learn so I mean
it is harder because I read a lot but I
I read because I'm curious about
different opinions but Java Eve world is
not that that easy so tomorrow i would
spend some someday one day at the jacks
conference in munich so we'll talk about
microservices so if you if you like come
to me whoever checked chat after that
and one day later i'm in mother also or
a deaf conference but the thing is i
will meet meet with there is going to be
a java a day and a micro service day and
i omit a lots of java ee no gurus out
there and we don't share the same
opinion so even i had some conversations
with the white flag guys and with pyara
guys and we are not always the same
apenas lost too much going on and if if
i read other blocks like if I retail CD
I block and all the block is all about
CDI then if you read a jpa block it's
just you know you can you can do
whatever you like with jpa and the
jax-rs guys say ok don't even know need
application server can run jax-rs or
Jersey Justin JVM so for me I'm
considering you know the the Java EE as
a platform something like rails or some
thing ready to use and I don't care
which API it is I just use it to build
applications faster and and and this is
where I think there's a way to go so
what did basically mean is what you
should do is you know to pick something
and just right for instance a block
engine a nice nice topic or whatever you
consider to be interested so starts such
a project which should be fun to you and
then try to write it as simple as
possible and rewrite it as often as
possible to make it even simpler and
then read stuff don't you know start
with reading because you go be crazy
there's a lot too much stuff going on
just you know start with your work try
to write simple code and then read and
this is how I learn all right now I read
I éclairs are crazy about JavaScript
because a little bit crazy ecosystem and
I would like to to see what the others
are doing and this is exactly the same
if I would just start reading do I would
go crazy so what I juice instead and I'm
fully involved in several commercial
projects and then I read on my side on
in Malaysia and compare no the
experiences I hope it will help you okay
the next one so let's see what happens
here no questions here elasticsearch is
schema-less a kind of so in my current
project so this is here schema-less so
in my current project it isn't
schema-less but usually you have scheme
up because you will have to set the
indices and the types and it is only
schema-less if you can live with the
default scheme up but i always have in
in in in larger larger my project is
right now not large but somehow i would
say complicated and we created for
instance i already had to create a
schema to set up you know the date
format for instance and yeah so
therefore it is a theoretical advantage
but yeah perfect so I wanted to ask you
if each eb jar will activate the
possibility of content is to handle EG
bees i'm not sure because and don't use
EG beach are a lot or not a lot it
didn't use it in five years or something
but there's one unique feature any gb
jar you can set up default interceptors
for everything so this is what where i
would use a gb jars and i think let's
take an enamine this is the reason why i
write blogs block because the may not
pend intercept or and and the cool story
is what you could do you can specify egb
names an asterisk and what this would
mean is it will apply this interceptor
to everything and this is not possible
without EG beach are so does the only
thing this would be an old one right
seven years old okay but i have to also
to admit i don't have a lot of
experience with ear anymore because
everything what i do is war right now I
really i didn't deploy ears for years so
i don't even know whether they are
working on application service and but i
don't know the answer i would ya
activate I mean lots of my projects
legacy projects are on weblogic server
and but I never heard about this that
the gb jar will activate something so
there are unique capabilities this is
true but not to activate stuff so gr pc
is a great one so i look at this so this
is actually interesting protocol remote
procedure call which from from google it
is a cross language but a little bit i
would say this similar to protocol
buffers or for me too IDL so if you go
to java for instance you will see what
you will have to do is you will have to
specify a
protocol buffer file which is for me the
same as I dl 15 years ago and from then
you can generate java code and whatever
code it's nice but i would always prefer
jax-rs over this in case i don't have
any problems with performance or
whatever so yeah oh it's called gr pc is
interesting stuff if you if you are not
interested or you cannot use jax-rs or
HTTP based communication then it might
be interested interesting what's also
interesting is there is there is an an
old Hessian Java protocol this is we use
also a lot it was a little bit I think
it's a more interesting but this is
ancient and why it's more interesting
because it is just a servlet and there
was no stop generation going on and this
was a the concept was more interested
but yeah i would use grp see if if there
will be reasons you know to do this just
for fun jax-rs is good enough just
github that occur again okay let's see I
think we covered us and Monsieur haschke
exactly the same how to managed security
patches by the way this is alumni from
from Eric's he attended the as a hard
core java developer and and and he liked
a little bit react so actually I guess I
answer the question already with because
with the layering with docker so what do
you'll have to do is you will have to
rebuild the whole chain I hoped it is I
think we already covered this so I will
rebuild everything and restart the
containers okay I hope mr. Shekhar just
ping me if you're not happy with the
answer so
okay someone anglers oh thank you what
about swagga for design-driven API in
jaii I don't know what design-driven API
in Java actually means oh we use swagger
for documentation purposes or to expose
the nice web page which which is
additional documentation but
design-driven api's I'm a little bit
afraid of this because there was
designed driven contract with soap where
people try to design and the API with
XML schemas and it was actually terrible
yeah so for me I I swagger with tool
from also alumni from from a hex and
this is Jack stress analyzer from
Monsieur Dashner it's a and what it does
it generates the it generates the swagga
file without any use of these swag
annotations so you you will get the
swagger swagger file without being
depending on dependent on swagger so
which is which is great and there's not
only swaggered you can jax-rs analyzes
also able to output the ascii dog as
well so you're not limited to use
swagger ok so we covered this and mr.
haschke are you happy with the answer i
have not react on on on the chat okay
cool and now even more interesting
questions there's a great week so i'm
also an alumni from costa rica i think
mr. mungus i also met him at javaone and
we shared some experiences with coffee
in san francisco so um I by the way I am
I covered this but I think in the same
week mr. mungus from Costa Rica and
people from Sweden from North Sweden
attended the workshop it was Christmas
and the mister and in Costa Rica is warm
and it's with the Sweden is usually
crazy cold and the mr. monk has told me
is not at bat in
unique there's like zero degrees Celsius
or whatever is actually warm and the
people from Sweden say it's this crazy
cold just like you are crazy I mean you
are from Sweden it should be a no worm
to you and it turns out that the people
who is from Sweden were were custom to
know dry air and the mr. mungus had say
okay I'm I don't care this mr. Marvin I
think is the first name I don't care
actually so it was funny experience of
the acts so but his question is a great
one because the problem he has us there
is an absolute path builder and this is
a common question and hear what the
absolute path builder does it adds the
location headed to http and the problem
is if you have engine eeks or h a proxy
whatever with HTTP redirect what you
will get here is the location of the
server but not the location of divisible
endpoints of the load balancer and i
think is the problem from what he
describes and the answer go is from Miss
theoret read cache def prox redirect and
what what you can do you can specify the
proxy pass attributes so and what will
happen then the engine X will pass the
headers will rewrite the headers so in
your app you will get you will get the
actual headers from the from the load
balancer and this is very similar to mod
proxy not mud proxy mod JK transparent I
just closed yet but found it again so
this is actually the thing and I'll ajp
is in binary protocol which between the
Apache and tom cat and the pageant pyara
glassfish and apache and white thread
actually runs on my block as well and
the thing is hence it is not it is not
HTTP it passes
all the information in a binary ways are
on the in the container you have all the
variables which work properly because it
looks to the end user as if it will
communicate with the apache or nginx and
there is nothing behind so that the
issue is you have two machines before
the outside user it looks like one
machine and if it uses HTTP redirect
like you know stock h a proxy or engine
X then you will get you no wrong machine
information so are the answers you will
have to configure your proxy with that
and this works was magic a mod balancer
and genex proxy and I would have to
double check H a proxy for this and
didn't try it yet okay question answered
hopefully Chris of Shaffer yes thanks
one of our project we need strict
control on the IP specifications the
descent driven and to generate stuffs
was an idea it is a dangerous what Chris
Monsieur Sheva suggests i was also in
such projects and what happened was they
try now to generate jax-rs api's and my
question was why we don't use soap then
because if you would use vistal you will
get the same effect so I'm be if you
have to generate code in 2016 is already
a bad sign okay miss your question is
how to automatically update running
container in fields every time when
images are updated on on our object on
something is there a possibility how to
automatically update running containers
in fields I think there is a darker
compose so I think this could help you
if I and there is a docket compose what
I do actually my server with app and
there is a command docket compose I
think it's called up or update and what
do you what docket compose does it
specifies dependencies between docker
containers so if you say docket campos
up yeah it is up and
like update as well it will check out in
registry whether they are they are
changes and restart all the containers
in the proper order so I think this is
what you will need then I hope now
Monsieur hash case on Doc up yeah this
doesn't matter whether it's on Doc up or
not because it would change you know the
difference and then and then you will
get it so I think dr. Campos will do
this at least it runs on my server and
this is similar i don't have doc appt i
have a private registry so it checks
whether there is a newer version the
registry and then install so randstad
cool so I always close my questions so
we are pretty far I think what are the
approaches you take to secure restful
web services so first the first
approaches of course in already me stock
Java security if this doesn't work I
would use a key cloak this is my current
approach 0 and if not key cloak open am
open am from sourceforge forgerock this
come on open or key cloak why it'll just
kick look it's not white line this is
actually a white flight server I also AM
there's a Docklands image not it does
not still does not work but I will also
push push a Docklands image with key
cloak ok this would be my approach to
security so um oh and this is so there
are some slides from light band and I
got unto it from Monsieur Ravitch and
let's see exactly and many people
already pink me about the slides and I
don't know what's going on it seems
a research project or whatever like a
crazy nose and now there are the issues
so and and he says this is not the goal
of micro services or Monsieur ravitch is
right there is not our goal they call it
scalable death process or I mean
scalable death process for me the goal
is building applications fast and easy
and and no one cares about you know what
do we do inside actually for some
companies em services on top of Java are
fine actually and then my answer was I'm
going here actually microservice in Java
usually exceed my custom expectation
actually my current project my client
always ask me you know it's crazy out
productive Java is and why it's so fast
in production so this is ok this like it
is I mean and it was never different and
and now we would like just briefly
discuss that says hundreds of libraries
are part of the base platform so I'm not
actually sure what this hundreds of
libraries means because if this rtj srs
it's not true it doesn't like hundreds
probably 20 or 25 and most and libraries
like jars this could be but do be not
not different to spring drop boys are
taller or no GS or npm so sale actually
we cannot use react because no no
kidding react or angular there is a
50,000 javascript files in node module
so we cannot use it so I mean then with
this statement you know the whole
JavaScript ecosystem will die
immediately so upgrading individual
libraries partly impossible but this is
always true for everything if you go to
JVM so i partly know patching JVM is
possibly impossible our eyes and thing
is this reference implementation this is
not true because so go to get top smile
and what I'm doing I'm following the
pyro guys and if you look at the payara
people the hyper act hype day I don't
know whether they are sleeping or not
delay hyperactive so they are patching
all the time and if you go to pyara fish
and go to downloads and releases
okay no no no no no no no download now
cancel there should be release notes
there should be released no release
notes then on github pyara releases
exactly hmm to look at the release notes
on for pyara what you will find that I
cannot find the release notes you will
find what they actually did and they
patch all the time everything so I get
you know that the whole thing the whole
thing with pyara the Edit values you get
the patches and and and the main the
main think about Webster Liberty profile
or white jboss EAP 7 as you get the
patches so I'm not sure what's what's
going on there so let's go back here the
next one required client libraries
jax-rs logic drifts into the client I
don't get it because this jax-rs is just
client library which exposes HTTP so and
now we use it all the time due to
communicate between micro services and
it says you don't have to use it but
it's a really convened way you could use
you know URL HTTP connection to do the
same I don't get it so i will probably
have to listen to the presentation
because the slides if you read it it
doesn't make a lot of sense or yeah then
javi doesn't support other languages and
can't really embrace the polyglot
approach to microservices okay but i
have to admit none of my clients asked
me whether we would be able to know to
develop the application in Scala groovy
closure java at the same time actually
they are happy that we can stick with
one language but even though i think
nothing prevents you to run groovy on
your java application server should just
work just fine and actually
what I did nah Swan is running like
crazy on my application service I use it
all the time and still works no
independent technical evolution in teams
because of the common base platform also
not true because what you could do you
can use Java 7 Java 8 and in one server
whatever because we have one doc image
pro pro operating system so I'm from the
research and I don't get how to how to
how to interpret this but this
distributed monolith reason one of nine
why Java won't help you with micro
services um yeah what could be that what
I'm doing are not microservices but no
one cares I mean then we do have to
rename it to something else if
microservices about running one project
in different languages with different
set of libraries then then I'm doing
something else usually but yeah but this
is interesting so we have to know to
take a look at this and it was pinged on
several conferences about this and I
have no idea what's going on here so so
thank you Lukesh and I cover this right
now and it is a way easy to talk about
this during a show then you know right
tweets with 140 characters okay cool
then let's see what time is it I just
close that close that close to add that
touch and kiss again and
this is good one when developing a rest
application what's your approach for
deploying the GS base you I do you put
it in on the same war create two
separate Wars and apply them to
independent serve instances just copy
just F 2 del exactly so in my current
projects we we we use docker we use this
so there is a Jenkins process we have
one war for the Java a back end is just
a plain folder a zip which runs on HTTP
Apache i think is a picture engineer's I
don't even know and they communicate
with each other on at the same time
another project based on Tommy I know
they have two wars because Tommy's the
only thing in production it's like an
enterprise system and they communicate
via HTTP another project is I know it's
also a war and the reason for this is we
misuse GSP's to replace to replace
environment entries oh and if you have a
angular react the problem is if you
would use no local host in your local
machine it will work but if you have two
wars on two different service there is
no more local host if there aren't run
and docker you could still communicate
but keep in mind the javascript part is
in the browser no more in dhaka so you
will have to use a proper ori and in
this particular case we used JSP to to
replace the host and the end the end the
number part so the answer is you don't
need war but the war can give you
additional additional possibilities like
for instance manipulating the javascript
files so if you don't need this just go
with plain HTTP ok the almost last
question is my question is about jdbc
and ORM because every project includes
the ORM eclipsing hibernate and apache
cayenne interesting did you know Apache
cayenne this is an older one actually
almost forgot about this is it was
actually a very interesting project I
will just take a look weather is still
alive hey nice so I would have to look
at this so take a look at this it was
really interesting project back then I
know it for four years is a very old one
and see I'm just curious with Medusa so
this is now your homework assignment you
know play with cayenne and and you know
he asked you know what is my take on
this and what I don't like about the
answers he is but what about the
performance because the benefits from
developers perspective are very clear
vertically means you probably like more
jpa than jdbc I guess so from the
performance it depends of course I mean
voice jpa and an hibernate you get
caching with jdbc you will have
implementation by yourself if you have
no manipulate huge amount of data it
really depends what we are doing usually
again so mine so my so I I'm looking at
this from the business point of view
it's okay are we more interested in in
instances of objects like user with ID
one or I'm more interested in the whole
table like for instance block would be
an issue in block you are not really
interested in you know having an article
as an object with business logic rather
than you are only interesting is
something having a title content and a
flexible amount of tags for instance
then I will just go with plain jdbc and
before I use spring jdbc or Apache
Commons DB utils i would consider just
use plain jdbc what we do right now in
my project so we just plain jdbc without
any additional frameworks so my general
approaches focus on JVM on java SE then
on Java EE if this is not enough then go
and pick whatever framework you like ok
go back here hi Mycroft release release
notes exactly so let's look at the
release notes perfect so you can see for
instance updated modules in current
pyara this is what I hazel cast grizzly
is a part of the HTTP server mine pool I
don't know what it is Jax batch API 10 0
j patch weld 235 and Tyros is the
WebSocket specification and some new
features so um if you look at this I
mean they replaced
a major parts of the of the API and I
think what's really different what's
different is the is the philosophy so
having pyara or white fly or Tommy
whatever you you are no more interest in
fiddling with the libraries you are
paying someone or you are trusting them
to do the right work for you and you
focus on business logic this is actually
my approach I am working with Java since
1995 and they really lost interest in
patching my own libraries because it's a
boring job so and therefore I would
rather use pyara and focus on my really
interesting business logic then you know
patching hazel cast by myself or grizzly
is even worse because you can ask the
payara guys they have properly are lots
of you know class loading problems
classic as exceptions whatever it is
really not fun of fixing that so it's a
lot easier for us to focus on business
logic and forget about you know the
crazy plumbing okay thank you so now we
have to release notes yeah and of course
some bug fixes but this is what they
update it and this happens because
behind the scenes and the cool stories I
hope this is the newest pyara so if you
go here the application server and this
is Thea where is the payara no pyara the
reason is that the first time in the
history of ax i downgraded to NetBeans
h2 because I couldn't find in the newest
release and but what I have on the where
a second so if I will just use the
payara 163 but which i think is the
newest one and my application was to run
on it because all the libraries were
replaced but the cool feature of java
years I'm working I'm compiling against
the API not depeche libraries and this
is the huge advantage of application
servers ok cool thank you Mike and by
the way Mycroft is one of the crazy
committers of pyara who keep you know my
timeline busy ok now is a lots of thing
going on here so they try to solve
problem by themselves
and now they the very last questions for
myself at this actually I got an email
actually weeks ago and in my book I
mentioned serializable transactions say
is it true because transactions are not
see Eliza below and what the reader
meant is java.io.serializable and what
you have to know is actually a funding
funny one transaction serializable and
exactly and what's réaliser bility
means in transactions is it appears as
if there is no concurrency so there's
the highest degree of isolation this
would mean serializable serial execution
not serializing java objects on disk and
in my book I mentioned the serializable
transactions like no transactions coming
after each other and not in peril and
this is a funny coincident because Java
we have java.io.serializable and in
transactions we have see eligibility I
think wow is a long one one hour and 10
minutes without any problems because I
didn't used slides this time so you see
it works ok Josh GAD exactly rabia to
try the docket compose and see green
blue with should should should work like
a charm so I think we are done so thank
you for watching and see you an upcoming
conferences in fact w jackson munich
tomorrow day after or a deaf and this is
everything i think in this year and
there are still one ax in December just
ask you know miss Brett Tucker and mr.
manga stay they attended them and yeah
thank you for watching see you on X come
and oh one of the question is whether
i'm working on online version of react
or angular 2 and the answer is no what I
think about an hour record soon is like
a version of the how it's called
the web bootstrap project so I didn't
call it to a bootstrap i renamed the
course actually because i thought if i
will name it web bootstrap anyone will
think this is the twitter bootstrap so
this is web apps essential I will
probably record something like this like
an OD absolute essentials for Java
deaths explaining how JavaScript in es6
is working CSS and dumb as foundation
for other frameworks this is what I will
do or I already started to do actually I
hope it is also in your interests so um
thank you for watching and yeah really
from all over the world is crazy and
yeah check out java javascript and if
you would learn learn whatever like have
fun and just try things out and buy see
you next month bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
