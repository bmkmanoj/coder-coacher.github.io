a new release of loader I call it hookah
and why our show in a second so what we
have right now is a Jenkins built her
sockets unit test it actually does not
matter what it is and what I would like
to do is I would like to a safety link
to the build so arms I can build it
automatically and what Laura allows me
to do is to do the following so what I
have here is the loader project and it
comes with a simple with a sample folder
called test deployment so what I can do
I can and in within the test deployment
there is a war so I can and coffee beans
Wars or what I can do I can say java
minnows jar and go to target so this is
where the loader is located you can
download it to direct it from github and
then i would like to deploy it and
deploy my coffee beans and after it is
deployed i would like to perform a or
invoke a HTTP GET URI and this Ori
triggers a new Jenkins build so when it
is helpful for instance in the docker
what you could do you can in one go
deploy the application and after
successful deployment trigger for
instance the system tests so they have
to run after the application is
successfully deployed so after executing
this you will see okay the application
is deployed monitoring do it in coffee
there are three applications running on
the payara instance and there was no
response or go back to to Jenkins and as
you can see they're also built triggered
number five there is at the current
built in Jenkins it was triggered right
now so i think is very helpful if you
would like to change actions like
deployment and after the deployment you
would like to automate something by
invoking an HTTP GET request for now so
only get is requested as supported
currently okay thank you for watching
and see you online effective java.com
all come to munich a demon
Airport and of course at javaone and all
other Java conferences thank you and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
