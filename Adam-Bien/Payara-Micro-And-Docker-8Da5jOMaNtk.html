to introduce you to PI era micro and run
it on docker so para micro is player a
fool or a smaller version of Pi our fool
in a jar so you can download it as a jar
and just run it
so just executable jar and the nice
thing about para micro you can specify
with the deploy command and external
deployable so it's nicely separated the
infrastructure from the business logic
which makes it perfectly suitable for
for for Dhaka
so let's deploy something on docker and
para micro so I started with prepared
docker file and the key part is to
scroll command which downloads per this
jar file and the entry point just
execute the jar file and points to an
executable which is going to be
specified in in a sub docker file so
let's create a project it is going to be
a maven project without any dependency
on para micro so sorry from archetype
and I will just use my own basic
archetype and call it micro so this is
going to be the micro project and this
is no micro inside it's just dependency
in Java 7 and I would like to add just a
micro resource with path micro
micro and string all get let's say
message and all return a micro and a
dynamic part not the browser will catch
something so we have this and okay it
should be deployable so let's create a
docker file so I will just create here a
docker file this is in other and docker
file perfect and we just inherit from
here hex payara micro so you will find
the images in in docker hub and
docklands on the github so panará micro
and two things has to be done the first
one is or the second one i will copy the
from target because it's a maven project
I know the deplorably is going to be in
target the name is going to be microdot
war and I will copy it to deployment
folder deployment there and then I have
to specify the archive name our kind aim
and the name going to be this okay so
this should be enough and now let's
build the project so I will I will just
go to the mic switch to the micro folder
and say the following
maven clean in soul and then after its
created I will create a docker image
- T Eric's micro let's call this micro
dot should be enough sure doc he built
just forgot he built just do it again
so it's built you see it's not cached so
now the project was built and docker
file was executable docker file was
created no let's run it
docker run - t- p let's specify a port 8
for 8 for 8080 and the name let's call
it micro and the image name was a hex
microphone so it looks good
so it runs doctor logs so we see
something happens inside now it's fully
started and deployed and micro is the AC
context path so let's try this HTTP HTTP
localhost it was 8 for 8 for micro
resources micro and we have here the
output so interestingly there is
actually no difference if I would use
here the full profile so just the payara
and we'll rebuild the project so let's
do let's call this macro so we will see
the same performance why because in both
cases the infrastructure is separated
from from the deployable so the build
time is exactly the same so I could run
the same project right now on on the
payara fuel and there is actually no
built time performance difference so
let's go try this and let's launch it on
8 5 8 5 and not a hex micro rather than
a hex macro and I will also use here the
macro name so started talking locks
macro and we see that the PI are fully
started with a lots more ports and now
go to the call 8 5 8 5
and we see the same output so this is
the output from payara so still pyro
micro is an interesting alternative
detoxified is simpler is less the
decisive smaller so and yeah it's
interesting into internet if alternative
2 to 2 pi era fool and on dhaka what's
nice also this micro you are not forced
to use uber jar or super jar or fetch
hours or whatever these tools clearly
supply separated the infrastructure from
the business logic which makes
deployments and builds incredibly fast
so thank you for watching and see you on
upcoming projects conferences workshops
or even at the airport munich workshops
particularly in micro services workshops
so thank you for watching and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
