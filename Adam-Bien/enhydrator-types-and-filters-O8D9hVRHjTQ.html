and we will extend a little bit with n
hit writers or what we did the last time
we were able to read all the JDK
releases from csv and into memory so if
i run the test we will just see a lots
of jdk versions so the test is hopefully
green it is and the and the output is
going to contain to put just need the
output window and you see all the
releases are here so let's say we would
like I would like just to see the most
recent JDK releases let's say starting
with the year 2000 and how to implement
this first I will have to do to to
transform or to convert a string to an
integer and this is actually built in
what I can do it can register a data
mapper a new data type name map as I
would like to use the name of the column
not the index at mapping and the mapping
is year this is the name of the column
so double check this yes here is the
name of the column and the data type is
going to be integer and what we just
missing is the dot here just reform it a
little bit a nicer and now run the test
and what we see is the test is red and
the arrow we get is cannot contain
column yeah with index 2 and value year
so what happened right now is we're at
the very first line and this is a year
and here cannot be converted to an
integer so I'm how to deal with this is
we can say with or start with again and
what I can do new skip first row so
there is a no op data transformer what
they were the data transfer mad asses it
just keeps the first row so let's try
this
and as you can see it is green again and
we should still see all the columns now
the columns D values are integers so
actually is no different in the output
but what we could do more easily right
now we could filter and for filter it's
a little bit more exciting I can use
nice one expression so there is some
built-in variables I can refer to and
the most interesting right now is the
row is the current role and what I would
like to have is get column by value get
callum by name sorry get column value is
actually the name and I would like to
use the year the current value and this
should be greater than two thousand and
now let's see whether it works so I
would just run it again is green and
what we should see us we see all needy
most recent releases of jdk so are the
value is greater than 2000 and this is
actually an integer it would not work or
it would actually work with javascript
because of coercion but it's not what we
would expect so what do you want it to
have this we would like to have integers
first and then filter everything which
is newer than 2000 and you can use of
course nice one on or java functions it
will work equally well so I'm thank you
for watching see you at a hex and enjoy
transforming ok bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
