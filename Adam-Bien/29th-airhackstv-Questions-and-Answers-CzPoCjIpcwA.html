a hex TV and after two weeks so it was a
short period I gathered some questions
also i'm going to answer some comments
from my block and this time is a half an
hour later and the reason for this is i
decided to create some slides which is
unusual because the reason is also
unusual so you will see in a second so
let's start with the content so the
question that got via email is whether i
will record online version for the react
and angular 2 workshops and the answer
is not yet what i usually do I just I
just delivers us some of you workshops
in Munich and then you know I tweak the
contents and see what is interesting and
whatnot so and then I record the online
version it's not like I started with the
online and then you know I tried in
Munich so this will come probably in
2017 and before I will deliver reactor
angular 2 I will probably start with
javascript or typescript or something
like this and also nice news and there
are already sufficient registrations for
all the workshops in december and
october so um so I see you soon in
Munich so now let's start with the
contents so what um what happened was
something really interesting I already
told you or show you the article about
about Oracle and javi commitment in the
register and it was somehow in official
and then what happened with there's
another article and this claims to be
exclusive interview with Thomas Korean
about Oracle to reboot java ee for the
cloud which is somehow interesting butts
really interesting this is confirmed by
Oracle itself so there is an july twenty
seventh there is a executed viewpoints
or at the news korean outlines java next
steps and it also links to the article
on infoworld which makes it really
interesting so and what I did is I just
try to summer
is the article on the slide and there
are some really interesting points here
so I will start in order to cover the
points and I thought it would be better
in order to have um 10 bullet point just
copy and pasted from the article then
you know reach the article for you ok so
there slides so what's what says Oracle
has a very clean plan for java ee 8
which is which is nice or what what
actually means is that oracle commits to
java 8 so something will come out and it
takes seriously tell Java 8 which is of
course unclear why nothing happens in
JCP whether they prefer to implement
some poo of consoles or whatever in
house first and then push it to JCP so
no one knows actually what what happens
behind the scenes the next one is also
interesting so I just this is except
from the article lists unmodified from
me Oracle plans to fit Java 8 with
capabilities for persisting data in key
value store and this is really
interesting because before java e7 there
were several sessions at javaone and the
spec leads from JP a tried to think I
know how on how and no sequel API could
look like and the problem was there are
so many no sequel data stores
document-based and key value store based
and graph based so it is really hard to
provide one one single API you know for
all of them and also the question to
know back then I ask myself why not just
jpa and if you if you know for instance
morphia from from a MongoDB it looks
very like jpa so it's not like you
couldn't use JP annotations to model no
Zuko databases so I'm really curious
what happens here here and whether no
cmj PA is going to be extended and don't
think so because then they will have to
find a new GSR or whether they will
start with completely new no sequel GSR
which could be even more interesting and
by the way right now I'm using several
no sequel data stores and I am accessing
them via Jason I just use JSONP in jax
or s2x on them access them also works
perfectly with Java 7 so the next topic
was modernizing javi for the cloud
what's also interesting this was Teddy
actually them
in theme for java 7 like multi-tenancy
and better monitoring and deployment and
then they decided to roll it back
because there was no clear requirements
for this so three years realized later I
think there is now enough material or
enough requirements enough experience
with the underlining technology to know
what can't watch what what can be a
standardized so this is going to be the
main scheme for java 80 like clouds and
containers so today java does not have a
formalized model for app developers on
how an observer can provide
multi-tenancy and this is the weblogic
does that there's even come to the
recent one it has a multi-tenancy
capabilities but what's interesting in
in in in my project is we don't even
attempt that so what we we probably miss
use the application server as a as a
container for a single application so
multi-tenancy would mean in my projects
we will have you know several
installation of deployments of the same
application in different docker
containers for instance and what Oracle
things I guess is having one application
server and deploying multiple Wars which
are isolated to one application server
which of course save some ram i would
say pair microservice i don't know let's
say 50 megs of ram but from the from the
viewpoint from a cloud provider this is
a big deal because if you are oracle or
jelastic on something like this you
could save a lot of hardware because you
don't have the applications of overhead
from project perspective or i would say
private cloud perspective i don't think
it matters whether your application
consumes now 50 max or or 70 max because
yeah because if you run I don't know 20
micro services and the overhead is like
1 gig of ram you will no loose I don't
know a few euros so it or dollars it
really does not matter in my eyes but
this is interesting what how it is meant
and I don't believe in and shared
deployment model so what I believe is a
thin Wars and an application service and
this seems to be a little bit opposite
from the direction which is
understandable for
from from the cloud perspective then
Java you will likely also receive
security improvements so we have it
already there is a great work from
Ariane teams and if you follow his
github account and there's even a
reference implementation called Soteria
and and you can use it right now in java
7 environment it's a great extension to
current security model I think it is
going to do to make into Java 8 you were
also interesting to see where the Oracle
has something else something different
which I do not believe because this Peck
was also driven by Oracle there were
Oracle people working or not it so I
think this is so the future is now go to
github and play with otorrhea so even
more interesting so the next slide java
current configuration model is getting
old I mean of course I would send only
old is not usable so I think no one uses
jndi anymore to configure the
applications that model can be improved
by a technologies such as daca and other
container technologies and and of course
so if you are using an application
server as multi-tenancy provider it you
know you it has you have to be very the
configuration capabilities have to be
excellent to do this but again what I do
right now is if you're curious go to the
microservices workshops I actually
implemented his life what it can do
right now is if there is one-to-one
relation between application server and
the war you can of course use system
variables for instance very very
conveniently from Dhaka and with one
liner you can inject whatever you like
from the Dhaka environment and this
works great in all my projects so there
is no big deal in Java 7 but of course
if you if the goal is being multi tenant
or supporting multi-tenancy then of
course the configuration has to be
isolated and no onus each war or each
microservice has to see you know the own
own own configuration what will be also
interesting something like in a rant
configuration like being able to disable
or enable something via jammies for
instance could be also interesting and
so um interesting what happens here what
what what's also happened there was a
GSR for configuration for Java EE and I
don't think it is active anymore or it
didn't made to Java 8 it was also
interesting to see whether this pack is
going to be reactivated for java 8 or
oracle see something complete complete
different it's also interesting you know
how how is getting to be involved
because Oracle will have to file some GS
ours have to otherwise I don't think we
can call it java 8 so if just Oracle
will come out with something like I
don't know like Jeanne you know 15 years
ago then it will be Oracle's II but it
couldn't be called I think Java EE so
it's in really interesting interesting
times right now some Java does not have
an elegant model for how you do a
reactive style of programming and this
is true actually you can do a lot with
Java it but it's not elegant so you need
to know at least you know some some
setup so you will have to inject your
executor service and then use for
instance completely future again if you
include us go to the micro service
workshop or at least clone the examples
a completely free on github and how to
do reactive start of programming so what
could be for instance interesting in
Java 8 you know consider like the queues
or CDI events as event sources which can
be then you know consumed by somehow of
reactive style jsr which or here api or
jsr also interesting what happens here
whether all the GSR is going to be
adjusted to be reactive or we get
another like adapter spec which going to
you know to consume all the others java
8 would have stronger support for HTTP
to than originally intended i mean i
think it was the razor ramon from from
the java ee guardians always said you
know HTTP to is big deal and has to be
supported by by servlet so i think
everyone everyone knows that HTTP two is
critical so what is HTTP with HTTP
to it it changes completely the game so
this is like web sockets a standard so
you will be able to have you know
multiple full duplex connections between
the browser and server and under and the
browser and the server is going to be
able to push push content to browser
before it is actually before it is going
to be really needed so you can speed up
times and you will change of course also
the build system of html5 applications
because bundling probably is not going
to be necessary anymore so I'm this is a
big deal so my understanding is HTTP two
will also be part of JDK so it will be
interesting to see which part is going
to be you know covered by a jdk and
which part of Java EE and also
interesting Korean said would like to
see convergence around a single
specification for using micro services
with Java EE and in the article this
micro of micro profile I always
mentioned and this was the answers okay
I would like to see us converging so
what it actually means is this is my
understanding that Oracle is willing to
work with red hat IBM and the others to
support microservices spec so and there
was actually no there was no commitments
to date so there was no no Korean
couldn't say whether Java 8 is going to
be delayed or not but I have to say I
don't care with the delays of Java 8 at
all so am I don't know why so many
people are impatient with the Java Java
is seven is perfect so this is one
remember a recent project we only had
java 6 and we could upgrade to Java 7
but it didn't work for some minor
reasons and we just went with java 6 we
were happy and which ave seven would be
a little bit nicer but it's not like you
know we couldn't deliver so it was just
a minor changes and the same is going to
be with Java 8 if java 8 will come late
so we can still deliver a great simple
effective and productive micro service
project which are by seven and we will
migrate later to Java 8 so not a big
deal and it's a whole delaying of Java
EE is lie
I mean the revolution or already
happened so what we now get is you know
a small chunks of improvement is not
like each new version will introduce a
full new stuff and this is I'm full with
Thomas Korean to listen at the end of
the day he said we believe that if we
are doing the right thing for the
developer community we believe the
developer community will rally around it
absolutely so if they really managed to
deliver Java 8 in the right way right
way it means simple productive you know
no strange I don't know interactions
again like Jane di and assembly roles or
whatever then absolutely so on if the
dictator does the right thing you know
it may work and what what we should have
all keep in mind is that the spec is
properly developed by the people who
develop Java 7 in javis exit Oracle so
the deformer Sun and Oracle Java
engineers so it's not like you know they
will kill the whole legacy from Java 7
and reboot everything to have Java 8 so
I guess the Java it would be right on
track what's also interesting so in the
not Indian fold our article in the other
article was mentioned that Oracle shed
the info with partners and so far I
don't know any partner who has the
information know what what happens
behind the scenes so white is critical
so if Oracle let's say a Java one and
this is actually mentioned that it java
one Oracle will reveal the concrete
plans but i think what what should
happen that Oracle will inform you know
red hats and IBM and all the others and
the Tommy tribe guys to give them some
time to implement the Java 8 otherwise
you will get in a weblogic which
supports Java 8 and no other way vendor
will will use Java 8 and then I guess no
one would be interested in Java 8
anymore i think the the only value we
get from java ee is that we have a dis
JCP so we can download you know all the
pdfs all the Javadoc from one place and
to implement to employ
and the application or to make the
application functional we rely on the
API and we can use no the Edit features
from the vendors but we don't have to to
implement the application and this is
the great deal if if this is not given
so let's sell it with Java 8 we only run
on weblogic and the others want support
this then forgot about java I think then
there will be mass exodus not from
glassfish to jboss till mass exodus from
weblogic and all the others to spring
boot or whatever you get dropped with
that spring boot and all the others so
then we get far better technologies in
this ok this was the first time a TX I
showed you some slides and so I think it
is actually might be a good idea to some
to create an overview what I would
actually two saves what I recognized the
last time I forgot lots of stuff to
mention so slides are over so now we can
close the PDF slides and these were the
article this was infoworld article this
was the block so if you search for this
is the official website from Oracle and
this is the older at the register
article not that old as the July the
seventh and yeah this was this so now
textual what's here so we have lots of
attendees here no questions in Twitter
no questions in chat now and someone
from Greece okay cool so at least one
other different from Greece officially
so on the others so if again if you like
just drop your countries also
interesting to say to see from where you
are you are listening or watching so we
are a TV okay next or the first point is
service serving files without a war this
is follow-up to question from from the
last a hex
and there was where was it someone there
was full up yes this was from from me
Kai and he said okay it's absolutely
clear that you can obtain you know to
fetch the log files from glassfish
without any problems but what to do if
you only have an heb jar no war and you
would like to do to load the files so
still what you can do you can implement
or reuse my connector so I wrote this
connector as example for the book
rethinking javi patterns actually
killing Java patterns and I implemented
a package store which is able to
exercise in transactional way so this is
a little bit overkill but it's the
formal way to do too so the problem with
the GBC are officially not allowed
because of programming restrictions to
access the Java io package sorry to use
Java yo to access files and local in
local directory but if you are now they
are doing you can still do it so you can
still you know say new new file open
stream or whatever to access the
contents why because no one will prevent
you to do this you have to be aware that
it is slow if it's slow transaction can
be blocked or locked so you get the
transaction timeout in inverse case your
application server will die because of
deadlocks for instance but this is
obvious that this such a thing can
happen what is also of uses and why it
is forbidden is also forbidden because
if you are running in a cluster it will
it will be no hard to coordinate if you
change device so it is not an easy
problem to solve but if you just reading
log files just go for it so just now
open the stream and the the harder part
is going to be if the file is going to
be huge it is harder to implement
streaming via remote egb interfaces this
will be the challenge with jax-rs no
problem at all you can use thing is
called streaming output so you could
stream de la crise back with eg Beast
there's no streaming in
just some air mi so a duel is hardly you
could implement streaming but this
doesn't come in or out of the box but if
the log file is is manageable I don't
know a view max you can just return them
as a string or a byte array or whatever
and this will absolutely work okay so
Java II performance monitoring and
results interpretation so what it did I
showed you the last time delight fish
monitoring applications or what it does
it connects to glass fish and pyara and
and views transactions and sessions and
whatever and another question is you
know now we have lots of lots of data so
what to do with it so what you can do
with the data and so um this is like if
you monitor the application you just
need monitoring info fund what I'm
interested in this for instance how big
is this session so this can be hardly
achieved with light fish because you
will have to create a heap dump but this
would be the DD question how big is my
session if if there is any for instance
jsf the next question is how many
transactions per second am i able to
deliver why it is critical because you
know then the peak if you know the pic
transaction let's say your application
is able to deliver two transactions two
thousand transactions per second you can
you can set up you know you can set up
bulkheads like thread pulls you can set
up timeouts and you can you can
basically throttle your service at let's
say two thousand eight hundred so it
will be never overwhelmed by the traffic
or you can prevent Danielle of service
attacks and of course what I do first in
my performance measurement is basically
watching all you know all the charts and
all the charts have to be flat so they
cannot be that it allocates more and
more resources so or charts driven
resources has to be flat so like you
know a number of threats number of
classes loaded number of memory acquired
to set to b-flat if it goes up over time
we have a resource leak and this usually
means trouble
so but what is not possible you know use
just to connect to write with light fish
to pyara and look at this and say it's
good or bad because you actually not
know your web applications is doing if
your application is accessing just you
know stock procedures and the stored
procedures are slow and so you will see
you only able to achieve you know 20
transactions per second this is like it
is it can be changed one project we had
to use a German back-end system with
three letters and it was slow too slow
for our purposes and our application
server was actually very fast but it
looked from right fishes as if
everything was was slow ok similar
question software quality with sonar and
java and basically or basically I
actually forgot to start soon ah so
before start so now let's start sonar it
actually runs so and this is a soon
Alice it's like it's like my my test my
test instance of sanaa and what I was
asked here was you know how to deal with
a performance monitoring and I'm sorry
so they could use sonar java rules
defaults in real world so what I meant
by that in the question in the question
is there is a company and in the company
they think that the standard rule set of
so now is the best and they are not
allowed to change that so how to deal
with that and SAT one is hard to answer
what would I do usually so what I set up
is I set up usually this view and what
does view basically what it says is the
size of the front is the complexity and
the color is the test coverage and we
have the simple rule complex code has to
be tested and simple code no one no one
cares about this so this would be ok
this also ok so the number of providers
probably you know you just get a sunset
us no complexity at all so complexity
one
if you go to this there is complexity
one if there is no if else complexity
one if there would be if else else there
will be no complexity of three because a
three communicare 33 path execution
paths in the method and this is a little
bit more complex so as if as else if on
the return and therefore we have
complexity of seven so I'm basically
everything which is more complex than
three has to be unit tested ok now what
other rules are interested so if we go
to to the top first if you are building
let's say pc boundary control entity
application in my way which means you
know or injected fields are not private
to get a lot of violations like major
violations you have to encapsulate
fields whatever because sonar is not
aware that you are running in java
context so what we always do we adjust
the rules so i'm in the beginning phase
of the project we look at the rules and
so this and this rule do not matter and
we just constantly now change the
configuration in the rules and this is a
good thing i cannot remember that we
ever used sonar out of the box because
it does make any sense you will get or
what developers will do they will
provide a comment no sonar and and and
then they will exclude you know didi
evaluation so i think this is the
mandatory rule and then if we go to wait
a second we have here a dashboard and
somewhere
let's go to a project that's a
calculator and we have here the trends
are interested interested interesting so
if we go to time machine this is what I
look for so what you can also say you
know over time the complexity if it
increases the whole time itself is a bad
sign and the coverage should should
remain stable or increase but not
decrease and if the coverage decreases
and the complexity increases over time
this is a bad sign what I don't care at
all is no of candy the comments there
should be you know deactivated
duplicated lines is a good one because I
think it is a good thing so if you in
microservice world the duplicate lines
is going to be how high and because you
are working at the beginning lots of
copy and paste without microservices
there is not application so and it is
always know in the context you cannot
just say no if the micro service project
you have knowed applicated lines is
probably not a micro service projects
because if there is no share no no copy
and pasted code if there is no copy and
pasted code you get lots of shared code
if you have shared code you cannot be
independent so so the time machine look
at the time machine and think about what
you would like to achieve with your
project you know if decoupling then it
gets more the applicator lines at least
at the beginning and then of hopefully
there will be less and less dedicated
lines and yeah lines of code of course
should increase but yeah this is what we
never I would start with the dashboard
view I showed you earlier and then watch
closely d the the time machine and then
adjust the violations this what I would
do okay I hope its coverage I will just
quickly go to d wow a lot of
conversation already so watching from a
moving train in Netherlands this is this
is an idol this is this is this is nice
and we have someone from nigeria africa
so Allah mean
France is not not that bad France we
have Costa Rica moving train to
netherlands by the way I was in
netherlands i came late to a project and
they told me the reason and i told me
the official excuse for the from din
from the Dutch railways was the train
has to go slow because there were leaves
from the trees on the house called
forgot on the track and therefore there
that train has to move slowly and so in
Germany we have different excuses but
never because of no leaves on the on the
on the tracks okay question if i use
inject with singleton that injects
another singleton that injects to
Singleton's that injects a singleton
each why do I need to provide interfaces
tect with local remote nice Nemo Nemo
you're absolutely right just delete all
the interfaces there don't need any
local and remote interfaces never so you
can just inject whatever you like
without local and remote interfaces
watch the last I think it did 28 now XD
v I just mentioned an article or a blog
post I've wrote is one of the recent
blog post I said local and remote
interface are duplicated Oh a nice name
I'm a net guy returning to the Duke side
of the force yes but I have to say no
microsoft.net is like now is like son
was earlier so it's not like you know
terror we have just bright bright sides
like Microsoft in Dukes are or or
friends okay Paris France nice okay so
where we were we were here so is there
any way so and and they were actually
the official questions because of just
two weeks away and what I did then I say
okay this is great because then I can
cover some questions for my block my
this actually toasty the origin intent
from ax TV just to cover my blog
comments and questions and I never did
it because I get too many online
on questions and and the questions which
were here from from from from github so
I'm a question is there any way to find
an EG buijs capital of X's and
persistence context in anti listener and
this is interesting so if we if we go
here there's an article from me or blog
post why sometimes or reference to an
entity manager instant GOP entities is
needed and the funny story is I brought
the blog post background to convince the
jpa speckly expect then that we need to
know the reference so that we need
dependency injection of entity manager
to entities I still couldn't couldn't
convince them but there are lots lots of
support from the community but yeah but
they're still we have meanwhile we have
java ee 7 is still no injection of
entitymanager in jp-a so and is there
any way to finally gb here actually in
entity listener you can just inject
whatever like with java 7 so it solved
so if you have an entity listener in the
entity listener just dependency
injection should work there was a back
in white fly but this is just a back it
should work and also funny stories or
funny in the effective workshop which I
online workshop from AIX I oh I I did it
so i injected an entity listener i can
remember a gb or a CDI beam and the I
used the whole training whitefly and I
knew about the back and I mentioned in
the course ok now I'm switching to to
pyara to and then I proceeded with pyara
and and many of the of the attendees
online attendees didn't didn't recognize
that and I got lots of emails no it does
not working why not and I just pointed
always pointed to the back in in in
white flag so um on the same notice
entitymanager civilization in clustering
so and there was a blog comment what I
did earlier is the following
sometimes i injected the entity manager
to stateful EG bees and what what you
could do then is all the entities they
will remain attached for the duration of
the of the session and we can what you
can do with this is you can basically
you know expose the entities 2d 2d view
right is GSF and it can be manipulated
in a wizard-like fashion so you can have
no five different views and in the last
view you will save or committed
transaction so you can save a lot of
code and the problem of course is if the
application server will try to replicate
the state of the state full session bean
it could attempt to assuage the entity
manager but do usually the application
servers should know that the entity
manager is not a CLI zabal state rather
than a resource and this is not going to
be civilized so the application servers
are aware of this and it should not
happen I actually didn't didn't test it
a lot and the reason for this is I don't
believe in applications of a clustering
because if you think about stateful EG
bees if you would cluster the state of a
stateful session bean or the state of
session scoped session scope CDI bean
which the same technology how it would
work is you are writing synchronously to
a uuu of writing synchronously to a to a
to a cluster node and the server would
replicate the state to do to another
cluster node syncros synchronously or
asynchronously if you if you switch to
synchronously it is terribly slow and
you get probably dead locks if it's
asynchronous it is just cannot be
consistent so usually we disable the
whole replication altogether in class
stuff session for HTTP session and
self-obsession means what basically
means no serialization of content but
also if the session fails the the user
will have to relock or that the state is
lost which would mean here is if the
state of the entity manager is lost what
ever happen between transactions is also
get lost which is
perfectly perfectly viable because it's
the same what happens if you have you
know an text document opened and it just
crashes and you didn't save it so this
is exactly the same behavior so then I
get a question from from Twitter and the
question is about bc can I relate
entities from from different components
if not is there a way to around it
absolutely it was always meant this way
a component entities from one component
can access entities from other
components what should never happen is
that entities from one component access
controls or boundaries from other
component so this is how it was always
meant if if you would forbid this or or
prevent this you couldn't use to no
joints between entities between
components which would be terrible okay
another question covered and by the way
what is the state of the union ear so
still you still cannot inject the entity
manager to to the entity so there is no
way around this or so there is way
around this but there is no standard way
of injected entitymanager to JP entities
and why I wanted to have this because
sometimes if you are in highly
complicated you know you have to
implement more more more evolved
algorithms you would like for instance
to create entities depending dependent
entities from the main entity and and
just persisting them to the entity
manager for instance or perform queries
directly from from from one entity if
you consider an entity as an object not
as a data holder it makes perfectly
sense to have a reference to the entity
manager and of course we'll just suggest
it from this package back then as you
you can you can you can you can you can
put the entity manager as a parameter
constructor but this is not not ruling
it not not a good good idea okay so just
just forgot gist github and i forgot the
very first question how far we can go
with java and our current or
interoperability so this is
15 days ago so what acha acha is a
little bit similar or is similar to
message driven beans in Java EE so akka
is like you have actors they were called
a cactus like message driven beans and
and they have inbound queue which is
called a thing inbox and they have they
they they have own threading model I
think is called ticks and and the day
they received ed messages from there
from the inbox model and do something
with it and it's a rice nice agent like
model and the question is no the Intel
variability the question is what do you
mean by intel / ability so um because
you know if you if you have a car you
don't need an application server but if
you would like you know to integrate
somehow a cow is the application server
you can always you know have like a car
microsoft which which communicates via
web sockets or jax-rs with the
application server this is always
possible so but it does not matter what
this is econo GS or whatever but we can
also do this is the arc of documentation
what you can do of course you can set up
your own for on executor and what you
could do of course is you can inject the
unmanaged execute or service from
application server and then acha would
use your minutes threats and you can
monitor your threats and what you could
even do you can use porcupine por q pine
my three class project and what
porcupine does it will create on the fly
execute or services make them injectable
and then you could get a nice statistics
so you know acha would use would use
application server threading model and
this would be I think the tightest
integration you can you could possibly
get okay
perfect so we had this realization we
have the references and now oh we are
pretty fast there's a new question nine
hours ago so I have to read it first
trying to develop to web applications
based on WebSocket using Tommy plus so
Tommy a great application server go to
Tommy tribe check it out it's like tom
cat on steroids idle timeout issues and
how how to handle those errors
especially on the server side so i think
in WebSocket there is no sirve own
client so if you have to web
applications there are two peers which
communicate with each other and as far I
I remember there is a timeout method in
the session so all these errors and
timeouts can be handled by the session
whatever what I would want is for the
server to send a message with time at a
few seconds and if it fails execute some
business logic so and there is an
annotation on clothes and on clothes
should be open on time out so should be
invoked on time also if you are in
developing a web sockets application
they are annotations like on open on
clothes on it's where the second web so
cats on clothes javi
so there's close reason so when a web
socket session is closing and the
WebSocket session is going to be closed
in case a timeout happens so I'm this
and on the session and I'm just
interested in close reason what is here
predefined are there some predefined
closed codes and I'm pretty sure there
should be timeout it's a timeout
now there's no time out but on the
session there are lots of methods we can
adjust get max idle timeout this is what
we probably mean and and there is set
max idle timeout so what should happen
is if you invoke this said max idle
timeout and then and and then I would
expect that on Klaus is going to be
invoked and never tested this so I read
the question too late and in this
uncross should happen if it doesn't
happen it's probably a back on their own
day Tommy site or you could request at
least as a feature if this wouldn't work
what you can of course do is you could
do on the other side you know you could
just measure the time for the connection
and then closed explicitly so something
like this so but try d on clothes and it
should work this is actually the
official way of doing this ok now we
have I think all questions answered but
we have let's go here ah how to update
pyara if I run the update tool it pulls
stuff from Oracle and this is nice you
should file a back from from this is
actually that is the update tool and old
and old tool from from from update tool
from from glassfish what I do in I use
actually a payara is I am I did download
the latest release so this is longer
question how to update pyara so what I
believe is it's called immutable
infrastructure so if i run currently
application service i think the first
thing i do either i launched them in a
docker container or i launch the
application service in in on my on my
disk but i configure them we using
scripts so then it is actually i tested
i tested
download netbeans class fish no update
what I had in one point of time ahead
and wrote a script like update glassfish
and what it did it it downloaded
glassfish from from oracle or pyara from
pyara and then run my script which set
up in all my environment like JVM
settings and so you can use easily as
admin tool for this and and then you
have a robust way actually the same way
you will need on continuous integration
so I never used the update tool from
from Oracle nice so how do ya iframes
microservices for eih and so Adam what
do you think about event baths in micro
service architecture so so far so far
all my projects we use jax-rs between
between between micro services in now
with thinking about using web sockets
and in one project we use a JMS because
it's clustered anyway and we don't have
any single point of failure but usually
just jax-rs okay so
would you go with angular 15 actually
right now I'm using in production
angular 2 so right now I'm using angular
20 so if you're starting right now
adjusting angular 20 angular 1 is 2
different I guess we are done so all the
questions are answered I hope hey this
is from the train hopefully without the
Leafs leaves on the track in Netherlands
so thank you hands cruiser so this is I
hope we don't get you know any any
endless loop because if you are showing
streaming me from twitter i'm streaming
you so otherwise we know we can shut
down the internet so thank you for
watching see you now in four weeks so
you have enough enough time to ask
questions on github and yeah have a
great summer you know go out and play
not just spend all the time on the on
the on the on the of behind a machine
and see an upcoming conferences I'm
going to Java one my session was
approved so I just have just one session
this time and wiser usually I know I
spent several I delivered several
sessions Jovan had no time to do
something anything else but I was this
time my job on going to be short i would
spend at think only two days in san
francisco something like this deliver
one session about real-world
microservices so this actually might
intend to show this otherwise see you at
conferences drug shops in munich airport
or online and see you in September thank
you and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
