to the 36th edition of a hex TV and it
is 36th edition so I think this is the
third year so probably we are something
like a birthday or anniversary of of a
hex today I guess so let's celebrate
that somehow so thank you for watching
36 times actually so let's start with
the first topic and the first topic is
unusual because I get so many requests
about what's up with the regular Java
workshop so bootstrap effectives and I
was also asked for testing so what I did
the first time actually so published the
date up front and the first to date I
almost took out and or sold out and yeah
and we have soon the html5 workshop and
it was in summer June 27th there will be
bootstrap Java effective Java EE and
testing so now with the regular topics
and the first topic is Java EE news and
actually very good news so there is an
email from Linda de Michael from the
expert group and what I said we get a
public review of Java 8 in April May
2017 proposed final draft in June 2020
seventeenth and final release
just before vacations I guess is 2017 so
what I stated over and over again that
like Oracle is on vacation so they are
not working with Java anymore and what
looks like they are now no recharge and
working cranking like crazy building a
Java 8 and it is actually be ready to
use before Java 1 even which are
actually great news and yeah all the
promises from from the keynote at Java
Java 1 2016 there actually hold so a
very really great news about about the
Java EE progress so I'm particular
interesting we have Jason be lots of
works is going to on this like Jax be
for Jason
jax-rs is in pretty good shape we even
get something like a flow API which is
going to look like Java 9 a flow API so
um
CDI 200 is doing well and the security
is doing well
so I'm actually good news for Javy so
and we have already some some attendees
from Brazil and which is really nice
ok Java 8 News done a chai Singleton's
in Java AIDS I will switch to the origin
questions from github gist and what you
see here is the first question from
Monsieur Giants and seems that wide side
supports AJ citizens in a class
environment this is true it always
supported that that's a that's by are
supported PG 2 and the question is how
whitefly supports that and what white
thread does cluster means you have
multiple instances of application server
and there is you can say you know
there's a che singleton and this class
is going to be active on one cluster if
this cluster node dies it becomes awake
on D on the other side or on another
note on the backup note and payara had
something like this in the cluster mode
but I would I don't know I'd like to
rely on AJ Singleton's in white fly or
print object on on ba so what I would
rather do to rely on hazel caste or
infinite span and because they come with
like distributed data structures like
maps cues and executors and they are
more portable than proprietary
application server features so if you
are searching for Singleton's the
question is why you need a singleton
probably you will have to know you have
to have you know to do to open a certain
amount of connections with the backend
or do something like this so what you
can do you can you can rely on built-in
for instance then hazel can't
hazel caste map or in Finnish pen map
and store the data there and this gets
automatically distributed to all nodes
another way to deal with singleton is
just store the stuff in a database so
sequel database just databases are are
actually Singleton's so um yes payara
glass
said that in in the in the clustered
configuration based on it was unfriendly
cold shoulde yeah let's see shoul Java
actually exactly the project shoal and
the singleton from from from glasses was
based on the project and let's see
whether Scholl had Singleton's Java
singleton because whether it was exposes
and you see and you will probably find
something like Egypt B Singleton's and
and showed but this is again not
portable and and I would not rely on
that and I would not even rely on the
project sholde because this project is
not very popular
I would rather rely on hazel cars and
finished pen I just remembered the
hectic cluster and the old cluster
GlassFish story and was curious whether
it is actually still around the corner
so arm so this was the tha singleton a
question about GMS is possible to avoid
the GMS message were delivering case of
rollback of system failure is absolutely
is the problem is this is provided
specific features so all EMS providers i
know are able to do this so if you look
for instance at apache activemq this
will be the configuration from apache
activemq so what you can say you can say
okay presence here said maximum three
deliveries to in case of road back so he
says it's infected session is used to
enroll by this code and all that is
called in case in case of of a runtime
exception as well so the the transaction
is automatically roll back and okay so
this is what what you can do and if you
if you search even it was all supported
it's a JMS message redelivery you always
will find read livery
exactly so we'll find the old docks from
from ba and there's also a message
redelivery we can set up you know how
often the message gets redeliver but you
cannot set it up using the GMs api you
have to rely on application server
configuration or the SPI okay so next
one make Pringle ask me okay we have so
you can run a Java on in clouds and you
can run it on in your own on your own
machine somewhere so what are the
options and and and he also says my
project are not business-critical so I
would say I'm running my my server on or
my application on my own server why I'm
doing this because I would like to set
up everything from scratch and really
understand what is going on behind the
scenes so if you rely on for instance
Amazon ECS you get now ready to use
docker you don't have to set up the DD
tokens and struggle with the network but
you don't learn as much so mike pringle
the question is if you are consultant I
would go with no bare metal server and
build everything from scratch and you
will learn a lot how it works how it
behaves and and the speed is also
interesting like my server is crazy fast
so you know I can I can launch several
application servers in seconds so but if
you spin up a cloud instance it is a lot
slower the question why because they
have to isolate stuff and and and do
more work and the question is always or
your questions you you see actually what
is the overhead of the cloud or overhead
to set up over it of the clouds and how
how it behaves on bare metal so I'm
having a set for client projects where I
really don't know you know where they
are going on how they are become popular
I would rather choose you know iCloud
before I will rely on my own service
um yeah so um I would say what I'm doing
right now I'm running on my server but
it's still experimenting a lot of with
clouds and run some applications the
cloud didn't come back to the server and
see see see how it works so um so this
is what I can tell you so I started with
the with the with my own hardware in the
year 2000 and and I never regretted this
so I really learned a lot so the next
one from from Roy yeah
great blogging video so yeah thank you
for watching so I could record whatever
I like but if no one watches this is no
weight value so and interesting question
so I order it message stream handling
daya for instance Capcom so Kafka is
like looks like JMS based on files which
are backed by a zookeeper and what Roy
would like to have would like to have
ordered message so the first thing is if
you are using if you are relying on
messaging protocols you should not rely
on the order of messages this would be I
would consider the spectres if the order
of messages is important you are a
little bit in trouble and Kafka ensures
the order of messages but the problem is
if there's two topics so the the order
of met of messages cannot be ensured
anymore and this is very similar to
tcp/ip itself so if you have the newer
you get TCP IP packets and each packet a
sequence number and the packets are
ordered regarding to the sequence number
but if you open multiple connections the
the the order of the packets cannot be
ensured and more and this is exactly
what you get the same problem what your
what you get so what you will have to do
is to implement or to pass something
like a correlation ID a correlation ID
with the message and wait until the
message arrives and then order this but
what can happen then is you lose a lot
of performance or scalability so this
might be an
shoo so uh in your case I would try to
rethink your business case and try not
to rely on the order of message before
you implement a correlation I didn't try
to solve the messages and you will
actually have to implement something
like tcp/ip algorithms to say ok if the
message didn't arrived I will just
request it again and this makes the
whole staff more complex ok the next one
is just watch your boundary control
entity a hex video where you place
exceptions and other cross-cutting
things and this is actually very very
easy to explain so if you have let's say
calm a hex messages boundary so I would
say here messages resource class so
messages resource and this would be a
component called messages I could get
another component called for instance
ordering boundary and like whatever and
the question is where to put like out of
order exception right or invalid state
exception which would be common to both
of them and the question is relative so
the answer is very simple I would put it
here because it is common to both so I
will put the exception here invalid
state exception and because it is a 3 it
already means this exception is common
to both to everything which is here so
this call me X so this is if we were if
we had several applications which like
messaging 24 and I would put it on this
level it would mean this this exception
would be would be shared across across
applications like another application
called workshops lectures workshops
registration
so what is also very common this is
actually never happened to my project so
I always have one project per or one
micro-service per war even no never
multiple applications to award so this
is uncommon but to make it more
realistic so let's let's now delete this
it would look like that
so messaging invalid state exception and
then if because it is common to all the
boundaries and what I could also get in
this case messaging dot jax-rs
application and this is annotated with
the path and yet this is top level so
and if I need some other cross-cutting
themselves I never never try to or I
never implement you know or create a
package called util I would rather try
to do messaging dot logging and say okay
Rd loggers and messaging configuration
so it means these are the main
responsibilities but they are not
business responsibilities rather than
rather than cross-cutting concerns and
this and this class both classes are
common for other components I hope now
it's crystal clear if not I would have
to record another video about this so
let me know that clear if not I will
create a screencast so another one I
have a war app war and I want to deploy
this war into two separate sub folders
at the same way for instance and so the
only thing I can imagine is this app war
contains static assets like react html5
or whatever and your services and this
this had to be split to two different
folders so what you could achieve you
could do so I would actually create two
wars it's actually what I always do a UI
war and the services war and the you are
UI war or zip even just contains HTML 5
in JavaScript and the backend just
contains the
services and you could of course you
know create or play with play with your
build scripts and to try to separate
that but this is highly proprietary and
and this is also very was a unstable at
any point of time you know the whitefly
can change behavior and then you are
stuck with with the solutions okay Pavel
so old friend actually interviewed him
on my block he asked me or asked States
I talked a lot about sin wars and the
Ptolemy's he has some useful libraries
like Apache Delta spike and the question
is what I wear I put these and so for
instance I never had the I never had an
OD the need to use Delta spike in
production I use Delta spike for testing
and the G library has to be really
really loose useful until I put it into
the war this could be like serialization
library so recently I used cryo for
certain reasons for Jax or a
serialization so this was inside a war
but it was not that big but this could
be actually one of the killer features
of so called how they are called micro
or yeah micro application servers like
payara swarm the payara micro or why
place warm for instance what you can do
with payara micro you could create your
own jar containing you know all the
libraries you need and then point to the
thin war outside the payara micro what
you gain from that is basically if you
if you're using cloud deployments or
everything is basically based on docker
you will build the payara micro once
with all your dependencies in your case
Delta spike and your death in war will
remain sin and you will only have to
rebuild the payara micro in case a new a
new version or Delta spike is on the
horizon the same is true in whitefly
swarm and this is called a hollow jars
and the question is do you completely
omit any additional dependencies beside
Java II I would say in most cases
absolutely so this is what I try to do
and I never regret that so if you if you
don't have any dependencies you know I
don't have to think about upgrading them
about patching them about security
issues about you know hit by bus issues
developers no more available or and just
the library disappears one point of time
and we had already the issue not with
the Delta spike rather than I think it
was called seam solder it was like the
precursor of Delta spike it I think
though seems older it was a normal
maintain anymore and we have to move
somewhere else and then it's okay then
you know we don't use any additional
level we just stuck with or stuck here
we just use Java 8 7 and nothing else
yeah or you can of course too if you
don't have the micro you can create a
base image of your application server
which inherits like from the official
application server image and then put
all your dependencies there ok yeah this
would be a provided dependency and by
the way Pavel told me once that in his
team someone has my last name Ben and
also uses eg bees which is funny because
I never met someone else with my last
name so interesting so next one bollocks
mm I by the way has to check double
check whether there are questions from
chat no questions from chat no questions
from Twitter I think the issue is I
started today have an hour earlier and
this is probably all know so if you if
used very good bit mr. Tucker
if you started to have a lot of
exception classes would you end up with
a messaging exceptions package no not
exceptions package so I would say I
never the issues then inside a messaging
package I get you know 20 exceptions it
since under
stick so um and the exceptions usually
are not cross-cutting so on the view
exceptions are cross-cutting exception
usually for instance you get logging
exceptions but the logging exceptions I
will put in logic pet package because
they are logging related configuration
exceptions I will put in the
configuration package because they are
configuration related and yeah and only
you know my business exception or
whatever exception would be in the top
level package perfect okay so next one
is interesting BC archetype thank you
for using my stuff which is deployed in
Paris ever do you know what any way to
get the code coverage with the systems
preferably with Jacko cobertura
absolutely
so I'm actually I don't know where they
are recorded at screencast but this is
what I show at the workshops of Munich
Airport for instance so what do you have
to do is you only have to to set up the
jacoco agent on the application server
and exclude all do you know or GlassFish
or org wide fly packages and then if you
kill the server you know you get the
jack o co x ik file and the jacoco exact
file can be used in your IDE or so na
and you get the code coverage for system
tests so this is how how it works you
have to set up the jacoco agent kill the
server and after the system test you get
the code coverage so and also very good
questions the warning is excellent
questions thank you
I read your blog post about JSONP
conversions so I'm actually someone arm
and and I company asked me what is my my
thinking about Jason and details and
should they user notified before I ask
you very male ever at a blog post and
what I did Jason knew DTO
and then being saying this is the blog
post I wrote where is it
Jason is the new dto and and being very
good so I found that and this is what I
did in in projects and it worked well
it's a little bit ugly so I mean ugly
from the conceptual perspective but
Forks really well so um the following so
each domain object it could be ended
whatever expect in a constructor Jason
object and this object is realize itself
and can have any number of - Jason
methods which she realises itself to
Jason so this is visualization and
serialization and hence it is within the
object you have to be access to all the
private page you don't need getters and
setters just works very well and then in
the resource you can just you know say
okay this star all and I can just you
know convert the workshops to Jason's
and do whatever with with streams and
now and now I get a question which is
very good one Jason bees around the
corner and Jason B will come with
annotation second I could annotate the
domain objects and whether I would still
use my approach and I think so because
because if we look at the blog post or
is it here the cool story is I could
have any number of - Jason lessons and
actually use it once already
in in a project and I could evenly
no-return slices of the objects or or
even you know and how to call it if the
structure both had a link to the
attendees I could create a custom jason
with the object and parts of the
attendees so that I'm more flexible of
course what I probably will do I would
start with Jason B and if this doesn't
work anymore then I will switch back to
this approach because this this is a
little bit more work but with having
that said more work what I see still in
project is like developer developers are
copying without any reasons details and
entities back and forth and this is a
lot more code than this and in some
projects they
right by hand no strange to stream
methods which is also very similar to
this what you can also do you can
actually modify the two string template
in your IDE to generate this this is
very very similar okay I think we cover
this well some one please if you can
write no shorter shorter questions
because I will have to you know
rereading takes a longer time so first
text tag for a new product two main
problems so first is bootstrapping
a product for different environments
this test different production
environments and says okay where spring
boot chains there is no concept in Java
EE with that and it's absolutely true
but what I recognized actually all my
clients have already something in place
so if you have Dhaka the idea would be
that the Java applications should not
know in which environment you are and
all the configurations provided
externally by Daka
and there is already a similar question
later for instance in one of my current
projects we use Tommy and what Tommy is
able to do it will you can just place
environment entries variables in your
configuration file and Tommy will
replace that at load time and then you
have and then it's starting docker just
say okay I am in test integration or
whatever and you just provide two
different values for different
environments and the problem is solved
this is a matter of a property file and
most of my recent projects recent means
in the last three years you didn't have
to know 50 different resources rather
than usually one to two databases and I
don't know one to three different micro
services by the problem but the micro
service communications already solved by
Daka and the only thing which remains
the public credentials and for the
credentials I wouldn't use something
like this rather than you will reliably
on etcd openshift there there's there is
a way to store the the credentials
already
dislike binary store for credentials I
think is even called secrets I think
it's called secrets or credentials or
there is another great product called
Hoshi Corp volt so it's like password as
a service the puzzle the encryption as a
service those open-source so does there
are lots of I don't think it belongs
actually to the application to care
about the environments so my wars are
identical in all environments okay
I hope it's clear right now and if you
go to my youtube channel so I had
several several screencasts regarding
you know staging and daca and a micro
service and docker with daca networks
and you will see what I wasn't doing the
daily application is completely unaware
in which environment is the application
running so you I stack like okay which
what what to choose and this is actually
the the the whole day of the first html5
workshop in March we do in Munich and
the gist of this or the essential what I
would try to look at the standards first
and in 2017 we we can go already pretty
far so es6 is the new javascript looks
almost like Java
it is perfectly usable we have web
components serviceworker so with that
you can build with a swing like or Java
it's like applications without any
additional framework and if you choose
frameworks I would so I'm to be little
bit careful but in my opinion angular 2
is a little bit over engineered it's
like it's like you know Java EE or no
Java j2e the old j2e applied to
JavaScript like you have to specify
providers in order to get injections
then you can eject something and then
you have to create module first and
maintain all the dependencies it's like
a dependency injection without
conventional configuration this how
would
classify angular2 so if you have a huge
application go with angular 2 if the
application smaller react is a lot nicer
and issues also look at polymer why
because polymer tries to go with
standard first and then my hope is that
in one time this polymer just provides
additional you know or niceness or
additional syntactic sugar which is
optional and then you can rely on
because right now there's still a
polyfill so to make the component works
in different browsers so I have the same
philosophy in UI as at the back end look
at the standards first and then you will
live longer of course they are not that
exciting little bit boring because it's
standard but yeah now in one point of
time it just says to work okay this is
the question how you manage database
connection doc I'm using Tommy and I
define our connection as a resource
Tommy
so what Tommy does if you go let's see
whether you can find it Tommy
configuration and vairam and entries so
it's actually documented the
a placeholder in the newer drama
documentation there is it's a little bit
harder to find variables no but it is
the tummy now they are rewriting the
ecology documentation and in the newer
documentation there is I they show you
know this is basically very simple in
the Tommy dot conf you just use with the
dollar curly braces you put the name of
the operating system variables the
environment entry or environment
variable and it's get replaced
automatically by Tommy before that what
I used I used on on my server and subst
it's like UNIX a tool which does the
same the so it will substitute in
whatever fly file you you give the to
the DD variables with the actual content
which happens to be provided by
environment entries and with docker with
Emanuel's - e switch you can you can
easily do this though is that you can
actually you know feed all application
servers on earth which wheat
configuration size and it told me
specific case you can skipped in the new
Tom media's and subs with the native
Tommy capability so you are luck lucky
because it comes with Tommy Tommy out of
the box this one is also interesting the
question is no what the hell is to Java
ik singleton and the answer to this is
you won't find it in CDI because the
whole story was the following so there
is a jzp torque so whichever community
process and there is an specification is
called 330 and it's called dependency
injection for Java and surprisingly it
was proposed by ro Johnson in the year
2009 and as you probably know the the
the mr. Johnson was behind spring so
they try to store day they actually
standardized they standardized the
dependency injection the funny thing is
they were crazy fast so their day they
proposed this Peck and implemented the
spec in about six weeks or eight weeks
so it was a very short amount of time
but there is no PDF so they just
provided the tests the Javadoc and
implementation without writing about
that this is the reason why I don't find
the PDFs but the cool story was at the
same time there was a CDI going on and
CDI had owned inject on annotations and
I think data called in and out and what
what happened
Diaz respected look at this speck say
okay this is cool actual is proposed by
the spring guys we should not ignore
that and they just replaced the CDI in
and out annotations with jets out to the
authority so what we get right now we
get three the whole dependency injection
is based on truth or key and the CDI
uses that so for me what I what I did
want Iacocca said okay the 330 is like
JDBC in this CD is like j'ai pas or jpn
JDBC and but the problem is there's some
overlap like this
GSR 330 also comes with singleton and
the singleton is also provided by CDI
called application scoped which is a
little bit confusing but there this is
on both annotations doing the same this
is a history seven years old crazy so
yeah it is supported by CDI and wealth
and everyone so I never tried to inter
integrate Swaggart because what I used
is a great tool from Monsieur - now it's
called jax-rs analyzer and the structure
is analyzer what is thing does it
generates the swagger file from metadata
and it works good enough
and and what I don't like to be
depending on swag annotations of my
codes I will you know you the whole code
is depending on the swag annotations and
it's a lot of noise and I wanted to say
mess but it's actually noise and F and
if you just look for instance PayPal
this is one REST API so it is very well
documented but if you go here let's see
whether we find something okay
billing agreements agreements create
your agreement details so if you look at
this and it's okay show our groom and
details this is this will be output of
such API show details for a billing
agreements get payment billing agreement
so you get the response and the fourth
and this really helps to write something
sensible if the API is well done so in
the projects where the API as well done
is like Java doc it is really hard to
write Java doc in projects where the
metric methods are self explaining so on
what I see right now in the whole
swagger movement is like it is the same
what happens in Java doc developers just
writing you know get payments so this
rest returns payments and then everyone
is happy but you can redirect the holes
with swagger stuff in dev null so I try
to avoid these swagger annotations what
I use this plugin from Monsieur - nah I
Sebastian - nah and that this plugin
just examines the jack source resource
without any other annotation that
creates asciidoc which can be converted
to HTML or PDF and also swagger file
which works well enough in my project ok
cool so let's see what happens in chat
nothing in charge
so okay David tolls okay I should do a
YouTube video on how to organize apps
the traction boundary control module
domains repository service okay
boundary control entity repository
service no needed but yeah I could
create a screencast one time why not
so this is answered so the new pyrolysis
comes with deactivated auto deployment
featured you to security risk
what is the workaround so what I will do
in Docklands Docklands is my project
which comes with lots of github github
and and be dark lens and there are lots
of dock images which I used as a base
for my project and there is for instance
payara configured and pyro configured is
a placeholder for pi RS from projects
and what I would do I would try to
reactivate the auto deployment here in
the payara configured and then if I
image will inherit from the payara
configured I get still gets the auto
deployment and I think the security
issues are not that important in Dhaka
and and are more important if you have
shared deployments and should not be
used in production actually on a
standalone service so this would be my
work around and I expend a long startup
times I also sometimes experience that
and unfortunately the last time I
experienced that was my Java one talk in
San Francisco so if you go and you try
to find my talk about micro services in
San Francisco I was really disappointed
by my performance because it took
forever to deploy a pair to start and
what I think what it is is if my dog is
running and then changing the network it
causes some timeouts and and my
suspicion is that at a startup from of
payara
it tries to pink you know the
motherships i'm
and this I have some statistics but if
you change the framework of the
framework the network settings there is
a very long time out using docker
probably 50 seconds so it can takes
takes 15 to 20 seconds so what I did the
Java one I think I restarted docker and
this denna just work properly so it was
very very slow but right now is very
fast so if I if I restart docker so if
the network changes the Gigi deployment
performances is very fast and I actually
don't see any difference between the
payara full and para micro so as you can
see para it becomes more and more
popular lots of questions regarding
payara
yeah please how we deal with field
validation in Java figs and F XML I mean
this is a broader topic you should look
at afterburn I don't know where they no
afterburners like also on my github
after burner FX exactly in the indie and
the afterburner is like is where is T
here so the afterburner is like
model-view-controller framework for java
fix and what you would do you would
create a view with a fix ml and the all
the controls will be injected to a
control by by Java fix and the
validation I would solve with binding I
will bind the field values to our
control and the control will validate
the fields in case the values embedded
you could you know whatever you can
replace a CSS class and make the field
read or you can or yeah you can play
with the user injections the disk sky's
the limit what I actually wanted to say
what he can also do you can use bean
validation inside Java fix because you
can boot
validator so hibernate validator for
instance with Java fix and I use this
for integration testing so I think it's
called validation secretary and if you
launch this you can you can launch the
Java EE validation framework within your
integration test and it takes I don't
know half a second or a second you can
do the same in Java fix so this is what
I would do
okay the next one is the chrome sunny L
expression Factory it's not found and I
got I think the issue with all the
integrations has been validation test
and this was in the blog post and this
is the error what I got it could be
other your error and then this was the
build default validation factor is just
how to to launch day and you don't have
to do use arquillian for that you can
just do this so I never use arquillian
to test my bean validation just go with
that and I got the response from guna
which was respected back then or still
is forbidden validation to oh by the way
the bean validation to always also going
very well
and what I did they in the Rubies 5-2
they seem to solve the issue so if you
first I would never use or I wouldn't
use arquillian to test or to launch key
validation framework there are just two
lines of code which worked well for me
and this is how to test validation in
without the arcane or application server
or outside the application server okay
then the third question is when we need
to override gate classes get Singleton's
in application class only if you provide
you know you own Jack's BC Eliza's or to
your own stuff otherwise you don't have
to do this so and let's see what happens
here
okay everyone is happy perfect so a good
one
key clock is like a single sign-on
solution which runs well on Wi-Fi users
in lots of projects is like security as
a service and there is an integration
some what Key Club is like remote
Darrell there is a key cloak and open am
it is an old son product open am from
from Fort Rock and and key cloak and
they work similarly and what happens is
you have the application server which
actually delegates or asks key clock all
the time you know with with built-in
caching of course you know
may I you know give the user the
permission to access this URI and what
you can do you can implement the Java
adapter config which which means is like
remote realm so the application server
asks a proxy which delegates to the key
clock and I will prefer that if it's
available if not available usually what
you do you would use the server filter
adapter or you can do implement your own
container request or response filter and
of course sometimes you will have to use
the how it's called client
authentication yeah and the and the
particular form of client authentication
is a JavaScript client of course like
angular react they can ask directly key
cloak you know for authentication so the
answer is I would prefer Java updates
available if not the service filter and
kind of indication for for JavaScript
okay what's up with chat India can't can
you suggest any framework which can be
used to service for service and
orchestration in Java there are lots of
frameworks I think one is called Combe
loose
one framework is called I forgot about
that which called day one the one Java
one Duke Award but I have to say I never
used service orchestration frameworks or
I mean openshift I don't know what the
service orchestration could be called
OpenShift so OpenShift is like a really
nice framework which combines already
etcd age a proxy and cuban ities or the
cuban it is an orchestration framework I
think though so I would suggest Cuban it
is first then then openshift
and but if you ask me about API gateway
is usually we I don't use at the I
gateways in micro-service I hate
actually I only use them if I really
have to replace external providers at
the runtime or something like this but
not for my own application by the way
what I forgot there was a question which
was funny not funny it was very good
regarding the cloud so and opens us one
of the club's managed server exactly and
he uses logon and the logon calls was
nice video and the cool stories where is
it this is a screenshot of the of the
legume with a video from the from the
company called light band and they say
ok how lightweight microservices can be
built and if you if you look at the code
is activity stream service input
implements activity stream service and
they have project Sherpa if you look at
the a D and D modules like activity
stream API activity stream input chip in
API input one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten projects of one
micro service
and why what's interesting in a recent
project we someone presented me know a
micro Java micro services 12 modules and
at the end we just created one war which
was very lean and I just look at it you
have to watch the video this region was
nice missing it well done and then just
would looked at is like what's that this
is a micro service with 12 modules I
mean to build this it is a terrible I
mean you have here
imple and interface and if you would
like to see what implemented or the
interface you will have to click you
know in the ID and then my questions
always what happens if they get the next
another implementation of the activity
service will they call it input 2 should
be interesting so this is the log of
story which I remember so I think we are
done is the third year so thank you for
watching and see you next month and of
course next month next month also means
probably even Munich so yes this is
April this is around the DX and for sure
ad HTML 5 essentials actually the first
day here I will try how far you can go
without any additional JavaScript
frameworks and then show a little bit of
react and angular ok then thank you for
watching and see you next month or in
March bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
