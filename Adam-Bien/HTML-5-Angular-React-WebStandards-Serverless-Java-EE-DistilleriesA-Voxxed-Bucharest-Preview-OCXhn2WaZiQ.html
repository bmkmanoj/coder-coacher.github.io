box the required to march can tell us a
bit about your fashion my attention I
get lots of questions about html5
direction of html5 and lots of questions
about back end and what's the technology
of the future and so on and at this
session in vox Booker is the first time
I would try to answer both and the idea
is I will start very fast to build
something on the back end with the
current java ee technology and then show
you some options in the front end and
absolute web standard called web
components with a little bit of help of
polymer polyfills which is optional and
then compare react to angular this is
what I plan to do 55 polarized between
angular and yet so it will be able to
the session so my next question is why
is this subject important why are these
web GUI applications important to web
applications are important because right
now the mobile devices are more popular
than desktop devices and and what's also
important for enterprise companies who
they usually do something with a little
bit more longevity so they try to play
me know for one to three years and not
for two months so um and what they what
many people believe is that angular 2 is
like you know evolution of angular 1
which is not the case is a revolution
and this would I would like to clarify a
little bit in one session I think it
will work very quick and who could upend
your session of beginners intermediate
as bad my second I usually let's say
this so are my coat from the business
perspective is trivial so it will end up
being you know a very trivial logic
invoke from several frameworks so to
understand that should be simple so I
would say beginner to intermediate
expert really depends I don't know what
there are many experts with java ee and
html5
deep knowledge so someone's there could
attend but I think beginner intermediate
nope am pragmatic programmers this is
what I looking for yeah and what are
some key things that Sandy's will will
take from your session ah I shouldn't
reveal this right because it would be a
surprise but the key thing is if you are
pragmatic technology do not matter and
you can be crazy crazy productive with
stuff we have right now and with react
angular and web components and even for
for the back end I will show you the
simplest possible built setup which this
is also a key you don't have to go crazy
and download whole the world you know to
implement her world and ok confirm from
my opinion do you think when as you
think that the mobile application and
web application we replace that all
decks of application ah I think what can
happen if you if you if you look at the
direction where it's going you know the
Microsoft with the new surface the huge
one forgot towards the name actually you
know the huge thing for Microsoft with
the specific surface professional i
think is the huge panel also mike what's
the Apple us which going you know to the
ipad pro with external keyboard what I
think it may blow that I know the
desktop app will look like more a web
app and web app could move a little more
like desktop app we already see it with
electron and html5 and native stuff and
also browsers become more and more
capable it is like the virtual machine
for for you I so I think probably in 23
years this won't matter because you know
one app should run different devices and
I would see a convergence like you know
the mobile phones would be more capable
and the desktop is would be more usable
probably with some touch you all we
already saw no is the new macbook pro
some touch elements
and and I think Windows 10 is already
you have a hybrid operating system where
touch you can use touch in mouse at the
same time yes the time they have this
capability yeah so a lot of interesting
topics for for your patient do you do
speak up some other conferences in the
organization in size because I try to
avoid conferences actually so I get lots
of my invitations and but i have to work
between the conferences and this is my
problem but one of the coolest i think
is cern there's a box at CERN it is like
your sister or brother conference and
some conferences in Poland there's a
crazy stuff going on then the nudie Jax
conferences like a german classic and i
would try to spend more time at javaone
that's so far and yeah what I this year
I will still try to spend time a little
bit more even the last name in code and
conferences I only good if you know the
flight connection is good which is
perfect in your case so it's like a not
problem at all and yeah and a question
to you how many attendees do you expect
around we expect to be here around five
hundred and this we had the past year
around four hundred and we eventually
eventually we want to grow into a devoxx
Bucharest and is our plan on medium term
and we want to keep a good growth piece
so I think quite understand list this
year it will be a reasonable target
there should be achievable so I was one
in Java user group in cluj and they were
like 180 developers you know so we would
have already fifty percent almost we we
have somewhere some attendees from Cluj
already secure their their seeds so we
would have some some some participants
from there but mainly we have fun
eucharist we also have them from other
from other cities who have fun yash and
also we have from Bavaria and say we
assign some people attending so it will
be a nice mix of people of vulcanalia
cool what I learned enclosures people
developers tend to hate Dracula so I
will don't do nothing with Dracula in
your in your presentation but they
really like touring car Palin kind all
the stuff so we could move in the
direction you know actually just like
kind of overrated every area from the
world is talking about Dracula and the
Romanians are yeah it was really yeah
exactly ok stop talk about Dracula's I
would you like it's like okay then do
distillery is okay this is cool idea so
we build restful webservice five years
ago for hurting cos I think like three
times of this beverage coverage and it's
on on a gradual scale we have some not
so not so strong to very strongly with
you give me some names so my talk to as
an example the strongest one is one well
in car but to the kind of Pauline car so
later that first one panaqa the next one
was the next level the intermediate
level we don't have intermediate to have
so there is something but is not not
called drink hole in car but it's
exactly the touring car this is what I
also learned on the search one you have
something search and no so this week
guys kind of medium and holding guides
low but nobody's talking about for Inca
because it's so low ah ok on the
intermediate is planning kind the next
one so give me the name planning car
holding current a certain name sweet car
its kind of swinging carpet yes we can
ok I have it for my talk so this is what
I needed you know this is the levels any
questions for me about my talks ok yes
already everything
yeah we can discover the covers
everything and as I think it would be a
great presentation we have keynote to
kind of session so everybody will will
get to see your session so oh thank you
very much yeah thank you for coming then
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
