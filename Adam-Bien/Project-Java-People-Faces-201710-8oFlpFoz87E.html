so I'm employing Microsoft Chapman and
I'm working of the so Java evangelist
and the Microsoft and so Microsoft is
extremely change so the our message is
so technology can change the world so so
so Joe Java agile is available so many
kind of the friction like a coupon a
dish or purchase people are people are
crap are so many things we can use
so please enjoy Java developer so Java
Roger thank you so much
one question what is the best job a
server ah for me yeah yeah I'll add you
know paella oh very good thank you very
much thanks a question who are you hi my
name is Roberts Colvin and I'm the
chairman of Apache maven hey cool
what are doing get to everyone looking
at all the new things and of course
talking about Java 9 and maven and how
it's all working so what are the big
news maybe maven runs fine on Java 9 and
almost all the plugins are also ready
for Java 9 we're doing the latest stir
things fixes and of course check out the
latest version of maven 3 500 is already
out there for a couple of months it has
color support and three five one or two
is coming soon as well what was the last
meeting commit
that's a couple of days ago okay perfect
thank you going to me now yes nothing
new yet fire of Allah and egb timer on
micropile right that's right
so we are we're recording there yeah
okay so we have an EJB timer that's
driving a LED display
you also have an EJB timer as measuring
humidity so this is a Raspberry Pi with
a sensor on medicine of humidity it's
firing
EGP
seedy sorry CDI events but then picked
up by this application on the Raspberry
Pi which is pushing them via WebSockets
through JSON through to the browser to
describe the screen so if I eyes hello
on this humidity sensor you will see the
graph okay do it
Wow
we'll time all job re7 real time
separate of the network isn't CDI so
what do mean to get some beers right hey
that's very true here I've had many
beers
who are you my name is Mohammad on and
from Egypt
I'm a Jap a champion and working for a
finance company as an enterprise
architect and a vision around the senior
part of GCP member and you'll find me
around the world every time any
conferences with big guys and create
community perfect what are you doing a
travel one actually is this is my home
conference that I have separating with
my friends worldwide and knowing what's
new in the technology at the same time
we would like to keep track what's going
with Java especially Java in Java SE and
out the new and what is the strategy
behind this new worldwide technologies
at the same time I'm presenting a
session Java one about how to
effectively design the rest api it was
yesterday Monday and it was very full
back session and I'm very interested for
this hey cool
and you still like Jimmy yes for sure
and I'm worried about the new transition
and I would like to see that Java is a
very big language especially we have
developed a lot in Java you see now and
Java EE
very creative and competitive language
as a server-side language for the other
technologies so I wrote me I would like
to make sure that this java is robust
enough and go on the right on the right
bus okay thank you much
thank you very much Aaron stop do we get
all right jr. I'm talking about this
crazy game and I go what game he's a
desiccant it was a game on
your own ability games no I'm not only
building Gators but we built a game to
help people build other things because
other people learn like I do which is
like building stuff why you know so much
talk about open Liberty then because I
wrote it
ah you see this is actually a teaser
what is over Liberty
tiny lightweight flexible application
server written in Java with OSGi
underneath the covers and cleared of
services and configuration injunction
and offense insanity and it's all open
source
this isn't any kind related to what's
new it is related to WebSphere and it's
related to something that we had for
WebSphere Liberty that had started eight
years ago before my son was born and we
finally been able to push it open source
and you still hacking code
optimatus perfect thank you very much
thank you who are you hi I'm Ed Burns
what are you doing at JavaOne
I am enjoying my 18th or 19th JavaOne
and I'm talking about Java EE and server
list state service and I saw you in
subject for Oahu L right yep part of
Java eighty one of the key things one of
the big new things
that new JSF 2.3 okay what are the keys
to keep each other on summit for what
didn't make the most
oh what I like the most is it finally
gives us well I like the most is that
it's done
actually and we've been working on in a
long time but the feature wise the big
deal is http/2 and the big feature there
is server push which is something that
fits very well with web frameworks such
as JSF which as far as I know will be
the first of any Java server side web
framework take full advantage of HTTP to
server push so jsf will proactively if
you stop to the growth does indeed
because it knows what resources it has
what readers to do with the pages so it
can easily just push to me what is the
feminist thing great service is Oracle's
answer to as popular been seen an Amazon
lambda and it's the ability to have
functions that are infinitely scalable
that can be stateless but with the
addition of state provided by the server
estate service
thank you very much thank you John Smith
and what are you doing at JavaOne I'm
representing the FN project for watching
us what is the aim project it's a
service serverless framework platform
you have FD k FN flow for operating
functions and can we try it right now
yes
FN project at i/o take you to github
it's all there
ok thank you who are you I am Steven
Chen director of the Oracle developer
community and here at the job one of
Oracle code conferences in front of the
best part which is the beer demo the
cloud rude IOT beer demo so what are you
are doing a double on junk abuse coffee
with the bureau yeah so we have this
this demo we also have our CNC art
project over there with German artists
wool pencil and Miriam walnut who are
constructing a collaborative sculpture
we have bumps big router
over there which is a community project
built in Bob's garage and we have the 3d
builder playground where you can build
your own constructions using 3d printed
like those or tinker toys and then
upstairs we have the matrix full-time
demo which is a 360-degree camera system
that recreates the scene from The Matrix
movie of our neo dodges the bullets say
cool
lots of fun okay any other jumbled
unused you like the movie
yeah the part I like is it's almost over
oh do they cut it out no well it's the
busiest week of the year yeah there's a
lot of preparation leading up to this
okay and I'll be glad once once it's
over and we can say it's another
successful year of job one conference
okay thank you who are you my name is
Tory wheeled okay what I doing here I'm
a developer advocate for New Relic and
we just had a presentation where we
talked about JVM options and also use of
doctor and you still hiking Java I am
still hacking Java as well as I ever
have no perfect thank you my name is
Lauren Sherrod same I'm a university
professor from Belgrade professo nice
yeah youngest professor ever right yeah
well no no no I have a younger
colleagues did oh really okay what you
are doing here I'm learning new
technologies Java technologies and
looking for opportunities to apply deep
learning for
to Java applications perfect and what's
the name of your project the name of the
project is deep nets it's a deep
learning library it will be open sourced
soon and it will you eat it was
presented a Jawa perfect thank you
who are you hi my name is Sebastian what
are doing here I'm speaking in five
minutes
so but then you are submerged and Aashna
right yes I don't disturb our
discussions what are you what are you
doing here and you're speaking about
what I'm speaking about CQRS you know a
bus were driven in session
yeah chorus command query responsibility
segregation and which framework are
using Joey how big is you war six no
more I'm not sure but less than twenty
years work on the side otherwise it is
you know there's a lot of events
involved okay thank you
I'm gonna moring what are doing here I
am going to talk about in relation to
the dough and enough talk about Java
music oh why about bean validation um
because I happen to be the spec leads
and I worked with a group of talented
people on the new version of emulation
and yeah that's why I'm here to play it
cool what are the killer features of
bean validation then one sentence and
support for Java 8 so we take advantage
of type annotations for pizza relatives
we support a new Java date and time API
and everything else Joe White okay thank
you you're a compositor are you hi I'm
Casey on our ik at Oracle specifically
as a product manager of something called
Jets which is Oracle's
platform for giving front-end JavaScript
development okay Java Scoob or Java
JavaScript on the front end on the back
end you can do anything you like java ee
ee 4j spring
PHP nodes typically you would have a
rest endpoint from somewhere or
WebSocket and you would integrate that
into your data visualizations in jet so
this graphs and charts it's a modular
open client architecture you can take
out what you like you can put in
anything else
it's totally flexible and it's perfect
for this modern innovative JavaScript
ecosystem that's constantly changing you
don't want to be locked into a framework
you need a modular architecture and
that's what jet provides you spend your
whole time with Jen yes more or less
the the tooling for jets is netbeans so
you can open any folder on disk that has
a package.json file into NetBeans
without importing without anything this
go file open project and point to a
folder that contains package JSON just
like pom.xml yeah and it will open
Internet beans and so in that way you
can you can actually generate a project
application on the command lines come
online interface object create and it
scaffolds an application it does npm
call it does yeoman all under the hood
under the command line interface and
then you have your application on disk
and then you can open it into NetBeans
and then any changes you make inside
NetBeans are automatically picked up
because the command line tool has a
watcher built into it so any changes you
make when you do a save or picked up and
you have to refresh the browser the the
program workflow is really really nice a
coolness on any news yeah news on the
net besides is clearly that we are on
the way to Apache which means that
everyone needs to be involved in this
NetBeans go into Apache the first code
drop has been done four million lines of
code 25,000 files which is all in the
beginning I think it's less than half of
what it will be in the end is in Apache
gets mirrored on Apache github
github.com slash Apache slash incubator
- NetBeans and then you will see all the
code you can check it out do a git clone
and then run ant
in the root directory and you build
NetBeans just like any other application
this is just another application so you
can just run and it builds the whole
application then you have your
installation directory you can start up
NetBeans you can use NetBeans from
Apache to do Java 9 development you can
use J shell jigsaw J link or from that
build of NetBeans ok thank you thank you
or not sure thank you who are you
David Bloods founder of Tommy tribe and
I guess longtime Java EE open source
advocates what is Tommy tribe
it's a company that support and services
for Apache Tommy and basically you know
does security patches and very practical
things but of course helps people be
good citizens and open source what is
the key Deepika oh well the killer
feature is that is basically the
smallest lightest server that you could
possibly find we have a very different
perspective on app servers than anybody
else they're kind of made by people who
traditionally don't like app servers so
it's a great one for people who don't
like app servers we like we do different
perspectives most app servers that kind
of a modular and have a desktop
perspective and with Tommy we like let's
build a laptop and just wire everything
together it's tightly and cleanly as
possible I don't think we like the
result so once everything is all wired
together permanently and so fast no one
actually cares about tearing anything
else perfect thank you who are you
masa and Vivek who Matt I'm very perfect
what are you doing I helped run the
London Drive user group and I'm a Java
champion and I run a company called J
clarity but then London Java is a group
right yes that's right is it active ever
so slightly we have six and a half
thousand members okay hosted a bit just
about every week okay what I learned you
have a company with AI behind right is
like profiler would say I that's right
yeah so we use machine learning to try
and figure out where your performance
bottlenecks are in your Java reps okay
what's the name J clarity jaycara here
okay thank you very much
who are you oh okay I'm Bruno Souza
known as the Brazilian Java man and I
help job develop professional developers
to share what they know so they can grow
in their careers they can work on the
best project the best team so I know so
you know so if you want to share what
you know that's what I'd work for are
you still hanging still making jars your
hack job yes so that's that's that's
actually my day job I own a consulting
company and we help customers you know
in Java projects and so basically my day
job is to know coding hack job yes so
Java is actually used in Brazil right oh
yes it's very user yes you know so it's
it's by far the most user programming
language and there's a lot of on the
server sizes a lot of java ee there's a
lot of spring also and yes so job is
very very well using cool finish it's
gonna just look into your back okay yes
you know there's a long story why I wear
it but it just happened because I had to
find a group of Brazilians at JavaOne
and Java one that time had like you know
15,000 people in it yeah
and we only five Brazilians or something
like this okay so I know I had to find a
good way to find that self okay that's
how I started
perfect thank you thanks very much
from the elastic platform as a service
for developers okay what is your lastik
jelastic is a platform the service for
developers it simplifies life for
developers they can focus on coding can
just I can do admin stuff for them so
you can use elastic as a powerful tool
to you know to increase your
productivity cool and does Java EE of
course we do support Hawaii and this
week we announced very sweet stuff for
the Java developers about Java EE thank
you very much who are you I'm your boss
ha CTO of gloom divisions cloud products
what is gluten gluten is a company that
enables the mobile enterprise so we
extend existing enterprise and cloud
functionality to mobile devices so if
you're a Java developer and you write an
enterprise back-end and you want to
expose it functionality via a mobile app
and you want that mobile app to be in
Java you can use our tools
hey cool are you participating in the
keynote again this year my contract has
not been renewed we didn't agree on the
fee because you are the crazy dr. Rossi
right yeah it was not good for my image
to keep that again but I do a session on
quantum computing which is also cool oh
cool
really quantum computing exactly 24
feels perfect and
when quantum computing will be a part of
you one we're still working on the
hardware because as you know grown is
hardware and software engineer two
worked it together but it's we're not
quite there yet so at this moment we
focus on the mobile enterprise ok Maya
mix Java one then right time is
difficult and a relative thing so it's
hard to make commitments
perfect who are you Who am I
my name is Rosa Romano
I guess a Java enthusiast a longtime
consultant I've been a consultant most
of my life I've spent a lot of money a
lot of my time evangelizing Java EE on
my own and when trying to contribute to
the Java EE specifications but you are
the the person behind guardians right
that's right yeah I'm one of the people
that helped launch the Guardians as well
booth and I were talking to everyone yes
I've got one taking a session one panel
actually a couple of sessions a couple
of panels
yeah which sessions so I just finished
one that was on what we're doing with
the footage of Chuck doing another talk
on Wednesday about moving Java e to the
cloud I'm gonna be part of some Java EE
expert panel and to be some other panels
on the JC cool what's your Twitter
handle it's very simple it's my last
name first name and last name separated
by the underscore characters it's Reza
underscore Rahman that's okay perfect
thank you so hi I'm a bar or Ivor if
you're American I'm respected for
embassy together very Christian and come
forth from Germany so yeah I would just
expect Latour i implementing the embassy
we are definitely implementing what
we're doing the the spec the the
reference implementation which is called
all sort and also the tzk and everything
is open source it's on github it's
Apache 2 license and we will probably
follow Java EE the rest of the
implementations over to to eclipse so
well looking forward to being eclipsed
Ozark a cool and what are the killer
pictures of MVC and the killer features
of Embassy is actually that as a Java
developer if you know jax-rs the
Learning Path for embassy is very short
because we build on jax-rs and just to
leverage those features ok thank you
very much hi how are you hello my name
is Josie I live in
Paris where I work on July technologies
as both NASA's and professor the
University in Paris and as an
independent contractor trainig cetera
for various companies in the area and
you are doing some Java I am doing some
Java I am part of the expert group on
the CDI 2.0 specification and I'm quite
doing quite a lot of work on the Java
Sea streams API
collectors lambdas stuff like that ok
thank you thank you
hi David who are you and what they are
doing here hi I'm Anubha say I work at
Oracle I'm a software evangelist
focusing on the Java Enterprise Edition
edition so Java EE and obviously those
day I spend a lot of time on working on
with e4j ok what's
e4j that's a good question so e for j is
basically so we have recently announced
our intention to move the Java
development to an open source of a
foundation which happened to be the
Eclipse Foundation so e for J is just
the name of that project so basically
the next version of Java EE will be
developed in an open source way and
outside of Oracle within the destination
