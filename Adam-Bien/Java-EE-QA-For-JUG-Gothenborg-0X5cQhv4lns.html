to squid and recut for organizing this
and yeah I the idea is here that I will
answer your questions and it is always a
little bit dangerous to do something
interactive like this over the wire but
what happened is we already captured 10
questions before the show where chat so
we have enough stuff to to talk about
and if you still would like to ask
questions feel free to do the tutu's oh
so you just used the ustream chat or
Twitter with AD Adam beam or hashtag ax
so and then I will answer the questions
life okay the questions hope are not too
hard but usually I get lots of questions
java ee the recent times FX and a little
bit java SE and just introducing myself
I'm a Java developer working since 1995
and i really like java so this is the
interesting part of me so not only the
platform but also uh the programming
language and Java 8 is really nice and
some resources probably so I try to
write kind of notebook and this is my
block since several years already a view
y are a few few times a year I'm
organizing workshops at Munich Airport
and these are standard workshops and if
you if you like subscribe to a hex news
this is our newsletter where i announce
shows like this is like a not a
technology or technology news a letter
rather than a meet a letter like I know
what's going on in a in my world and
what's very new is effective Java EE
it's a online workshop and yeah it you
can it can rent it or download it and i
think is up for a half hour
with 42 episodes about various topics so
if you're interested go for this or come
to Munich yeah and this is the Java
forum and this is my last very last slot
so I will try to do it fast because I
think you're you are going to enjoy and
8 30 some some oil so I I think ill is
German oil but I think it can be only
beer because I don't think you are you
are very very happy about our oil on the
Java user group so and and what's
similar i'm using right now the ax TV
infrastructure so what I do I don't
answer questions via email anymore
because there are too many I try to
gather them at the github and answer
them once a month like this is less
interactive and but it I get so many
questions that I thought we can do it
once for java user group as well so and
if you like come to munich so we have
this time attendees from sweden of
course but Costa Rica USA and from all
over the world so Java is really popular
so this is the workshop my books and now
is your time questions so um how it
works I'm what's open is the chat so I
get lots of questions you see Frederick
ask the question if you don't like here
eii or see you can equally well use
Twitter and ask the questions just
mentioning me at Adam bean or use the
hashtag ax I could also know create an
hashtag at Jack's but I will lose some
some some space here so the first
question in the chat was securing rest
so I just captured the first questions I
don't even know who asked us properly
unknown someone who asked we start with
anonymous and it is a common question
and the answer is very fast is no
difference to servlet so um what you
have to understand the restful web
services are implemented as as a servlet
so you can use the standard Java EE
security to secure servlet rest and
sublet endpoints of course so um what
you can usually do you can say I don't
know sessions is the is the URI so in
the web.xml file you can say sessions
can be only accessed by guests using the
get method but the role admin the admin
has to authenticate and then you can use
posts so this is the very basic one what
I think what the what what's meant here
is not like securing the role based
securities or air be a season more like
API and what usually happens so you have
to just watch a node D or just watch
review commercial api's so what usually
you get is like a token which is sent
back and forth it has nothing to lose
Java you will have to do it by yourself
so we also implement in one a project so
that token was generated at the back end
it was passed back and forth and this
was the authentication so this is a very
common one it could be also a cookie but
token is also good enough or yeah this
is basically what what what you can do
and for instance it is also common to
use the basic authentication so you
would use with tools like curl you can I
think it's minus u is username and you
can pass username and password and why
you can use basic authentication but
because because restful services are
sublet so whatever works in servlets
would also work in jax-rs or rest
actually I think it was many jax-rs so
this is what's meant not rest doesn't
have to be restful is just the
technology I hope is answered so I would
go briefly to the chat so great x means
happy users and black text means someone
has a question or statement so okay
nothing happens in Twitter nothing
happens
in chat so the next one hour Killian and
Java and this was a thing mr. Odinga and
he said it is really painful to use our
Killian in java funny enough yesterday I
delivered a workshop in Rotterdam for a
CGI company so the name was CGI and they
they asked me now they were an attendee
wanted to use our Killian and for unit
testing and I was really curious why
because I mean there should be no need
to use to use our Killian for unit
testing and those longer discussion and
I implemented everything without our
Killian and just proposed archaean for
specific killer use cases because we
have only one hour what I would like to
do is to open our sample application I
created so you can also repeat it at
home so um no netbeans open what is a
pity so we will fix this in a second and
then I will try to code a simple or not
code to open a simple application and
the application or code if we open here
project from archetype so you can do it
from commanded as well as nothing to
lose netbeans and then search for call
me X you get the BC BCE archetype
boundary control entity and what it did
with the archetype I try to answer as
many questions as possible so and i will
call it aliens because arquillian so and
if you go here i will show you the set
up first so the setup is as probably
already outdated here we have 119 but
you have something like our Killian bomb
here which specifies all the
dependencies and then in this case I'm
using our Killian g-unit container the
world core and arquillian world II
embedded so so what wealth court me
means I own I don't use
the whitefly jboss or glass fish are
just using the dependency injection part
so what I forgot actually to mention is
to explain very briefly what our Killian
actually is and to explain you this this
is actually the code which works and as
you can see what our Killian is is that
a unit has run out so instead of using
the unit s runner you can use our
Killian and then our kid and is able to
inject stuff to your unit tests or do
some more magic like starting containers
that are already playing your app so and
what you see here is specific arquillian
annotation called deployment and what
you see here is what only arquillian can
do so um the problem is what I wanted to
test here is to what the log injection
works so and this is actually I try to
explain in this example the killer
killer use case of our car Killian and
if we go to the test class the disorder
would I attend attempt to test so we
have a logger exposure which exposes a
logger with the injection point and what
I'm what I'm asking here is were the
logger or where the log is going to be
injected so the injection points
represents the injection point so I'm
and I'm configured the logger and now
the question is how to test this I think
we was unit test there is no point on
doing this is unit test because because
then I would mock out this interface and
it will always work right so i will just
test my own mock so we need that kind of
infrastructure and what we at least need
is something where I can inject the
logger and test whether it is properly
configured so whether this actually is
working so how to do this so what I did
is I created a class but this class
resigns through sites in source tests
source test Java yes source test Java
exactly so on what it means this class
is never going be deployed in production
and now comes the killer feature from
achillion i can use or i can deploy a
class from source java so i don't need I
don't need mocks
in production and this is a big deal
otherwise I would have to probably
create a branch of this create mock
classes and use them you know to test
whether there are the logger actually is
properly configured or not this example
is of course trivial but it has to be
trivial because it demonstrates the
killer use case to reading or deploying
classes from source path maven source
path source java and yeah and the logger
injection support is going to be
injected here and then I asked the class
hey class give me please the injected
lager and it compared the logger name
with the class name and I know that
actually works so what it means I only
use our Killian for such cases and they
don't use are killing at all for
persistence test so for testing the
persistence what I use is exactly this
so I've right the two lino or recently
it was became boring so I implemented
one class library called rules this is
this one this is the rules and if you go
to a.m. you see here you have one liner
you can say entitymanager entitymanager
persistence unit and you have the entity
manager and you only need one dependency
yeah you can choose you know to use the
dependency or write the two lines one
dependency was one line of code or
without any dependency and two lines of
code but this is what I always do for
testing of the persistence and then what
I also have is the aliens st i have the
system tests which tests my application
from outside and i'm just using the
stock jax-rs 20 client so for such cases
I don't use our Killian at all so I have
very fast unit tests without any java
infrastructure just plain unit tests as
they are defined in Wikipedia and every
everywhere else then I have integration
tests like this an integration tests
could be or what usually is is like jpa
tests in rare cases i use our Killian
and our key what arquillian gives me is
the ability to use to load mocks from
source de chava so on Moxon source main
Java absolutely prohibited in in in in
production in my project and the other
question I got is to everyone so I think
Joseph is somehow somehow happy with the
answer and I need the drawing app is
here and the next question is similar
how to test Jason endpoints without back
end and I had similar requirement in my
projects not similar requirements I
wanted to do so because at the beginning
what I would like to do is to create a
nice rest api and the business logic
actually does not matter so i would like
to play with the API as soon as possible
and what i usually do i create a jax-rs
endpoint without any back-end and just
return mock data but what could work but
what could work is is the following you
can use our Kilian and deploy for
instance this jax-rs resource and with
the mocked back end so you could start
embedded container deploy your rest
resource and override the ddd back end
so how to override a class in Java EE
what you always can do let's say I would
like let's find something here here this
is an ejb oh this is a POJO fat
calculator and i would like to do to
create an enterprise fat calculator
enterprise value v80 calc
and it can extend this fat calculator
and if I say he has specializes then it
will override at runtime this so this
class is going to replace this class at
runtime and what you can do you could
put this back end to a source java use
and user killian to deploy it and then
you would you will have something like
knocked out backend for restful tests
having that said I was shortly before of
doing this but i but but I didn't and D
and why what I did instead is I created
jacks or as resources first designed
them until I was happy I'll return
something you know thank fake JSONP
objects and then I just injected the
back end so but there's actually a very
very very good question so I will go
back to the chat
canada when you have big application
anonymous says arquillian is is very
slow when you have big application what
I think what they are doing you are
using I think it's called resolvers to
deploy everything this is what what I
never do so what i use arquillian for is
to deploy deploy parts of the
application and if you would like to
deploy everything what I would I what I
do then I use system test instead so I
create a nice one script or be prior to
last one were just they were just shell
scripts x-ray is one of my open source
project so I actually can show you this
but with this the application server is
set up this is glass fish or pyara and
this is what have has to happen and it
was the next line of code is deploy you
would deploy applications and run your
system tests so I would always prefer
system test over embedded container
tests why you know the class holders
clean the application server is as it is
downloaded from from from the internet
and what we also do in my current
project use docker so we create the
within the docker their applications of
a start so we do not rely on a bedded
container for testing because embedded
container if you would test everything
in embedded mode you will still have to
retest in the real mode and this is too
much testing for my taste ok Alien see
Khoda is happy which is nice anonymous
says arquillian is very slow there we
covered this because you are probably
deploying too much and Joseph says it
should be as fast as the java ee content
itself I don't think so if you think
about this what are key and has to do is
either it uses just it just puts the
containers right away so it will always
a little bit slower because the unit S
has to be started and the application
has to be deployed on each on every test
so this it will
I think properly installed container
could be even faster also if you think
about this you we have the maven JVM and
within the maven JVM we got the
application server JVM so this all
depends on how its implemented if this
embedded container so you're running in
one JVM everything in my case with
system tests I run in one JVM two
processes and because we have multiple
cores it properly even would work back
it better and you can assign more more
heap so um yeah joseph is very very
right not for unit testing so resolution
can be highest as Joseph Oettinger it is
already HD so I think Joseph the problem
is your connection so you are not it
should be HD so it is as high as can
only be perfect I think Joseph Joseph is
happy so this is what I can tell you
with with our killing and testing let's
see so
so I'm wicked ask me Adam what is your
take on oracle move to fire several java
evangelist recently so um of course is
it set so I mean I know the people and
and they are they were I mean all java
people are or there were some of them
were even even prior son son evangelist
they were extremely motivated i really
enjoyed to to watch sessions from then
and it was really happy to talk with
with them it java user groups and and
why oracle is doing this who knows and
usually no one knows right there would
probably one manager oracle who decided
to save some money in short time and
then say okay we fire them we can
probably earn more money in the next
view month and what happens then no one
cares because because this how
management is rewarded trike is not a
short term but i don't know is not long
term rather than short-term so my take
is a pity so the question is would java
suffer from this I don't think so if you
look at this rica tune in for instance
this is who asked the question organized
organized the show and this is nothing
else than evangelism right so for for
unknown reasons java is extremely
vibrant so we have lots of java user
groups we have conferences it's crazy i
could just travel all around the world
never work just be on vacations and
token conferences about you know
psychedelic topics so i think we are in
the unique in the unique world how
vibrant it is and yeah so my take is
it's a pity why it happened no idea i'm
no idea i'm pretty sure is manager
decided to do to do such a thing is even
stranger this what oracle did with
glassfish right it's okay where there is
no more commercial support and all my
clients either moved to white fly or to
pyara this is this was also from
business perspective and i also don't
understand this but this is a huge
company so you probably want on won't
find direct answers or statements
because it's not like no all people at
oracle decided this is probably i would
guess one manager who wanted to save
money
um now very good so we have perfectly so
I hope Rick artists happy with my answer
some answers there is no evil Oracle I
think it never was is Oracle is a huge
company and and and sometimes there are
also people who know who don't even
properly know what Java is and if they
have made the decision oh I don't don't
know the people and then I just fire
them and save money this could be also a
case and also this is how it is it is it
set anyway so stop with this topic what
do you think about MVC 10 or it can ask
me this I think it's good stuff because
if you MVC what does MVC model view
controller i think what wicked means is
multi controller framework for java 8
it's like a very thin specification
think 20 pages and what it basically
standardizes is something like struts
and i got lots of question whether why
there is no action based framework in
java actually the last question was
yesterday and and i think is the right
thing to do and I interviewed a start-up
and well a single was tilite and and
they use Java EE and what struck me they
don't use any JavaScript on the client
and I asked them why not and they said
because of SEO soda render everything on
the server side using strategy was trust
a thing back then and what what
interesting there is a need to use
server side rendering solutions to be
better ranked at Google so I think I
think mbc is great alike MVC so far so I
use it in production is too early
because it just reference implementation
but if you would like to use something
in production there is a thing called v
raptor and i think it will even
implement MVC 10 but is very similar to
this so look at this i think it is a
really nice as it comes from brazil so
it has to be nice right so
hola says have you jumped along the
docker hype train in your Java
development environment and if so how so
this is questions alike you know so half
half heretical half offensive but this
is how no enforces the discussion funny
enough I am thought my story to dhaka
right so this is what you want to hear
so what I did before dhaka so before
dhaka i used i wanted to use opensolaris
zones that the problem with oracle
bought son and I think opensolaris was
on hold so I waited for the last release
I actually set up everything and I
waited until his release I would never
release so there was a DD release
appeared on the under page and it
disappeared so then I tried to
investigate it and I wanted to use kvm
so from redhead so everything was set up
and then I bumped into dock and into
Dhaka not core OS squirrels relate to
Dhaka and I thought okay this docker is
very like solari zones and I look at
this and I think I installed on my
server just for testing was diversions 0
for no one cared about docker back then
and then i'm using docker since i think
two years in production on my block
right and now it is a hype and everyone
asked me about dhaka and i just show
what i do is dhaka so I was in the lucky
situation using docker before it was
really popular back then the one kid
about docker is the hype justified I
think so but I think Dhaka is very easy
to use and very convenient to install so
it's really hard to talk about docker
for too long because you know he's like
talking about I don't know top command
for for for one hour so I'm but it I
think dhaka will really save money in
production development and integration
and yeah but it's completely different
topic so what happens here Joseph you
don't have to back up so if you have
questions ask for dr. is always a clean
cube sure mmm yes arquillian cube or
what I do in Dhaka
is the following dog status exactly
which to occur status so and for
instance where was it so this is my
script to list all my docket containers
is very simple and I have similar script
to lunch you know install build docker
containers and this is nuts on the Java
8 so the funny thing was dr. is is very
easy to orchestrate or orchestrate you
know how to manage or chris is a funny
word is to just use the admin API
because all the documents are our rest
or docket combines of wrapper around
rest clients or yeah HTTP client ok so i
like dhaka this december so what's
happens here perfect dream real is
fascinated hope not about archaean but
he's on my side which is very good and
so no question so far what happens here
ok so now I answer the questions the
metered ok question next one I got a
question yesterday and this interesting
one so and the question is were to not
not yesterday it was a comment on on the
online course effective Java and forgot
to mention this so what schedule is this
an it's an e gb which which can be
configured to to run krone schedules and
the question is should i put it to
boundary control an entity so this is
like the the separation and I get lots
of questions know where to put a ton o
laga aur hmx signing this was also the
next one where to put this and what I
consider this scheduling is like an
aspect so what usually should
happen we have our job controller or
whatever but what the job controller
does it basically invokes method of a
facet so it can be considered as a as a
cross-cutting concert of the FSA trial
and if it is cross-cutting for a concern
of this for said i will put in the same
package as deficit so the answer is in
the boundary or the same package were
the classes which is going to be wrapped
with this what also means is a really
bad idea to code everything in a
scheduler because then the schedule is
responsible for scheduling and business
logic implementation and then it could
be harder to test okay so we have this
perfect so anonymous 5139 ask can i
still use soap for production
implementation of a web server web
service the answer is yes if you don't
like your clients just propose posts but
what I get the question question
regarding soap a lot and what I did I
did some research because I know I
cannot just say to clients soap is that
so you have to you know to explain it
somehow and I think what a second i hope
i will find this yeah perfect Oh even to
year two years ago so um so what I found
out is there is soap was no more updated
so if you go to the last update was 2011
then 2006 so at javaone 2013 there were
just two sessions about soap and if I
found something so priorities or in
pawleys is like no portal tomb to lots
of conferences all these sessions just
proposed you know how to walk away from
soap and yeah if you go to Google Trends
so I'm most interesting to look at this
right now what happened about two years
so it didn't recover torso there was a
spike in march 2015 interestingly
because of microservices probably and
then yeah it is even worse than it was
so this is the the interest over time in
soap so on the answer is you can still
using soap in production because the it
works so it will still work the problem
is you will find less and less someone
who is willing to you to use the
technology or client to consume the
technology and you know ask iOS Android
or Apple watch developers to consume a
soap service you know the soap is like
usually can be only consumed by the net
or Java and all other technologies try
to avoid soap this is my personal
opinion about soap probably oftenly
hopefully his German hopefully not too
offensive so perfect so we have okay
perfect so um no questions very good
next one where's my so Java code
organization and I think this was just
an overview because I could got already
a good question before so just look at
this and here also let's roses with busy
for a rest app with Jess f Easter a
separate boundary for the GSF course
which is also used by rest component
very good question because I can quickly
answer this in my coat so if you go to
the sample application the registrations
is a facet or boundary this resource
gets injected the registrations and oh I
don't have GSF here but in a jsf case i
would have a model class or named
request scoped class and this named
request scoped class would be used by
jsf and i would inject the registration
registrations to the index to the index
class as well if i had solved service so
something which is annotated with ed
service this I would inject
registrations as well so I hope is clear
if not please Ria's the question or just
right again and I will repeat this I got
a question frequently so I would like
just to answer the question properly so
um I hope Marcos s is happy and we have
one question with code organization it
was it was this one another question so
there's a core layer and customization
layer what I understood okay is it
possible and the answer it is very very
possible one answer you saw already is
what is with extension zone extending
and specializing so you can replace
classes the other part is that there are
multiple options and actually describe
them very well or hopefully very well so
I actually forgot what I would have
wrote but and in the green book there as
in the plug-in pattern a pattern yeah
plugin approach and the next one is what
you can do you can use let's say whether
actually implemented this here in my
alien no but instead of doing this I
could say ed inject instance of fat
calculator pricing so and if this were
an interface it this injection would
always work or so there are no
implementations so and then I could say
for pricing and now all calculators are
listed so what it is actually with this
I implemented a plug-in so this is a
Java plug-in system so if there is if
there is no implementations in a jar
this would be empty empty set so this
follow-up won't be executed if we get an
implementation
so we have our plugin and even better
what it could also do you could mark the
implementation as alternative and use
here a little bit of XML but is not bad
and then with a stereotype you could
activate all implementations at the ones
which implement a given stereotype so
arm and this is like you know a product
line engineering so we can do we can put
in a war everything you have and on the
client side aside you know which which
implementations to choose I hope it was
your question this was about about this
and yet the SPI would be DD interface
and if you go again to ken i.com you
will find a free example from a book and
java e patterns and best practices
source code and then search for plugin
and there should be a maven project
which does exactly this it should i hope
plugin perfect for we just paste it to
the chat so and now you have an
executable answer 4444 your question
rickard ask me do you think that java
you will go the same way with fetch our
spring boot in other words continent
code in the same jar we are already
there white fur is capable of do this if
you go to paigham pyara micro is also
capable of do this and I will just
curious and I running a photon operating
system which is the stripped-down linux
and what you see here this is PI arum
micro so
hmm I'm in the docker container right
now and this is oh you see pyara micro
41 and this is the case this is a
showcase from from dipiero guys so I'm
running in a docker container and this
pyara micro is the Fed jar is it a good
idea with Daka not at all so a docker
i'm using pyara straight and so what I'm
doing in Dhaka case is the following so
um wait a second in Dhaka case this is
actually my personal servers I can show
you this so i have a java image which
comes yeah exactly so I could get
yesterday's similar question so it just
masks out the password so it just
contains the operating system in jdk
then i get a payara image or glass
Fisher or what have you or white fly and
this contains the whole pyara pyara set
up this a little bit more complicated
whitefly is simpler but regardless what
you are doing is you do it once and then
my actual application so like for
instance the white wine it just inherits
from the white lie what i forgot to say
is that the whitefly image also extends
from this base java server and the
payara image extends from pyara so what
is the outcome the outcome is the
smaller the war the faster deployment
and build and this makes a huge
difference so what I did actually if you
go to the YouTube channel and search for
where is it thin Wars Java is seven and
productivity so i actually created a
screencast which demonstrates exactly
this so it created us small war and
deployed to to doctor and a large war
and what is the performance difference
and build and deployment difference is
very important my projects because this
is the productivity so the less I have
to wait the API am i okay so I put it a
chat if you like watch this is like I
think about five minutes recut I hope
you are happy so and recant its own beer
or is it oil so this is a question to
you so um this is very good one then
harder to to to answer because it
actually has nothing to do is technology
what do you think is the right way to
version rest services URL except HTTP
header and this actually is the question
has nothing to do with services rest or
soap and what I what what I would ask
you then is the following do we have
control over clients if we can control
the clients so what we can do in one of
my current projects we actually can
control the clients so what it means we
are releasing the server and the clients
at synchronously so simultaneously so
there is no we can rely on the
versioning then it's a good idea to put
the version in the early because the
client has to be refactored anyway or
rewritten anyway and retested together
with the back end so it's a very good
idea to have the version in the in the
Orient it could be also a good idea to
use typesafe API because if the client
does not compile something went terribly
wrong if you cannot control the clients
you cannot put the version to the early
unless you are as mighty as YouTube or I
don't know instagram or something like
this because you cannot just you know
not to notify all your clients and or
your users in the enterprise try to find
using the enterprise say please you know
use the new version and forgot the old
ones or with versioning in the URI you
will you
we'll have to have to have a really
stable and robust versioning and on the
house governance right so it's all good
governance system and I think the only
way to go is if you cannot control the
clients is to be backward compatible so
there is no versioning and all and you
are testing all known versions against
the newest release so I think and and
also if you don't know the clients it is
easier to be not typesafe so what it
means you can add more features more
attributes over time without breaking
the clients okay questions questions no
question young okay Peter your hands and
ask me about fetch our with container
what do you think about that spring is
hiding the container well I mean this is
sometimes I get questions about spring
you know what is my opinion about spring
and I'm actually rather neutral i would
say i don't use spring in my projects
because mostly i'm asked about java so
no one asked me not to help them with
spring which is natural i guess so i'm
even don't see a spring a lot in my
projects which is also interesting
because someday okay everywhere springs
okay not in my world so on but we had a
nice conversations with you can holler
from spring and they are java ee and
spring are absolute opposite
philosophies so um why i like java is
because actually convention over
configuration and out of the box you
know feeling so i can download Wi-Fi or
pyara or webster liberty profile or
tommy and rely on java 7 and i know it
will work and done i forgot all the
frameworks in all versions and just
focus on business logic it seems like
the spring people prefer the best of
breed methods when they say before I
start I would like to evaluate the
technology and take the best and this is
actually not required in my enterprise
project so it doesn't matter whether
my library is known as the absolute best
or not and if we find a back the
solution would be to open an issue and
or try to fix the back with service like
pyara Tommy or white fly this just
possible so it's not like it is no and
mission impossible to fix our backs an
application server so on either pay for
it or just fix it so this would be the
approached and whether spring is hiding
the container in Java II there is a as
very strict separation between at least
my projects between the application
server and the application so you only
will have a single dependency like
hopefully in this sample code as well so
every the only dependencies are tests
and there is no run time dependency and
I think the what we also have is Java 7
which is provided so this war does not
have any dependencies at all so if we
build this it should be tiny so if we
look at the target and I will just open
in terminal so is 13 k 13 kilobyte
divert shops so if we have this this
will deploy very fast but if the war
becomes larger and larger my daughter
image becomes larger larger and diploma
will be slow and I need more hard as
good I mean 30k doesn't matter but if
this were a 100 makeup makes this will
make difference so and if you use docker
it does not matter at all because in
docket case or meta in the other case I
think whatever changes should be small
this is a docker best practice and come
last at the image build and and in in
Java EE case it is absolutely small so
all my wars in recent years were tiny
and and and effect jars as the name
implies cannot be thani another
conversation that was spring but with
another provider and they say yeah but
we created this before docker and right
now doc has solves the problem so yeah I
mean okay don't know you know discussion
is over so then we don't need four jars
in a docker case okay hopefully so let's
see what happened here no question PTF
ask me don't you have to recompile
change container not at all absolutely
not so if your container support java 7
you don't have to recompile anything and
it works out of the box you don't even
have to change anything line of XML so
it just works ah ok ricard reveal so
what you will get after the show you
will get in gothenburg dear not oil so
don't ask too many questions otherwise
the beer will disappear so nice okay i
hope we cover the question with where is
my notebook was versioning and there's
also good one is there a way to
intercept a rest call and protest h mike
signing absolute leaders and even
described in an article jax-rs to all
Adam bin what I find out or bean is also
nice is be in English here and this is
called request interceptor I think but I
wrote the article so early that parts of
had to be a little bit change because
staff change there but it should be in
saboteur there is a read interceptor
and as you can see what I even did in
the example I implemented a payload
verifier is like a signer so it is a
pool one but this is exactly what you're
asking for so it is absolutely possible
and you need to read the intercept one
to do to implement this okay you have to
ask questions other one otherwise
everything is answered I hope all your
questions I hope I didn't forget
something no okay then i would say it
looks like all questions are answered
and then the last quote organization
question I get a lot so i will just
proactively try to show you what i mean
by the code organization is the
following so um all my projects looks
exactly the same and for years I was not
sure whether this good idea but now I
know because I've worked closely with
developers and they seem also to like it
and the basic ideas this call me a hex
doesn't matter is like company name then
comes the project or product name and
then I get two layers business is for
the pure business logic without any
reference to user interface UI and then
dot presentation then I will where I
would put MVC or GSF for stuff like this
and then for each concept which I try to
find a good functional name so we spend
a lot of time about thinking about names
so registrations so obviously this
application has something to do with
virtue ops registrations and then it's
always the same the same sequence of
packages this the boundary which is the
API to the outside world control which
is optional and just just reusable
classes and parts of logic and how this
evolves is the following if the boundary
becomes too fat we introducing the
controls and entity our domain objects
then can be
but they don't have to and controls are
pojos like this and boundaries in all my
java is seven and six project usually
have two parts one part is just a plain
ejb which tests transactions case about
monitoring pooling and stuff like this
and the other part is the exposure to
rest of the rest so this part should not
contain any business logic and this part
should not know that we are using jax-rs
and rest so and for each high level
concept I've one package here and
interfaces are not allowed you are only
allowed to use interfaces in my project
if you get two implementations or you or
you have to implement plugins but here
and you just creating you know pojos
which with business logic and there's
and also need a handful of java
annotations so this is how my java
projects look like and if you like do it
at home so again you need to search for
call me a hex in shrunk in the archetype
in maven archetype it is it is in this
sauna type so if you search for a what's
wrong maven so yeah calm ax and this is
called Java boundary control entity
archetype and what archetype means is a
wizard these are like maven wizard okay
so let's see whether we have questions
no I suppose now I revealed that all is
Pierre now you are waiting for the beer
so no questions are coming which is
understandable also no questions in chat
so i would say thank you for watching if
you have questions go to EXT visa i
think is the first monday of the month
at 6pm it's a show very similar to this
but i don't expect any interactive
questions we can participate in the same
way what I usually do I gather the
question the whole month and answer them
at once
this was more inductive without any
preparation I hope it was variable to
you this was the first time I try
something like this for a Java user
group and yeah what struck me there's a
lot a lot of participants in the chat
and I hope you are enjoying this in
Gothenburg as well so enjoy the beer
thank you and see you at Munich Airport
a hex or the online course ok thank you
