so it's not 42nd so not all questions
are going to be answered but just some
and start with the whatever free show so
there will be no whatever today again
and good news first and why good news
there will be all the workshops there
are already sufficient attendees for all
these Lots so everything will take place
and actually we are trying to upgrade
the rooms because they are already too
small so I'm if you like attend in
Munich and of course the web standard is
getting to be more and more interesting
I'm constantly reworking the agenda okay
now the very first question though this
is the agenda for today the very first
question so going to come back to these
two the gist and this is from Monsieur
in kovitch and I will just keep that and
open this oh what's wrong with that
github gist so I lost my questions and I
would like to have detailed questions
okay
Monsieur ring kovitch asked me whether I
prefer react over angular and this is
correct because angular is a great
framework but it solves a lot of
problems which I don't have
for instance dependency injection is
nice to have in the in the UI but what
you have to do with angular you have to
declare it a lot so it is actually it
even requires a command-line interface
to be somehow productive and react is a
minimalistic framework I would say so
there is no dependency injection is just
a beaut
and right now I supporting some startups
and they really like the decision of
using react so in one startup by using 4
we using react for 2 years and they are
coming back and saying thank you for the
decision and actually they started some
project with angular and they moved
everything to react over and they are
really happy and so but the reasoning is
not right I don't like react because it
supports more standards than angular I
like react more because there is no
dependency injection no modulus is just
jazz UI so having the tent in I
completed some html5 projects and what I
did in the project I just used vanilla
JavaScript CSS and html5 and looks
surprisingly well it works surprisingly
well and it looked almost like react so
I'm in upcoming projects I'm using more
and more web standard so why I'm about
the web standards actually the same
reason why I'm using Java EE Java EE is
compatible forever so there were no
breaking changes so far for I don't know
20 years 20 not 17 years and the same is
going to be true for web standards so
instead of you know chasing the
framework you can focus on standards so
there's actually the exactly the same
motivation why I like and you really use
like like to use Java
okay thank you but I delivered a talk in
devoxx Poland and I actually forgot what
I really mentioned there but but and so
this is the talk if you would like to to
see what happened at the talk I think it
was built to last on the minute 30
so I mentioned both framework and there
is a UGS there are several frameworks
which are very similar to to react so
Mike Pringle asked me ok I'm one of the
of the members of J's are 375 years one
of the latest member of 375 so I was
active or one year ago and now really no
time which I really regret so if you
have any any mean to stretch time we're
really interested is a framework which
is stretching time this would be this
would be great and and he asked me does
this API help protecting the rest
endpoint of Java applications absolutely
because the rest endpoints are security
of respite rest endpoints is related to
servlets and servlet are related to GSR
375 so it absolutely also helps to to
secure the rest endpoints or it makes it
more flexible so next one let's see what
happens in chat so nothing new here you
see a parallel title is tuned and some
people complaining about Flash I
actually don't have flash and it works
probably there is some fault again html5
swimming so I don't think flesh is
really required to watch a hex TV and if
it really is I upload it afterwards to
YouTube and there should be no flesh
required ok cool
reactive programming so there are lots
of frameworks or Mamet dem SOI says the
following
there are many frameworks like completed
by future eric java reactive streams
archive vertex react yes
and he's confused as everyone else of
course because reactive programming
isn't all over the place and little
conferences everyone is excited about
and of course and brings some are
benefits but if you don't have the
problem you know
don't use it so and the next question is
what what's the problem what is it
exactly and he comes a little bit closer
and says ok Eric Java against computable
future and and they are pretty close so
how to explain how to explain you know
in the shortest possible way reactive
programming I think what is really meant
in Eric's Java and Eric chase and all
different boxes you have observable
which listens to something and
continuously gives you data back and
actually and we had something like this
in Java and this was called things text
parser so there was a at the beginning
let's see where the way this is dogs
from Oracle so we have Dom parser which
you know in XML loaded everything to to
to Adam and there was a sex parser which
read everything and send events and
which was very efficient but really hard
to code and Aztecs is like is not as
fast as X and but but but it's more
efficient than Dom and this is really
easy to use and what it does let's see
whether we'll find an example Oh example
it was you could just iterate over yeah
and give me just a very example come to
hear so streamreader and adjust you had
the streamreader
and you iterate it over the reader did
something with it and reactive
programming would be a little bit more
so there will be no while it you could
just subscribe you could filter and do
something with it without iterating but
this is very close to this and and we
have something similar in Java also
called future
the only problem if you get the future
back you have to resub scribe again and
the observable in eric's Java and the
others you don't you can reuse it over
and over again without resub scribing
what we also get in java 9 Java 9 flow
happy API we get the flow interface in
JDK 1 9 and this flow interface is
absolutely compatible with reactive
extensions or reactive programming so
all you get in Java 9 we get actually
reactive programming built-in so you can
use the other frameworks but you don't
have to so if you can use standard use
the standards so um so you could for
instance I'm using completable future
it's not you know entire reactive
programming but it's but it's good
enough in my projects and I never missed
a feature of reactive observable feature
in reactive programming so why I would
use when I would miss the features just
imagine you had event source like you
know robots emitting data or a drone
emitting data or stock market stock
market emitting data and you would be
interested just in specific cases
so then with reactive programming you
can just subscribe to the socket or or
something else and
and we mentioned didn't use divert
whatever so on something and then you
could you can use filters or or what you
get from the compare from Java it
streams and react to it so this is the
main difference so we have this and what
I did four years ago I recorded a small
reactive programming with Java X session
it is a fairly short you can just watch
it and I use Java fix to John effects to
to explain reactive programming and I
use data binding for this so I think I
subscribe to two fields and if something
changes in the fields a button gets
enabled or disabled so you could use for
instance reactive programming for input
validation so if you like watch that
reactive program with Java fix a short
video on old one and I also implemented
the library Java 8 data transformer and
what it does it reads the data from JDBC
Jason or any any source you like and
transforms the data to two to another
representation so I could also use here
reactive programming and just for fun I
will probably reimplemented in Java 9
why not Java 9 with the flow API ok so
we have that and there is Eric's Java
this is the reactive ex Eric Java on a
library and you can look actually what
they are doing this shrink observable
and at the very end just really the
source code you will find here what they
are doing they are they are reading
using just byte buffer and if they find
something so at the end they will they
forward the data on next and this on
next is the is the official interface I
think from subscription this is the name
of the thing from subscription and we
get in Java 9 the official API so Eric
Java could be another implementation of
the interfaces I think we cover now
fairly
clearly deep reactive extensions Eric
Java but briefly what it means we have
observer we can subscribe for events and
react to the data with modern means like
lambdas expressions then we are reactive
you are reacting to the stream of data
and we don't have to resub scribe again
so this is reactive programming so is it
no revolutionary in my projects probably
not as still still deleting or fighting
with GTOs dowas and and and and
superfluous factories in and superfluous
impulse so if I will delete this crud so
it means this bloat then probably we
could use something like this but I'm
waiting for this for years already so
any traitor mentioned I think we covered
us now Monsieur de Ratman says he's
using startup singleton and this in the
long-running process from startup
singleton and he invokes asynchronous
Egbe and he asked me what what went
wrong so what could happen so I'm not
sure off to the first the first startup
signaled means it is invoked first even
before all other beans are available so
what could happen the startup singleton
starts and the asynchronous gtp is not
available
so it will wait until it's available and
this was the first suspicions suspicions
the next one could be you are for any
reason not using the injected instance
you are just using this method and even
if this method is annotated with at
asynchronous not it's still synchronous
call so to really use at asynchronous
features you will have to use the
injected instance and by the way if you
would like to have more control just use
the managed executive service ok
as a brief oh now I have fun for negara
Jack what is jsf future mmm this is a
good question so I think I would say the
future is bright from the technical
perspective the problem is the
perception is somehow JSF is bloated
complicated and therefore it could die
also it is a good framework this is like
I think Betamax died and what is it
standard VHS won also Betamax was better
so this is how it works if you know what
happens behind the scenes
I think JSF is great and actually very
very productive so on the majority of
the startups I work with they're using
primefaces for back office admin
interfaces because it's crazy fast and
if they need something more evolved
complicated pixel-perfect they switch to
html5 react or flame or frame looks like
that ok so I think the future is
actually bright the problem is no what
is the marketing story behind pee behind
JSF so if you would know every one of
you will write a post how great JSF is
and it will take a moment would we just
know gain some momentum it will survive
if everyone's bitching JSF probably the
developers behind JSF will know lose
they interest ok cool
is it possible to use persistence
context in an interceptor absolutely so
the persistence content as if you have
an interceptor and you are intercepting
as stateless a GB then the Interceptor
becomes the eg Pisa can do never use on
purpose whatever you are you're doing in
a stateless you can also do in
interceptor and I don't think Paris
seems to have a problem with that
because what
I don't think so because I did it
already and anti-d manager is a little
bit strange because the entity manager I
mean what I would do is let's say a
boundary is intercepted and you would
like to lock something to a database for
instance instead of injecting the entity
manager to an interceptor I would rather
use a control which for instance uses
the entity manager so you can
encapsulate all the behavior in an
irregular pojo and not implementing this
in the Interceptor okay so therefore I
don't think I actually did implemented
something with entity managers in
interceptors but it has to work actually
what I did a lot I fired
events in interceptors I injected staff
check security and this works very well
what I have experienced with mqp AMQP is
a standard protocol currently in the
version 1 0 and this RabbitMQ is using 0
9 1 I think is the current supported
protocol for transferring data
asynchronously yes it works well and it
is useful for sending missiles of
datasets between magazines kept in the
reliable way of course as any other
messaging service not like you know mqp
is great and GMS would work so i'm GMS
is also great for that
but in micro services in scalable and
reliable well if I think of micro
service that the first thing which comes
to mind is why not WebSockets for
instance so and WebSocket is not really
a reliable of course it is reliable but
it's not transactional so the question
is do you need persistent queues or
durable subscribers and then it is SS
that then WebSockets are not suitable
for that but if you just know streaming
data on web server just perfect and my
second choice would be if you really
need a little bit transactions or more
reliable behavior something like
infinite span or hazel caste is already
so hazel house comes with payara
infinite span with white fly
and the Apache one I actually forgot
this although something similar in
Apache grid cache caching Cranbrook and
and what it could do or what you can do
is for instance hazel cast and infinite
spend don't not only have like a hash
map you can also send events and and
they can be transactional and in hazel
cars even with two-phase commit and this
is what what would be interesting
interesting to do is like I know you
could use write to one node and it is
going to be replicate it to all other
micro services and you could even
subscribe as a listener so this will be
the communication protocol and AMQP for
instance there's implementation for
along and other languages so it would be
more alert Royce if you will have to
write from Java in communicated with
along but you could do the same with
WebSockets so first I will stay away
from any third-party libraries as always
use use the platform whatever is there
but I wouldn't use JMS in in micro
service environment with with Java EE
and the reason for that is because you
also will have to set up the GMs server
which can be painful in cluster but if
the GMs server is already there like MQ
serious and is already maintained by
another Department just go for it okay
so there's a tweet so I just copy the
tweet and this is actually interesting
somehow interesting article to frame
broken auto framework and via what it
basically says start with nothing and if
you if you you can learn a lot and it
explains a little bit you know libraries
versus frameworks and it says ok if you
if you're building if you using
frameworks you have to understand them
or depending on that I think if
something like Java is a little bit
different because if you if you look at
the business logic you don't see the
framework so you are not really
depending on the framework you are
depending on the framework features
and the question is is it worth to
implement the features this is what I'm
is it worth to implement your own
dependency injection actually it's
fairly easy this is actually there is
even a thing and I'm being the
dependency injection there's even a
video which I implemented even four
years ago so it is in ten minutes i
implemented dependency injection with or
8-minute was reflection so should i do
it for fun i mean why you can do that
you know to show how it works and then
just rely on the framework the next
story is what I can also do very simply
with Java you can use dynamic proxy to
implement my own AOP framework so this
would be the second thing actually we do
is in the bootstrap course on Munich's
just to explain what the serve actually
does and it is fun to do it once but
never again I would never implement
dynamic proxy to have fun with proxies
if I know that if I just put a stateless
on my poggio the stateless would start
transactions for me and check the
security and and and threats so I'm
implementing the low-level technical
stuff I find a little bit boring so did
that's all so we could do it of course
and and there is also a little bit
different story so if I implementing
something for myself like for instance
here the statistics or on my server I
actually do a lot from scratch just for
fun but if I do something for clients I
will never do this because then I will
have to document all my thoughts and and
and there's actually no way that our
view years later someone will get why I
implement my own dependency injection
framework so this is this is the
thinking behind and it also relies to
JPA whether JP is worth and this is
actually the same so if you if you are
with JP a you are incredible fast at the
beginning but the more complex thicker
it gets the more you have to understand
in one point of time you can say okay
now I cannot use JP a anymore for this
particular cases I will implement it
from scratch but it doesn't mean you
have to
ditch JPA all together you can use for
the other know 10% JDBC or any other
low-level technology and and I'm not JP
a so you're not forced to use JP for
everything what I think what is a good
idea first to understand your platform
and you can implement in your leisure
stuff and then if you if you get how it
works then just ditch your stuff and and
and then focus on business logic in and
use the framework and here he had also
some good points
he said somewhere we wrote somewhere
that he saw that developer say are you
had to use a framework and they
implemented their own stuff on top of it
this is actually what they also see in
Java EE projects Enterprise projects
because there is nothing else to do so
you can just fully focus on business
logic you don't have to implement
anything it's boring so and what the
developers will do they will invent some
stuff it's all the dependency injection
from applications of is not fast enough
therefore I will implement my own or
logging framework is not flexible enough
so therefore I will have to do something
about this or I know produces that work
properly I will have to implement their
own factory using reflection and of
course because I already have the
factory it will be nice to have a small
configuration framework so I can
implement this and this configuration
has framework has to has no several
levels to the first level reach from
reach from properties and they can
override this with database stuff and it
should be also for stage stage
environment and know and then the whole
life develop a life is more exciting but
this is not what the clients are paying
us for so imagine now in real world not
not in software world but in real world
people like know companies carpenters
bar charts or woodworkers would you know
behave like we so it's like all in order
to really they will come to you to fix
your home and say you know I cannot use
my electro drill because I not don't
don't know what's going on inside this
is the framework is way too complicated
I will build my tool first come back you
will pay me for that
and
there was my own drill and then I
already understand what's going on and
this is not how they work the world
works it's like I don't know why we
thought the whole software development
world is so crazy and and and and
outside the world everyone seems to
behave a little bit more seriously I
would say okay let's see what happens
just a future done Twitter is quiet
which is good and that because we have
lots of stuff to cover and the next one
because is it possible to unit
primefaces so there was some discussion
like yeah this was actually forgot to 20
days ago was like oh good it is possible
to develop an independent primefaces
based project and use back in Java later
I don't know yes it is absolutely
possible you can use the Java EE
projects with boundaries and use
primefaces later and then you can inject
the primary's boundaries and primary's
boundaries to primefaces prime phase
views so it works absolutely
is it possible to unit test primefaces
it is even possible to system test
primefaces i use it in in the testing
chorus speak once the attendees want to
see it so I use the graphene framework
to unit tests or system tests primefaces
and unit tests primefaces I guess the
whole favor of this unit tested
primefaces I know the developers they're
pretty reasonable so everything is unit
tested so system integration test and
unit tests I mean prime faces they come
with JavaScript components so you can of
course unit testing JavaScript
components but the this should be a
little bit causal so the MDD all the JSF
frameworks like primefaces
the F components usually written in
JavaScript and they can even separated
from the Java part and and the
JavaScript part can be absolutely unit
tested and the D back-end stuff it just
emits the JavaScript stuff this could be
also unit tested but is less important
for
world projects and what is actually
important is how you if you combine the
built-in primefaces components to an app
so what is interesting is not the unit
test the application this is what what's
interesting and I don't call it system
test because you are remote controlling
the browser and this is a really
interesting use case for frameworks like
graphene are Kilian so this is the
graphene framework okay I hope covered
covered covered you can close the n
hydrator back so I'm interesting
question so if if if one purchase
purchase if one is purchasing the
on-demand javasan Berkshires from AXA Oh
gets all workshops listed on the website
or only one clicked so this is what I
don't fully understand the question so
there's a xio there are four workshops
so if you buy if you click here and oh
stop it
if you click somewhere here and you
purchase this direction here so what you
actually purchased is just this workshop
Java 7 bootstrap so if you would like to
have everything you will spend I think
there are about 40 euros or $40 $160 for
everything or you can rent everything
for $40 but if you buy one you don't get
the others
it's like books ok
I hope it's absolutely clear cool so
and there is no information what the
full series contains so if you go to
Java micro-services so this is the you
full series what it contains and there
are all 55 episodes so this is about I
think four hours something
there's effective Java I think is the
next one here it's also everything so
the whole agenda and Java
bootstrap I hope so you should be able
to find the whole serious by properly is
misleading my my entry page so this is
all what Java bootstrap contains I hope
is crystal clear what I can do I think
the problem is so that if you don't have
account
2d if you click here somewhere no it's
not true you come here I thought this
what you want see so I am you will have
to use to just use the links here here
here here and here and you will see the
contents and if you look at github you
will see even these simple apps so I
should be able to see the whole agenda
okay
I want to use jax-rs client using Jersey
in a java SE multi-threaded environment
how can I make the client instance
thread safe that I can reuse it very
good question and it really depends
whether using Jersey or or white lie and
in white fly for instance there are like
two modes and the white fly rest easy
library it depends on its called HTTP
components it's the big common client
from Apache and yeah what was the
problem with that in standard case
there's only one thread poor per client
so you can perfectly use it within each
state as it should be because there
would be only one thread prosthetist you
be but if you try to share the client it
was stuck so this is a one of the common
white thread problems and that this does
not happen with Jersey for instance and
what I would do is I use a control like
at stateless and then use the client
fetch the target in post construct and
you can close in pre destroy also I have
to say in I never closed the client in
Jersey and it passed all the tests but
still you know if I would probably a we
should start closing the des client and
how can I make the cluster associate the
carries it yeah exactly so a private
client private web target wrap it in and
stateless egb then it's perfectly thread
safe because EG bizarre thread safe and
if you get 5v jeebies you get via five
five power threats you get five vgb
instances and you get five kursi
instances any workshop streaming update
yes this html5 how to how to call it
like the real name of the course would
be like vanilla html5 CSS and JavaScript
apps and now it's called web standards
it's an update yes I'm putting more and
more standards in it and I'm 30% done
so I'm constantly working the course
because I get more and more ideas from
my projects so and there is no standard
way to implement attachments I think
attachments like file upload and use you
will have to use Jersey or rest easy
extensions right now so next one is
differences between Java and c-sharp
dotnet and what is the difference
c-sharp Internet is a less of a
framework like Java years it does not
start so I would say the how it's called
the Microsoft server is the the
Microsoft HTTP server I forgot the name
make of Microsoft information services I
think the name information server this
is more like the application server from
Java so you will have to have dotnet
plus Microsoft information server and
then you have something like Java and
there is Windows communication framework
communication foundation good friend
logo and this is even closer to to javi
huh and so there are services we
simplified configuration looks like this
and then ok this is not what I wanted to
show you the bindings endpoints but
these windows communication foundation
with Microsoft information sort of an
internet they are somehow similar to
Java okay if you change from one
platform to another how much of your
knowledge will transfer I would say a
lot because if you understand the
request response and the service concept
it applies to everything given rügen
rails would the change be something like
Java to node.js or something like Java
EE to spring
I would say more Java to no jazz because
Java EE and spring up fairly similar and
no GS other
similar to let's say servlets but of
course it's different language I would
say more Java to no J's dynamic entity
in Eclipse link so of course is
proprietary so no one knows how long it
is supported any update in payara could
break this because there's a crippling
feature and large amount of data could
work the problem with all dynamic data
is like imagine like a hash map so one
entity is a hash map with key and values
they get a far more instances than one
class and this was a problem in my
projects we had we used instead of back
then we had to use data transfer objects
but we used a dynamic data transfer
objects like I was called bin binutils
Chicago Commons binutils and also build
my own and the problem with that is of
course that you have many more instances
and actually described it also in the
green book and I hope I also compared
the performance so the performance is
worse with that
so to encrypt the data I always used
database so database is great for
encrypting the data I would never do
this by myself and the offline feature
can be done right it's never ending
story so I think to do to be to do to be
offline capable is always a no the
question what happens on collision and
who wins if something goes wrong and
yeah so what we did even one times you
can just experiment with that if you're
using entity manager the entity manager
knows which entities are dirty which
entities are are are changed or empty
and there's even a feature called cache
coordination and eclipse link so in and
what what the entity manager is able to
do in eclipse link sent the dhih dhih
dhih dhih changes as events over the
wire array my core by JMS with pluggable
protocols so what you could do is of
course you can you can Hecht eclipsing
in
that way that the cash is replicated
across the notes but still what happens
if the same entity is changed twice or
the entity with the same ID is to end is
changed at the same time in two notes so
we need answer for that
what I can share a completed project in
github like Allen scoop device to run or
Cairo frackin actually x-ray this is
what is also a content of the blue book
it is even on github so I thought so the
x-ray is my complete project and the
word am this is an old one is I think T
even older than from from our wounds or
cargo from Risa and what it is is this
is my real-world project is actually the
oldest and this is the steps here these
steps here this is my real-world
projects what I cannot do I cannot share
project what I do for my clients and in
the real world night hacks this is where
is the book hmm Co goodwill will quote
night hex so in this book I implemented
the x-ray application and described what
was the thinking process the idea behind
so this is what I did okay so this is
done which conference do you advise to
see the trends of software industry and
get the best benefit and this is what
so first no fluster stuff is not
necessary trends so trenches for me like
you know esoteric stuff and Garnett
quadrant or whatever sorry for the
whatever or is how it's called the radar
technology radar and no class just stuff
was more like hands-on conferences and I
attended the info sheer conference in
Danzig dance in Poland and this was
amazing this was like there were
Google people Amazon speakers from all
over the world github a huge conference
and there's also a startup area would I
deliver the talk of course about Java II
which people will confuse at the
beginning but then there was no
questions left so I think it was
well-received and this info share I
think it's a good one there is even some
free sessions and you can just just
upgrade the ticket with an attendee
workshops and devoxx of course this is
also always a good content what an yeah
what should be careful what I don't like
if you know if you if you get the same
talks and all conferences open over gay
over and over again is because it's like
more like a show someone prepares a
token delivers it ten times a year the
question is always know is what they are
doing
between the talks are they just
preparing the talks or they are spending
time in projects this is what interests
me the most so if you after the talk go
to the speak and say now where you used
your technology you you introduce to us
and if you get reasonable answers or you
can then you know ask about about the
the experience then then you will
exactly know whether this is something
you know cool new stuff which is never
used or something with some meat so um
so yeah DevOps box conferences Java user
groups of course and this info share and
in Germany we have Jack's
and DW Jack's these are huge conferences
and this was this is that okay let's see
what happens here no questions here no
questions no questions no questions
next one which would be your approach to
implement I think it is server-side
rendering on a custom service page app
es6 in java ecosystem so server-side
rendering so and I want to avoid JSP and
the question is why because I really
like JSP but if you would like to avoid
JSP of your reasons the reasons could be
you don't like the templating so um what
I did jungle now let's see I forgot the
name of the project that's on template
engine and the project is SPG stands for
static page generator and this doesn't
run on a server what it does is you have
a template and the template uses master
this is a must
yes this is a nice templating language
this is a mustache and handlebars there
are different templating engines and my
thinking was I would like to use you
know the same templating language which
all designers are using and yeah
mustache or handlebars is this what you
usually would expect so let's see if it
go to it's JavaScript and search yeah
you will have to be to do this but it
looks like this where's the template
here the template looks like that and
this is the key and the key is here this
is the key and this is the value so this
is going to be replaced by look and if
you go to the workshops and for instance
your web standard actually the whole
page is generated with the SPG and why I
did this because for instance the this
year
response with the hidden fields' behind
the registration with the same date and
this is stored in a Jason and I generate
the static page whenever I get a new
course date by the way I forgot to
mention the bootstrap effective and
architecture the next course is going to
be to take part in March and not no time
to announce that but it will be March so
you could do the same in real in life so
on the server so you can reach Jason
from database or unrest endpoint store
the template somewhere combined both to
an HTML template and we did it a lot for
invoice generation you know contracts
and and printing so works so I would use
nice one you can just take a look at SPG
NASA on Java 8 and a control a CDI or an
eg be and it should work nice covered a
very good question so I would like to
know you're naming your boundary class
which just reduce of craze read update
delete update correction so um if I
really would have something like this
and it just has the crutch why not to
call it customer crutch so instead of
current customer service just call it
customer crotch and and if it gets more
responsibility then rename it to what
whatever is doing and also nice one Nick
Shaw says there is a jab for Java 9 and
this chap and this chap defines Java
Java 9 util Java logging API and what's
my thought about this and yeah as I'm
shared the opinion was Nixa G Java util
logger is more than enough for my
projects is I don't have the problem
that you know the Java ddd logging
frameworks are don't have enough
features then more is like the
developers are writing lots of
crept to the log files and no one no one
is able to know to to the reef to derive
a sensible information from that and so
on but this is interesting so this this
new Java logging it will not replace the
old Java logging is more like they would
separate the implementation from the
interface and they will use it or
internally also for like I'd even guess
the M or I suspect even the the garbage
collector the internal JVM machinery
will use this logging interface and if
it come out and it's good enough I will
for sure use it so before I use you know
any filter debris I will always prefer
to have a nine delineate the better
thing Wars okay I hopefully see what
happens here no questions no questions
no questions
so quite audience ad from Munich so I'm
no far away so thank you for for for
asking so out to discover restful web
services or developing generic restful
web service client and you can
absolutely do this and what I'm asking
myself so if you also discover all the
links and you will for instance see that
a hex slash workshops so you'll find all
the workshops and you will find out that
you can you know follow the link but you
what you will have to do is you will
have to configure your generic client
how to react to the workshop so you will
have to configure a client then to say
okay follow the link and if you fetch
the effective workshop register to it so
I'm I think as a human we go to a page
we click on the link and then we think
about what do the next if you build a
generic client the question is know what
should happen to the generic client you
will just follow all the links and and
and just you know discover all the
possibilities we are building a crawler
like a Google crawler or robot or you
would like to do something sensible and
if you all like to implement something
sensible you would have to configure
what should happen if you follow this
link
and the question is then when you are
able to follow the link generically but
you will have to configure what happens
in XML JSON llamó what is the added
value and the repeatable process what
you could do the question is would you
like to do it from outside or inside
your app if you build this from inside
you could use the Sebastian - nice great
how it's called
jax-ur is not analyze a plug-in it
analyzes all these structures for you it
works the structures and extracting the
information so you could use Jenkins for
that for instance to take a look at this
and you could of course do it from the
JAXA scan as well because you get you
can fetch the data structure parse the
data structure and and and see whether
there are links and and follow the links
so you only we will only have to know
where is the link and if the if in case
the jax-rs service is done right so it
should be obvious what it is it will be
possibly you know behind an element
called links if you or you are following
in for instance atom published
publishing protocol suggestions then it
should be easy to follow I want to learn
react.js polymer with Java back-end so
first if you are using a react GS of
polymer I'm using polymer 2 but I'm not
using the polymer 2 components so I'm
just using the polymer 2 just for
templating but not I'm not using the
paper button on paper text field I'm
using this straight straight
html5 elements and how and a Java EE
backend does matter so what in both
cases I'll use the fetch HTTP API and
with a polyfill when are we quiet and
then the Java is already separated and
then for react I mean this trivial just
create some views I would encapsulate
the fetch API in a service pojo or new
plain old JavaScript object the service
pojo and then you are good to go and
polymer is exactly the same so there's
no different performances about streams
API in Java 8 I mean there's lots of
talk about this and the question is
really relevant I never had a problem my
project that the streams are too slow
and we have to know to move to 4 and
they had a full loop or wire loop so I
don't think is an issue in general case
and you will always find a corner cases
or or or how it's called
yeah a load and stress test will show
that the streaming is too slow and you
have to use regular 4 or while loop and
what I think that Oracle team will fix
the gap of performance between streams
loops I I don't think there is something
to fix I mean what you should do give me
an example where stream is too slow and
for is hosta so like root world example
and it could look at this and think
about this what I know the Oracle team
is really concerned about performance
and they are constantly improving the
performance is that there's not like
really bright bright people old Sun
engineers and Oracle engineers and they
are it's not like you know they are just
ignoring any performance hints and I'm
not aware of any serious performance
problems ok HR glasses payara
know hazel test session replication
whether I have any suggestion that
simply the session ID is always in fest
and never shared what can happen if you
are have first I don't you should use
this distributor
web.xml this is the obvious part but if
you writing something to a session there
is a difference whether you are working
in replicated mode or standalone mode in
a standalone mode the HTTP session
behaves like a hash map so if you have
key and value and it changed the value B
values changed if you have if you are in
replicated mode then if you change the
value the value is changing one note but
not on the others so in order to make
your application work what you will have
to do is to say HTTP session that put
and and then override the existing value
then it gets replicated this is what it
really works what I what I'm actually
doing I'm disabling HTTP session
replication because you only have you
know cap theorem and there are two
choices either you will they have to be
scalable so then it has to be replicated
asynchronously if it's replicated
asynchronously what's the point because
if it fails it is it is not replicated
so it's no fell over if it is replicated
synchronously it's just too slow if you
get more nodes it gets us all so this is
why I try to avoid HTTP session and
stateful egb replication not I try to
avoid actually for years and never
applicate that I'm really interested in
excised about the concept of a chart you
should be at all excited about HR and
even if there's a Wi-Fi swarm why
transform is absolute production ready
but I don't know why the exciting
feature is you are building 90% of stuff
which never changes like the you know
the whitefly swarm changes every three
months or twice a year and you are
building it over and over again and
putting all the stuff to fhr and so but
what fact whiteflies swarm is capable of
lookup the hollow jar this is the actual
we should be excited about so you can
bin thin-film jars with white rice warm
and I will probably record and a
screencast or write a blog post about
that this is really nice and I don't get
at all fetch our concept so what it
means to me I'm building you know
char over and over again fifty to fifty
times a day and and and and and upload
it over and over to the server and from
the know that's a twenty megabyte of the
jar just 500k are different or changing
at each build so this is what would I
what I don't get
okay me again so you often recommend
communities really at I mentioned Cuban
it's a lot but not often I mean if
someone asked me about that and various
okay
is it pursuit to make a separate YouTube
coding session auto-scaling services are
absolutely is possible the problems just
my time before I do this I would like to
complete the html5 course so this is why
I'm a little bit quiet with my youtube
channel and OpenShift is also a nice
option because open shifts open shipped
already reps the Cuban it is so it uses
Cuban it is been the scenes and if you
would like to try that look at mini
shift okay I got tweet today is there
any way to set time on injectors using
only je je or something that works in
Jersey and rest easy this is what I
proposed in the jax-rs Java 8 I brought
several image I don't know whether it's
actually inside I've wrote the email and
then emails were migrated to github I
don't know whether they were actually
right but I try to enforce that
hopefully it is so and this is twice so
I will have to delete this once so let's
see whether there any other I will just
reload that Oh next one how do you see
Java based fondant like JSP and JSF
compared to JavaScript based ones with
Java beckoned this is fairly simple
there's a server-side rendering or
client-side rendering if you have
everything on the server it is hard to
be offline so this the Java EE backends
and with single page apps it works like
we have in the backend and a nice API
domain-specific API and declare
just using the API and they can be open
or not it's more like set client if
something works it's something runs on
the server like GSF JSP Vardhan
for instance or yeah button then it's a
little bit different because what
happened then you have direct access to
the java classes and you have fine great
fine grained interaction model so you
can call methods and you can validate on
the server right away and with the
clients as client-side frameworks you
will have to validate twice once in the
fondant and then in the back end so to
complete two completely different
architectures so this is the difference
okay nice no question here yeah Pavel
also has some nice it's a lots of
project using JSF right now okay
they asked me is there any good maven
recipe on packaging je apps - for
different applications automatically
using continuous delivery approach I did
something like this this is what we do
in the testing workshop and with Jenkins
- is actually trivial because with maven
I was called Adam being maven java ee so
the way to go is that this is the
archetype so you have already O'War and
now if you said what you have to do then
is to you know to submit the war to
application server or using FTP or in
Dhaka you just create doc mhm so this is
what what happens and I use Jenkins file
which is included in the in the war it's
available or to use JCA resources of
course I mean and a good book I'm not
sure but there is a connect tours Adam
beans I created two connectors with
source code and this is in the green
book and just look at the source code
whether you like it or not my perception
is JC is not that well-known so what can
happen you are using a no recent
application server and there are still
some bugs because it's not that every
project is JCA so does the downside of
JC a yeah but absolutely you can use it
to the Audrey actually covers what i
pre-act react over ankle angularjs
I think everyone prefers react over
Anchorage's if someone knows react did
build a project was react its and at the
same time with angularjs I cannot
imagine that people will still prefer
angularjs unless they already as j2e
know Java j2e architects from all days
with 20 layers and XML files they will
probably like in graduates a little bit
more
x-ray x-ray project is actually j6 yes
it is j6 but you know there's no
difference of Java 7 which are by 7 used
to be even a little bit more efficient
but dee-dee-dee-dee-dee sample project
is still so interesting our bread taka
Thank You Bret welcome back and come in
December to Munich so we have glowing
wine waiting for you
cool so I think we covered everything
thank you for watching see you in Munich
glowing wine in December so we have
Christmas market or winter market and
Munich Airport not related to a hex but
we use it and yeah and and still enjoy
this summer and see almost in autumn I
think there's a beginning of September
is the next 42nd a hex episode and of
course it will answer all the questions
thank you for watching and bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
