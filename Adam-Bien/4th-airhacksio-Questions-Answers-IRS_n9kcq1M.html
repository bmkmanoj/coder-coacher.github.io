to the fourth edition of hex each first
Monday of the month and this is actually
not the inductive show rather than I
recorded this another time and the
reason for this was we had some problems
with the stream so I rebooted my machine
and forgot about the recordings so
instead there was some corrupt files or
instead of attempting to repair device I
will rather rerecord the show I hope
it's ok so there will be no interaction
during the show ok the first question
was are vanilla java application
actually viable and this is not actual
question rather than i was mentioned
during a twitter conversation and
actually had no idea what what's the
reason for the conversation was but i
will actually show you the the
conversation it was Teresa Rahman
mentioned me and said has done the same
as well just vanilla Java applications
and the question was Eva had wolf looked
for valve looked for years without
libraries I don't know the reason but
the question is are such projects out
there and the answer is of course my
only problem is I'm consultant so I
cannot mention the projects but I hope I
will be able to perform some interviews
on my blog soon with some startups using
just vanilla Java and recently I
reviewed several larger projects so
larger project means a couple of
developers are now 30 developers develop
the projects for several years and the
and the dependencies were negligible so
so what it actually means they just use
dependencies like Jakarta Commons those
are from time to time so actually you
know so nice to have dependencies so we
could actually eliminate all the
dependencies without any impact on
functionality and what will remain is
the vanilla Java II so the question is
what's my opinion about this on my
opinion is I like it so what I really
like is if we have java application
server just use it
and what it means is try to keep the war
small so I'm in the Twitter there were
the ears were mentioned but that didn't
used years for years
so keep worse small and why it's
important well you can build in faster
you can build their wars easier so there
are no external dependencies there are
empty deployment is faster so there's
just benefits and also the problem you
can get with with external dependencies
if they they have to be maintained so if
any external dependence you have to be
maintained what it actually means is I
would upgrade to dependency at least
once a year and if you will be really
sure you will have to check check out
the source code make it buildable inside
a company and then the and then you can
be sure if that this dependency
disappears so what it actually means
someone you know push the delete button
on github you can still proceed with the
application so in my eyes Java epoch HIV
applications are absurd and without any
dependencies are absolutely viable this
is what I'm going for if you look at my
open source projects which are just a
pet projects I try to minimize any
dependency yeah because of my many
minimalistic point of view so if we have
already a productive platform or why we
should introduce an or and other
dependencies exception from the rule is
of course UI framework so if you are
using JSF like primefaces for instance
you will have to add the dependency okay
so the next question is really
interesting what about exposing DB
objects via rest directly answers if you
can live with this go for it
so I'm what would you will gain is if
the database changes your IP a changes
this will change which is actually a
benefit so why our benefit yeah because
there is no no duplication so the truth
in the database if it changes all the
clients have to be recompiled or at
least extended or some more or at least
tested and but before you are
implementing this I would rather
look at the project chest from open GPA
it's a nice servlet which directly
exposes jpay object as restful Web
Services and the same is true for for
eclipse link the project called JT a RS
restful data services and what I
realized alike is also the API it's
really nice if you are learning rest
just look at the API there are some nice
principles or post input is used
properly and you know there are nice
speaking or or flu and orey's I would
say so you can just looking at the at
the URI you know what is going on so
before if you if you are thinking
exposing you know master data management
to a database I would rather look at
eclipse link JP ARS and open JP AJ's
before I would implement it by myself or
just clone the code look at the code
modify the code and contribute back ok
third question I have Java six
applications that communicate with eg
B's jax-ws and jax-rs
and there are server-side applications
and there are swing clients or or Java
clients involved and the question is
where to put yet classes so the first
question is do we need shared classes so
if you have a tricks that jax-ws the
common interface is WSDL so you could
generate the classes on each built at
the client side is actually would write
it
if you're using jax-rs you will probably
go in the not non type safe way so what
it means is you will expose JSON object
so the common API is a JSON object so
the broader topic is type safe versus
dynamic interfaces and we spent a couple
of hours actually or a couple of hours
yeah
worst case couple of hours during the
architecture day at mini gap or just
discussing the topic you know what is
better type server or not type safe and
it really depends this is the consultant
answer depends on your needs but so it
could have you have nothing in common
except the REST API or WSDL so this
would be would mean you are creating the
server-side code and the clients are
created by
Department was different lifecycle for
instance if you would like to provide
classes of like a business delegate
classes to the client I will put it in a
dedicated projects called API for
instance or API is a generic term some
what the project is doing I don't know
ordering RP or just ordering something
in domain within the name and the client
will have to import the HR and the
server will be dependent on the chart as
well this could be one approach and what
would be the con the ingredients of the
jar would be videos could be JPA
entities and of course exceptions and
all the parameters which are necessary
to communicate with the server back and
forth but I will never call this you
tool if you call something util it's
like the term is too generic is a
kitchen sink you can put whatever you
like and as always ok so I think it was
a huge mistake in Java JDK that son
called introduced the util package if
you look at the util package right now
everything is there so from collections
to dates to locks everything is a you to
package ok next question the question of
number 4 what is the best way to
implement my own data sources for
database connections for database
connection the question is a little bit
strange but I had to do it twice
different database once for TP 2 and the
admin in another project for Oracle am
actually more than twice but at least
for two databases why we had to do this
it was insurance like company and and
there was a bank and the problem was if
you are using the data source or
something from connection pool which
communicates with the back-end system
the problem is that that in the database
only sees the resource user this is the
resource user which with which the
connection was created so in the case of
glass which I open the the admin console
if I go to additional properties you
would just see the user app which
communicates the whole time with the was
the backend
the app is the resource user has nothing
to do with the real user so and my
requirement was to pass the wheel who
user to the backend how to do this so
what we did we start the principle in
thread-local and we decorated the actual
data source implementation the question
is how to know what is actually the real
data source if you look at this it's
declined data source in the india in the
case of derby so what I would do right
now if you will have to enhance for
instance Derby I will check out the
source code from the Derby database it
just Apache project to be Apache to
torque I think you can clone the
repository look at the implementation
and enhanced implementation and what we
did is we implemented the actual data
source and we passed everything to the
Oracle data source and we created a
decorator and the decorator manipulates
the real data source so we enhanced
Oracle driver I registered our own
driver to the to to the application
server by the way so it's an old driver
is called p6 spy hopefully it still
exists yes and this is also interesting
so look at p6 pi it is on empty JDBC
driver and what it actually does it
wraps a connection and it's able to lock
all the interactions with the backend
you could do something similar for data
sources then you can do whatever like
and what I it is not about data source
but something legacy I would look at
connectors and actually implement it a
JCA connector for Java e6 once it's
called
what just is with the threads which is
no more necessary in Java EE 7 because
we have what's called concurrent
utilities for Java EE and the next part
is what I also implemented connector
which accesses files in transactional
way so on to our implemented
I hope question is answer the fifth one
is a little bit trickier so I had some
interactions with Patrick today morning
about this so the question is how to
solve database passwords and so as if I
read the deed
question directly what you would assume
Patrick attempts to communicate with
directly with the database and bypassing
the data source and this is actually not
as it should be used you should always
use the data source from the application
server but then you don't have the - - -
- to communicate don't you directly with
the connection rather than you are using
all of the data source so there is no
way to pass the possible to the database
because the application server is using
the resource user but what Patrick would
like to do is Patrick would like to use
own authentication mechanism so you
would like to pass username and password
to the database and I think a better
approach would be to encapsulate this in
a security realm so what it means you
will pass the users what password to the
security realm and the security realm
will would would care about salting and
to implement the security realm is not
that hard actually in the in the case of
classes or jabba's you there are only
view classes which just fetch you know
the user sorry the principal and
associate the principle with the roles
and I wrote an very simple our simple
short article on Java magazine is called
Java security and this article just
explains how to use the security realm
and to make it salt table you will have
to enhance it and there are several
resources in the internet how to use
security realm with salt but if you
wouldn't like to implement your own
security realm and just use any kind of
salting what I would do I will I will
implement this in a simple jar tested
and then include the jar in a warped it
would be one of the view examples were
actually having a module which is
standalone makes sense because probably
you would like to share this module with
different other applications and this is
very simple in generic
functionality and highly reusable and
you could even put you know the the
module on github why not okay
I think the question is covered so now
interesting one about the BCE pattern
and the question was why do I create it
and a simple application called
workshops so I tried to I thought what I
can build with a little bit business
logic is that what I did I recreated our
workshops ax registration mechanism just
to have a little bit of business logic
and I published this as a BCE or ECB
entity control boundary pattern and I
would just show you what it actually
does so I will create the a project from
scratch and this is going to be
application from archetype come ere hax
BC archetype is the recent one and I
think it is I don't even know so go with
this PC so it fetches the definition
from maven central and the question was
I used I had two classes registrations
resource by registrations resource and
registration and the question is why and
so if you look at this in powdery are
two classes registration we just cares
about the registration and registrations
resource which has something to do with
with jax-rs and the question is why I
created two classes and not single one
and the answer is a little bit in the
register method if you look at the
method as lots of going on with Jack's
or as in forget episode path builder
path then I create strange JSON objects
and if I would like to test this method
or if I had any business logic in the
method I will have two tests or just a
method and then I will have to mock out
all the jax-rs stuff which is way too
too too much actually too just to test a
business logic and this is why I always
separate the the protocol classes from
the pure implementation they will always
find
jax-ur as resources separated from the
actual business logic and yeah but no
interface nothing is just in those
straight injection this is why I'm doing
this and doing this always and even in
most simplistic cases you will usually
like to to to return back a response not
the actual class you know just to say
whether it is created a 2/1 or HTTP code
200 you will have to return the response
and then it's harder to test okay I
think we covered this next one given the
uncertain future of GlassFish which
application server I would recommend so
uncertain future of GlassFish so there
is one company called lodge on and they
provide commercial support for GlassFish
and and they are I would say passionate
Java developers so I know you had Foss
from from several conferences this guy
is crazy Virts night and day and speaks
Java and they providing commercial
support for GlassFish and I would say
high quality commercial support so if
you have a question you probably get an
answer from them and another one is C to
be o C - B - I think there are yes and
this is a company from London and they
they provide you commercial support for
glasses as well also high quality also
crazy guys and crazy means positively
crazy so we have already two companies
which provide commercial support
GlassFish so I would say the future is
not that uncertain and what Oracle
stated several times GlassFish five will
come so but also also noteworthy I had
some discussions or our arguments back
on my blog about whether support let's
see what I will find it commercial
support atom beam
so and there are some discussions in the
blog about commercial support and and
application servers and what I would I
would I got or the feedback was no one
cares about the commercial support so no
one buys it is not necessary and I was
in completely different opinion but what
happened right now Oracle cancelled the
commercials applied for GlassFish and I
would say many of my clients moved to
white flight so so what it means I was
actually right sadly so people do care
about the commercial support at least
take care about commercial support if
they really have trouble they would buy
it so this is I would this is the MDD
attitude I experienced the project and
the problem with glass which was no one
knew about the commercial support so I
think the the Oracle salesman didn't did
a great job with this because most of my
clients didn't even knew that they buy
something for a glassfish so um this was
probably a problem with less fish so I'm
but then if if you would like or have to
migrate away from less fish where you
would migrate to so um my first choice
would be white fly so white white fly is
similar to GlassFish it comes with
command line interface which is based on
rest very similar to a s admin so you
can deploy the applications with
feedback so will get the feedback back
whether actually creators or blog post
so JBoss CLI and a mean it is very easy
to do to use it so it's like you can
just it's very similar to to to
GlassFish actually and it comes with
admin interface and it comes with some
shared components on glass which for
instance to weld the CDI dependency
injection is actually glass which one of
course hibernate validator JPA is
different so they they are using
hibernate and not eclipsing but
in some projects we migrated eclipsed
linked to a white flight and it still
worked
okay did were the first one Tommy also
interesting the problem was Tommy is
there is no CLI and there is not yet and
there is no Java seven support they have
working on this but it will come soon
then Tommy would be very interesting
because Tommy from outside looks like
Tomcat so I integrated Tommy to to
NetBeans s Tomcat it was able you know
to deploy the application so there's
already very good well integrated and
some companies having if you have Tomcat
in production you can you can just you
know enhance it with Java EE and then
you have Tommy and the secret weapon is
double LP and what it is WebSphere I
always suggest you WebSphere this is
very strange but what I tried out is wlp
Webster Liberty profile and this is a
totally different beast that the
full-featured WebSphere it comes with a
single jar and you can just execute this
with Java - jar you can download and
execute it and you get something like a
white for glass which very light but
very fast application server which
Travis is six support so if you have any
IBM licenses or IBM products in-house
double LP would be also interesting so
this would be application servers I
would suggest you okay next one do you
recommend overriding equals method given
that is doesn't work when comparing well
proxies to real objects interesting
question so first of all
I would like to draw something for you
and so how it works you have a client
and the the this could be an EJB for
instance and this could be a CDI object
and the CDI object is injected to the HB
with at inject the question is what
happens behind the scenes and what
happens is the following what usually
they cook the container does it creates
a subclass from Direction creates a
subclass of the real POJO and this class
is the proxy and that proxy knows how to
communicate back to to the real class so
what is actually injected is usually the
proxy and not dipole Joe so what it
actually means is it means that what you
are dealing with is a subclass of your
real class usually or a bytecode
extended class and this is another
instance of the class so here get two
instances a proxy instance and the real
instance this is the first and if you if
you implement equals the question is is
the proxy equal to the real class or it
isn't and I actually don't know why it
matters because it would only matter if
you would attempt to do entity means JPA
classes and managed objects then you
will have to copy a kiss or something
like this but usually CDI are treated
like services in Java 6 and then you
actually don't have to compare them the
only reason I would think of is if you
enter it implement your own scope if you
implement your own scope it will be
probably nice to compare the objects
whether they are already in scope or not
using equals but usually you would use
the equals equals you know operator just
to compare whether they are the same or
not
so the question is why you would like
what is the problem not implementing the
equals actually never in
Limited equals which doesn't say
anything but I don't even understand the
problem okay then next one next question
GS f-22 is early days to support html5 I
wouldn't say this html5 is already
really well supported so we just closed
some tabs so and this is the UM the
Oracle page which explains the html5
support for JSF and what's interesting
what you can could do you could write
code like this and what it means is
input type vs. email and now JSF ID
email and what's important is here to
make an element is not a strap JSF
element a pass-through element specified
with one of its attributes using the
namespace so if you specify at least one
attribute here which the name suggests
it becomes an elements the question is
which one and it depends here on you see
here here input input with the type
email it is this one becomes H input
text so you can just work with standard
html5 markup and the standard html5
markup will be ice converted behind the
scenes to facelets tags for you so it
just works out of the box and then you
have all the power of html5
the problem is let's see what I will
find the the old post the problem is
what what GS html5 introduces this
semantic markup so actually what you
would like to do is to have you know a
specific meaning for enough article
section and a side and then you will
count on the component providers that
they D will use the html5 markup
properly so on the suggestion here is
what should happen in JSF in my Eyes's
it will be to introduce a kind of
structure to the component providers as
I say look you know there should be if
you are building a navigation bar used
enough take for instance then it will be
more more responsive right now you can
that the component providers like
primefaces or retraces or whoever could
just just use dips and nothing else and
then you will be hard time to create
responsive web design pages what is
responsive web design is a page which
the UI or layout adapts to their clients
automatically usually usually using
techniques like media queries so and
relative size size settings so you are
not using pixels rather than DMS or
percent and shameless plug this is
actually what we discuss in the html5
day and what's also funny on Thursday I
will introduce your web frameworks like
Vardhan JSF and on Friday I will explain
you why sometimes such frame frame does
cannot work but yeah interesting dates
but and the html5 day we discussed the
responsive web designer must the actual
problems are and the problems are
sometimes you need to access to the
bi-metal to the html5 markup and
regardless which technology you are
using it becomes not that productive
because JSF voddy in GWT and all the
frameworks are generating HTML code for
you but if you need a total control of
HTML code such frameworks are just you
know slow it down so it really depends
on what you would like to do but you can
achieve a lot with html5 and GSF - -
right now and wood strips type as
practices you can still do it with JSF
if the structure is clean and you have
nice classes you have some thoughts
about the structure classes semantic
markup you can absolutely use use
bootstrap for instance and what is
recommended practice to ensure
responsive web design actually just F no
difference too
to practice in html5 but you have to be
aware of the generated code so if you if
you have to use primefaces rich faces
ice faces or whatever Omni faces what
you will have to do is you will have to
look at a markup whether the markup is
semantic whether you will find you know
in navigation bar footer or header or
whatever and then if you will find them
easily you can create your own media
queries and adapt a layout to your needs
okay so what I thinking about just big
Java authorization what is this Java
authentication for containers and why do
you never use it in your examples I also
never use Jack Java authorization
container contract so there is JCP dork
page and the GSR
115 is Jack Jonathas ation contain a
contract for containers and what it
actually specifies is the layer how the
principles are created and the roles and
how the roles in web.xml are mapped to
the real ones so you can if you are
creating your custom security you could
look at this also with salting you can
you could enhance this and just peek
it's about messaging and authentication
and oh there is nothing currency JCP JCP
jars vic and it is actually it is a
specification about HTTP GMS soap
authentication using messaging and the
spec is fairly thin is about 170 pages
really well described and this is if you
if you if you would like to create your
own custom authentication just picked us
what's my opinion on this actually is
something which I do not implement you
know in each project this is why I don't
have a lot of experience with just
beaker implemented just big ones and
Jack twice on different application
servers and the specs are well written
so if you read the specs and implement
it it is fairly obvious what to do and
yeah
if you need to cast an authentication go
forge a speak this is what what my
opinion is and you wouldn't see it in my
examples because if I'm just you know
creating this ones or to to my clients
it is harder to recreate this in a clean
room implementation after the work and
this is not a lot of fun for me to do it
in my leisure so um this is actually the
reason but there's nothing behind this I
hope I hope it is clear so just begin
the app perfectly usable is Java 6 and
Java 7 you can use it right now ok this
was a spec is there a good way to debug
concurrency locks first don't use
synchronize modifier rather than use for
instance rien re-entrant reentrant
read/write lock in Java so if you use
lock classes like this from the Java
util concurrent locks package it just
looks like this so you would have to
declare the lock here and then look and
and read lock becomes regular method so
you can set a breakpoint here so if you
set a breakpoint you can profile this
and you can easier search for problems
this is a trick in the past we debug or
profile such problems with Mission
Control and there is a flight recorder
is a great tool but it is commercial I
don't know about the licenses cost but
it's a commercial one but it's really
great it doesn't slow down a slow down
or slow down the system
another interesting commercial product
is called Cronin systems and the Cronin
systems create something like yeah like
a DVR for Java they record the whole
stack trace the whole stack and you can
reply what happens over and over again
and even you can insert some logging
statements or really interesting
application ok so the next one example
how to connect with from Java X to Java
EE beckoned with restful web services
quick answer is no difference between
Java fixer and swing
or system tests but I implemented back
some years ago this in project called
light fish and light views the job of
exponent of the project and if you go to
the services tab there is a escalation
fecha which uses the jax-rs client to
fetch the escalation so there's a simple
method get escalation there's an
escalation provider which wraps this in
a task and make sense asynchronous so in
Java 7
I will code it a little bit differently
because Java 7 comes with asynchronous
kind out-of-the-box this would be one of
my next tasks to make it asynchronous
but in the script manager for instance I
can register new script using using put
and XML so I'm just wrapping the jax-ur
asclad and exposing the script manages
something like a business delegate back
then and the project is my github
project and it's called light fish where
is it where is the fish light fish so if
you clone the project you get the
example I think it's pretty
straightforward also although I created
a short video starting with Jax res
client so you can look at the video so 6
minutes how to start with Jax or s2o
client and if you've wrapped a client
was with a single class you can use it
from java fix wink or whatever you like
so what is the best way to handle large
files and 20 Meg's at least and with
they can get larger and if a few hundred
of users so let's say it'll be 1,000
users 20 MX it would mean 20 gigs I
think right let's say 30 gigs then still
I bought 24 gigabyte of ram for 180
euros recently you would saturate a one
server with this so it is not it isn't
end-of-the-world so if you think about
this you can you can keep everything in
memory in the would still work and you
will have to spend 180 euros but the
question is going ok they did the
uploading
your files so it can be significantly
larger than 20 max what happens if the
if the file is you know 20 gigs then
there is no way to keep them in memory
what I would do then streaming so I
would always use streaming so how to
what it actually means you should use on
the client and on the server input
stream output stream but never JSON
object or an entity class because then
the data is going to be deserialized or
uncivilized to a java object instance
and this is and this will take a lot do
is take a lot of memory so this is the
problem with this and so how to do this
the question is okay fine I'm uploading
from a stream so it is really easy to do
it actually I would probably record
another screencast because I'm
implementing it right now I'm streaming
a file by a jax-rs service which is
really easy so I only have to put you
know expect an input stream as a
parameter and it would just work where
to put it because if you if you create a
file on the server the file will live in
a local file system if you have class
they're already in trouble so um one
idea would be to use something like
Cassandra Cassandra is very very good in
writing large files and and it already
would would replicate the data in
cluster so I would use something like
Cassandra to write directly to to
datastore you could of course use
relational databases or of course just
use a connector so if you look at my
connectors implementation you could
enhance the connect implementation so
you could just write you know load byte
array rather than a string just write a
string directly to the store and the
street could be and a string a stream
directly the store this could be a
Cassandra store and if you have lots of
memory I would use something like hazel
caste or infinite span to keep
everything in memory but I would
separate another store like Cassandra
hazel cast from the objects and there
should not even attempt to deserialize
the object into memory because then it
would be in trouble so I would say 20
make XML file could be expanded in
memory to I
probably even to a few hundred megabyte
of RAM okay and the last question why
maybe lifecycle hooks are problematic so
of recent drug shop someone asked me you
mentioned something
don't use maven lifecycle hooks why why
not and the answer is simple so if I go
to any maven project and say here clean
and build what happens maven performs
maven clean install and this should be
fast so this is already slow but what
happens behind the scenes it creates a
syntax all your dependencies creates one
single jar for Java fix so this is six
seconds are already too slow and if I
would create setup lifecycle hooks for
phase safe integration tests and for
quality control like Sona it will
probably take several minutes or even
several several hours so in my eyes you
should never use lifecycle hooks rather
than create several jobs on your in your
CI environment like for instance Jenkins
or Hudson and each job will execute a
single mavin mavin step or it's called
maven phase instead of sorry and plug-in
actually so that's amazing
phase safe integration test and you will
change the jobs together why why it's
important to do this because if you if
you do it this way what you what you
will get is you get a faster feedback
because you will see okay unit tests are
finished integration tests are finished
and now the application is deployed on
the Play application server if you
create a got an huge monolithic maven
you will have to one hour to get a
feedback okay thank you sorry for the
non interactive style today but it was
easier to me to you know to go through
all the questions again then or easier
more fun then you know spend time with
corrupted files and and editing and yeah
see you and one of upcoming workshops so
at Munich Airport so this is the
schedule and there will be also a bunch
of workshops in in December and
particularly I will what I'm really
looking forward is in October of wrecked
ships about combining Java 8 which are
by 7 particularly now you can do some
tricks eliminating JPA or just using
hazel house and stuff just playing with
Java 8 possibilities and probably I get
lots of requests about Java EE testing
and quality like are killing all the
stuff I got so probably I will initiate
another virtual as well this year so CEO
of upcoming conferences Java 1 I will be
there the whole week so if you have any
questions come to Java one who can you
can have a milk and discuss and have a
chat about Java and related stuff I
probably will record something in Java
Juwan who knows and yes your upcoming
conferences workshops or even the X and
each first Monday of the month at 6 p.m.
CET see you here in livestream thank you
