think we have one whole year so thank
you for watching and so let's start with
the question so we have lots of
questions or start with D first HD and
the first one is about httpsession
replication and clustering is asked by p
0 track and he asked me how to replicate
the session and and clustering in java
context and i think i mentioned it
several times so in my opinion session
application is actually not needed in
java context and why does what I'm how
it usually works is you have multiple
service and the each server maintains
the hash map and the ashram is actually
the HTTP session they look like a
hashmap and behind the scenes the
session is replicated between the notes
so what it actually means is the session
is replicated asynchronously so I'm what
it what it what it means of course
asynchronously it means that i can get
lost and if you synchronize in
synchronous way or replicate the data
and synchronous way it usually does not
scare scale very well so you have to
choose between consistency or or
scalability as always and usually who
cares about tippy session right so
inverse case the user will have to relog
in to the application again so usually
need a neat session application session
affinity is just just enough and you
shouldn't store anything important in
the session so if you would like to
store something really valuable you
should start in the database so on the
next question someone asked me so why am
so against soap and actually I'm not
against soap but if you if you look at
the soap so what I did I try to find the
soap specification and to to show you
the recent one so we have
here I will have to find the right one
there was this one and the recent one is
actually four years old and it was it
was not even not even updated for for
for several years so for four years and
no one is talking about soap on
conferences anymore blog posts books
those are pretty quiet and from the
technical perspective I would say jax-rs
and rest is superb I would say over so
if you if you look at the sole protocol
it is basically a xml message wrapped
with an envelope and it is it is a
servlet which expects post messages and
this basically soap and the sad story is
soap is not really that interoperable so
on you get some trouble between you know
java internet and and even if you would
like to communicate between java and and
how it so called Internet of Things it
is really challenging and this is why I
don't talk us over a lot it's just is it
for me soap is fading away and even in
really large projects right now we don't
use soap anymore we use jax-rs
exclusively this is why I am NOT again
soap so for instance i really like korra
bar so i think if we would update the
core by api it would be a great
efficient protocol but they're still but
it don't use it anymore because you know
it also fades away so I'm so this is my
opinion bite soap and I have to admit I
personally never liked soap because it
was sold as a i would say business API
it was never used that way it was
misused as a remote procedure called
protocol and and in if you are using
jax-rs you cannot miss use it so so easy
because everyone would see them as using
the URI and with soap it was really very
it was very convenient to hide to hide
behind the pistol and yeah this is why
my personal opinion about soap so
really i think i didn't use soap for i
don't know eight years or something so
I'm 2006-2007 in projects sometimes of
course you have consumed so messages and
then i generate the stop with visible
gen but i don't use it actively or i
don't don't like to introduce sub
services in new projects and for me it's
is also a little bit too complicated to
complicate it to test to debug you need
for stress that specific tools you need
soap you I so it is like too much over
hat so it is not compatible with the
lightweight nature of Java EE so so the
next question is interesting can two
modules communicate with each other
through local interface in the same
observer or JVM and the same observer
JVM yes but within the war for instance
or between egb Jarrah's in the same year
it is very possible what you shouldn't
do it shouldn't communicate between or
it's actually not meant to communicate
between ears or worse because then the
isolation of applications were violated
so what's the point having two years
communicated over binary protocol then
you can put everything 11 year and it is
the communication is even improved
what's even improved with with ejb3 too
so i will just try to find it so there
should be three two specifications and
what I found this is the chapter global
jndi namespace if you looked at Jane di
names who were standardized so what you
can now easily do and it's very easy to
locate the Egypt beasts as you can see
the the name comprises the Java global /
archive name and bean name so this been
obviously doesn't have any interface is
just the local view and after the ! you
can you can specify the interfaces local
or remote interfaces so um so this is
again this is the the module name and
this is a pin within the app and
so I'm absolutely possible and look at
the heb 32 spec and the global jndi
names make it even more possible I don't
do this what I'm a big fan of is putting
everything to a war we have we'll have
our questions soon about you know
monolithic and and microservice
architectures so my point of view you
should create a Monell at first which is
easy to use a war and then if you have
more requirements or multiple teams what
you could do then then you can introduce
more Wars which are communicating with
each other so this was this would be my
my basic idea how to how to structure
the applications so the next point what
is the most elegant way of implementing
Sybil single table multi-tenancy was
discriminate a column in jp-a to without
using provided specific features so the
problem is multi-tenancy was supposed to
come to java 7 but it didn't make to de
spec so I'm Java 7 was supposed to be
all about clouds but i would say at the
towards the end of the of the spec they
decided not to do so so I'm hibernate
and eclipselink are providing
multi-tenancy but the mountain tendency
is not exposed via official jpa api's so
and now we have the product situation
where you can actually be multi-tenant
but not over GPA jpa standards but all
providers behave similarly and eclipse
thing is doing this hibernate you can
achieve something with having it filters
i think and in verse as of the portable
way would be to enhance the name queries
so what you could do you can you know
enhanced an inquiry was where a tenant
ID whatever and with java 7 you can even
create named queries on the fly so you
can load them from i don't know even
from database or from whatever this is
what it could do so this is a manual way
of doing this so each query needs to be
enhanced with the tenant what we also
did it is even go step further in a
project you can
select the whole entitymanager depending
on something so if you for instance
specify a jax-rs token so depending on
the token you can use producers CDI
produces to select the right
entitymanager so this also a way to
implement this so we actually did in the
current project so depending on the user
ID we were able to connect with
different entity managers depending on
country on whatever so this is and then
you can of course which everything right
but it's not what the question is about
the questions about single table multi
tendencies amines detect it's very like
very similar to a single table
inheritance it's the same is actually
the same story okay then then there is a
and the scenario is actually was the
token is what I explained right now what
you could do depending on the token you
can select the context using CDI on the
fly this actually works really well I
think even recorded some some screencaps
or at least I described it in my block
if not I can record it so it's very very
very nice what you can do you can eject
an instance of something and and pass
they qualify qualifier and select on the
fly whatever you like for instance the
entity manager or even more so the
question number 6 do we need to
propagate a security context does the
subject principles to EG be fusing form
based authentication you don't never
have to do this and this is actually
based on on the sublet protocols oh and
this is the authentication of servlets
and what happens here it's all so let's
say Soviets are based for everything so
serve it at the base of soap jax-rs GSF
struts and whatever and what servlets
provide you is the basic authentication
this is this base64 encoding digest is a
little bit more secure but not really so
it's just you know the the hash is
passed back and forth the HTTP client
authentication is certificate this works
but is very
hearts to maintain because you will have
to distribute the certificate and the
form based authentication is what is
asked for right now and but by the way
this is ancient is nothing new here I
think this was the not i think it is
actually from the beginning of the
sublet spec so even java web server
could provide this and this is actually
how how the internet works and at the
form based authentication is a little
bit more special what it actually means
you have to prepare a form i think the
name of the form is like jay underscore
form whatever j username and jay
passport and the interesting story what
we actually did in project you can use
even this for jax-rs so if you know the
names of the form or whatever you can
pass with jax-rs i have what is called
ww form encoded request to the 2d back
end and the principal is still going to
be passed through gb so DD the answer is
you never have to pass the principal if
you authenticate yourself using servlets
jsf or whatever everything is passed to
EG bees okay so and the next question is
isn't it better or almost easier to use
custom annotation interceptors to
implement a permission based security as
opposed to the containers are all based
security and i think you need both so
you need authentication and
authorization and authentication would
mean you get the principal and usually
they're there are they are how it's
called realms you have to use from from
Europe from your clients so you know it
could be held up it could be database
usual it's dead edible database or
something something else and this and
this realms are usually used for
authentication and then you get the
principal the principal name and if you
have the name you can you can then go to
your realm or your store and fetch the
permissions whatever like and I actually
wrote a free article about this if you
search for Adam being authorization
article or whatever
article it with glassfish and with
examples actually what I implement it
yeah exactly so if you if you if you if
you if you search for this you will find
a free article that they can it can use
the ideas there to to to to implement
this is what I exactly exactly what I
did I started with the basics and
assumed okay this is not sufficient and
then I implemented interceptors and
annotations to show you what you can do
without any external framework but I
wouldn't don't do it always you know is
it just if you have specific
requirements or we need a very I would
say very flexible permission model okay
so would just speak server
authentication module Sam fit in this
scenario it could and I actually wanted
to prepare a small example about Sam but
what I would I what I did instead I i
found an example and i will show it as
in a second so
and and if you search for jazz peak and
glass fish you will find you will find a
a glassfish 30 example so wait a second
it was called glassfish just peek and
the question was serve a fabrication
module
this is this link and if you if you go
further you will find an example source
code example how to implement a whole
example using glassfish three orders one
was weblogic and the other one was with
glassfish glassfish fear 30 even and
usually you good you you could use sam
or a server authentication module to do
something special like for instance you
could as mentions here use the token and
use the token for authentication but if
you are using form based authentication
or base64 using https it would be
sufficient so you don't need you know to
implement some folders so same would be
if you have no control over the tokens
or the API then you can use custom
module which extracts the information
from the from the request and and and
use it for a for authentication but then
you can do whatever like so easier once
a easier is more flexible then you can
do whatever like I actually implemented
this very view times the same and
usually I rely on the base64
authentication and sometimes from base
which is exception from the rule base64
with SSL is just works just fine so I
think I hope the question is answered I
just cannot launch the editor for
unknown reasons it's just kind of lunch
it so I'm so the next question is a
single time I event of egb timers in a
distributed application so the question
is understanding of the question is we
have a cluster and the application is
distributed over a multiple nodes and
and what what is needed is that the time
time is fired once per whole cluster and
this is very easy to achieve what you
have to do the default schedules or
timer is the schedule annotation or you
can use a time out of the box and the
schedule annotation means if you're
using persistence it goes through if the
time is persistent it's Torstein from
somewhere and in the event of glassfish
for instance you can specify the table
where the timer information is start and
if the table is global or shared you can
you get this so the time I will fire
once per cluster and if you're using
transient timers instead then we'll fire
once per node so the next question is
what I think about Gretel and I mean
this is a really hard question so what I
think about Gretel so what I did instead
so instead I i created an application a
java application which is buildable
buildable with with maven and with
Gradle so um this is the default maven
so what you see is do we have the group
ID artifact ID version number we
packaging war we have one dependency
which is Java API this is optional but I
like to do this so now the name of the
war is predictable those maven versus
cradle that war and not a version number
and then some optional properties like
we would like to dedicate 18 and we
don't need web.xml and in the event of
Gradle this is the Gradle script so as
you can see is exactly the same
information so what I just did I created
a variable which is used here this is
exactly the same using Gretel and so
actually from this point of view it does
not matter i have to admit most of my
java several applications look like this
with more test dependencies so there is
there are no usually no specific plugins
and if so is our plugins like a no
visualization plugin or what else we
have visualization plugin this is a
visually what I use sometimes and then
it's just straight you don't need
anything else in typical java java is
seven java 6 project and Gretel is more
flexible but they usually don't need the
flexibility in strange of a project but
what you could use it with Gradle for
instance you can replace grunt for
instance or
gallop with Gretel because it's more
powerful is actually programming
language and maven is not a programming
language so in straight java ee projects
i always use maven and not Gretel so
what I am what I can do I would just
open the I would like just to open the
terminal wherever the terminal is
something strange is going on
so and so what we can do right now is
the following maven clean install so it
was created in 07 seconds and with
Gradle we can build it as well it looks
a little bit different more interesting
probably sew-in built in two seconds so
we could argue maven is readily three
times slower than maven is of course
doesn't matter here so um this is again
this is Gretel and we have a built with
maven so whatever use is fast Gretel is
more powerful and I would argue maven is
simpler for java 7 and if your project
is not java 7 and you need more complex
I don't know continuous integration
pipelines whatever you can use cradle I
usually use a nice one or shell
scripting on or pêche or Jenkins
actually for pipelining nor cradle and
not gretel so um I would say if you
don't have specific requirements i would
use maven if you have crazy build
requirements use Gradle so this was just
was my I hope objective answer so with
Java 8 in streams you do not really get
how I I don't know to really get how the
exception handling is working so does it
the question number 10 and yes the
functions cannot throw checked exception
so it is just impossible with lambdas so
what do you what we can do is you can
you can inherit from functional
interfaces and you know and and throw
your own runtime exception for
instrument to runtime exceptions and
then you just get the exception but if
you would like to pipeline you know the
chunks of functionality I would use a
complete able few of complete able
future yes I recorded also a podcast
about this completa belief uture is the
name of the podcast screencaps sorry
and then you get a methods handle do
handle exception on exceptionally so
then you can react two exceptions
actuary so you can spay say if the
exception happens then return this so um
so in default case checked exceptions
are not possible and runtime exception
will just stop the pipeline but if you
would like to react to the exception two
exceptions use completely future so I
get funny tweet at Java 8 7 applications
not working and what I should do and
what happened was what I understood this
pin 6 emily was forgotten and there is a
different behavior between java 6 and
java 7 so if you have java 6 application
it is only this is sufficient to have
been 6 ml if you get bin 6ml dependency
injection is working everywhere in java
7 if you have just been 6 ml you get the
default that only annotated beans are
injectable so this is what what i always
do i put in pin 6 ml all i do it in all
the screencast so just watch some
screencaps of me will see this and and
then with in java 7 bin 6ml big pin 6 ml
with all is the same as in java java 6
pin 6 ml empty so our question number 12
can we set schedule schedule a time from
some property file or so of course and
even this is a very time configurable
very old blog posts from me I don't know
how holidays but simple as possible
timer and there is there was one
additional blog post about configurable
timer
probably too old so and the main
differences as you can see you can
inject the timer service and if you have
the time a service you can create the
timer's on the fly and I actually
actively using this in light fish in the
light fresh application you can you can
stop create timers on the fly with the
text box if you enter the text box the
the dddd schedule changes when light
fish fetches the monitoring data from
glass fish and then it kills the current
time and starts a new one so there's a
method time a service that cancelled you
can cancel the timer and what we did a
few years ago but it was already javis
java is six we made a schedule
expression injectable so we could inject
a schedule expression which was
depending on the class so on so what you
can do then you can start the whole
schedule expressions of scale expression
is basically a pojo with some you know
attributes so you can store it in a
database table and then you get then you
get a job framework job scheduling
framework and this is what we actually
did so we implemented a proof of concept
now in a few hours so it worked
perfectly so it's absolutely possible to
into to use to implement configurable
timers so it'll be actually fun for open
source project but you know just
additional open source project just to
configure timers it's very easy to
implement okay so this is the question
number 13 is the same there is the same
answer and question number 14 John Hogan
what i usually do i always mention
during conferences or whatever I like
monolithic applications and then I had
some talks about micro services and
someone asked me you know how it is
compatible so sometimes I talk about
monoliths sometimes I talk about micro
servers am I crazy or what so this
basically the question
and the answers nothing actually changed
so what I always said hopefully is the
following so if you have a war or start
with the application think about
business logic and create a monolithic
war first if you are lucky you basically
done if you are if you are a member of a
larger project or whatever you have a
multiple teams and and they have no
different life cycles or life cycle
means they they push the application
parts of the application to to
deployment at different schedules
different dates or whatever then you
have to set to create then you have
forced to create multiple Wars and and
the wars have to communicate with each
other usually you would use jax-rs and
not soap or a core bio jax-rs because no
mono live for me means monolith is
completely independent from the other
monolith so we have two monolith but do
you have to be in depending how to
achieve this the best way to achieve
that is with jax-rs so um and then we
then we are talking about micro services
so what it actually means in Java 7 you
get or Java 6 you get micro services as
a side product because you know if you
have to grow you have to introduce more
Wars and the words are deployed on on
standalone domains in usually right now
in some projects in the docker
containers and so we have to all the
cool stuff everyone is talking about and
these are actually microservices okay I
hope I clarified this if not there I
think I spend more time on d'box this
year to talk about microservices rest is
stateless some are claiming that you
should not even keep an his client State
on the survey yes this was always true
so I think I I remember I delivered a
workshop it was before 2003 and the
problem back then was the I high-tech
forbid the developers to have state in
their applications of state full session
beans were forbidden so they were unable
to use stateless beans the problem is
the needed state and and to implement
this day in the state
session bindi relied on a singleton with
her hash map and they passed our session
ID back and forth so from the outside
the application was stateless and they
implemented stateful session- stateless
session miniatures actually allowed but
stateful session we weren't there was
nice situation and why I try to help
them is because they get of course memo
leaked memo leagues with the singleton
because it was not as well as
implemented a stateful session meet so
yes I would say it is not bad you know
to start with stateless applications if
you are amazon google Netflix Twitter
Facebook or whatever it is a very good
idea to be stateless but in typical
enterprise applications if you only have
to serve to our view hundred you know
clients you can you can you can use
perfectly well stateful applications
usually you can have several thousands
sessions without any problems on a
mid-range server so it should work out
of the box and doesn't mean that each
request should contain a reference or
concrete information about user
credential whatever yes it usually has
to mean this is that the data is stored
on the client or in the database this is
what status means but not on the
application server so either you the
database in the Indian the status in the
database or on the client and sometimes
in the grid so what you can also do you
do you can use no hazel cast but this is
I mean very similar to session
application or you can sort data in CDN
or whatever but not on the application
server so the next question number 16 is
already what we actually talked a lot
about is how you would implement using
authentication with you I based on a
pure restful api with tokens actually
the first idea would be like servlets
use this would stir so yeah we just use
straight java ee authentication and and
if it doesn't work then i would think
about tokens or whatever in a project
last year we use tokens because the
tokens were stored on the host bay as
400 so we had to use tokens but we
didn't use j2ee security at all it was
just implemented entirely in the
database in all other cases we just use
jax-rs
as if it were as straight servlet so
there is actually not difference to this
how to pass and maintain focus and
invalidate sessions without keeping
client state on the server I mean if you
are ssl if you have secured
communication which I think you have it
is stateful anyway so i would say SSL is
stateful so that you have to communicate
with the server because the client
connects to our server to a particular
server then usually this token can be
reused oh yeah this is what stage was
with HTTPS so the answer would be just
use Java security straight so the
servlet security also for jax-rs and if
this doesn't work it is also mentioned
off there are lots of all
implementations or I think the jersey is
using off there is also a project called
porcupine is actually so funny because I
created project porcupine por q pine and
github and you will see there are
actually two projects and I think I just
tweeted about this this is my project
and this one it is interestingly enough
arrest security for jax-rs implemented
with java 7 and white fly and i will
just pink by the committee of the
project is all for java 7 i I didn't i
do not know nothing about a project but
they also pink me and looks interesting
so i will probably look at this but
seems like it implements or two oh look
at this okay so transactions over rest
api calls i would say is a really bad
idea because transactions in distributed
systems are always a bad idea and this
is actually ddd first outside ddddd
first hour i think in our architecture
course and munich airport so we talked
about
or D cup theorems ocap consistency
availability partition tolerance and
then you can actually prove that if your
system is distributed you can be either
consistent or scalable but never both
and and and regardless which product are
using whether using soap or WS
transactions or corporate transactions
or whatever even two-phase commit is not
bulletproof of course so it's always a
bad ideas or what you will have to do
instead you will have to implement a
rest in idempotent way so it means you
can repeat the requests without side
effects so usual you can use nuns for
this or yeah this is a nun so there's an
ID which never repeats and you send the
idea along with the request and the
server stores all the IDS in memory if
it if it and compares you know the
current ID with the known session IDs
and if it repeats in which just drops
the requests or forgets about the
request this could be one and the other
one is what just look at how net q rest
examples so there's also a beautiful
example so what happens is you are
posting at GMS message and the server
sends you back and Orey with a unique ID
and the audio is the unique ID has to be
used for the subsequent request services
also why it is idempotent and and and if
you don't use the DD or ed request is
going to be dropped so um and the
problem is what happens if nothing
happens right it would mean we have to
services let's say the classic one is
hotel booking and flight booking and of
course you would lie if you have to
flight you would have to room and this
is a testing problem so on how to solve
the problem you can only solve it by
business so what it means is you have to
arrange a business API and enhance the
business a bad agent say ok and I can
cancel the room so this is the business
rollback but you cannot roll Barry
transactions you can roll back the tea
business transaction this is I think the
best way to deal with something like
this the next one is interesting so this
really one of the ax attendees and he
brought me a couple of images again
early no time to answer this but I will
answer it on on the X and it's a
composite key and the composite key and
the composite key does not work with the
columns are nulls some of the columns
are not wise the case and this is a
really interesting case and if a search
for it I thought there's something in
the spec which prevents this but
actually and null it is not equal to
null in your database so the problem is
if you have a composite key with null
columns it is really depending on the
database it depends on the database
whether you can find anything if one of
the column is null and I think this is
the main problem behind and then found
any any mentioning of not null composite
key so from the jpa perspective it seems
to be valid from the sequel and database
perspective is more problematic so then
I question how could you structure your
web application to keep one code base
for several customers each with their
own customization so this is always a
problem so what I would do is I just
copy and paste there's a whole thing and
then over time find the right
abstractions and abstract them or just
keep copies of this this really depends
how many customers do you have and what
I wouldn't try to attempt to do is to
create a framework from right from the
beginning because usually you don't you
know too little about the business
domain to find the right abstractions so
um and you know the question is a little
bit too too too general but usually one
copy is okay so keep them separate per
customer then see what it is actually
worse you know to generalize something
because if you do make everything
abstractly to get just another
additional you know the enterprise
framework which is crazy complex and and
and cannot be used by no one but but the
author so um this is what I would say
and of course if there is something in
common I will try to extract services
like jax-rs services and then you will
get micro services for free so I would
prefer to use
Sarus communication over shet classes is
of course it really depends what it is
right if there are just JP entities is a
really bad idea to and to create for
each entity a JAX direct service but I
would try to be able to create corset
services and then expose them via jax-rs
but again the question is too general
and n man's is also to general but and I
never try to find the right abstraction
from the beginning so this is I hope
clear and I think we got some additional
questions in the comments but i would
say i would just overthrow them to death
to the 13th edition of a hex because
there are multiple question in the
comments and some questions in the gist
gist and yeah we are almost one hour so
it's going to be too long so um by the
way was also interesting because i see
it i performed the first interview with
a start startup cop typic typic camp and
it was actually very very what surprised
me a very very popular so i got about
six thousand views in two days or
something so for for a singular article
is a lot at least in my block and and I
there are several more interviews in the
pipeline if you are involved in our lean
java ee 7 project or java 6 a-7 project
or java ee projects or a start-up think
about it son drop me on twit or whatever
if you like I could interview you as
well okay so thank you for watching and
see you an upcoming conferences
workshops so um there are multiple
workshops and I got an idea or this
couldn't just as this is very new
building java apps from scratch this was
actually requested by several a hex
attendees and they and what i try to do
this is inversion of control so we will
think about an java application all
together and then i will let to code you
the app and i will just help you with
questions i'll go around the whole time
I want code at all I would just try to
find errors in your code and help you to
implement the application you can ask me
a question and if and I will try to
challenge you so this was the idea of
the new workshop just one day and the
the problem is i had no x we are just
shorten the workshops but there was so
many requests for the testing ones there
was one you know standalone testing
workshop and javi so it was in the past
also very popular so thank you for
watching and see you soon and some
questions are over flown to to the 13th
edition of EXO thank you and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
