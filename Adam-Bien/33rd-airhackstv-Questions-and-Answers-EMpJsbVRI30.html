a hex TV and with really hot drama so 10
minutes ago so what happened so there we
have in germany and the sun conference
organizer coughed called software and
support and what i did they confuse me
with yun-harla and they publish that and
this basically me so i don't know from
where they have the picture but it's
actually me and some conference I assume
jacks or w jacks and what this is it
says like in 2017 there will be like
revolutionary spring 50 framework not
revolutionary and reactive spring five
of framework with reactive streams and
classic server and embedded runtime and
and JDK 19 support and the funny story
is that's me consultant author and you
can hit you can register or you can yeah
register to the conference with that and
I've actually I'm not a spring
committees or they just confuse me with
with Jordan but by the way indeed Spring
Framework 50 is going to be interesting
because they do a lot of reactive stuff
they really thinking transactions right
now so it is going to be interesting but
I got lots of you know there is a like
Twitter storm happened right now like
Adam beam is the spring evangelist I am
not working for for spring source I'm
just a consultant and most of my
projects or I would say this year only
project were actually Java is seven and
java 8 and spring sometimes I work with
spring if it's a older project but what
we start what we are starting or what I
started was Java 7 but still spring 5 is
interested in interesting and it was a
interesting also funny glitch okay so
endo via happens so let's start with the
content so lots is going on in chat and
there isn'ta sebastian apologize for the
mistake so don't worry
just funny and I thought someone
photoshop me this was my first suspicion
okay so we have lots of topics first
Java 8 news so what happened so there
will be no GMS next but the GMS to
always going to be part of the Java 8
it's not like there will be a new
updated spec it will be become just a
part of that so what I actually did I
sent and male with a suggestion to to
actually duplicate soap so am I thinking
so was not updated for years in Java and
I think this what I mean is jax-ws and I
think if you if you listen to the show
you should just write you know to the
Java EE user list and try to drop soap
this would be really nice also for
argumentation in in Java EE projects
like now don't rely on duplicated
technology what also happened so Oracle
woke up so there is an early draft of
the Java 8 spec so I would just put it
to the chat and and it's basically it's
just the first the first edits so it's
not like everything is new and and what
also happened the management spec was
dropped which is a pity am I was a bit
involved in the management spec so I
just reviewed the reference
implementation from redhead last year
and and it's a problem I see with that
is the following it's like no developers
is interested in management because what
do you like to do is to implement
business logic as fast as possible or
this is actually what what should happen
and managing server it is not an
interesting job and this is actually and
DevOps job so I think you know asking in
a survey whether developers are
interested in in in management is a
little bit officer the same like no car
manufacturer will ask you whether you're
interested in measuring pressure in the
tires or whatever I know is as boring
zone 01 by a car because of of
management interface of a car so this is
a pity and and why it's pity because
what we could do then
is just to use you know to standardize a
bit on monitoring matrix and and
management and oh and and and for
instance in dhaka environment you can
you can automate the setup of
application so about this a bit pity but
yeah but I understand Oracle then don't
have indefinite resources or they have
focus on whatever can be done but this
is a pity and what's also interesting
interested happened oracle could good is
interested to pass over the MVC spec to
an organization which is actually and
the first time i heard about this and is
actually nice because someone else could
take over the MVC spec so a model view
controller spec the new spec so there
there there will be you know the next
release of MVC so this is what happened
in the java ee in the l actually this is
a this is my my email so um i wrote that
they should rather prune soap then then
JJ ms but um ok so uh this was I didn't
actually I didn't meant prune here like
you know there is no Gemma's next so
this was unfortunate wording here okay
so this one and what also happened there
is a new Jason be in the clips link they
are going to be split and there will be
going to be a new project eclipse
project with Jason bindings and let what
we have was the JSONP like Jason
processing the JSON parsing rather than
binding JSON object to a JSON object to
java objects it's like Jack's beep
specifically for Jason and this is the
project got the project yes'm so I would
just copied this so if you like you know
help me to prune soap this would be nice
now go to javi and say we have to prune
soap okay yeah and there's also a quick
update as the efficient use with
management and as always we get
greetings from Greece so hello to Greece
I hope is warm in Greece in Germany we
have minus degrees Celsius minus sizes
degrees I'm really I'm really
interesting how warm or cold is in
Greece so we have that and now start
with the with the first question so I
just make a little bit larger so in
someone asked me they are interested in
commercial distribution and what did you
choose lock or splunk and this is really
hard for me you know to to suggest the
commercial commercial solution this look
io is it's like hosted elk and plunk is
I would say the origin idea commercial
service which is able to consume a large
amount of log files and consume that and
so which solution you you think's fits
the best and and I have to say it is
really hard to compare because yeah once
it's based on the open source elk and
the other one is the origin splunk
service and it is really what I think it
does not matter what you use from the
commercial point of view because what
happens in one of the companies goes off
the bill out of the business this is the
first do you have some compliance you
know some compliance requirements where
you have to keep know the audited data
for years or whatever what happens then
so there are lots of you know
requirements we would have to walk
through the first thing I will ask you
know what you are so what do you would
like to start there just are the No
unstructured locks what I know that this
Blanc is really very good in extracting
information from unstructured locks or
your locks are probably already
structured so um what you could do is
just to to focus on on on on storing you
know streams or text us event of streams
yeah streams of events so at teched
event so structured data and so this
would be this would be one of my of my
my further questions
and what I also don't get is why it has
to be a software-as-a-service so so what
you could do now you could just use elk
out of the box in a docker container
what we do in our project so so this is
a broader question and what's also
interesting you know we have to separate
like streaming or events or logging and
and metrics like you know you can deal
with Prometheus or nat geo nagios stuff
like this so um what's also not clear
would you like to buy a soft as a
service and and and and send the locks
remotely or rather than you know by this
software run it on premise is also also
important distinction okay so um half
have big question but elk or splunk so
elk is a recognized tag with lots of
support and splunk is known for years
and yeah so you you already on the right
path i would say so the next one is like
a meter question and someone asked me
about promotion code so actually i don't
give any promotion codes for for DM this
is asking about the online courses so NX
dot io yeah x dot io this is the online
version so these are why not because i
try to be as cheap as possible so you
can you can run them for ten ten dollars
or buy it HD for thirty nine dollars and
you know managing ddd codes would be a
terrible exercise for me I always spend
a ton o a lots of time or with that and
I think and also for the phone the
on-premise courses I also don't give Reb
any any discount as well here it is one
of the my because i think is really
competitive so then i try to in order to
keep TD prices down and then have no
head ages about management and managing
the rabbits codes and you know then I
will have probably have to hire presale
department and this is what I actually
try to avoid and still focus on on
technology and hacking
so no no discount codes and as far i
know it's also not possible to offer
bundles from vimeo so and yeah and if i
will offer you know the discounts it
would be unfair to some users is really
a mess i would say so we covered this so
a bad way because we are already in the
virtual mode i had we had to upgrade the
room so the largest room because we get
some some registrations and so right now
they we get we got the largest available
room on the airport Munich so if you
like to come come next week so no next
week just start as December twelfth
there's enough room for everyone right
now so um yeah and of course in March
there will be some JavaScript going on
and the next bunch of workshops a thing
is going to be in april or may have no
time before and there will be one new
workshop like monitoring matrix
measurement debugging profiling and
troubleshooting ok so now workshops are
over ten to one is interested so the
question is about application scoped and
stateless so when to use oh when these
applications coped and when to use
stateless so and it seems like there are
two layers resources and service layer
and application scope is rest in the
services stateless i would actually just
put the stateless at the resources and
lift the service without any annotation
or put at stateless on the service
annotation because it looks like and
then he asked is it correct to use
application scope in bins that insert
objects into MongoDB and the answers it
really depends which driver using
because applications code means all the
threads will hit the one driver at the
same time so you will need a kind of
transaction scoped injection or request
scoped injection of T of the MongoDB
driver or the driver is already
multi-threaded so I think the safest
thing would be if you don't like
stateless and you would like to get rid
of monitoring just use request scoped if
you like
if you if you have nothing against ejbs
just use stateless and by the way just
remember github some or lease off so ejb
versus CDI so a nice guy from IBM and he
compared each obese with CDI and each
obese and EG beasts were as fast as the
others and and why that because all the
dependency injection tree was actually
cached okay so uh the answers resources
has to have to be a request code or at
stateless and services has to be
stateless and application scope is
exception from the rule and usually I
use application scope for another
configuration caching and stuff like
that okay so any questions from the
field no questions here no questions
here okay exception factor is an
exception pooling so I twitted once ago
that I spotted in a code review
exception interface an exception factor
which was funny and then I remembered
that I actually implemented by myself an
exception factory and and the reason was
interested so um this was like a bank or
a huge insurance in something like this
and what we did back then is the
following I remember there was an beg
and mainframe system and host and the
house was available from nine to five
and after five did something else so we
couldn't access the hose we would get a
different kind of exceptions like host
not available exception something like
this and what I did then I created an
exception factory which depending on the
on the on the current time was able to
throw different exceptions and I think
the went from production was no more
time dependent rather than exception
depending zone specific exceptions were
converted to system exceptions and the
other one to application exception but
this is really exception from the rule
and what I spotted it in the code review
was like someone tried to make no
exceptions and decoupled way of throwing
exceptions like throws exception
interface and it could make a modular
exceptions though it could replace the
implementation of the exception okay so
this is I implemented an exception
factory once but I hope the the reason
was yeah what specific reason okay so
the next one is this is interesting is
this Java Vic's which runs on spring
boot and what what the problem is there
is like a model window and there is a
long long along the task going on behind
the scenes and it blocks the window what
you do and take a look at light fish
this is if you go to my github account
github light fish exactly and the light
fish comes with light view client and I
would what it does there are several
they were several several long running
tasks the whole note several long
running tasks TM the communication with
the back end is asynchronous so look
what I did there and i use the i think
how it's called a fix invoke later and
so what do you have to do is on your
case i will take a look on completa be
future computable future in java 8 so
you do the long-running task first and
then without blocking and then you
passing the results to the view but
indirectly indirectly means with with
wrapped with the gfx invoke later and
actually if you if you look at the
afterburner framework it already does it
for you so i would just go to
afterburner of hopefully no
okay and I hope we will find that let's
see invoke with a no change but there is
an asynchronous way of elegance
interested whether i will find that no
this was the presenter factory and views
so to take a look at afterburner or on
unlight fish and you will i can just
take cannot do this i see we have some
trouble with the internet connection so
and this is what I'm actually doing so
I'm instead she a ting the views
asynchronously and then the result is
going to be passed 2d 2d 2d java fix
update threat and this is very similar
approach to swing invoke later and in
java vixter is the same class called
like Jay fix utilities or something
which invokes the which passes the data
to the view using the EU I threat okay I
hope so i'm i'm actually what I cannot
do it just cannot fix your code so i
have no time for that but if you look at
a light view this is a asynchronous and
look at the after burner it is already
capable of updating give you behind the
scenes okay then there was a long a
longer discussion with suffix you to
this evil so oh wow it will almost 10k
views and and someone asked me what's so
bad about a kitchen sink so actually if
you know in my opinion nothing is really
bad or wrong in soft development but if
you
whatever we do that there should be a
reason otherwise there will be a cargo
cult and cargo cult is funny so if I
have the opportunity you always cargo
cult programming so this I show it
already several times during the ax and
this is kyra card program style of
computer programming characterized by
the ritual inclusion of code or program
structures that serve no real purpose
yeah this is what it is cargo cult and
the question list if okay let's take it
seriously here the cargo cult what
actually means you too and what I did I
performed several code reviews this year
and usually you know packages you till
packages obvious they are really bad so
if you look at Java util there's
everything in place so there are so you
know usual you get util foundation
whatever you get lots of packages with
the names which are meaningless and and
then I started to look at classes and
what I the recognizer also lots of
classes which ends with you till and I
thought okay what this actually means so
if i put a util on the class on end of
the class what does it which information
information does provide and actually
nothing so I would say it would be a lot
better and I'll just skip the YouTube
and then you will get a class which is
usable it in the name of the class would
be like for instance java.lang math the
class math is a utility class but there
is no Matthew tool so if you will call
the class Matthew to do we know it
additional information so just saying
something is util it means it degrades
the class to something you know a
throwaway quality which which comprises
a lots of methods which are properly
probably not cohesive so there I have
nothing to do with it with each other
and this was the reason why we call
something you too and what I also did
then I became curious and I try to find
you know classes in jdk so
and which is surprising okay now okay
now is exactly there are just at eight
classes with you two in their names so
what I would recognize and this is
remarkable because there are four
thousand two hundred to two hundred
forty classes and exactly eight have the
util name which is remarkable so um you
know I was in project with less classes
than 4,000 there are lots of you two
classes so I would say you two is not a
best practice and I try to avoid util
all together no packages with you too
and no classes with you too I hope you
are with me so and if you if you name it
util you can do it but the question is
why so questions here no questions no
questions here interesting is an old
interview with one of the ax attendees
and becomes really popular so like the
breaking parts here with brake parts for
cars with Java EE ok so we covered this
topic the next one okay no viewed in the
future so and this one is done easy one
how to configure gdb see data source in
the pie are configured dock onto
container what is PI are configured so
I'm first there isn't project called
Docklands on github and just for you
what I did today you will find a new
image if you're interested ingenix image
image and with Tommy load balancing if
you are interested but now he asks and
so what is Docklands docklands is a as a
set of dhaka files i use frequently my
projects and this dhaka files are as
simple as possible and or are based on
the super java a docker file and the
reason for this is I try to keep you
know the docker images very small and
this this project written with that so i
extracted the dock advice from
commercial projects on extracted rewrote
in actually from scratch and yeah and he
asked me okay there is a payara image
and there's para configure and the idea
of pyara configures you know
provide to provide project specific
settings like here for instance i'm
creating some JVM options that equation
is no imagine we would have we would
like to have GD bc datasource and how to
deal with that and the answers it is
actually done and not in the configured
rather than then in the payara pink so
what i did here i added the pink war to
the image here and of course i did it
into edited to the deployment there what
you should do you will have to download
for instance the postcode strive and add
it to a glassfish lip and then you can
just you know create the datasource and
if the yeah this is this is the DD
answer so i will just put it to chat so
this is your answer cool so we have that
so is it but it's better to run the
database in a docker container or on the
host it is a lot better to run it in a
docker container if you can run it if
you have the control why it is really
easy to test so you can just launch you
know the database you just you know take
the data and run it in a test
environment integration environment that
so this is really nice this is perfect
and and also you can use toca networking
so what you can do then you can just
rely no on exposed part which never will
change and the docker container names
you can it's a lot easier to implement
stage environment if the case the
database is running in dhaka container
as well what i recommend if you can of
course have have one application per
micro service or replication is the best
a shared database it is it will cause
and adjust their there is no advantages
of having a shared database so it is
harder to scale harder to maintain and
harder to upgrade so so thank you nikki
so where do you save
acha images which cannot be public so
this is actually very easy to answer so
I save them in the private doctor
registry so Dhaka minus D minus our arm
minus P 5,000 5,000 and what we can do
you can run now docker run launched the
registry reg is 3v2 oh I can didn't pull
it right a second I don't think now
there's a fresh duck installation so
there is no but the registry v2 if you
if you perform this registry to actually
this one so um I don't actually know
it's still not too late but internet is
still going but we're what you will and
it pulls the the private doctor registry
and we just have to stop that other ones
and there will be problem with the
stream so this one will pull the doc a
registry private doctor registry you can
use it to store your daughter images and
what you should know I think next three
and artifactory they all have Dhaka
support and if your company is using
something like red hat enterprise linux
they have so-called satellites which
also store private dock images so i have
to say the doc a registry private doctor
registries as well integrated to
enterprise as a nexus service ok cool so
next one dry principle single object for
saving in the database in the safe
object and the same object I guess same
object return via rest output and the
problem is some some things some some
fields should not be transferred over
the wire and the question is what to do
with that so you can use Jason ignore
with Jackson of course you could wait
until Java 8 of course it's just not
available
and what I do with that I have to say
more and more what I do in my project I
use jsonp right now to expose the
objects via rest so we have no details
just entities and if you for instance
use elastic search then we have just a
java classes if we have some behavior
otherwise we use Jason from from the
beginning to the end and this is what i
would suggest and of course you can be
dependent on Jackson so then you will
use Jason ignore but if java 8 comes out
then you can replace that with we see
standard annotation the next one which
management mechanism do i use for cues
and surprisingly this question was asked
i was asked a lot of times last two
weeks actually in all projects I don't
know why he's like everyone asked about
queuing and my first question is okay
why we need queuing at all so usually
the reasoner's we have like payment
system or order system and what we
actually need from GMS is deliver once
and only once quality this is why we
need queuing for other purposes in my
world so again i'm not at Facebook
Netflix or Twitter so we adjust in our
lower scale applications so I just using
jax-rs where everything is perfectly
fine but in we have in one projects with
no chat is becoming nervous okay so we
can follow up question and and in one of
my project we have lots of we are going
to be a massive amount of data and and
the data could be partially lost but we
at this like yeah and in this particular
case we will probably use Kafka in one
case and the other case we will use
hazel cast for instant hasil cast can be
also used as an as an in-memory grid or
infinite spin they both can be used as
communication medium between the notes
but I will stick with jax-rs
first and then it is not enough then you
know think about why we need queuing at
all could be for instance that some
micro services are not available all the
time when you will cue the stuff
Princeton something like this then you
will need a persistent Q so the question
is will you look just like you know to
communicate asynchronously do you have
to use persistent queues is this deliver
ones that only ones an issue and are
duplicates allowed for instance this is
the DD main main things ok so I hope I
answer that and the next question is how
to deal with foreign key so foreign keys
how to deal with foreign keys you will
have to use you will have to access the
other micro service and query it or not
to query it just invoke the service to
jax-rs so you get the n plus one problem
of course so you have to you have to do
it wisely so what it actually means in
micro servers are high-tech chetak or
micro services yeah or micro servers
architectures in can be only successful
in case you are really down you are
really experienced with the domain and
business logic so the technology does
not met a lot but you have to be skilled
in the business logic and domain target
domain if you notice you know you know
how to how to create micro services
which do not interact a lot with each
other and don't share joints for
instance okay perfect so we have this
and does what happens here okay um ok
Q's done
so what's going here ah this is okay the
question is know how to how to have
rolling updates with with daca and I
hope you to a damping you should look at
the video take a look at the video
something with H approxi load balancing
java ee microservices so we just put it
to the to the chance
so and what what what i did i just
created an HD proxy started to java
e-service it was pyara and then I killed
one server and restarted the servers or
if you just have the setup going and if
this is a che environment usually you
will get to AJ proxies and 442
microservices and unusually hardware
load balancer in front of them and then
if you just kill or service the AG proxy
will recognize this and read out all the
traffic to the other one and you can
have of course in all force
microservices you know not limited to
have to have to so you can have as many
as you like and and and what happens
then well you can just you know kill the
DD services introduce a new one and what
you can also do so look at the go to and
take a look at the screen cast you could
actually connect and disconnect the
micro services in the running systems
you can launch a micro service kill the
old one and then in the next millisecond
to know replace it with the new version
so rolling updates are fairly easy you
can automate this and of course if you
have one and one server it it is viable
but if you get you know 2,000 service
like Twitter or Netflix you need
infrastructure in my project we are not
Netflix we have a couple of micro
services so not a big problem with that
and it's a little bit larger take a look
an open shift in do it nicely integrates
for instance Cuban it is which is able
to to use to use running updates with
tagging so Cuban eighties is the next
stage just stay with plain Dhaka if this
does not work for you take a look at
cuban it is and open shifts for instance
provides a nice of you to this cool the
next one is project lombok and kudos to
the project actually it isn't a very old
project and they are still active and
what project lombok does it tries to you
know makes the java development nice
sir so what Lombok does you have a
couple of annotations you put the
annotations on on fields and is able to
generate getters and setters for
instance getters and setters or two
string method or whatever and the
question isn't know what is my take on
that and as I said at the beginning most
of my project are java ee projects and
in java projects we we just focus on the
business logic so for instance a builder
pattern is already not as common in in
in in Java I did it once in in our view
times for instance in porcupine project
so there is a builder pattern but
usually is this more like if you're
building infrastructure builder pattern
is more common because with Bill de you
give the developers opportunity you know
to use your object a little bit nicer in
in real-world projects and build a
pattern is not as common for instance
get us some citizen actually not needed
in Java so if you have you can use
injection to private fields jpa can just
deal with private fields in Jack speak
and deal with private fields or getters
and setters are fully optional so and
therefore I neither use blonde bock nor
ed plugins and try to write as lean code
as only possible and the next thing is
what is interesting the deal on book
project is what you could actually do
you could use an OD lombok and deal on
bug which will regenerate actually
generate the aerial Java code which
could be an interesting procedure so um
yeah so I think project lombok is a
really interesting project and I don't
use it in production or nor in my
leisure and yeah and I tried it look
nice but I don't think I would be a
significantly faster with lombok than
without and if you really would like to
have you know you don't like Java
because you have to write lots of
getters and setters first I will have to
consider you know rethink your design
and the next thing is properly you could
use no another different programming
language on the JVM so then you say okay
because yeah and it is
not natural to Java in order to have
something which works behind the scenes
and particularly no in the at the
beginning there was some I had some
issues with maven because it generated
you know the sources now there's behind
the scenes and yeah but right now
everything is fixed but still so so the
answer is I don't use lombok and the
opinion is right lean code and and and
then I think you you won't be
significantly more productive with
lombok you shouldn't be but if you have
crazy architects and they require you
know to write older older plumbing then
lombok could be you know the the prodigy
of productivity okay so currently
evaluating different content technology
so we have docker and now we have Dhaka
and rocket and run sea and the question
is why you have chosen dhaka instead of
rockets at first I have chosen Dhaka
because there was no rocket in place so
I think I using docker for several as it
was 106 or 05 uses the one even the file
system became corrupt so I use already
dhaka back ten and a rock and rocket
came later and i think dhaka is far more
popular right now then rocket so in
there for us to use docker but if dhaka
and everyone knows doctor rockit i have
to explain that this is actually
something from core OS and and and and
based on common standard but yeah this
is doc i use in production all my
clients are using docker if they using
container virtualization and i know that
people are evaluating rocket and yeah it
will properly track as well so for me
there is no need to evaluate right now
because you know dhaka ships out of the
box with open shift all the clouds are
providing doc I know ecs comes with Daka
out of the box so this amazon this
Amazon Elastic containers so um yeah but
this is the reason ok so let's see what
happens here
okay no questions here no questions here
so I think we are done so there was just
this time it was a short 1i bought
microservices today for my birthday so
thank you for free to you and so then
hello to Brazil Paris USA and and Greece
and see you on upcoming workshops
conferences travel user groups so I'm
this week and Java user group darmstadt
and just for you keep it secret end of
year in Hamburg as well but I was I
promised the organizer I won't tell
anyone should be like a private meeting
so but you know you belong to Java
family so why not and yeah and yeah I
think this is the last of the year right
so yeah so a see you in 2017 in January
of 2017 so thank you for watching see
you at a hex end bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
