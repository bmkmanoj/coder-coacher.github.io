would like to show you how to docker
eyes a Java EE project so um we need a
simple Java project first so we'll
create one call it I will create it from
the maven template and let's call it
Docs so as and it comes with the Jax or
s configuration already so I only would
like to create a simple class a simple
resource and call it messages resources
such as resource and then yes I messages
and then string message gat
hello Daka so let's say it's array so
messages should be multiple messages but
it does not matter
so hello Daka as a string and now I
would like to dr. eyes the project so
how to do this now so I would like to
rely on Docklands project because it
already comes with nice layering and
what it basically means is I have here a
image for payara and it already exposes
and and deployment der environment entry
as well as whitefly for instance and the
white fire image exposes the same
deployment there and there are two
examples payara or white light pink so
if I go for instance to payara pink
you'll see that it inherits from a hex
PI are configured this configured is
fully optional so it just comes with
project specific settings but and this
itself inherits from payara and this pi
are pink it only comprises one liner
here and it basically says at
pink dot wore to deployment there and
pink is the project name or the war name
so let's do this
so then what I would like to do is go
here and say new other should be Dhaka
file and just say from this is which
server to choose and instead saying pink
war our project is dogs it's going to be
dogs war but the project usually resides
in target so this should be enough so
let's try to build us city ducks so
maven clean install this will create the
the target so there is the docs project
and docker built ministy AIX docks this
is going to be the name and the current
current file so I'm do it again it's
faster why was it slow because it pulled
the first time the images from from from
the Docklands and it took a while but um
if we change something let's say hello
docker and just redo so this is the
usual performance so it takes around 100
milliseconds ok doesn't at all now try
to start it so I would say docker run in
detach mode - P and 8080 should be free
on my machine - - name docks and this is
going to a hex docks is the name of the
image so the image is start I started
docker locks
docks as you can see is already started
and now let's see whether it actually
works so I would just like to start it
Chrome and local host 8080 ste payara
and dogs resources dogs resources
messages I think and we have hello Dhaka
and interesting EDD old version so what
I forgot is to say maven clean install
usually create a small shell script
which does that and then we can rebuild
the docker then of course this was this
what it takes to create a fresh image
then I would like to kill dogs docker
remove dogs and restart dogs where is it
yeah and now we should have still not
deployed
no here's it hello Daka was so it was
deployed and started so um now let's say
I would like to use whitefly instead of
payara so now let's kill kill dogs and
remove the dogs so the only thing we
changes is the reference here so instead
of using PI are configured I would like
to use white flight out of the box not
configured and of course I will have to
rebuild the project so just rebuild the
project so it's built you see from a hex
white line so it's no more para and then
I would like to run the project dr. Lach
stocks so this is white lie not payara
and this is the response from white red
right now
and we can look at this white lie yeah
it's white fly it was cached by the
browser again so as you can see white
lie and white lie and payara and Tommy
so Java in general is perfectly capable
as a as a micro service in the micro
service environment because of the
built-in layering and thank you for
watching and see an upcoming conferences
workshops or even a hexade mini care
port so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
