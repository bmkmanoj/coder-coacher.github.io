create a greetings microservice so I
will start with the first module and
this could be even a milli service and I
will call it happy and this will just
comprise let's start with the dockerfile
of course it has to run on dakka and the
dockerfile arm will use Tommy Tommy 7
and i will copy the am happy service
this is in target happy that war into a
deployments just deployment there and
these this image comes from docklands
just take a look at my github account
project at auckland's so now it should
be deployed and we need a little bit of
business logic so let's create a
component so this is called happy
boundary greetings resource and I will
expose that as greetings greetings of
course lowercase and greetings
can't and return hecky so we have that
and this should be of course I need you
be a little bit monitoring so it's like
that and then another Millie service and
I call it new year and we can actually
copy the dockerfile the only difference
is there should be new year so
convention of a configuration is good
and what I would like to do is to create
here another file called com a hex New
Year boundary greetings resource aim
ronk project so now we have it
and no package unfortunately servos calm
air hex hex New Year boundary boundary
so now it is in the right package it's
in the right package with the right
syntax so first I will have to learn
Java then use Java but finally in works
path and this should be greeting and
stateless string greeting cat and here i
will return 2017 so good enough so 2017
ok so what we can do now we can create
of course a Christmas a Christmas
framework framework network toka network
create or Hecky even better name hecky
so we have the heck in network and then
i will go to New Year and say da cab
first may even clean install and then
docker built Minister minus T and call
that a hex new year new year and run it
so now it should build the whole app
what actually happened and now it could
actually run this stalker run minus T is
d th road and let's actually use even a
port it's not necessary but just for
test purposes new year and the name is
going to be as a name but it was an ex
new year this is the image name so it
runs docker PS so if it runs toca looks
new year so it's deployed and so let's
see localhost 8080 this is our Tommy new
year it was resources and it should be
greetings a new year greeting greeting
so arm should be mark more consistent
with the naming in 2017 so this is
greetings and greeting but it's okay so
i will have just to remember the early
okay now ah the heck II resource or the
heavy resource would like to access to
another micro servers or how to do that
so what I will do I will create a first
method in it and here i will establish
the communication so client build a new
client so we have our client
and this is the client then one can add
the Ori and the Ori is not a local host
it should point to a new year to New
Year the then I can return here my
target
so it looks good and then I would like
to return your message and this is going
to be this target request get and just
use string return that's all so now you
can say okay cool this message so we
have the communication established the
new year is already running with the
name new year hopefully so dope yes it
is new year perfect so now we can build
the um so just double check that so this
looks good news greeting okay and this
should peak just to greeting for
consistency okay greeting greeting
greeting okay now let's go to the happy
and let's build and maven actually we
can reduce that it's the same the only
difference is they should be happy so
the only thing is if we look into the
doctor network dr. network inspect Hecky
it's empty so what should happen we will
add local network connect hecky new year
to that and now the new years in the
network so now let's launch you have to
choose a different port be happy and i
will just launched it in the right
network so just do that so seems to run
so both are running happy new year and
let's go here and i think the port was a
ch2 h2 resources and happy happy
greeting three think so and as you can
see we have hacky 2017 to microservices
deployed on Tommy fool so it's a full
java 7 compliant but not certified
server so it contains all the features
and to micro services are running in
Dhaka at the same time so I wish you
happy new year and have a lot of fun
with java java of course and don't
forget you know one of the resolution
list simplify the code base and delete
as much code dependencies and java
source is only possible so so thank you
for watching the whole year watching the
x and see you probably an upcoming
conferences ax TV the first monday of
the month or even munich airport
workshop so thank you and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
