would like to show you how to write and
read pojos without any annotations which
plane java and you could do this even
starting with jdk 14 so i would like to
introduce a simple domain object and
this domain object is of course our Duke
and the Duke is javabeans or what it
means in some properties like language
and H and we need also a convenience
constructor for our purposes because we
are lazy and we need a default
constructor for javabeans purposes and
some property accessors as well so we
have our Duke and we would like to write
our Duke to a disk so how to do this and
I would like to introduce an XML app
class which represents our application
and what I would like to use is XML
encoder and this class was introduced in
jdk 14 and koda and what it expects is
newegg new xml encoder you can also use
the auto closeable file output stream
and new file and the file is Dube dot
XML and we have to input the file and we
have to throw the exception so now we
can say right object here and the object
is our Duke so Duke language Java and a
Chavez very young too and then I could
flash the encoder so now it should be on
disk so I can run the app and no no news
or good news and now try the reverse so
i would need to xml xml decoder and I
call the decoder equals new XML decoder
and what I need is the input stream new
fileinputstream and the input stream is
the is we need a file with Duke to the
XML and then we can say decoder read
object and what we expect is our red
object and this should be the Duke again
so what do you would would be nice to
have on the Duke is the following to
string so run file and you can see we
got our Duke back so um let's look at
the file how it looks like so if we go
here you see the formulas a little bit
strange and if you look closely what
actually happen is you will probably
understand what what what happens behind
the scenes so the runtime it creates the
object behind the scenes and invokes the
getters and setters so you can see this
so what we could do for instance we can
even set a breakpoint here at the addy
language level and then you will see
that it will actually going to be
invoked so our debug file so as you can
see the runtime is invoking the set
language with javis drink so I'm enjoy
xml and java and c you at erics admin
