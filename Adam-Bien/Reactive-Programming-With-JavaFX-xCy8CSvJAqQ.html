would like to explain a cool concept
called reactive programming so in Java
you would just use an expression like or
would like to compute the expression
with B plus C equals a so in Java it
will be computed once and whenever
changes whenever B or C changes you will
have to manually re restart the
computation and reactive programming it
looks very like the same except there is
a whenever B or C changes the expression
it gets automatically re-evaluated and
assigned to a and the cool thing is it
is already built into Java fix so I
would like to start with very little
maven project created by igniter so
maybe an archetype I would use the
recent version is 88 and I would like to
demonstrate this to replicate the
Wikipedia project with Java fix react
reactive FX and I use the project
because it comes already with a fix ml
built-in and I would like to fix ml to
create the two text fields bound to the
expression so let's try this I would
like to use the symbol ax and the output
of the computation I would like to put
to the label so I will have to name the
label I think what was it it was a so I
will use it a just a label and then I
will need two text fields so just the
first one and the name is I think B they
are being and the next one is C so um UI
is done now we have to only implement
this so the label was a what we need are
two fields
this was textfield B and textfield C so
and we don't need this but more
importantly we need integers integer
property I would say B number and C
number and the computation what we can
do right now we can say P number add C
number and Java fix comes with
high-level binding which actually comes
with some some arithmetic operations and
the a a label L the value of neighbor a
label a is a text property we would like
to bind to to a number at C number the
problem is we have to convert them to a
string property first so we are done
actually so this is exactly what what
was stated in Wikipedia text property of
of label a is bound to the result of B
number added to see number what I have
to do I have to transfer the value from
text fields to a number which is a
little bit harder but doable so find
bi-directional B number dot text
property no sorry this is B dot text
property text property binds to be
number and we have to use a converter
new number to string
converter so this looks great
and the same with C C and we are done so
we what do you only have to do we have
to build a project I would use - a shell
script created by the maven archetype so
it just fires up maven clean install but
using Java 8 and now the project is
built and now I would like to start the
application Java I - jar target reactive
Java fix app and let's write it
3 4 6 so actually we have built reactive
extensions reactive programming with
Java fix and the arrow you see here is
probably not pointer arrow and why it
happens is because we have if the text
is empty we get a null pointer so thank
you for watching and see you in one of
the upcoming conferences workshops or
even EAX worry actually deal on half a
day with Java fix so thank you very much
and see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
