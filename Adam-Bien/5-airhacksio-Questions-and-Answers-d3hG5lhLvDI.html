create a very simple project and the
project is going to be a web application
or even maven just a simple one state
full gateway and the pattern is
described in Java EE patterns in the
green book um so i will just switch to
the source code view so i will just open
the glass fish with java is even java 7
web profile we could use white flow
whatever it doesn't matter actually it
would even work with java java 6 so i
will like to start with GSF and the
problem is with this i would like to
show you the main benefit of java of
using java 7 application and stateful
applications and to demonstrate you this
i will just create a small example with
multiple pages and a single domain
object which is going to be attached to
do pages so and it is hard to explain
because for very simple application is
very easy to achieve this they got the
same goal with stateless applications
and the more evolved ido main logic
gates that they're easier and you will
see the benefits of stateful application
so let's see whether it actually works
so i will just run the application and
deployed on glassfish and if it works
would be nice hello from facelets nice
so I'm then i would like to start with
an entity and let's call this a a hex
session and package is going to become a
a hex skip the project the project could
be kuai why not business and business
what the package sessions and entity and
the ax session is going to be an entity
so I would like to import the entity and
what we need at least a view attributes
so I would like to use a name attribute
and a duration attribute and probably
the name let's say the name is an ID we
need a primary key at least one and
let's say I don't know whether we need
it or not but we just put a description
here so and then I would like to create
a constructor or actually constructor
with all attributes because ID is going
to be it's a business attribute so and
get us in set us this time this time so
we have the ax session and what we need
is the air hex gateway yeah hex gateway
and the gateway is going to be a
boundary boundary and of course we need
an ejb and it's going to be a stateful
one and a really strange one because
this one is going to be not
transactional so I will disable
transactions on purpose so so
transactions are this Oh transactions
are disabled I will just lead this so on
and of course i would like to inject the
entity manager and for this what we also
need as the persistence Oh default
constructors also great not great it is
necessary and what we need is the
persistence unit and we need to drop and
great everything just call the prot data
source doesn't matter take the default
one and now we have everything I guess
so we can inject the entity manager
right now so a.m. and we use addy
persistence context a notation but with
strange settings so um i would use the
type is extended and not transactional
which is somehow strange and i would
like to keep here the x
shun oh yeah hex session session so
let's do this and I would like to return
those the session and a method let's
call a hex session save or update next
session session and we will use the
method merge so entitymanager lurch
session and we have to remember this
session here and we can also return the
session so I think what we also need is
the safe method so safe and save has
transaction attribute requires new and
this is always empty so what what
happens here on safe the entity manager
will flash all changes to the database
regardless what happened so we don't
have to do merge to persist nothing it
is just just enough to do this so I'm
get session say for update and yeah this
is all we need I think anybody can also
do we can implement a method for free we
call this undo and what undo does is
this p m dot refresh and the session so
um looks nice hopefully you'll work so
and what we also need we need a class am
I will call this session presenter
session presenter and the session
presenter is not in the business here
rather than in the presentation tier or
layer
and the session presenter is going to be
a session scoped doesn't have to be and
doesn't even have to be session scope so
we can go with model and no it has to be
sorry it really depends whether it has
to be or not so if we put here the
session scoped attribute here as well it
d beam is going to be bound to this
session automatically which is actually
a good idea scoped session scoped yes
now it should also worked here without
the with request scope or stateless
session presenter and what we need here
is a method at inject a hex gateway
gateway and we would like to expose the
session so i will have to call this
public ax session yeah hex session get a
hex session with a little so and you
know how to implement this a return
gateway get session so we'll get the
current session and and and and what we
also need a method called safe public
object safe
and this will just invoke the method
safe and return null no no navigation
and a method on do with this gateway
undo return another almost done the only
problem is we get null first here which
which might be a problem because might
be it will be a problem because the
first time I will access a null so um
what I usually would do to create an
index presenter which create a session
first but yeah let's see how to how to
do a little bit later so I'm first I
would like to implement a form H form
and this form comprises a input text
which is which the value is index save
everything saving is crucial so index no
suggestions not index rather than index
is my default session presenter session
presenter a hex session and as you can
see I can just access for instance the
name here and for this reason I would
just create another presenter just to
create the accession first in the
database and then we can we can populate
it so i will need another present a new
Java class let's call this index and
this is going to be model a model and
we need an access to gateway as well a
hex gateway gateway and we need a method
in it which is post construct and here
we can create the ax session session and
this session equals new a hex session
and here so this is an exception from
the rule because our databases empties
when creating the whole application from
scratch constructor Oh guetta next
session so we get an empty one and we
need a method safe we need a method safe
which returns object safe and this is
actually easy this gateway say for
update session and return not now rather
than we need the next page and the next
page is going to be let's call the page
name because you would like to edit the
name so um what do we have here so no
index
index session name call this name
description description and duration
duration and of course a wonderful
breaks and big button save action so now
it is merged in the database it's not
entirely true it's not merge yet because
transaction not committed so we can also
put requires new here or just invoke
save afterwards I think in this case it
is easier or will be better just to
invoke save after afterwards it doesn't
really matter safe so now we need
another page and we call this the page
just F page name because of name because
of name here so we would like to go to
to spend some time on the next page and
I will just copy this to the name and
right here edit name and this is not
going to be this rather than ya ex
such session presenter sorry session
presenter and a hack session and name
and it will just copy this and this will
break now always the same here and here
so and here will leave the page and here
we can also put session presenters safe
and session presenter undo I think we
have under so nice arm so what happens
here it is saved and the session
presenter let's say navigates to the
next one and the next one is going to be
lets say duration so I'm with the same
story new page let's call it duration
and the duration page comprises the same
content as the name so this would I
where I can copy this so uh what I would
like to show you a basic flow and
imagine a complex domain object model
and on each page a part of the object
can be updated so this is actually the
whole point of stateful applications and
the interesting part is I'm just
exposing the domain object directly
without without any details and nothing
with it can be lazy loaded or not so it
is just just it's managed by the by the
entity manager and so this was undo
duration and just to show you I would
like to go back and I think I just can
say here back
so um hopefully we work so what we have
here index we use the somehow difference
presenter because we would like to
create the object first so an index
session name so an index will create the
entity which is not managed safe will
pass the entity to the entity manager
and it's going to be managed and safe
will commit a transaction and then we'll
end up in the name GSF and the name GSF
would be able to update the entity and
the message safe the method safe we'll
just committed transaction whatever
happened and we will end up being in the
duration or we can update the values and
just go back to the name I'm not sure
whether it is the right syntax but I
hope so so on now let's see whether it
works Oh index HTML page form must be
terminated by edge form H form must be
terminated by H form and I think it's
just a problem
looks nicer okay but then we have the
problem everywhere so this one this one
you see how wonderful XML is so and this
is also strange one this is also strange
one and this one so and now just retry
this and what I also forgot of course it
has needs to be implements serializable
because sessions coped common error a
stateful session it doesn't have to be
serializable but a sessions code has two
so now try this again and see whether it
works if it doesn't just imagine it work
so what i did i created a very simple
state full application name we called
life description 5th edition and
duration hopefully 50 minutes what I
don't believe anymore so safe and you
see we on the next page which is
prefilled with the values so we can
change it to very life and say safe and
now the transaction is aborted forearm
and why actually the attribute name of
class is mapped to a primary key column
oh of course okay my fault so just do it
again I cannot change the primary key of
course so named life description very
life duration 10 minutes safe extremely
life and duration 11 minutes safe ah so
but I come I can just change this to
nine go back doesn't work anymore so I'm
what just
the problem was in the last one duration
H form you see the next time i will
prepare an example would be profesh
better a little bit more boring so the
last time you will see the wonderful
state for applications or named monday
description very life duration 30
minutes safe very life Monday's which
can change the 20 minutes safe now we
are a last page very life which ad we
change to prepared works better back and
now i can click undo and what you see
and the contents are replaced by contest
from database and i would argue such a
thing so this is a very simplistic
application but imagine you have an
object object graph with entities with
behaviors and then stateful applications
become very easy to implement because
you don't need any facades use cases use
case for sales or whatever just expose
your to domain objects actually we spent
a thing at least three hours at the
regular ericsson munich discussing such
a kinds of applications and joe certain
certain application just are easier to
build win stateful way but then you of
course has to has to perform a lot of of
stress test because what can happen you
adjust the eustachian can consume too
much memory but um so I would just
wanted to show you how stateful
applications can feel like and and just
imagine how stateless application how
much code it will require to do to build
similar stateless application okay I
hope is a little bit clearer right now
and yeah I'm see whether we have any any
questions here no questions here and in
Twitter no question so everyone is
absolutely happy
with the with the with the example so
I'm the next one the next example is
boundaries intercommunication
restrictions in Java and interestingly
there was somewhere there was instead
Stack Overflow even discussion so let's
open this and there were questions why
communication between
boundaries.forbidden and the answer is
not a technical one so I'm so therefore
I would like to show you why I don't
like as a forbidden is nothing so I'm
actually you shouldn't be should be
never dogmatic in software development
but why I don't like it so I'm or I
don't get it so it's a following idea if
you get a use case so just use case user
stories or whatever is hot right now so
in the use cases for instance or a book
or a book or register to a veck shop or
I don't know go home then what it means
is each interaction between the actor
and the system the boundary is actually
a transaction why because the user
pushes a button or does something either
the user does something or not it cannot
perform half-and-half operation right so
it doesn't work that way so if it if the
user does this then it does this or not
so what it actually means each
interaction between the presentation is
actually not the user is the
presentation it can be rest jozef or
whatever so each interaction with the
backend requires a transaction which
actually happens to be a method here
method on a boundary and because each
interaction between the user and the
boundary is a result in a method there's
actually no way that this method could
call this method because
us what it would actually mean that the
user between performs to interactions at
once okay that's actually the reason why
cascading of boundaries doesn't make a
lot of sense from the business
perspective from the technical
perspective it would even work because
the boundary comes with default
transaction attribute which is required
so you could cascade boundaries but if
you have a boundary here any what would
like to reuse functionality between
boundaries what I suggest you rather to
do this and evoke this boundary directly
i would rather extract the interesting
part to a control and the boundary could
could call d control here okay so this
is actually the reason why I don't like
a boundary calling another boundary and
the like means if you if you would like
to do this just do it so nothing will
happen from the technical perspective
but I would rather say if if you if you
communicate a lot in this way something
is wrong with your with your component
structure okay so I hope it's clear
absolutely clear right now so if someone
likes just answer the question and stack
overflow and earn some credits points or
whatever you get okay i hope the
question is answered so i will just look
briefly the chat now pretty quiet which
is good news so um next one perfect the
next question is how to learn java SE
and e email from city this is one of the
eax attendee nice student and very eager
and this was a Java beginner and I get
the question a lot how to learn java SE
and e and so what I don't believe this
learning something from from books I
really like read books so I read lots of
books and I also read lots of books
about Java different books at the
beginning of both of JDK and actually
still accelerating java ebooks just for
fun but i would say a better approach is
to look at on your leisure and
or your hobbies I try to implement
something from from your hubby space it
could be I don't know running tracker or
DVD collection maintenance book or mp3
encoder decoder or whatever whatever
like and implemented with Java if you
like to learn java and be really
pragmatic so treated as an real-world
project so my own problem is my open
source project tried to tend to be a
little bit over engineered because it's
my playground and my commercial projects
are then rather boring or simplistic
which is a thing a good good good good
thing but if you would like to learn it
just just learn a minimal minimal java
ee amount of java or java SE and build
how it's called MVP minimal Viable
Product for you and you will learn a lot
and then read a book and improve it
constantly this is actually if you look
at my current github projects actually
what happens with my projects I think
this is the most effective way to learn
Java or whatever you would like to learn
just do it and forget about you know
courses and even the X so if you have
them questions i come to EDX and ask the
questions but it is actually not not
required to learn java java and java SE
r are very simple technologies and you
know it's different story if you if you
if you have would like to learn
encryption or or assembler programming
but Java and Java is pretty pretty
simple just do it and implement
something and implement something from
your hobbies space so this was what i
would suggest and actually there were
several a hex attendees there were no
architects from major companies and
asked you asking interesting questions
why you need this knowledge as an
architect for the company and told me
actually and more than doing and
building and an real-time online game
with java ee and this is why i would
like to know this and it's not required
from the phone for my for my job at the
company's what happens a lot during the
ax show they're actually the most eager
students um okay i hope it is clear and
resources i would say
just do a simple thing and let it grow
and and then make it open source from
the beginning github they will learn
good and Oleg and don't be afraid to
know to expose there's a 28 to expose
you to D to the public so I would say
the java community is seems to be rather
nice this is actually my experience so
extrusion I think is extremely nice okay
thank you and now no questions even
better next one doesn't it versus java
so i wrote i think when was it five
years ago Java or.net and of course I'm
java developer and dotnet enthusiast I
would say and the question is what to
choose when or what is the difference
and my points were Java is more open
source and the net is more closed as a
what it actually means you get with two
net benefits because you just have to
look at msdn microsoft developer network
and you get whatever you need to to
understand this and in java there is
more choice but the problem is the
choice so you have to know evaluate a
lot of thing and it could be less
productive and what happens now the net
becomes more and more open and lots of
interesting projects are actually in
internet space and then c-sharp
programming language is excellent this
actually more more interesting
interesting than Java actually is but
the problem is is not backward
compatible so if you if you are if you
are large company and you're introducing
the net what can happen the next
versions of the net could break the
backward compatibility which is great
for developers not so great for for new
companies in Java is then this is
another problem is not or Java is not so
innovative like like dotnet but but is
backward compatible so but what I said
is it changes a lot and even the visual
studio become really great for web
development it is very comparable to
NetBeans
intellij which was not the case five
years ago so um my opinion is todd net
earned or java are great platforms and I
wouldn't consider the net a competitor
of java ee rather than you know no GS
and all the stuff or even PHP this is
which we have to compete with dot net is
just too similar to java ee so but it's
really interesting and microsoft opens
up and yeah it is really nice to see
that it actually happens okay this was a
esoteric one what is the state of java 7
so i'm adam wrote me an email to another
atom say okay what's what's the problem
with java 7 there is there is no major
application service supporting java 7
and he was deserved java 7 enthusiast
but it was a little bit concerned about
java 7 state of the union and i have to
say i was extremely positive about java
7 adoption in fact in several courses i
asked you know who uses j2ee 140 words
usually a few years ago there's the
majority use JJ 214 now really one or
two poor attendees and java if i was a
used about I would say ten percent of
the on the audience java 6 at the vast
majority and java 7 is used more than
java five so the adoption is great so
what about the application service so
white fly is excellent glassfish comes
out with his open source OS Java 7
support and java 8 support and the only
problem with glasses of course is no
more supported commercially by oracle
but is supported by the communities as
several companies provide support seat
to be too and lodge on provide support
for glass fish so on this is this is
nice Tommy they are working on support
for java 7 you know java 7 comes with
batch and JPA extensions and just takes
time to implement this and i think
websphere the wlp can also support parts
of java 7 but is not certified yet so
from my perspective it looks great so
I'm really as I was surprised how fast
my clients moved switched to Java 7 was
faster than either than ever
it took longer from j2ee 142 job I five
now it takes fast and faster because
Java 7 is similar to java 6 so there is
a no no no migration needed ok let's see
whether there are any questions no
questions Oh jks that this was a really
honest answer yes um doesn't it is nice
but i still like java a little bit more
why I have no idea I just just from the
beginning I was a huge Java fanboy
without knowing why I just was just I
was somehow magically attracted by
whatever java so um ok this is how to
say I'm not dear ask me hi Adam I just
wondered why jet visits rendered methods
more than one what is work around for
that actually knew that and we had the
problem in a project and I forgot
actually the Verger on that there is an
issue and i forgot the answer so um this
is what i can tell you i have to look it
up so sorry for this probably if someone
can answer this so just just go to chat
or answer those in the acts letting me X
in in chat so interesting one cancel
versus cancellation and when get and
post so our Frank wrote I think a
comment
and so far he refers to a session I gave
about restful a little rest with Jax
arrested was a conference session and
what he asked was that i mentioned don't
thinking and actions thinking resources
instead of using canceled use
cancellations and and what i don't get
is that what what if there is no
resource and he's argument is that if he
is talking i want the server to send our
test mate but even if you had the server
and you would like to send a test mail
mailee still a resource so it would
nothing will change so I would just
model like you know there will be not
you know sent mail so I would rather try
to think in resources what it could be
in mail I have no idea like no spamming
and like a protest not not to spam like
spamming clients and with this distance
and sense and I don't even know what the
substantive with of spamming users but
this was what I would search for in
restful webservices thinking resources
not in actions or methods and I'm more
interesting question is getting post are
widely not accepted but supported by
browsers now the question is what if put
and delete is not supported because of
you know proxy servers or whatever and
the answer is there is a workaround for
this and I actually wrote I think over 1
year ago short article it is java java 7
and Jack's Rs 20 so I will just post it
to chat and what what what is actually
the idea what you would do is you can
set a header with the name x HTTP method
override and say I'm sending a post but
then i would rather but this is actually
a a put or or delete and what you can do
in jax-rs you can you can implement
container request filter in the face
pre-matching so pre-matching means you
can you can with this filter still
perform and/or still execute a method
with with the which is annotated with
put or delete so with this filter you
can redirect the a post request to be a
put or delete request this is actually a
technical answer to the to the second
part of the question okay let's see okay
todo ventil gangoh five no yes gang of
five another interesting question what
do you would like to execute complex
queries in a control located at Jeff
Jarvis of a JP plane gdb cgpa native
query as how so very good question and
this is this what I'm oh this is
actually this what I am looking right
now and so um I actually was about to
write an a blog post about this so what
I wanted the title of the blog post is
going to be something like business
logic considered harmful and why I think
right now what is normal needed is to
separate the business logic from the
technical aspects because there are
actually no technical no technical no
technical just looking at a chatters
chatters three MOS down but it isn't um
there's no more technical aspects in
Java EE what we get at most are our
notation so there is no reason to
separate between business logic and
technical aspects now i would consider
sequel as being business logic so um if
you have if you have Java code and then
sequel what happens if you just put your
sequel queries everywhere so what
happens then you get duplicates in some
point of time if you get appliqued know
the sauna will probably scream and what
you have to do then you have done to
extract the common queries
to a single class it would be usually a
control or could be boundary but could
usually a control and this control will
implement a query but I will never call
the controller Dow I would just name it
after the responsibilities for instance
I don't know you know session finder for
instance in our case okay I hope it is
clear so I'm usually it is a control if
the car is complex it is complex like if
the business logic is complex in the end
I control it now becomes too long just
just split it divide and conquer has the
same tool for for sequel should control
the remote interfaces no only boundaries
can have a remote interfaces and there
are lots of questions from from Twitter
so interesting so next one so this is
the the article so here's my post ah
should suggest some good resource how
java ee container operates so and my
only resource i have is this pack so the
great story about java ee we have free
documentation for everything and this is
actually a stateless session bean life
cycle diagram from the e gb 32 spec
which is you can download for free and
and as you can see it is it's clearly
states what happens under the hood so
the bins does not exist and then its
constructor is called then dependency
injection is performed then post
construct is is called so we learned
that is actually a better idea to do
something reasonable meaningful in
constructor so you shouldn't use
constructor just post contract but this
is actually the research you should look
at this is the spec and how to find this
pack so what is actually the number here
3 4 45 so what actually did go to JCP
dark and put 3 4 5 here
and download the spec this is what I
would do and by the way shameless plug
but in the first two hours is actually
what we do at the bootstrap workshop the
very first day okay I think we recovered
this and more interesting no more
interesting an interesting or more
challenging question is here the
discussion with layers and this is with
a friend of the show Simon Martinelli I
know him it gives fracture but ceased CH
open so I'm a nice fellow actually and
what Simon is not with me as the
layering of ECB pattern and and what I
think what Simon or C Mon suggested
'used to put the boundaries to controls
and the resources as as boundaries and
my point of view is the following but
again this is just how I structure the
applications so what you could do is the
following you can implement a boundary
and this would be an eg be right and
this boundary would just talk to
entitymanager so the entity manager
could be considered as I control
actually but if i put at path on the gb
and now the boundary becomes a resource
pic or it is decorated with the
cross-cutting aspect path so now the
boundary becomes jax-rs resource as well
but i don't like it because it is harder
to test and this is the only reason why
I split always split the boundaries from
the resources of what i would do is to
introduce another class annotated with
path and this class is heavily depending
dependent on HTTP and jack sir
ress and this class when this class
accesses the ejb so this is actually the
idea this ad path excesses the egb and
it was split because it's easier to test
so this is actually usually not unit
tested because there is no real behavior
so it is just integration tested or
system tested and this egb can contain
real business logic so then it is going
to be tested so this is and what I think
what Simon would like to have that the
egb becomes a control and the boundaries
the resource but in my case this is to
my way of thinking and I think yeah I
just like the idea a little bit bit
better but I know what simul would like
to do but if if Simon would just keep
the boundary here and put the control
the move T boundary to a level below it
we also okay so I mean this is just my
explanation of things so boundaries
first I would always start with
boundaries which are playing ejbs
playing holy jeebus just business logic
and then you could annotate the heb with
tracks or s would work perfectly but
usually what you have to deal with cash
control and and then GDP headers or
whatever and then it becomes really hard
to test the egb so i think is better
idea to split both but then i will just
keep both classes in the boundary
package so and on that note there is
another interesting component here
clinical a a business layer and we had a
way ago I gave courses for sun
microsystems that there was always
discussion what is the difference
between tia and layer and this was prior
you know the whole java 6 and java 5
discussions or the old days of
enterprise Java tia was physical was
usually machine and Leia was logical so
um and what i'm using in my examples is
the naming from the old son stuff
because happened to be a standard so i
always even in my examples of what i'm
using is presentation business
integration is what the old tears from
Sun so I'm the presentation contains jsf
for instance and the business would
constrain the business logic this
actually did basic idea so on the first
tier is
nickel then we get the component in my
case is always business and within the
components i'm using technical layering
which is boundary control entity and the
only reason for this is it is always the
same structure and it is easier to track
the dependencies with sewn-on for
instance okay okay I hope Simon is happy
Simon are you happy hope so ok any
questions no question Twitter so then
next one what are microservices and this
is a interesting interesting question
because microservices are hot now in
fact if you look at Twitter what I did I
registered a talk or a deaf in August
actually in in mulva about nano services
nano services because you know if if
microservices our hood now let's do a
nano services and I will probably sell
submit another talk about peak oil
services why not so I'm the funny
stories everything started with so on
and what let's see whether i will so our
definition whites so what they finish
let's see here this weather we will find
here something in English and SOA
service-oriented architecture okay if
you read this the service orientation
let's see whether we find the service
orientation so it's a design pattern to
build computers often in the form of
services to automate business logic as
distributed systems so what actually SI
a sad-ass back then is that you are
building services with significant
business value and this Sigma M these
services are distributed so it can be
accessed from different systems so and
now the question is if we have Java EE
it is already distributed and now why
someone would build services without
business value so so um I always wonder
the so uh I mean it is absolutely
obvious that you are exposing something
with business value right so and if you
are building a restful web service which
business value you are per definition a
sewer service so um this is a little bit
trench to me was always trench so and i
never got this actually and separation
of contents and whatever you see is
already happens in java so it's actually
nothing you and so and the problem was
so ours is probably too coarse grained
so um if you if an application would
expose one single service from the
business point of view it would be you
know to coarse-grained so it is harder
to reuse and what what how it's called
micro surface what microservices are
actually smaller sewer services and what
what what's funniest actually whatever I
wrote did the the the last few years and
actually
talk at the conferences we actually
microservices because what I always said
is a team has to be small and produce a
single war and if you are if you are
creating a war with a small team you are
you you are probably will only have a
few restful web services and you are
going to be a micro service given that
given you are providing business values
which is hopefully the defector no
because why you would build something
without business value so um this is my
explanation of of micro services they're
actually so our with a different name
and finer grained and more pragmatic so
without ESPs just using you know down to
earth protocol like HTTP arrest so it
can is easily consumed by a client
without any you know an ivory tower
technology and this is a nano surface so
this is what i can tell you so I'm I
hope you are with me still and the
question is is it possible to implement
a micro service with Java I mean of
course I mean this is what we do all the
time so let's see where are my questions
so arm microservices in of course are
there any improvement on implementing
the good old design patterns with j 7
and javed in fact they are because what
we do in the architecture day i have one
slide with all gang go for patterns and
we go through all the Gulf patterns and
what happens is most of the creational
patterns or behavioral patterns are can
be replaced with a view on rotations for
instance usually you can replace all
lookups or sorry all factories eps tech
factories with producers you can you can
replace the bridge pattern with a
stereotype and alternatives you can
replace the strategy pattern with a
single qualifier
and you can replace the singleton
pattern with singles a notation so I'm
you know all the patterns are still in
place but there is no more
implementation because our part of the
platform or the good one as well
observable becomes just an injected
event so most of the patents just are
part of the platform right now and no
one I think we'll call it gang of a
pattern anymore because if I just use
producers I will never call it Hector it
just producers so the difference between
path and stateless if you just put path
on our class it is just jacks or as
resource it doesn't as a standalone API
resource if you put at stateless on it
it is the life cycle it becomes an e gb
with the life cycle of an ejb this is
the difference and the and usually some
application servers implement supports
the inject dependency injection then so
if you put at request scope or session
scope or stateless on a path it becomes
a managed bean CDI managed bean and then
the dependency injection ref works an
EDD path would even work on tomcat on a
web container without any CD I support
so and someone asked how to do I run
integration tests this is a simple one
you have to run from the command line
maiden fail-safe invoke not maven
testing doesn't work what you have to do
from the command line you have to do
maven fail-safe integration test this is
actually d answer yeah
okay this was a simple one so I think I
got some questions here in the comments
3 comments and then we are still over an
hour so how to handle shared
transactions in context of micro
services or shed transaction there are
no shared transactions so on I think
what what what Sebastian means or would
like to express is two phase commit
something like you know distributed
transaction and you could implement this
passing the transaction ID / jax-rs
services but it's a really bad idea I
think the only way to do this is to
rethink the business logic so instead
doing everything on one go you will have
you know to try to to order the book
first if the book is not available ask
the user what to do not you know try to
book and ship and pay everything on one
go this is the only only only only
answer I half and we actually we also
discussed in the architecture day a lot
exactly the point about transactions how
do microservices differ from so in my
eyes there is no difference so so eyes
was just same old architecture so I
there was actually my eyes nothing new
except some vendors would like wanted to
sell some interesting products but I
mean or interesting and less interesting
products but microservices I would say
it's just if you're building something
variable to a company and you are in a
small team deploying one war with a
limited functionality of a micro service
how to handle cross-cutting contents in
Microsoft's like authorization so this
is actually easier to handle there are
multiple tools and then the most famous
one is open IDM as from Fort Rock it is
an old son project with single sign-on
sso a single sign in single sign-on yeah
single sign-on sso and yeah there's also
open ID is a different project
supporting this and because
microservices are usually
jax-rs or rest services it is actually
relatively easy to implement yeah and
someone answered the question so this
was which I appreciate is actually my
opinion so I think we answered
everything right no questions no
questions no questions then I would say
thank you for watching see you in
September and/or an upcoming September
December actually this is where is my
workshops page workshops so there are
two special events one about testing and
another one about how to be even more
productive with Java 7 with Java 8 with
strange stuff like concurrency you know
eliminating in jp-a with lambdas stuff
like this and the regular a eggs in
December we are already sufficient to
registrations to all slots so the
berkshires will take place so am thank
you seein projects on our upcoming
workshops thank you for watching and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
