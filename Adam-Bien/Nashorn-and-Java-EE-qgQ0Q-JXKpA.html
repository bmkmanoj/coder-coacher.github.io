working in java java project java SE
projects as usually adjusting java and
javascript space some references so you
can find my blog twitter and from time
to time actually three times a year I
organize or I organize I deliver
workshops at Munich Airport about Java
and Java EE and projects related to the
presentation RN hydrator SPG and x-ray I
will as all open source all Apache so i
will show sometimes some code from this
projects and i also use javascript a lot
in my commercial projects the problem
with this is I'm not allowed actually
two not allowed I have no idea i signed
several ndas it is really hard to say
whether whether i can talk about such
projects linux because of the strange in
das so in this book i described the
x-ray project it's a little bit related
to javascript and in this project i am
describe a pattern called fluid logic it
was implemented on rhino it is a
predecessor of NASA one but it works
with nice one even better and yeah these
are the vet shops but and this are
actually the contents I would like to
talk today about JavaScript to Java
communication Java to JavaScript with
NASA on some ideas about automation
fluid logic agents and templating zor
what fluid logic means is encapsulation
of algorithms agents is some interesting
stuff which were nuts one helps me and
templating is a little bit more boring
than agents but still useful in projects
by the way you can ask me questions in
real time so I don't have the back
channel via skype but could be a little
bit disturbing but you can use on ax
channel and er er see which is preferred
or at Adam beam or a hex at Twitter so
whatever you like should be M so this is
my Twitter stream as a
and see we have to listeners on or two
attendees at IRC so so let's start with
the topic so um this was actually the
various fist slide very last first in
last slide so let's start with the
actual content so what I have here is
actually a stock netbeans so it comes
with with interesting extension called
terminal we can open if you like just
search for terminal and tur me know then
you can open it so this is what i order
actually did I could use the de regular
a terminal bit actually does not matter
and what what nice one provides is
something interesting so i will show you
right now it is actually unbelievable
what you can do with this and what I
create it I created a file which can be
executable and on this purpose I have to
define a shebang this is this stint of
bench I'm using javascript actually Java
not sworn to scripting environment and
in order to be able to execute this I
will make have to make the script
executable so let's do this and let's
implement you something out say print
print hello java day so
and hello Java day by the way the NASA
on output comes from the minus full
version flag which you can set in or set
off as you like so somehow exciting
what's a little bit more exciting you
can have variables of course against a
message hello and say instead of hello I
would rather like to use the message
hello and should work you see the same
way so you gave a string substitution it
makes a little bit more interesting for
what I show you a little bit later so
this is a should should you already
given idea and Nass one is done akma
script I think five something
implementation so it is actually
JavaScript what we're doing right now so
a little bit exciting right so what you
can also do of course you can you could
define function great cond and say
return java day of course you can you
could also call the function here great
conf so somehow exciting but what's also
works and this is these are the the
natural extensions I could do something
like this and if I execute this nothing
happens because the result is stored in
a variable called out so I could say far
out
so as you can see here's the output so
at this point of time you should on the
other side in Kiev just shouting and
crying and say what a great story here
with NASA on right how usable it is so
this is this is so far what you can do
with NASA on and now is the question
what to do with this right so I what I
showed you right now you can define
functions you can replace parameters I
guess is actually the case in bash or OC
shell I can execute commands it's a
little bit more interesting i can store
the output regular out in out and arrow
in error and i can print it out and yeah
the question is what's the story with
this so um let's see whether they are
any questions so there are no questions
and no questions so what's wrong with
you i hope to say oh nice if no
questions on at least statement so you
can say okay nice one is pretty pretty
good or very good or whatever so um I'm
I would like just check something watch
duck oh it is not up
okay this is the right directory what I
do right now is a little bit surprised
so you have to be to wait for a few
seconds and probably have already an
idea what you would like to do and if
this doesn't put in the right time have
full back a solution in the internet but
I think this would be more interesting
and more useful what I'm doing right now
I'm putting a darker in vagrant what you
could also do you get a boot docker in
how it's called boot to dhaka this
vagrant is is perfect and would dhaka
does actually it comes with no it's
already interesting let's see whether it
works nice so now vagrant ssh and let's
start our of my virtual workshops
registrations registration docker PS
this what I wanted to say nothing is
running but i could say right now
fractures remove front so now it starts
started workshop container which is a
java application and what happens here
is actually darker comes with json api
and i think the entry point is container
Jason so looks nice so what I would like
to do to play with this a little bit so
I can go here and say it was nice but
let's do something useful so now i can
say Vera command and i would like to
curl this or w get doesn't matter and
just would like to print the command
here wait a second dollar exok comment
and say this is a role output and say
Dola Dola out so and say print raw
output war output raw output so let's
try this you see it starts to be nice so
what we did we access from NASA one
which runs as a java actually
interpreted by the JVM backend dhaka so
you can say oh this is actually nothing
exciting but what you can do with
because it's JavaScript you can parse
zero output and what you get back are
all containers and this is actually no
more a string let's try this
so as an object and what what kind of
object it is it is it is an array of
objects you can see so I'm what I could
do for each each container in containers
print container and let's do something
useful what we have here for instance
the container dot ID as you can see the
ID is printed so what I can easily do I
can implement an interactive no
containers this what I wanted to comment
out I can implement very easily an
interactive dhaka shell so I have the
idea of the container and of course i
could say names is also an array so i
would like to have the names this would
be container with names and i think i
need the first one and plus let me see
what we have here are there should be an
image or something it's an image names
image yeah this is capital so let's do
names and contain a names 0 and contain
that image as you can see the ID the
name and the image and of course what's
nice with this I actually use to
provisional applications and Jenkins and
because it's i miss a mix of system
commands and script there is no external
dependencies or this script runs equally
well on mac and linux which was not
always the case with bash because you
know there are some issues with erase
and stringers whatever
limit us but this is actually pretty
stable and this is I get a nice support
from from from netbeans or IntelliJ and
and even syntax highlighting debugging
and stuff like this so let's see you
with any questions if know we actually
covered more or less javascript a little
bit and automation so no questions here
no questions here it means silent
audience we just enjoys nice one okay so
order of course could do we can initiate
post with minus X minutes- exposed and
and and and start even new containers
from from last one but on that note
what's even more exciting is erm a more
useful for us for for a streamlined Java
projects we can let's do a call it
differently with Java Jas yes and shroud
blue 6 with Java j/s and this is just a
template which is expanded so on what I
would like to do is I would like to
create a new project which happens to be
a java project a maven project and I
call this na slip knots on library &amp;amp; Co
me hugs nastiness lip looks good and to
make I would like to check out java
version i would like to have java 8 and
to build final name and I call it now
slip so why I'm doing this it will just
omit a jar with the name now slip jar
without diversion so it is easier so i
will just clean and built and see
whether it actually work so you have
nice lip target and now slip jar so it
looks good so what i can do right now in
the with java i can set it the classpath
so i can all say
hey nice one use please my jar and this
is an oz lip target nah slip dot Chara
this was actually the reason why I I I
had coded the name of the project and
let's create an object here or what you
can do is of course you can I think it's
called arc VAR arcs and if we print this
those are all invocation parameters arcs
if we print this object I'm interesting
what is actually the object so we can
say hello I know with Java what was it
with Java I a b c three parameters and I
got ABC back but what I'm interesting in
what is actually this is it give me the
class of the object and as you can see
type error cannot coils I cannot cannot
access the object so it will try with
gas with class and defined so some some
and I'm really curious what it actually
is this JavaScript object by the way
what we always can do I can print it out
of course with for each it works equally
well for JavaScript and Java objects arc
in arcs and just come print it out print
arc so let's do whether it works so so
it can output this but I'm really
curious what it actually is so on then I
will create an object and call the
object inspector nice name inspector and
call the method gadget public static
void gadget just for fun doesn't matter
object oh and what I would like to see
is here on the Java side Oh get class
getname and say here class this is the
class and what we would like to see
let's would like to use the class this
class so and then i would also like to
have get declared forget methods fields
are not that interesting i would like
get methods on public methods and just
output the methods so and now i would
like to call from from our own ass one
this object and pass the other object
back so on how to do this is relatively
simple so let's wait a second so we
could say here VAR inspector and i think
it was calm in Hanks non-slip dot
inspect or and i hope it is static so we
can now say inspector gadget and pass
the arcs class odd found i think i
forgot to compile come a hex now slip
call me exactly let's see what is better
lots of lots of methods so i could call
this methods and let's see what happens
what is what is actually the class and
the class is a native array so what we
what we get back is a native JavaScript
array which can be of course converted
to java ray so if you say java too and i
put the arcs i will get a java
collection bank
as you can see there's a Java ray okay
this is actually useful this Java you
can convert JavaScript objects to Java
back and forth and so on what you
learned here we can access it in not
only the the arguments we can access the
environment n we can define in a class
path and use libraries and use these
libraries or scriptures libraries from
command line using last one which makes
it particularly interesting in
enterprise project for instable
installation of stuff configuration or
monitoring so I'm what do I show you
earliest that we can access with
JavaScript and jason with with NASA on
rest and Jason which what I did in past
and monitor glassfish which emits Jason
as a monitoring protocol so our with a
view scripts you can see now what there
are any exceptions in production or or
all bags are really really useful and
you can decide whether you would like to
have external dependencies or just go or
without any dependencies and implement
everything in JavaScript so I hope we
covered this JavaScript to Java a little
bit let's see with any questions no
questions and three tweets could you
implement it at a letter X to a pattern
I think I could take a question from
Twitter but not during the session and
another I can see how yeah um it is not
like I'm trying to to to to to how to
say to replace something it is just
first it's a nice heck to implement
something quickly like monitoring and
sorry i will see you some some some less
achy sessions in a second implement
something like for instance
installation or or monitoring or a
configuration or some ideas in a moment
and I'm don't think I'm replacing the UI
or so i will show you an interesting
example in a second just use a lot in
production so thank you for the comments
via Twitter and shame on you lazy chat
usually I got more questions from the
chat and Twitter so now this not all
what I could also do is more interesting
I could for instance say something like
this but if I try
instantiate this I should get get an
error and I would just deactivate this
just too much noise cannot construct
runnable with the past arguments they do
not match of any constructors ignatian
uh no wonder because they're unable is
an interface right but what we can do
with NASA one you can implement the
interface a and I can pass the method
this actually interesting so i can say
function run and say print runnable
should work now
so we have an instance of runnable which
has an interesting package and I could
say now runnable dot run so what you can
do is to use should work now as you can
see this function this function should
be another Moses could be anonymous as
well because of sm in Java single
abstraction works and of course what we
could also do we could say this is a
JavaScript function and I could pass the
function into the exit tube executable
and run it again and you see it still
works so this is pretty powerful so what
it means is you can implement with NASA
on Java interfaces on the JavaScript
side it might be interesting if your
scripting the application on Java side
it is even more interesting and this is
what i would like to show you on the
java site and will lift this this first
idea so how to interact from javascript
which out to java and see what there any
questions no questions here IRC still
lazy and twitter is great so back to
code we have no much time also I
couldn't do longer today because you can
just set off the Bema and I could talk
forever right so let's create Java to
jas project which is going to be a maven
project and I would like to have Java 18
and I would like to start the easiest
possible thing is I guess to use a unit
script Janet sorry unit test Jane it and
here we go package calm a hex naw sex or
not sexist ness hex
better and the question is playing test
so initialize so I think NASA X is even
better better than ya ex so before so
and how to initialize what it can do
what I would like to show you right now
how to X is not swung from Java and this
is the just the am Nats conscripting i
am using for for for DevOps like actions
or two for monitoring installation and
this was a show right now i'm actually
using in in the real world applications
so there is an old API and almost
forgotten script engine manager and here
i can get the engine if you use
javascript i think it could be even
lower case you get the engine back and i
would like to remember the engine and
let's see what it is
so now i would write a real world test
it means no asserts but the test
coverage is great so test so and what we
will see as you can see it is nice once
cryptic engine and so we could make it a
little bit more sane and say assert
through this engine to get
so provide an import do it again okay
seems to work so and last one is a third
true callable which is pretty exciting I
will show in a second instead of call in
vocal is the internal info yes in vocal
so it is in vocal what it means our show
in a second and it is also compatible
which is interesting by the way I forgot
to mention whatever I'm doing right now
it comes with java 8 no external
dependencies which are particular
interesting to me as you know or should
be small and lean and diploma to be fast
so and that's one is absolutely
compatible with this so now let's play
with playing with in vocal so so playing
with a in vocal how to do this so what I
will have to do I will have to create an
invoker ball and cast nice one to it so
this is required and now I can do
something crazy so i can say do the same
in vocal get interface and this is
interesting and the interface i would
like to have runnable interface
runnable and this shouldn't be not by
the way we are not test-driven right
because everything is green all the time
are true a gel developers would create
like to see and read bar first what they
saw half half bar and then fix it so
let's fix it the problem is there is no
script so nothing implements here so to
to to make it happen we can now say
invoke this engine eval eval and what I
would like to evaluate as a function run
and say here print hey Duke
does not work do so pity and i think is
the problem still not
function run print hey Duke not equals
even too much red so now it looks a
little bit better so this is green and
it's suit all should also work this way
it didn't but it doesn't and this is I
think back it is all the reported and so
I had to chat at travel on with the nice
one engineers and they told me they
should work but a dozen here so you have
to name the function as the runnable so
because runnable has a method called run
we have to use the same here and this is
actually great so what we do right now
is what we are able to do we are able to
implement Java interfaces from a string
effectively from a JavaScript script and
runnable on the fly so let's see whether
chat or Twitter is excited in in a
second so twitter is absolutely not
excited and IRC also not so what's wrong
with you this is great story so we have
an interface runnable implemented here
from nice one so let's do it even more
interesting
we put some we pass some object to an
ass one and can execute the objects
accessing Java API s so this actually no
mo needed and we could pass here the
bindings so this engine put let's say a
B
and let's say what else we could also
use for instance this engine put message
so now we can go do we can actually
access the objects here and what we get
back should be an integer read file a
cert dad read file is um is for sure and
a little bit casting and a little bit
importing
oh this is a double so you we have the
red bar again so which is exciting and
now it should be almost green so what we
expect is a double so if you have any
questions so and this is what we
actually did in enterprise projects what
we needed to we needed something like a
flexible flexible formula interpreter
and we use begged and rhino which is a
little bit slow and an asshole is a vast
leaf is very really fast comparing into
to rhino and this would actually did and
get developers already thought about
building an old an own language with
entler and with NASA on it those are a
lot easier and cheaper to to implement
this also what you can do we can also
access the the message here and this is
let's do it in the next this engine even
and say message and of course what you
can back is the string
let's try this a shrink and the next use
case what we did a few years ago so we
implemented the the idea would was to to
provide a an extension to a java ee
projects and the java ee was there were
four sites EG beef assets which you need
to be scripted or it scripted extended
and the customer thought about
introducing implementing this with
frameworks like watch GI to make the
small bundles replaceable what we did
instead we expose the whole API to a
scripting engine and store the script in
a database and and this was actually far
more stable because on in india on the
event at the event of exception we could
replace the script and and more stable
because there were no class order
problems it was just surf containing
okay i think the most interesting part
we covet you can implement from java you
can get Java interfaces implemented with
mass one and you can pass to nasa on
java objects and access them from from
the script and both are really useful in
enterprise project so arm let's see any
questions Oh two tweets
okay thank you javascript to Java so we
have this Java to JavaScript automation
was with daca and fluid logic is exactly
what I explained to you right now and
now a little bit of agents and I'll show
you some prepared code I I have from my
projects so agents the problem is if you
would like imagine a distributed
environment and you would like to move
code from one node to another and you
can implement an interface let's say
runnable and initialize runnable and
pass it over the network it's a problem
with this is of course the class doesn't
move so you will have to implement your
own class loader you're at class loader
or you could you will have to for
instance implement a marshal object what
Marshall object does it it transports
the data with the class but this is
painful and could be problematic with in
with firewalls and whatever and what I
did several times already I implement it
the arm the interface is let's say
runnable with mass one and then you only
have to move a string across the wire so
there's no civilization involved nothing
and and recently and a project with GSR
1070 just happens to be a je cache and
implemented by hazel cast I just stored
all these scripts in a cache as a string
they moved automatically to all the cash
nodes and on each cash node I knew all
this interface is actually I ran a
runnable callable function or whatever
actually it was predicated my case to
implement a filtering on collections and
I could very easily and very robustly
distribute and interface instances over
the network over the wire and with Java
plane job would be a lot more
complicated and the really the nice
story was no external dependencies just
plain worse in Java EE this bean
validation we did it several times so
for what clan nice one is great i'll
show you just let's say we have here a
virtual entity number of attendees
coffee volume be Max's room size so we
organize a workshop in case we have a
lot of attendees and the coffee volume
is equal to the anti DS and the entities
are smaller than the room size and the
Bema exists and of course stupid to put
script in annotations but just show you
the possibilities and in the validator I
would just fetch from the annotation the
script and evaluate the code more
usually what you do you would you would
like to load the script from a database
and validate for instance very flexibly
you could change the validation rules
without restarting the server right so
I'm just let's see whether it actually
works so this is a bean validation unit
test from from javi and now it validates
the workshop instances with scripts
loaded from perform a shrink and start
in a notation here of course this hard
coding is stupid it's only only good
force for hope for conferences in real
life you would like to store the script
outside the application to make it
flexible so this is what we used a lot
and actually I do it in some of my on my
blog for instance force for spam
prevention they don't like to restart
the whole block or whatever if something
changes and I don't like to implement it
in my own rule engines or what I did i
implemented a filter as a JavaScript
function and it can upload it / rest to
at any time I like and change the
validation rules if the script breaks I
catch the exception and just just say
true there's as if there were no script
so it can be even robots or it is robust
so I'm embedded not an ass one is what
we actually so right now an iterator is
an interesting project and I show you
the unused case of this project equal to
Twitter and Twitter to github and
download it is Apache project is
actually used in a view commercial
projects but and the generic time is
open source and I show you right now is
a common problem what I would like to do
is I have I have here
let's say i have here json file and the
json file isn't sourced as resources it
is source test resources and there is a
language is Jason so how does language
rank this is the head us and then we
have languages javis number one sees
number two Kabul is number three and
everything else is number four right and
so and the problem is what I would like
to do is I would like to convert a Jason
to Java flexibly and this is actually
what n hydrator does not only Jason it
can convert Rose CSV or whatever and
this is the setup so what I implemented
is a scriptable source the input is
languages but the problem is the Jason
can vary and in fact what what this
actually is I just change the structure
this is this is usually methods and this
is performance of the methods this is
actually the output from from from
software like x-ray monitoring outputs
weekend for instance I would like to
convert this to csv and have nice nice
charts right how to do this so what I
did instead the scriptable source what
is descriptive resource is a java 8
class implements source and what source
does it it creates from something an
iterable of rows and what roles are is
this actually as a row at a table row
into it comprises columns so um a source
is iterable of rows right you only have
to know this and we have one scriptable
implementation no can imagine what
happens here so I'm just reading the
script and reading the source and there
is somewhere we have load this load on
as you can see I I set the input and
rose to the script and the method query
what I do here I said this load and in
the load script the conversion between
the input and the output happens in
script and what it actually means i can
very easily implement the conversion so
this is nice one
embedded nice one so I get the Java type
you can also Express this way and hit
later in row I print the output and then
say Jason would parse so i have to json
object then i'm interested in languages
and i would like to have the language
length and I'm iterated over the
languages and I create on the Friday
column so if the structure changes i
only have to adapt the the script and
don't have to recompile the code which
is somehow important here because n
hydrator is stored in sonatype central
and this would be it is will be not that
nice in order to to change the the the
core framework just because the format
changes this is also useful it's just an
example you can download it with the
anhydrate a project together and also
interesting so if you go to my blog it's
not my blog this is my there is our most
popular entries here and a problem with
these entrances so number one is usually
the block itself and number two are the
searches and some entries or this is
actually crazy popular and one point of
time I will be no more interesting to
have you know just adjust the dis dis
entry on the top so what I could do is I
could filter them out without restarting
the block so how to implement such a
thing and this is actually create a very
simple tool with Java fix and we'll
start and show you this so this is the
default script and this is an from this
from key and values and entry and
hashmap entry is created so it can say
here Duke is the is the Ori and this is
the number of hits let's say 10 10 or
seen in German so and what I wanted to
do is it could now say return t dot
value ah it needs to be smaller than 10
let's see validate and it get falls back
so if I say nine it passes so what I'm
able to do I can am able to test
my filter expression for fort for the
ranking and filled out entries for
instance a t dot value I think it's Java
screen as java string then can say
contains Duke because in JavaScript
there is no contains and so so I can
evolve the scripts it validates not
contains Duke this false who go so
whatever this is a JavaScript
application and I could implement here
any fruit the expressions alike and if I
click click Save and they are submitted
via restful web services just this
expression and is immediately active
okay I get some questions from Twitter
whether this is a good practice to reuse
form validation from back-end and
front-end and it is a practice it really
depends on the context was his best
practice are not in the back em in there
in the past we are the problems with the
performance of rhino with this nasan is
crazy fast in fact someone a jabber one
approached me and he develops the robots
and he told me that the glass wall they
are able to run and last one Frank it
they are able to invoke NASA on
functions 50 times a second which is
remarkable and I can only say it didn't
perform any stress test but it is really
very fast and according to NASA
engineers mass one is as fast as the
google v I'd there are no limitation in
Java object so you can just invoke them
and yeah there are no limitations no
known invocation so far not in vocations
limitations so we have 10 minutes to go
so I would like to show you a little bit
more code so this is actually one my
what I do a lot a backup also
interesting so what I'm able to do
backup I'm able to to connect to my
block and from the hazel cast grid i can
able
to store all the statistics on the hard
disk for instance this is also nice one
you see this is everything is actually
very very lean and thin and I think
that's one predicate is actually what I
implement a lot so I'm to show you how
it works so we have get engine by name
JavaScript we get an ass on back and I
have somewhere a predicate yeah get an
interface predicate and I get the
interface back what predicate is is an
interface from Java 8 which has one
method test so you might ask why I are
talking so so much about the predicates
because predicate is what is used in the
filter expressions so what I can do
right now I can say I would like there
is a new fluke and the Duke and what I
would like to do is to to filter them
and psych hekkus dot stream filter get
predicate Dukes only collect and
collectors to to list and this get
predicate get predicate goes to sources
resources and search for a script with
the name Dukes only so what I should be
a script here there's packages notice
packages it should be other sources
Dukes only and as you can see this is
the implementation of of the predicate
and it only returns the Duke so this is
actually the implementation that can
also load on the fly optimistic and
pessimistic and this is also what engine
280 does on the fly it can load filters
mappers whatever from from last one so
are you don't you don't have to
recompile the code ok any questions no
questions here
extremely lazy today so do you have any
questions
okay then no I'd only jealous six was
removed but why nice one needs Java I
don't need this one wait a second now
i'm in dhaka sorry so the problem i have
is the following so i have branch of
workshops and three times a years
already mentioned and the problem with
these workshops is the date changes
three times a year and needs to be
consistent in the caption in the form
and several times in the text and I was
not able to maintain it by hand so if it
looks at the workshops you know there's
um or we go to the internet so i will
see the date here and the date is
somewhere else and it has because in the
form and I was not able to maintain it
properly and my wife went crazy because
someone reduce it to the workshop in
December and she got an email for March
or whatever and I say okay we could
create everything from from the whole
workshops javaserver faces application
GSP which is actually stupid because
they change three times a year and
there's no need to know to create for
such a application and dynamic
application so this is I would like to
keep it a regular HTML project so and
what I actually implemented if I invoke
here Jen
hmm wait a second as you can see it
regenerated all the pages and what's
interesting here is open there's always
appear you see HD HD emjason HTM Jason
and what I did here let's open it with
for instance Adam it's just a JSON
object and it corresponds to htan to HTM
object and the question is how it works
and to show you how it works I would
like to show you the script so and just
a script as you might suspect this is
nice one again and this is a fully
fledged static page generator so what it
does it needs just arguments the input
and output and then searches for
corresponding HTM and Jason PS and the
most interesting stuff here it uses it
loads this is a nice one extension
mustache the JavaScript masters library
so what I can do I can use my templates
whatever is provided by the Masters or
handlebars libraries or a caduceus or
how it's called loader or underscore
whatever I like and this is a mix of
Java libraries and mass one so because
file i/o from Java is really convenient
i use the Java I own I oh and and I use
a nice one for for working with with the
templates so and if you go to masters
chance you will see this actually a
really really interesting library
mustache yes and I use the JavaScript I
can just download the origin library
loaded it for loaded it from an asshole
from command line and
I'm able to use all the syntax described
here and it's actually what happens i
invoke in one point of time masters
render and if you look at this there is
somewhere mustache render render exactly
mustache render content parameters so um
I'm actually using the same templating
what you usually use in html5 in browser
on the server to pre generate my content
so and i didn't i didn't use this year
for my block in the first place what i
actually what we did in a project
multiple ties at times we use this to
generate you know emails confirmation
emails or invoices of stuff like this
was really convenient because you get
very flexible templating mechanism and
you can even work very tight with web
designers because they already know the
technology and and because i know it's
drugs i just hectus from my blog and
actually it is an open source project in
is a justice on my github account if you
go here to SPG's stench for a static
page generator is it here somewhere or
repositories SPG and on twitter so
someone mentioned is that it implemented
with SPG it generated I think glassfish
or our jboss xml configuration files
which is also an interesting use case so
I would talk could talk for hours with
this is really a nice one and and and a
rhino previously they had me a lot in
project so I saved lots of time with
this and I never had a project with just
with JavaScript but combining Nass one
with JavaScript from time to time is
really interesting in in enterprise
particularly in enterprise project and
because NASA one comes with Java 8 I
don't have to justify why I'm using Java
because usually we have it already and
yeah this was actually my ideas i'm
using in in my project let's see whether
we covered everything but i think we
were pretty efficient even template dick
was covered and yeah so um thank you we
have two minutes to go so thank you for
watching and see you at
in projects of course github Twitter or
chat or whatever and what I forgot to
mention is what I would I do one time
one time a month each first monday of
the month I it's the same only what you
are watching right now I have a hex QA
so if someone asked me a question I
usually answer it interactively on the
heck square session so i can save time
and we have already eight questions for
the next show in november so if you'll
just allow 10 questions because we have
only one hour time so I'm thank you for
watching and see you probably in Munich
and my workshops I just would like to
see whether there are any questions oh
very good get one Quinn oh I take it
back Chet is not lazy at all someone
asked me is it possible to run no GS
apps with express or any other framework
on the on the answer is of course so it
is not that enterprise-e so this is why
I didn't mention this but if you look at
avatar GS this is what you are searching
for this is the this is no GS on Java EE
so
can we get code examples from the
conference of course but just have to
remember not to delete this this was
this what I implemented I will submit to
the conference and everything else is on
github so are the DD all examples which
were already prepared SPG and so forth
are on github and what I implement it
today I will submit to the conference by
the way is a really great conference
conference and I know the organizer he
approached me at javaone so this is
actually why I really joined this so um
thank you for watching and I hope it is
was helpful to you and and this is
actually not that esoteric to use nice
wand in enterprise projects adjust the
last look okay no questions so we are
very on time which is remarkable for a
conference so thank you for watching and
see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
