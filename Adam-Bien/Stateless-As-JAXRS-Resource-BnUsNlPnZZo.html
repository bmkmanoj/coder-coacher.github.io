would like to explain you why eg bees
stay classy jeebies can be beneficial as
Jax or as resources to show you this I
would like to start with a maven project
and i will use the essential archetype
which is the simplest one and it should
be as resource I will call the project
and go with the a hex group okay it's
just a start project nothing special but
then I would like to create package and
call it of course hello resource and
this hello resource is going
to be fairly simple and of course hey
Duke now let's run it and I will run it
on pyara which is the page glassfish so
as glass with with commercial
third-party support so it launches the
payara is a cold start so this is so we
have hey Duke and what we could do right
now we could for instance look at the
monitoring capabilities of the server
you can go to 48 48 monitoring domain
server and we see applications and there
are a couple of application and EGP as
resources one for instance and we just
see basic monitoring like request count
and and the max time max execution time
error count processing time and request
count so I'm just general general
information and now let's change
something I would just convert that to
an ejb just to adding at stateless
annotation on it this causes
redeployment of the app and then I will
just go back server we see the
applications and I go to EGP as a
resource and what you see this is new
here the header resource
hello resource link i will click on that
and you see here to create count so it's
not created yet so i will just go here
and go ejb as resource resources hello
and just refresh that so it's created at
once you see I can I can monitor the
amount of instances but even nicer I can
go to the bin methods and see the method
hey and CD method was executed once and
so I can go back and erase good with
several times and see it was executed
six times there was no errors there was
six successes and and the last sample
time this was the execution time and the
nice story is I can also get the
information as Jason which can be easily
processed with any JavaScript client you
like is very easily so you can fairly
easy write a small angular or react app
which monitors yep and this is actually
what I did with the project light fish
so if you go to github Adam bin right
fish it actually parses the light fish
app parses the parses the adjacent
output of the application server and
provides a nice statistics so what we
get with ejbs we force application
server to emit to emit a stats
monitoring statistics and why we force
the application server because it is
part of the JCP spec and is called jsr
727 this is ancient one this is
management and monitoring and
application servers or compliant
application server starting with j2ee 14
has to emit monitoring and statistics
and they will each obese are forced to
emit statistics and just managed beans
don't have to admit these statistics and
this is one of the benefits why at
stateless on resources maybe
been beneficial so I thank you for
watching and see you an upcoming
conferences workshops a hex TV munich
airport or a xio if you would like to
learn from home so thank you for
watching and bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
