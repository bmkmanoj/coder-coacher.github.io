command line or IDE we'll just use the
command line to be IDE neutral archetype
generate and I will use the filter comm
ax so which will just return archetypes
from the group idk a heck yeah X and we
will use the first one igniter the other
ones are Java you related but the first
one is creates will create a Java fix
MVP application so on the latest version
group ID is going to be a hex and the
artefact ID let's call it igniter well
he nighter snapshot and this is the
package yes and we are in the igniter
package and this is what was created I
can now build the whole application with
maven teen install so it will create a
jar which is going to be executable and
to execute the char I can use command
line or with ignite that comes a little
bit shell script which does nothing else
but Java - jar igniter app so either I
could you make the run shell script
executable and or executed from command
line as you can see a very nice
application who was started and so good
news or bad news first
this application doesn't make any sense
this is just one button with a message
and good news are it shows major
capabilities of the afterburner
so a dependency injection 3 class
dependency injection framework so I will
just launch the IDE and use the project
group junk and you can see here's the
igniter project and which we created and
we just walk through the code so as you
can see there is a class called tower it
resides in the business flight control
boundary Peggy
and this class is just a single poacher
simple poacher and the single pole Joe
has a method in it post construct so it
is invoked once per instance and one
business method ready to take off so
what you could do you could encapsulate
here at rest jax-rs call or soap call or
JMS or or WebSockets into actions so
this is just usually either it is the
business logic or the gateway to do
business logic the proxy to the business
logic so the business delegate so there
is the business part and the
presentation part is a little bit more
interesting so follow me present at
first what it as you can see the tower
can be injected and the tower is going
to be a singleton so they'll be only
just one tower in the whole app which
makes sense for client-side applications
and label and fix ml which was injected
from the F XML and what's interesting
here in the method initialized which is
invoked by the Java fix runtime so
because we implemented initialize able
interface resourcebundle is passed by
Java pics runtime and we can access the
internationalized strings with a
resource bundle gets string and as you
can see we have here a follow-me
properties and within the follow-me
properties we can just declare these
drinks which can be internationalized so
follow me properties is the resource
bundle so then you can see there is a
prefix happy ending and date injections
or prefix and happy endings are just
strings and they are injected from a
property file as we can specify property
file as you can see here there's a tower
size and check manage the happy-ending
system property so there are two values
and you can check the application you
will see Tower says ok from tower empty
and and the state is also injected so
there are injected values and so what we
can do we can declare whatever you like
here in the configuration file and the
configuration file can recite once per
per view or per package okay
so then we have even something strange
we can inject a real object a real
object not strings and primitives rather
than real objects so we're at your local
date is coming from this you have to
declare it in the app in their startup
so what you can do in the recent
versions of After Burner an igniter so
you can specify whatever object you like
so a map of objects and then pass the
map of objects to the injector an
injector will use your values to inject
whatever you like to your presenters and
and services or models and of course you
don't have to use map you can you read
it from database property files or
whatever you like and yeah and then
finally we have the follow me view which
is empty so the question is why it is
empty and it is empty because it
inherits from F XML view and everything
you solve so far was was inherited from
the conventions or was directed from the
comic conventions so or what you so what
you you don't have to specify anything
if we can live with the conventions but
what it could do here which actually
never done what you could do you could
say I would like to override a method
and there are a bunch of methods but the
most interesting one get presenter for
instance if you like in order to do
special treatment to presenters or get
you if you would prop for instance
create some manually layout or post
process to view you can do this but I
never had to do this so I I just created
the views always with with the scene
builder and of course we have follow me
CSS which you already can decline out
declare your layout properties and we
also have follow me F XML which is
usually edited with this symbol than not
with D IDE and this basically comprises
a simple afterburner job of X
application based on MVP pattern so
thank you for watching and see you on
one of upcoming conferences workshops or
even the X or Y X i/o thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
