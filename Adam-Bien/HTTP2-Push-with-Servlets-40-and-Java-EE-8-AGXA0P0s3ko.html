to show you how to implement h2 or HTTP
to servlet server push with servlets for
all and java 8 so let's start with the
project and I would like to use the Java
EE 8 archetype so it's like maven wizard
and the very first version is 0 0 1 and
then let's call the project push and
this project will contain a single
dependency a provider dependency to Java
8 API and this is this and and the only
difference to the Java 7 setup is to the
8 here so let's create some content and
I would like to push some business logic
with the rocks some crucial styling
information and this is all divs have to
be blue and some content and the content
title is push and the div is Duke and I
would like to include the the stylesheet
information information with a style and
also include the script with script and
we have fgs so now we have both so let's
try to deploy it so what I would like to
do there is no Java inside just HTML and
CSS so I would like to use the GlassFish
v5 which happens to be the reference
implementation so now it deploys and
then should open this in the window so
and it open opened but I will have to
choose its HTML and now we see the
wonderful blue and actually
light blue is going to be better so a
way better so and then what's
interesting I would just to reload that
and we see the content HTML was loaded
and stylin fgs were loaded and the
initiator was the parser and the parser
so the parser parse the HTML and loaded
the style.css and dieppe GSS so now
let's implement a sublet so I would like
to start with a class and I call the
class push servlet and this is going to
be annotated with web serve with a
notation and the only thing I'm
interested in is the URI which has to
start with a slash and the the name is
push or let's call it h to push because
the project is already named push so we
have that and then I'm s a method to get
to lazy
let's override that so and forgot to
extend extends HTTP servlet and now we
can override the do get method to get so
and now so this method to get it just
two parameters request and response and
it's row servlet exception IO exception
but now let's start with some servlet
for all features requests new push pull
down path so I'm telling the server to
push the styler
CS first push and then I would like to
push the app.js and then I will get the
dispatcher
to content HTML to content HTML and
forward to this so a three liner so here
I would like to open the browser so and
now try it again so I will just copy the
URI and instead of using pushia I would
like to use H to push H to push and we
got an internal server error and the
reason is HTTP to only works via HTTP so
let's fix that so HTT P s : / / 8 1 8 1
servlet push and this time I will just
change so so we have turns and try to
reload this so and what we see here is
so a little bit larger that this was
loaded by other by meters H to push but
the style.css and app GS s were the
initiator was push so the contents were
pushed and not pulled by the browser so
what we see as the the HTTP 2 and serve
it for all are working and by the way
the warning here in a chrome is only
because we use a self-signed certificate
which comes with payara class fee or
payara so thank you for watching see you
an upcoming conferences a hex Munich
Airport projects or even jungwan so
thank you and bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
