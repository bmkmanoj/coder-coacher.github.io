it's the first Monday of the month and
I'm here again to answer the questions
about about Java and Java so I got a
bunch of interesting question and it's a
really interesting one it's a kind of a
meteor question
just someone guna is actually an old
friend of the show asked the resolution
of the screencast is rather low and this
made me think because it should be
actually HD thousand ATP and turns out
that it really depends on your bandwidth
so I tried to watch the screencast on
YouTube with was my iPhone and it was
pay um to UMTS it was really really low
resolution I couldn't even recognize the
diff'ent
but with wireless LAN brought great also
if you watch the screencasts on YouTube
with with the HTML html5 player I think
the highest possible resolution on
YouTube is 720p and if you watch it with
with Google Chrome or I believe flash
you can actually watch it in 1080p so
whatever I do it should be a 1080p and
720p is already somehow a workaround
okay this was the first meter question I
got a bunch of Twitter questions but I
would like to start with the official
one so I think Twitter is quiet so
nothing happens there and yeah let's
start with the with the first question
performance impact of remote ejbs and
Gregor asked it several times and seems
like it found a back of a glassfish or
something but what I did actually I
implemented a very small aperture
application called remote and there is
an remote beam and with a remote
interface to simulate
led behavior and the remote been
implements to remote interface and
returns something just just to see the
output and a remote servlet gets
injected used particularly egb and not
to simulate the behavior
Gregor Gregor mentioned and I just
invoke tgb here and what Gregor stated
that there is a significant overhead of
using ejbs so what I did I performed
very very very small stress tests very
simple one and I would like to repeat it
if it works so it's a little bit
dangerous to prepare something because
then you can get confused all the stuff
that is tried it whether it actually
worked and what I saw is the remote is a
lot lot slower than remote servlet so
you see there is an output and what we
do right now I would just start jmeter
and I go yeah jmeter
and I start the load generation file so
I think is it this let's see yes it
works good so um I would just I will
start this and I would start J visual vm
j visual vm and show you a little Hank
so I go to GlassFish I just connect with
the process and then I would like to
sample D CPU so to see what actually
happens behind the scenes so I will
write to start it so I go here and say
start watch the performance you can see
we are around about 500 transactions per
second using this servlet and what we
can do right now I go here and see you
see the heiress's let's to measure some
performance overhead and surprisingly
not surprisingly something and I all
related an
HTTP consumes the most performance hacks
as you can see the egb doesn't even
appear here so these the the overhead is
actually EJB related but I will just
what I saw previously is if I do it
often enough I will see some overhead
but in any case the HTTP overhead or
some orders of magnitude higher than the
HTTP so I could reproduce this but I
will explain actually what Gregor
actually asked so are the issue is if
you are using ejbs remote agb's all the
parameters and return values are going
to be copied because of the
specification requirements and this can
significantly hits the performance I
will just repeat the test because I
don't believe that it's actually run
clear all so we just and restart the
test so there is a test and I will
always stop and repeat I should be able
to clear this as well what is it I don't
know just
oh just case for itself
there's no proxy and you can see now it
appears dynamic stop get message there
is some overhead going on probably I
should use a larger a larger object not
just a string so we'll see the impact so
the point being I would change now to
locally interfaces and the performance
should be significantly better than
remote one so I will go back here and
you see we have 1600 transactions per
second about and where was the run clear
all so we just will deploy the
application with a small change so
instead of using the remote I will use
the local interface and now the
application server won't have to copy
the string so which should result in a
far better performance so this actually
the reason why you should never use
remote interfaces within within your
application just if you really have to
talk to from Tottori node client I
forgot what they actually king builders
and what cleaver actually asked was
there some optimizations called by
reference by a glassfish and he asked me
it said that it has doesn't have any
impact so in my project it had an impact
on what I am doing right now I'm
simulating the Colbert reference by
using local I was just too lazy to
create and egb jars and here to create
exactly what actually gregor asked so
instead of using Colbert reference I
just tested with remote and local and 2
to emulate the environment a remote
servlet
so it works still so then I will go hear
noises and run and then stop it
and
interesting performance even lower which
is crazy so arm is actually interesting
probably do not worry was the deployment
but before they show it was about twice
twice as high the the local interface as
the remote one
so let's this is reset and now just try
it again and see what happens here so
now there is even the there is actually
the eg B is now so fast there's actually
no yeah it doesn't even appear in the in
the sampler to be more precise we would
have to use profiler but it would slow
down significantly less efficient than
the process so this around 1500 I think
the problem is the this the screencast
software I'm using so it takes
significant amount of processing power
and my laptop is already hitting oh I
think it was the you know the boost
effect of CPU now my fans is running so
the performance degrades so this is
actually the unwanted result but the
point being you should always use local
interfaces if you cannot use local
interfaces within the application you
can use remote and with with it was the
setting call-by-reference which is
proprietary it is available on most of
the application servers and and why
because with remote the application
server is forced to see allies all
parameters or return values and with and
with and with local you can just call by
referenced the method and the overhead
of egb is negligible so there was 1600
transactions per second and gregor
mentioned there's 20 milliseconds
overhead so I could
measured us so in anyway remote the
local it was it was very similar
performance so um let's see whether you
have any questions one tweet what softly
I'm using for these string cream casts I
use a lot of software so there is not a
single one this really depends whether I
doing regular life swimming right right
now it is a wire cast final cut logic
motion and paladin and I don't know what
so I just need the whole infrastructure
for remote workshops for my clients so
as okay
because I have already in place I can
just create a small community project
and answer the questions instead of you
know using my comments in the block
which takes significantly more time so I
think three feel loss three fellows I
hope your question is answered so I
think it was clear so use local whenever
possible remote is actually duplicated
except you really want like to have you
really like to have remote communication
like IO P 2d to the external clients but
then doesn't it make any sense to use
call-by-reference
and remote with in a war or ear or eg
BGR doesn't make any sense
usually usually you would use it as a
wreck around because you use genuine
names or something okay I think the
first question is answered the next one
how would this architecture so this
architecture is referred from Wayne to
my not my boundary control entity idea
and cross-cutting concerns so this is
actually a very common question and the
follow-up is isn't a better way to
structure apps by splitting I'm here the
elements vertically instead of
horizontally I mean stuff related to
something like blocks should reside in
the block patches or niggas package
private except interface entities so oh
this is from random so this was a prompt
link and
so what a question is so what I'm
usually doing is the following so I'm
I'm using business packages and for me
these business packages are I consider
in like like objects so this would be
lets say screencast and this could be a
block and I would weather whatever is
inside it belongs to the block like an
object so if you would have a Java class
with block the idea would be the private
and methods belong to the class but you
cannot do this in distributed
environment so instead of using a class
I'm using a package or whatever is in
the in the package it belongs to block
and now the problem is another problem
they like accident is that if you are if
you are in a Java environment we know
already that we need a dedicated
external interface it has to be
coarse-grained because of the
communication so we can say ok we need
at least one boundary and usually we
need some persistence so we need the
entity and controls are optional but I
always use the 3 packages and now the
question is what happens if you have
some common stuff so usually you would
have two components which are able to
communicate with each other so this is
ok this is ok this is not ok why we have
no no no no time right now to answer why
this is not ok but this can ask this
could call boundary can and call another
control control can call control and
entity has to call entity because
otherwise joints would be not possible
so if you have some common stuff what
you can do you can you can introduce a
pseudo components it's like components
which are only visible visible within
the layer and so this control could call
this control but there is no boundary so
no external client will be able to
access this this is I hope explanation
this is the cross-cutting concerns and
another cross-cutting consulates say I
have something which is not
business-related like logging then I
would really create a pack
with the name logging so this is the
idea okay fingers is clear so of course
if you have some some more cross-cutting
or senses a little bit ugly but it is
better than you know just putting it
somewhere else so I mean whatever it
belongs it belongs here
to the layer and the layer is called
business I get another question why I
need business at all but for now all the
components business components are
reside in the package business okay
I hope question answered and nothing is
perfect but it works surprisingly well
yeah
Shai put even says yeah
it says ok I'm right so thank you Mathis
so um I think we answered now these two
questions cross-cutting concerns and why
I'm using this structure and not the
other one so because I like to how it's
called locality a locality principle so
if I have to modify let's say the
screencast I would open the package and
hope whatever belongs to screencast is
within the package the for question
could you maybe elaborate your choice of
makita and other tools
well I'm way back I use easy mark and J
mock and it was nice but Makita is why I
started to use Maki to it I think it was
2009 or 10 because it's that simple one
jar and actually most of the
documentation of makita is actually Java
doc of the class mojito and I introduced
mojito and whether I like it or not it
doesn't actually matter but developer
from my projects really like that and
this is a very good sign because you
know if you introduce something what you
really like you like it
and it will work but if other developers
like your choice this is actually a very
good sign
never got any compliance against mockito
so everyone was really happy with with
it and probably I will look again and
and an easy mark J mark or whatever but
right now mojito is just perfect so um
the perfect means simple and I didn't
miss missed anything so far so this is
actually the the the question from Tran
Minho though what what I didn't actually
wanted to do to compare all the tools
but actually I felt okay this is the
dhih dhih dhih dhih dhih right question
I think mojito is the simplest possible
one which you can really easily learn
it's actually one class mojito and all
the methods are static methods which you
can statically import and there's
actually the least possible magic and
this is actually widespread in most of
Java EE projects I see are using mojito
ready so okay so I think we answered
this so there is nothing
what problems of benefits can I have
running Java six application serve on
Java 7 vm can I use example try with
resources or switch case with strings
the question and the answer is of course
so I I think as since Java 7 came out I
always run everything I had on Java 7 so
you can perfectly use it I actually run
whatever I can on Java 8 right now I
actually on my service so where the
block is running I think I only have
Java 8 installed there is no Java 7
anymore I'm not really sure whether my
laptop is Java 8 I think Java 7 I think
I had installed everything I have just
Java 8 running with Java 8 you should be
a little bit more careful because
because in in Java 8 we we added the
last actual because in Java 8 they
extended the bytecode with invokedynamic
and some proxy frameworks on
approximate bytecode manipulation
framers cannot deal with it but if your
application service starts and you are
able to perform basic dependency
injection with some proxying so just I
would and in your case just start you
know an EJB and inject CDI to it and
I've wrapped the CDI managed bean with
intercepting filter for instance if this
works if this works perfect then you can
just run your application server on Java
8 so I had some trouble with glass we
should back then but it is fixed and
white flag GlassFish all major
application servers are able to run on
Java 8 yes I think question answered so
Twitter see whether there is someone in
chant probably someone asks the question
here no ok then the next one the next
one how should someone make an e
application configurable during runtime
is there a standardized way to do it
just of course no standardized way
because it's more or less business
requirement there is no configuration
API and it could be one but there is
there is none right now and funny enough
short story I'm asked about this a lot
and sometimes I was even forced to
implement this for my clients or they
expected me to implement and
configuration forever before the project
even started and funny also it was
cheaper for me to implement such a thing
instead of argue with them they they
were convinced we need a fully
configurable software system in
production and you should and of course
it never went to production and why not
because there was no use case for this
and there was no no stakeholder who was
who wanted actually to change anything
in production so I'm not a huge fan of
and in a running system in production
but what you could do is you could
introduce a producer's CDI produces and
I let's implement this I think it is
faster to to Hector's new project I will
use maven with my own archetype and it
was also asked a lot on the recent Java
EE Ericsson Munich Airport configuration
and and we implemented this together
actually several times so let's imagine
I would just improvise some pseudocode
or one why not real code configuration
servlet and I would use come in hex
prefix so this is perfect and then in
this the same package a class called how
call it screencast screencast and a
screencast is EJB and say the eg B has
to be configured so and configured means
I would like to have something injected
and let's say a message it has to be
configurable in this message I would
like to inject in order to make
configuration work
I need injection work and it been 6 ml
because Java is 7 I would like to inject
everything and I implement a
configurator and the configurator has a
method called whatever whatever but this
method needs to return strings and
produces the string and I expect an
injection point IP
this injection point provides me with
the member declaring class let's do it a
little bit nicer introduce variable this
is class plus was a backwater class get
name and plus plus IP get member get
name so what happens right now I get the
injection point and now I can get the
fully qualified name of the class and
fully qualified name of the field which
is unique in the whole project I can go
to the database fetch the value and
inject it and my screen class class I
could just say string message return
highly configurable message high
configurable message configuration
servlet configurator now configurator
what I wanted to have a screencast
screencast @inject and what I wanted to
do is a seeded message message so let's
build this and see whether it works it
should I never tried actually with
servlets I always use Jack's alright so
far but let's see run and this is
configuration servlet I will use the I
think this one is running home hopefully
if not we get some configuration and
this was con confi configuration servlet
Oh it works so I didn't expect this but
it works because its life so you see I
injected the key and the key had to be
resolved from it from a database table
or XML or whatever and now but it's not
life so what you can do you could of
course say
the problem with this is it is jet it
gets injected only once per beam
instance it could be cached so to make
it life you can do something like this
this and then say message get and now it
should be life so let's say class
as you can see this is life
configuration right on each click
something else and I think let's try
this if you remove the instance yeah by
the way I got the question per email and
it couldn't believe it so I and you see
this is cached so this is normal life
for this cached one pay instance so if
the beam is going to be destroyed it
would be injected
I hope the question is fully answered so
you won't believe it but I got a
question paper email someone wanted to
deploy locally application to GlassFish
and asked me what is the easiest
possible way to do this so I'm of course
NetBeans Java and and click and you get
exactly the same environment I have
right now so what I'm using right now
for all my screencasts on my projects
actually using NetBeans all the time I
also enjoy using IntelliJ so if licensed
IntelliJ and I really like it but for
most of the time most of the time all
the time I using IntelliJ IntelliJ
NetBeans for all my projects and
IntelliJ just to see something different
and I try to avoid eclipse if possible
so um but who cares about the ideas
actually so you can oh please don't
download it right now so this is if you
if you download this this is actually
what I'm what I'm using okay I hope the
question is answered so questions no
questions okay next one so developing
Swim client with a GB back-end would you
include deployment you need to transfer
in the package name no I never would do
this because it is actually not that
good idea sometimes the class shift
between client and server and you will
have to affect everything just because
it causes nowhere on the server but on
the client so um what I usually do what
I always differentiate is between
presentation classes and business logic
classes this is my differentiation so
because I think it is a good idea to
separate the business logic from the
presentation because the presentation
changes frequently but let's say if the
client uses a utility and the services
and a utility and it's just a utility
class or a business logic class I would
not put the class to client on server
package just because it belongs to the
client I think this is the job of
deployment then it would be actually a
good idea to create an AR for the client
and Ja for the server and packaging is
in my I should be logical and and
otherwise you will have to repackage
repackage the refactor the application
just because you decided to no deploy
more or less classes but if it whatever
I say if it works well to you go for it
so you shouldn't you know you shouldn't
listen to this to this ax and then
refactor all the application because I
said something it is just what I would
do in my projects with basically means
nothing so I only see a limited amount
of projects and I'm developing what Java
from from from from 1997 or 9 1995
actually but this is just just me so um
I think we've got a question here the
can the first question I don't see what
you see I don't see what you see sample
applications are what I did Gregor is I
created servlet and ejected and egb
whose local and remote and tested the
performance and just used a visual VM
and and the
and the corrective performance and there
was actually not the call so the egb
were not measurable so it was crazy fast
performance but I could share the
project by the words just waste so um I
could even tweet it because as almost
nothing there so um so IDI inject is
even more magic
I am it was a twit and I'm not sure what
it actually what it actually meant but I
think it refers to something I do
frequently yes I'm often using often
using package private field so there is
no private whatever is injected is just
injected without using the keyword
private and and someone complains it is
too much magic because someone could
could use the reference directly so I
thought I'd try to do is to reproduce
this and there's a boundary with
injected course control and a servlet no
magic servlet with injected boundary and
what I try to do is I try to access
directly the field CC and then invoke
the message so I would just try to run
it and this is I think no magic servlet
as you can see the field is null which
is interesting so if I access the field
directly it is null and and then I get
back the the the the message so why now
this is French and I would like to
explain it to you why now and draw
something there is indeed some magic how
eg B's and and usually CGI operate so
what usually happens is the following so
you have an eg B and we have a servlet
and the servlet would like to use the eg
B because both are in the same package
would actually would never
be the case in my projects because the
BC pattern but let's imagine it would be
possible then the servlet could access
the injected field so this eg B uses a
CDI beam this would be D control this is
the boundary this is D control and this
eg B uses the CDI beam so the sublet
could access the fields directly here
right so um so I did it and this was
null but it worked so it means it's not
but not null why this is because what
usually happens the container creates a
subclass of the eg B this is the proxy
and in the subclass you have all the
fields but if you try to access the
fields they are null because they do not
matter the proxy just uses delegation to
access the real thing and between the
proxy and the real thing there is a
bunch of interceptors I would say
actually AOP aspects which who cares or
which care for about transactions
security threading monitoring session
handling and stuff like this and this is
the actual overhead of the aspects is
actually the actual overhead of eg BCD I
whatever a little bit more dangerous is
between CDI beans because if you have
CDI bean and another bean was dependent
scope dependent scope Minster is not
annotated it is actual are reference to
the actual class so then you could
change the fields but if you would even
attempt this usually something like
sonic qube or Sona source will scream
right so this wouldn't pass any any any
quality control and I would say in
swordsman Java accessing the fields
should be forbidden in source test Java
is absolutely okay it's just a test so
whatever your hack is okay okay
I hope the question is answered and
sufficiently covered no questions then
the next one so we are really fast very
fast and we are ok for today links
inside resources for Nilla F a prior
student of a hex so eager student
and so this the question is do we have
rest resources and the rest resources so
we have jax-ur a service with sub
resources and I think in the yacht ela
refers to the talk I gave for DJ econ
jax-rs
about jax-rs and java 7 and I shot
something with resources and subsidy
sources and the question is ok really
nice but how to deal with links because
usually what you will have is you have a
business object and this business object
is dependent on other objects and if you
would like to implement lazy loading you
will have to implement somehow the
linking between both and this is you
have to do it by yourself so what you
will need you need a detail which cares
about the resources but there is
something interesting JP a I think RS
and this is an eclipsing project and
what the eclipse link project does it
exposes directly JPA entities via
restful services and all the
dependencies between the entities are
represented as links and this is
actually a really nice example for
building a restful api so they have
rests hopefully where is it yeah so you
see get persistence version unit aim
entity type ID and then there were some
composite keys there's persist merge
relationships and this becomes
interesting the relationship is nothing
else and then a link and the JPI RS is
able to deal with with links between
entities I think there are similar
project for for open JPA called jest I
think just open JP a yes
similar to JP IRS is just the idea that
you can just expose directly JP a
entities as resources with linking so
the question is yeah you have to do
something about this but you there are a
frameworks like JP RS or open JP do it
for you so
just look what they are doing and just
still steal the ideas so okay I hope
question is answered or at least
discussed so we cannot go into the deep
because it was spent I think one week
with lively life event but I hope and
you know where to start with with
linking okay the next one is why the
package name business and because it
seems redundant and this is a good one
because I always use business in my
screencast and it stops with this and it
would be extremely redundant and the
answers usually there is also
presentation so in my project there is
one war with business and I get another
package called presentation and in
presentation if I have GSF the whole JSF
GSP or struts code is in presentation in
the business is the business code and
sometimes I even have integration which
just cares about integration resources
or what it means integration resources
like if you have a crazy legacy system
which is hard to do to access then I
would implement or implement create an
integration package with the whole
excess logic or for instance if you have
to implement a GC a connector JC a
connector API then I would do this so so
again what I'm a huge fan of is not
probably monolithic deployment but but a
I would say atomic atomic deployment
what it actually means is I have one war
usually so actually I think the last
year I develop is about unknown
2006 or something so um since then
adjust using worse since Java 6 Java 6
came out I think 2009 since 2009 so um
so imagine this is the war and within
the war I have a presentation package
and business package
and within the business package we have
the components we talked earlier so with
PC within the presentation I have
whatever whatever the application is
there's actually no clear structure
because really depends was it as a
single page up or not or workflow
application whatever and usually I would
start for simple applications JSF jsps
or whatever server centric framework
Vardhan era whatever and this is why I
always separate a code between business
and presentation so the business should
not be dependent on presentation if the
if the business logic has to to
communicate as a presentation I would
usually used CDI events and nothing else
whatever else is forbidden so there
should be no coupling between business
so the business should should should not
know that presentation exists and the
easiest possible way is to introduce
another package otherwise you will have
to do to implement two modules which is
huge overhead and usually if you deploy
the application you would like to deploy
everything and not just a part of it
yeah this is the reason let's see
question no question so Twitter is quiet
today
so I switched it down on what's the
problem so say at least hello
where was the test also nothing here so
I think we clarified the business
what do you generally see as the
potential problems on components call
each other across different runtime
advanced like je spring is it a better
day and should we just took with pure
spring yes so if you have spring already
in place I wouldn't I would never mix
spring with Java because you know there
are two injection models to life cycle
models and spring has transactions java
application server has transactions so
if you are happy with spring does use
spring forgot about cydia 8gb whatever
but I would never use spring on java
application server and there is
because there's too much overlap I would
use print on Tomcat jetty
I forgot this server this was a nice
Tomcat extension from frumpy bottle
t.server I think it's the name so is
this but never run spring on Java
why because you get @inject from CDI
@inject from spring and what it actually
means is yeah you will have to to
explain to developers why there are so
many annotations which are doing exactly
the same or similar stuff so I think
lots of hello hello perfect so it works
so what are the best practice to avoid
naming company who's backing beans in
JSF so I'm I use exactly the same what
Rito hearts actually suggested I'm named
the backing being exactly the same as a
JSF then you can of course get conflicts
but usually what I would do I'd use the
dot notation or just name it after the
component so if you have booking I would
call this car booking and flight booking
it is actually a good idea and probably
is a good idea to rename the IDI JSF
pages as well because if you have
booking HTML two times it's really hard
if you if you are dealing you know with
with the deployment I would just rename
the JSF pages to to booking
flight booking and car booking with
underscore or just camel case camel case
a little bit problematic and then rename
the the manage pins correspondingly okay
no nice so this is the first time ever
some sometimes someone refers life to as
I see myself so this is actually this is
like mirror is actually only possible in
a virtual in a virtual environment nice
so I'm there was a I brought the post I
wrote a post I think it was I don't know
two or three years ago DTO versus vos
and son named the first time value
objects very objects which was wrong
because very objects with value objects
means something different and they
renamed very object pattern to data
transfer object pattern and but this is
our the province said something really
really interesting so DT all could be
more useful in distributed systems yes
it is actually only useful in
distributed systems because if you have
to know pass data between layers if you
if you if you look at the origin DTO
definition you will find that the data
transfer objects were meant to first to
transport data of the entity beans
container manage persistence entity
beans to the client and there was
actually no way to serialize the entity
beans so this was actually the job of DT
OS but we forgot about this if you
really like to see the intentions behind
tto search for DTO j2ee patterns and you
should find exactly the transfer object
and this actually defines what is the
what is the actually idea behind it and
you see you want clients to access
components in other tiers to retrieve an
update data other tiers it already
implies somehow network so if you don't
have a network between don't between the
client and the service or the user and
the nd service you don't have to use d
tos and there are I think the one of the
most overused patterns
oh great
great question so what do you think
about GS front and angular backbone and
Java back-end to substitute the old
enterprise apps egb JSF and J's piece
what I think so I like angular I like
actually JavaScript and html5 html5 a
lot html5 is semantic I really like it
and by the way we have a one day
discussion about this it is Java EE UI
in Java EE html5 so Justin shameless
plug because it is less about the
adverts about this but more that someone
who attended it could say yes so we just
argued the whole day what is actually
better JSF J's peas and html5 and it
really depends on application so very
very very briefly the problem with was
angular and and all single-page apps
they are not that great for SEO s
and server-side components server-side
frameworks a lot better for SEO search
engine optimizations also if you are
looking at GSE JSF just F are really
easy and very productive to use in in
typical enterprise apps without you know
high demand on what on UI but if you
would like to implement very good
pixel-perfect
applications I think you will have to
employ you code the html5 route so I
would say in enterprise you could use
JSF and be happy with it but if you are
using just F what you are what I would
use for sure is I will point my client
to the components suit of primefaces
rich faces or whatever and say we can
build the applications for you but we
will only use components you see here
and there is no changes to the component
because if you start to know to to tweak
the components it is actually the
beginning of the end so this is the
short answer
so for for instance in all my open
source project if you have to create
something quickly I would go with JSF
and if I have more demand on you know
loading I would probably start with
angular right now he's actually my
honest answer and there's also a place
for Java exo-m this is the same story
Java fix on the client I'm more
productive than before for us with
angular why because Java vixx's Java so
they can use exactly the same
infrastructure angular is JavaScript I
need two builds to quality assurance
environments and in my eyes if you are
able to use one programming language you
are always more productive than using
multiple programming languages but this
will be actually a great question for
the next year hex IO tokens security
framework and tokens I think there was
one is open IDM this was the prior
framework from sun they provide SSO and
single sign-on and stuff like this I
will look at this first and there's also
a apache forgot the name a nice one from
apache forgot a name
but thank you for for the questions
right now so um uh also an interesting
question where do Jess if beans go in
this structure so Jesse just F beans I
would put two presentation package but
not I would not replicate this structure
from the business package why not
because what what I saw so far is that
there's no one-to-one relation of streak
one to one or one to one relation
between views and back-end components
usually you get n to M so if you are
able to do the same structure and
presentation business great but usually
you are not able to do this okay so just
forget this okay so I hope I answered a
question DT oh I think killed so and
this is a very interesting one is it
possible to implement HTTP session with
J station that've etcetera and not
cookie or URL and this is great one and
the problem is if you have it is
possible in but not with Java EE or with
with servlets why not because even if
you would
you serve servlet filters or container
requests it is actually after the
sessions already established because you
can access the session already in the in
the filter and the filter is the
earliest possible errors possible
component which gets access to the
session so what it could use on the
application server on the application
server you can replace HTTP response
which is proprietary so this Tomcat is
able to do this and then you could do
whatever you like but in I just looked
and the GlassFish configuration what you
can do in GlassFish you can rename DJ
session ID do something else and you can
also force GlassFish and other
application servers just to use cookie
and never you are out of writing so this
is called HTTP only and this is part of
the spec so what aspect suggests that
the application server would be able to
rename the j session i do something else
in a configurative way and yeah this is
what what you can do but what you cannot
do is just pass or token whatever like
and and and and just change the token to
a session I says I'm not aware of this I
just look at it spec and play a little
bit with several filters and then
occurred to me that actually this J
session ID happens at the very early
stages where you have no control about
the whole process I think if there are
no questions we are done which is
surprising so we are 10 minutes faster
than the last time which is actually
great so um I will just look at the at
the regular chat where is it the Ustream
chat if you have any questions ask the
questions on Twitter and of course
submit the questions to Twitter our also
gather the the comments as always from
my blocks and after the show ends of and
so forth and wait a minute I forget
something
so I favorited some stuff so Christian
Farland asked me sorry so I have just go
quickly over this is there any good way
to debug concurrency locks
what we what I use in the past and this
was the only way we could find some
problems we used Mission Control
yes Mission Control doors is from J
rocket and this was the owner
environment we were able to find
deadlocks with even the new concurrency
API so I would I will look at this and
this and the feature is is commercial
right now is it's called I think flight
flight control a little bit confused
with Dax but I should the name should be
fight control okay what do you think
about just pick good enough a little bit
a little bit complex with the messaging
but I mean if you needed you need it and
before you you you are looking to the to
adjust peak look briefly at Java EE
security Adam bean what we can do out of
the box with an article for Java
magazine and were it was horse somewhere
here so what we can do with very
primitive means with CDI produces and
and and servlet so just try this first
and then see whether you need additional
framework okay then responsive design in
JSF and yes
you're absolutely right novice this is
actually the pass-through feature is
very good responsive design
I mean if you are really about a
responsive design you probably don't
like to use any components and then it's
just F as good as jsps I would say so
the the point of responsive design
ingest F actually the component provider
like primefaces will have to implement
responsive design for you and and if you
if you would like to do it by yourself
in Jess F I think you are already
the wrong path yeah this would be my you
cannot be too drastic we discuss
actually a Dax and then you attend the
DDD workshop so um you can of course use
just you know very no components and all
just standard which comes out of the box
and then just the binding so that you
would get something out of this but yeah
but you know the the best possible case
for JSF is take primefaces for instance
you can get all the components for free
for free your clients if it is perfectly
happy with the components you don't have
to adjust anything you are perfectly set
if the client is not happy with the
components you have a lot of stuff to do
which which probably will kill the whole
idea of JSF and you will have to go with
angular html5 or whatever but we can
discuss them then the next time I think
we are almost over time and let's see
what else so I have to kill of ie
Internet Explorer it's always good idea
to kill I may as well just joke actually
did the recent IES are very good so if
you have two recent one should work and
don't know what the context is so um
yeah but a recent II's are perfect and
the and the oldest are not that good so
I'm thank you for watching see you next
month so you can already subscribe to
the show new streams at this time there
is a button so you get reminded pair me
it's not necessary but if you like you
can do this and thank you for watching
oh how can I disable the passivation for
an stateful egb it can be done in the
admin console of the application server
and this is and this is proprietary so
there is no there is no spec doesn't
dictate the deactivation of the
passivation but I'm actually not sure
whether Java 7 introduced us that
passivation I would have to look at this
because we discussed this at least so
I'm
I always deactivate passivation for
stateful session beans does not make any
sense in my eyes so and this was always
proprietary administrative task which
has nothing to do had nothing do with
Java and I will look at this Peck it
will be a great question for the mixture
was I would try to look at the spec and
find out whether it is a part of a spec
right now or not so um so then thank you
for watching and see you on one of
upcoming conferences workshops so we
have in July a hex Munich's as full as
always and but there's still places
seats left so if you really look like to
attend come in in July and we have a
special event about software quality and
you know how to build you know robot
software and and matrix and sonar and
testing and all the stuff because
there's lots of requests about this
about the workshops conference talks and
so far so there is in July also a
special event just about this and yeah
thank you for watching see you at the X
projects or even back shops thank you
