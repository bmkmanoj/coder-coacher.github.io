would like to introduce you to the FN
project at i/o which is the server's
platform for different languages in
today we will just look at Java
installation fairly easy in comprises
download download of our single binary
so it is the project is written in go so
there are no external dependencies so
it's it's already installed and then as
in any other service platform the first
thing you have to do is to start the
server which is with the command line
interface FN start so it starts the
server and the interesting thing is if
we just switch to another terminal it's
a docker server so it starts a docker
run time the server and what's also ever
available is the UI is fully optional
it's written in note and I would like to
start it and give name UI so I will
start it as well so and what happens now
it starts an app with a port 4000 and it
connects to the API server where the
port 8080 so it's like fully optional
but nice so we have everything started
to dhaka images so we have one this is
the UI project and the functions project
our server and the city you also ui
server ok so now let's start with
playing Java project so I would like to
call it hello and this project just
comprises no dependency is a simple
chart project so nothing special and I
would like to create a Java class and
call that hello
and what we also need is a method so
let's proceed with that string call me a
string input and let's say hello from
serverless server plus input so let's do
this um so this is just the function we
would like to deploy in call so what we
also need is is a file and this is a
Hamel file so we need and what is it
yeah Mel yeah and the name has to be
funk and this we need actually three
pieces of informations of version 0 0 1
then we need the runtime which let's say
it's Java 9 and then the command and the
command is the fully qualified class
name and the class was hello
and then in function or method name
called me so this is the Java file and
the only problem is we have to rename it
from funk yeah yml to funk dot Jana
ok now we are ready to go and let's
deploy the function so this works with F
and deploy yeah and then we need with my
nose- app the app name hello app hello
app and then the local is important so
what the local does it tells the service
that we would like to have deployed to
the local docker registry without the
local would try to push to the public
docker hub and it will require me to
provide my username so let's try that so
what happens now it builds this project
with maven and pushes it to the to the
service and
we have the hello route using image
hello 0:02 so dust attack so FN apps
list so we have one app is called hello
hello app so now go here to 4000 and we
see here the hello app so and this is
the function version zero zero two and
we could run the function now and what
you can see it expects parameters here
let's say parameter is Duke and it's
just no Jason it's just string so we can
run it and the answer is hello from
server less server Duke and by the way
we are we don't have to use that over
the second run function we could of
course use the command line as well the
command line copy so let's try that this
and just hello so this is the
application name and the the d function
name hello and not API rather than
localhost localhost so and almost there
the only problem is yeah we have to use
something more sensible like Duke of
course and hello from server a server
Duke and right now we have just two
docker containers and this the d
function is going to be started and
stopped by the server we could also run
the function for a longer time this is
so called hot function so I think it's
not for impression so thank you for
watching and see you at Eric's
conferences workshops or projects so
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
