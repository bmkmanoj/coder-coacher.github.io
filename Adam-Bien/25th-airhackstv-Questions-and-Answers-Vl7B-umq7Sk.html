oviya xtv the last time someone
commented I are actually not two years
ovx there were almost two years so so we
can celebrate again and this time you
have something special special mac java
and particular prius you know sun
microsystems you so as you can see so i
would say in 10 years of the XD v we can
celebrate a mark with with Oracle on it
but right now is the first log of java i
think i got it around i would say to
around 2000 and yeah so we have 22 years
of continuous answering and and then and
questioning java and java ee so okay
let's start with the question there are
lots of questions this time almost 30
questions so let's start with java ee
news and for this purpose i would like
to i would like to start with the java e
news and project docklands so i was a
little bit busy and created some some
new images for for docklands i started
with what docklands is is a set of is a
set of simple doc images and it started
with pyara and white flight and now i
got a web celebrity profile and weblogic
server and post-crescent derby databases
as well as headlands in various in
various flavors so i use it heavily
sometimes as a base for my projects and
sometimes for workshops and trainings
and on this note related i use the
docklands in two screencasts both are
about a month all
and the overt of java application
servers in this screencast i described
or described tried to show you the
overhead using the j visualvm so I'm so
like looking inside the JVM what happens
and this screencast i launched websphere
liberty profile weblogic pyara whitefly
tommy and had a world up and compare
this to a hello world application and I
look from outside so i just measured the
comp list size of dhaka image with I
guess surprising results so this is a
bit of a story so this and of course
also interesting so I got about more
than 5,000 subscribers with actually big
big news and almost 350,000 views and so
Java nudes there is an interesting new
twitter handle called Java guardians and
very active and so the breaking news is
17 minutes old james gosling is behind
java and and work today soon to follow
the java guardians twitter handle and
behind this is very active Razor Ramon a
nice guy former java ee evangelist and
he really cares about java it tries to
push it forward and yeah so if you would
like to see know what the java ee
underground is doing so subscribe to to
the java or subscribe follow the java
guardians and you know the interesting
part is interesting part they try to
push jerry forward regardless what what
happens so this is java guardians also
interesting there is a really nice blog
post from sebastian tashna is the author
and creator of jax-rs analyzer a nice
tool which generates documentation from
from jax-rs from Jack source annotations
and what what what he did was actually
what I also do as he said stop saying
heavyweights I usually don't do this if
someone mentions Java is heavy weight I
would like exactly know what is meant is
it cpu / hat is this runtime sighs its
deployment speed what is it so what is
heavy weight and I try to measure it and
compare it and nothing is heavy weight
so I always challenged the someone who
mentions Java is too heavy weight or too
bloated or whatever I would like exactly
know what is meant by this and he did
nice write up so he compared compared to
describe the build time artifact size
deployment I'm memory consumptions and
so interesting summary I did the same in
a screencast so I'm read that I would
just post it to our chat and so you have
something to read that evening so
perfect then a little bit of drama of
java drama Ariane teams of Java 8 ask
about Java timeline and Billy Shannon
said our team is working on other
assignments currently and the schedule
to incorporate these components hasn't
not bid worked out yet sorry so what it
means the Oracle EG is doing something
else what no one knows and now they have
no resources for java 8 and and no one
knows what happens and i mean it is good
and bad so a good me because the other
folks get chance to do something and we
should see and wait what happens in my
eyes if some specs become inactive we
could just take them over I mean this is
part of the process we could try to help
Oracle if there is no resources for java
8 and just you know just step up and try
to support this and some specs already
operate this wake like for instance CD
is entirely entirely in the charge of of
red hat or arion teams does a really
great
up in Java 8 huge amount of work so why
not I don't think Oracle has to invest
too much in Java 8 it should be in a
community effort and to be honest Java 7
is a pretty stable already it's not like
we need to know another evolution with a
huge amount of resources and yeah so a
little bit of drama and this were
basically a Java 8 News what news from
from from my side I'm working I
implementing some features for any
hitter ater for the for the data data
transformation pipeline breaker get some
new updates light fish guts already some
updates and I'm thinking about the
afterburner to kind of plug-in mechanism
because I got so many contributions and
I would like to make the features
pluggable so this is what happens in my
leisure and now back to the topics let's
see whether we have any questions no
questions of course not I got some
tweets so and so I get the the first
question was a via email and someone
asked me do you think netbeans is still
a good idea for java java HTML and as
single page applications development in
2016 i'm thinking netbeans becomes
better and better and this is one of the
problems my problems why I always use
the daily builds for instance for
instance the there is a nice docket
support with docker containers and it
comes with nuts on support so I use it
all the time and this is a fairly recent
daily build and so I yeah and he did you
question no comparing to IntelliJ
IntelliJ is even better I'm an even
better is more powerful in my eyes net
means a little bit more usable so easier
to use in and some better integrated
better out-of-the-box experience can
just download the new
it intelligence a little bit more of
friction but as the tool is even more
powerful and he also asks using eclipse
and SDS so on either like eclipse a lot
and the only reasons why I don't like it
is because the you know proliferation of
plugins and I don't like spend my time
to setting up the dids so this times are
over so um another question I got
according to afterburner is how to
access the other side so we have a
service and the service is injected to
the controller and the question is how
the service can can can notify the
controller and the answer is of course
using events or data binding in Java fix
this is why we need data binding so the
request could has a reference to this
service and the service and the
presenter could register itself Andrew
safety events so now the first official
question from March ninth and this is a
nice one from Abby rocks and the
question is about ejb vs CDI and and the
future java 8 and 9 seems to be
following there are multiple components
EG be and CDI at the same time and now
he asked more detailed questions know
what to do with it so II gb model
predates CDI and as he asked about
unification so what I did I created
several issues in in the issue tracker
and in my opinion what should happen we
should either get the puller bill
annotation and CDI to make the CDI beans
poo level or we should make the GBD pool
size and win precise standardized right
now is just proprietary XML feature this
should happen and in if we get CDI pull
Abel CDI with a view stereotypes we
could actually replace it should be
entirely where they kill the entire jess
r which would be nice
cause then here because then Java
becomes even simpler it's just I know
one less API always good so the next one
is what is the benefit of extracting
should be features putting concurrency
scheduling in a separate specification
so and this is also this was a little
bit my criticism because I don't care
what it is whether the CDI oag be the
most I see I always saw Java EE as an
entire thing which is usable whether i'm
getting the features from egb spec or
CDI i really don't care and and none of
the application developers who has
something to do from the business
perspective really care and actually at
the hexa munich i don't even you know I
just hacked the application and and
don't spend too much time explaining
whether it is a heb or CD i SPECT no one
cares I think what we should do we
should combine all the specs and and and
for productivity and and stopping in or
arguing what's what's better and
whatever but having that said EG bees
are the fastest and it was it was the
performance was measured several times
so as interesting and why is interesting
because i know some project where they
killed each obese because they were
afraid of performance and in turn turn
out that performance vgb is just
outstanding good so I want to just
continue stateless singleton stateful
this is exactly my opinion so it works
perfectly well but if we get pull Abel I
would be ready now to kill to kill a GBC
why not so so RB rocks just reached my
mind so what is wrong we having to model
models nothing in my eyes however the
CDI guys care a lot to do to be you know
to have the feature parity to EG bees
and and i can understand it that the
data just would like to have no one
single component model but having that
set in none of my projects there were
any issue so no one complained that i
don't know--i jeebies behave differently
to see the IRS EDI to it should be and
there was actually no question that the
XD v
for the two years so there's none issue
in the practice but a lots of issues in
the in the mailing list so uh would you
be a suspect be duplicated is that safe
I think in one point of time is going to
be duplicated is it bad no because I
think what we could do then we should
consider at stateless a stereotype which
comes with monitor able to label and
transactional and inverse possible case
I will just replace all at stateless
with my stereotype writing a simple
script so this is not a huge risk and
yeah I I don't have a lot of EG BS i
usually use EG bees as a boundary and
everything else can be gb what does not
have 20 cave onyx 2000 so before I move
on let's see whether some there are some
questions in the chat no questions in
the chat lazy chat and Twitter also no
question the Twitter but i can ask
answer a question from from twitter some
clients are only running tomcat can i
create micro servers using CDI and
transaction at the put a war on tomcat
actually you can use micro servers using
food a fully-fledged weblogic or
websphere it doesn't actually no matter
if you cannot believe it to watch this
screencast i'll show you earlier but
what i did one of my hands is an unable
to run tom cat what I did then I Nissan
to the Tomcat the Java e+ and I got the
full stack Java EE so I wouldn't bother
just to install CD I I would just push
the war to tomcat to go to the Tommy
side so let's see whether we will find
it so Tommy so this is what you need and
Tommy comes with distribution as a war
so so you can deploy a war that there
are some downloads stand alone in a war
that and download and if you if you get
the sea drop in wars so you can you can
transform a tomcat to a fully functional
Java server with almost no difference in
in runtime almost no difference runtime
is actually we find example to test it
right just running a tomcat and dropping
the the java ee war and see what the
difference is actually it could be it's
an interesting idea for for a screencast
yeah why not so thank you music for 40
for the idea and so an idea of how to
test interceptor bindings a thing to
test interceptor bindings I mean I
wouldn't test the intercept to bind it's
rather than interceptors because I hope
interceptors interceptors bindings are
already tested with the application
server but I would test interceptors
using something like delta spike it's a
little bit easier than then arquillian
is just perfect for this okay so so we
had this so let's see the next one
boundary control entity so I'm I use
controls from boundaries of another
business component I thought the classes
in side control package are not exposes
to other business components they
absolutely are so in boundary control
entity you are one boundary from one
component can get injected controls from
other components it is not best practice
but it is absolutely necessary to do so
why it is necessary because otherwise
you will end up having lots of empty
interfaces is bounded only for external
usage yes boundary should be the API and
calling from boundary to boundary is
unusual it's not prohibited but almost
prohibited so I really try to avoid it I
only have jax-rs access would I only
place the rest endpoint here in a
boundary package you would place the
jax-rs resource and the ejb which has
nothing to do with paths or the boundary
comprises at list at least a resource
jax-rs resource plus a facade or our
service which is an e gb so it is
annotated with that stateless and it
coordinates the others so a scene which
ones for crutch I have simple crutch and
the question is
so all the all the requests takes less
than a second doesn't make sense to use
suspended async responsible dedicated
managed execute the service so first I
would like to draw something so first
the thing with the boundary so it's a
recurring question so why not to draw so
the question was I by component is a
boundary boundary control entity nice
component and the other component is
even nicer boundary control entity in
the question list here i have many gb
now sorry a resource so this is jax-rs
and this is a stateless and the question
is how they communicate though we have
we can have here as well jax-rs sorry
stateless this would be stateless
stateless and here could be a check sir
as resource and with dependency
injection and here would be a POJO so
pojo portal plain old resource objects
could be also possible yeah okay POJO so
this ejb can talk to this proj oh
absolutely this egb could talk to this
gb but it's unusual this should never
talk to this so it should only talk here
in this con hit talk here and the best
component would be one stateless with
server with a view pojos and a view
entities and controls are optional so
this is a recap BCE and the next one
with a thing so what's the deal with
acing so the nice staff is if we have
several paths path 1 and 2 and there are
let's say two components in charge of
the path so if you are using managed to
execute or service and let's say we have
via old
a legacy system one and legacy system
too so dogs here and this talks here so
if we use the manage executor service
with async response we got a bucket out
of the box so we can say five threads
here and five threads here and they are
completely separated so if this
component just blocks it will only
affect this path or this component not
the whole application so i actually did
this life during the java ee
microservices workshop so if you're
interested in it just watch the workshop
so am I just tested exactly this how it
behaves if this component gets stuck so
and best practice for long java ee task
long-running java task several minutes
and even several several hours so what
you should do in my eyes you shouldn't
return to 0 1 you should return to 0 to
accept it and just unjust giving an OD
or pushing T as status updates using
using web sockets for instance instead
of an appalling you can just push it and
the best would be if you had something
like let's say scheduler schedule which
pushes the changes and it changes the
state in a database like a state machine
and I implemented something like this if
you go to github and here you can look
at state fool this is like a little
state machine which where you can load
st xml and use HTTP to perform
transformations transformation state
transitions and this could be of course
this could be persistence in the
database doesn't have to but could be
and what you could do of course you can
you know you can transform the internal
state from state to state to state and
on each state transition notify you now
or listeners using web sockets this will
be the best one so at the point is you
should not block so it shouldn't work
like this that you
blocking for several minutes you should
immediately return 202 accepted with an
Ori where the various status can be
checked so another one nice one I get
the question all the time you know
es2015 or es6 versus typescript which
framework to choose should i start with
angular 2 or angular 1 I would say so
angular 15 will have some angular 2
compatibility but it really depends when
you go live angular 2 is already it's
already available not and thing is beta
so you can use it right now and I think
it's a lower risk to use angular 2 then
starting with angular 1 this is what I
would do but it really depends where you
are going life if you have to go live
tomorrow then use angular 15 so the next
one is broke breaking up monolithic
plain old java are textured down to
microservices plain old actually if you
follow me I actually always propagated
something like having you know
monolithic war which is small and talks
to other Wars back then i would say
probably seven years ago or something i
I propagated more remote method
invocation because comes out of the box
and there were no web clients and right
now I would rather choose Jax tourettes
over ere mi because our mi is is no more
supported as well by most applications
or support as well it's not no more
pushed forward by by by jdk so so it's
not plain old but the question is the
bigger thing what I'm thinking about
this transaction management across micro
service calls so the answer is forget
about this so even if you will get
remote method invocation you will have
to to handle X a exceptions so X a
exception happens if you have two phase
commit which can happens via Cobra and
what you will have to do for instance
you should be able to handle holistic
mix where one service is committed
and the other one roll back also my one
of my favorites is heuristic has it
which means i did something but i forgot
what and yeah so i would say it is not a
best practices to try to it was never a
best practice to have independent
services and trying to coordinate then
and then using a a seat transaction so
what you should rather the question is
then so what i should do then so what
you should do is you should design these
services in idempotent way and the other
idempotent way what it actually means so
on exception you should be able to
repeat the service call over and over
again and if it doesn't work you need an
compensative transaction but a
transaction is not an undue rather than
something business like a business undo
so what is a business undo let's say so
if the if the payment doesn't work there
is no unpaid so what you would rather do
you will you will you will ship the the
order back or something like this and
the point is if you if you do this you
need a good connection to the business
department to the domain experts because
it is not possible to to just you know
as a developer to to invent new use
cases so it is possible but is usually
not not supported by the by the business
people and actually we spending several
hours a deal java architectures workshop
last week just talking about exactly
these issues is not possible just to
answer this but the the simple answer is
everything has to be idempotent so the
only danger is post of course at
important means you can repeat the calls
and it's an if it really doesn't work
you need a business road back so a good
one each gmx is gmx still useful now
will it be useful in the future so
igenix is still very useful if you have
the infrastructure in place so in the
infrastructure in place means you have
you have tools which gather the data and
usually such tools used amex
and if I don't have such tools what i
usually do i prefer jax-rs or rest
because it is very easy to monitor such
a system from from from from a distance
and the nice story is if you have of
course rest you are absolutely not
dependent on Java so you can do you can
just use curl and then write simple
scripts to monitor the system and nice
story in Java e you can have a singleton
which exposes balls at the same time at
gmx endpoint end and jax-rs is actually
what i did in in the x-ray project who
are exposing both so i am able to
connect with j visualvm and theorist and
all-stars are ready to use libraries I
have to say I'm less interested in
libraries which provide some
transparency showing me technical stuff
what I think is more important to show
what your application is doing from the
business perspective like you know how
many orders per second are processed how
many were successful and how many were
not successful so just exposing no
decent essential responsibilities of
each component as a rest service I think
this is a paramount feature and whether
I see you know the heap or not there is
not it is less exciting to me so this
one is interesting so this is an ax
alumni and he asked there is one method
called God call from Maine and this
method invokes invokes returns a list
and the list is used by as is used by
services BCD on e and they are
independent from each other and he would
like just to to invoke them in parallel
and how to do this and so the first call
I would implement the call in in
synchronous way so or if it's fast
enough so I get the list back
in the list you could use stream and in
streaming kunis for instance map and
within the map method you can call these
services gather the results and then
transform them in in real time and I
shout how to do is also in the Java EE
microservices workshop so i started with
such things like losing completely like
using completa be future to coordinate
remote services and it works
surprisingly well and so if the stream
works you can you can and try to use
parallel stream and see what happens and
yeah and even if they are in in separate
Wars doesn't matter because you could
use jax-rs client exactly what i did in
the java ee microservices workshop how
to do this looked at computable future
it's called supply async then run and
there are no run both and run easy as
that the result you can build a very
easily a nice pipeline with nothing but
computable future and Jack's Torres
client again just look at the Java EE
microservices workshop and the first the
color balls paralyzation with callable
is exactly what what he asked for
combining pipelines where you can
combine the results from different
services this is actually what i did and
more go look at the sample application
called Java microservice on my github
you will find the source code as well
okay we have this I hope he's happy so
this is also interesting do you know how
to implement the existing product or
standard using jax-rs for retrieving
partial response and what it actually
means this is you have a you have a huge
object and you would like to pass some
parameters and depending on the
parameters you get slices of the object
back and this is not supported directly
by Jack Suarez out of the box so is
another part of the standard but
eclipsed Moxie is able to do this so
there
I think they call it filtering so let's
see eclipse Moxie filtering Jason there
were several and you have to search for
the Moxie client and what what there is
there is a possibility to add to use
annotations and annotate several parts
of the object and with the binding to
the jax-rs let's jax-rs moxie partial
let's see whether we found something was
partial this is i think is this yes this
is exactly what I meant so the idea is
root element attribute and exam element
phone number and then you can somewhere
say they do need a slice a subgraph and
the sub graph can be populated using
jax-rs so look at this and they compile
and combined in one and we just post the
link the problem is of course is not
part of a standard is just it's just
moxie so we just push it to the chat
spell or aprox and into other chant as
well so we have both
okay sharp David asked me about shoot JP
containing business logic why not are
you object and emic it's time to get
rich in 2007 so I'm pretty old almost 10
years old and he looked the light fish
is my monitoring tool and and found no
business logic in the escalation entity
and in Java ABC archetype found some
amount of business logic in registration
so exactly so thank you shop for
reviewing my stuff and and he says okay
I understand this old blog posts the
question is is it still up to date
absolutely so um I would say just you
know prohibiting business logic and
entities is completely wrong sometimes
it is really nice to have to have
polymorphic behavior and there is
actually a really funny page is called
an TF campaign and what it means instead
of using if typeof use this and else
this just use polymorphic behavior I
always show it during the trainings as
well because it's fun so we just put it
to the chat where is the chat here and
the
and my observation is particularly as
expert systems or systems were you are
modeling graphs then is really variable
to have true real object rule object
means if you invoke a method of the
entity you get the entity could change
internal state or you get polymorphic
behavior back for instance transport
planning is a classic one where you have
different routes and different
transports and different vehicles and
you could have you know working with an
abstract vehicle route and and transport
and depending what it is it could be no
container bicycle or highway and and and
and there are only particular vehicles
allowed to go on particular particular
routes and and then it becomes easier to
work with the problem with
object-oriented behavior of courses you
have to done to do the abstractions
right from the beginning and and not
overdo so it's not I think it's a really
bad idea to start to know with abstract
classes without having any idea about
day responsibilities okay so what it
means instead of artificially keeping
the business logic outside the entities
just keep them in the entities and it is
actually a best practice if it belongs
together because entities are two
objects so I'm do it is like is the
sample app from from the effective Java
a7 virtual online workshop and there is
an issue with white fly because the end
injection entity listener doesn't work
and I actually commented this already
and the issue is known by white lie and
therefore I used for this particular for
this particular example I used pyara to
show how it works during the effective
workshop so what I'm talking about there
is a xio they're all my workshops
and this was this the effective one and
there should be somewhere listening or
out it exactly and in this is out in
changing with jpa listeners this doesn't
work on white slab because of a white
slab back okay perfect so Robert asked
question then watch the Java
microservices workshop and say okay is
answered so but what he asked is whether
dhaka should build on every push and the
answer is absolutely because it doesn't
take around 100 milliseconds it is
extremely fast with javi and yes I mean
do you have the same war for your system
test that get deployed in production
later absolutely if you need a bearer
token to access the services how do you
handle that security system test in
general I mean what you can always have
you have several key clocks and key code
can be also containerized and you could
switch use and use using
software-defined networks different key
clock service and inverse case what you
can always do you can ship the war as a
char as well so what it actually means i
will just try to find my old blog post
or reuse as you can see i really like
you i really like like I use my blog as
a notepad so if you do this attach
classes to maven war plugin what happens
behind the scenes you get the jar and
war at the same time and and you can use
the char and wrap it with another
testing verb for test purposes and omit
for instance better token or whatever
like so then you can do whatever like in
your in your in your test okay another
one I try to use correlation ID so what
correlation ID is I think this is just
you
Nick ID which is used for instance to
sort their calls and something I use it
in container request filter and the
container response filter demoproject
the filters ever need what I don't like
is the call from another service so what
he says if the service calls the the
header or the correlation ID has to be
extracted and then ascends back of
course it has what you can of course do
if you need the correlation ID
everywhere what you could do you can
produce the correlation ID using request
scopes for instance then it will be
injectable everywhere and so you can
pass the context or using transactional
scope what the request scope would be
would work even better but what you see
here what what he did is he used the
HTTP headers extracted the header by the
way you don't have to do this year you
can also inject the HTTP headers and
globally not on sub parameter and then
and then sense the correlation ID back
so it's a better way to implement
correlation ID in Java I'm amid are lots
of examples you can use sublet filter a
stupid one and just you know save it in
for instance threadlocal so if you know
what they are doing it would work or
using your own scope like service copes
there are lots of lots of ideas but for
me it does not look that bad it's just
she just extracts the correlation ID and
and sentence since its back okay next
one let's see what their questions so I
was no questions here no questions in
Twitter the chit is somehow strange
today no questions usually is very gir
okay
so Vic to ask me how you would manage in
a high-tech chiral aspect of a huge
system the question is whether studio is
just wars or are there any chances that
I would introduce an ear first I don't
get what a huge system means huge is
always suspicious because what I saw
several times were able to delete eighty
percent of no boilerplate code from a
huge system using Java EE and would
remain were just pure business logic and
the war was actually tiny comparing into
before and then what you usually do you
would split the one war into a view wars
with with isolated responsibilities so
no isolated responsibilities with
dedicated responsibilities but the wars
will be completely isolated and so what
I wouldn't do use the remote and local
anymore what I described you know years
ago why not because remote communication
is is that i would say i would just use
exclusively jax-rs this what I would
change I wouldn't use at remote anymore
why not because at remote is mi over iop
what usually means korba and Korra buys
not well supported by or were supported
is disappointed by the service but it's
not like you know very popular
technologies or the chances that you get
backs are very high there are also
serialization vulnerabilities so you
should avoid that and and the problem is
if you are using egb client you are
depending on off half of the
applications of others huge dependency
on the applications of the runtime so a
better way to be to go with with restful
services so on the next question is do
you think the new MVC action based
specifically insulate is a bit late in
Java 8 what I remember is as iPhone came
out the first one everyone said is too
late there are no nokia never serve
everyone where you know very popular
technologies everyone said is too late
also i think for 10 years ejb was said
to be dead and java ee should die
because of spring because of rails and
still alive and is even more and more
at least in my projects is like it's
like crazy what happens right now and
and since now most of the project goes
restful services I think there are two
architectural choices restful services
is client-side frameworks and MVC is
server-side frameworks and I have to say
both have to have their place so
server-side frameworks web frameworks
you get no better page ranks at Google
the client-side frameworks can be
offline and then server-side frameworks
not with MVC action based specification
there's nothing to replicate because the
data is or is you have a direct
reference to d 2 d's server runtime
whereby in restful web services you have
to think about the api first so for me
is MVC is a nice extension and i would
use it a lot for templating you know
admin you is just health checks why not
and properly from time to time in a
large application actually there are
huge apps still using service I
technology and the question is where I
cannot find videos from you regarding je
a fix my youtube channel the name of the
channel has been Adam so if you go to
youtube youtube com c 4 channel and beam
Adam and you should be able to find me
and these are the recent videos so this
is how you find me and you will find all
the screencasts here and on vimeo it's
also a channel and i try to gather here
also some third-party of third-party
records from other conferences for
instance ok by the way about popularity
what we were here at the YouTube where
was it yeah what's funny or find
interesting the Java ETO from Jay for
cozia let's see with it it was crazy
popular so where was it how to find DJ
focus talks
here J focus exactly this is what I
wanted to see and if you sort the video
by popularity most popular then it's the
Java istic way of coding which is a java
a session number three and this is one
month ago and the others are five years
old so Java is a crazy popular as you
can see so I cannot even believe it so
on and this is just Java istic way of
coding is not as exciting title like you
know microservices will save the world
something like this so we have this next
one several sub resources and the
question boys down does the CD I
dependency injection work for sub
resources the answer is not you have to
pass it from outside US bin manager look
up I actually try to if you look at the
issues to achieve that in july seven but
was rejected because of some quantity
problems with this pack so it is not
possible to inject CDI beans in sub
resources you will have to use service
locator pattern for this so on other
java sources with other java rated block
screencast can you recommend it is
really hard to say because i use you
know google for topics and then read
whatever I can find it's not like I'm
following blocks or screencasts outside
is Java magazine from Oracle is nice
this Java magazine this is nice then
there is a boxed which also i think
focused this organized page about
various development this is a fresh one
vox java magazine and they are java mark
as in from oracle this is this one this
is really great publication
and we have the German Java magazine
it's also interesting so there are lots
of resources but I don't think you know
is like a canonical resource where were
you should spend all the time I read it
which often you use for recording your
screen cast it really depends what I'm
recording and when so right now I'm
using wire cast and i will post process
this with final cut and the title work
are made with motion and and screencaps
of the info forgot the system from I
think it's taylor stream is the company
just suppose a video recording software
so x i'm experimenting a lot that try to
increase the quality or automate the
whole process so on the sauce tomato
question now reliable checkpoints in
java 7 batch processing and this
question asked ok there isn't a spec
there is no point where a database is
prescribed can i confirm this I don't
have to think you already look at this
pack but it's the same story like in
stateful EG bees is also not prescribed
that the state has to be stored in a
database not either in scheduled the
schedule persistent timers does not
prescribe that the data is to be stored
in the database actually a white fry
stores the data in a flat file even for
JMS honored q and glassfish uses
database so databases never prescribe i
think more important it is that it has
to be consistent and transactional this
is the whole point and i think is
nothing wrong to store the state in a
file you can't even I mean at the end of
the day database that stores also the
state in a file similar questions what I
already asked what is the benefit of
ringing the initial processing thread by
passing over to another asynchronous
thread instead so what is the benefit
the HTTP thread is not locked anymore
and the server remains responsive you
have more control you can better stress
tests and if if one channel breaks the
application is still operational and
this particular interesting for micro
services because it's not like micro
service means we get you know 500 worse
with a single resource in it I would say
a micro service is something which is
delivered by a small team so you will
get are several endpoints and you can
you can better manage each endpoint it
individually okay exactly so the point
is the state ability and robustness all
or how it's called resilience so
security someone moves PHP spaghetti
into Java and this is fun new funny it's
interesting because in for several years
there's a trend that there are more and
more PHP developers who migrated day is
tough to java ee i interviewed some on
my block and yeah interesting because
PHP you is considered as be you know the
lightweight stuff and and more and more
project at migrating to java Sookie
clock is a good idea could recommend me
any other parts where I have to shield
the app I would say if you only exposing
rest then there is nothing as to secure
I mean the only possible you shouldn't
use any remote interfaces nor am I know
korba nothing then it's secure because
the only way to access your app is
restful web services so what he's saying
is stateless and Ed inject and says okay
he used local or stateless what I think
what you forgot is bins XML all
injection point so this is what you
should look like check that and probably
I would suggest start with my archetype
so if you go to maven project from
archetype and let's say X so get to
interesting projects as BC archetype I
will refer to it later this is the
scaffolding archetype in Java is seven
project archetype and let's say hello
let's call it hello and what you will
need is the following
where is it web pages this is what i
meant been discovering not all if you
don't have it then all classes has to
have to be annotated otherwise the
dependency injection won't work okay i
want to share common fields and behavior
at all entities how to achieve something
like following so entity Locker would be
a entity listener so this would work so
just go to the do it project and look
for entity listener so you can just use
entered listener there but put entity
login okay this is just a logger entity
which is used for to storlock price and
what you can always do you can use map
superclass is like an entity with shared
fields so a map superclass the name of
the annotation and this is an entity
without being mapped to our table and
it's just contains fields and this
should also work what you did but you
should use here at entity annotation as
well then it will work or map superclass
here and then you can use different
inheritance strategies and the dbase one
is storing the whole graph in one single
table which I prefer because of
performance you only need one query for
polymorphic results I have done it for
sample project jsf rest and so forth so
looked at the please take a look at the
BCE archetype so if i go here this is a
more complicated project com a hex bc
archetype so it comes with with rest
scaffold
this one also if you go here you can say
we can start a project crowd and so what
the scaffold contain is this a
application with shows you how to build
and test a little bit more complicated
application is not crutch but is a
little bit more business logic here and
the crotch what you can do you can go
here and say new entity classes from
database and I can for instance gate
check this one and it just touched the
database right now and I could check
okay I would like to have a address next
and finish and it would create an
address entity here from the database
and then I should be able to say here
knew it was like other web GSF classes
javaserver faces jsf pages from entity
classes and it will create for you
doesn't have a target server so let's
assign the target server run
which one pi RS okay and now let's try
new other we did it a lot for master
data management so if i go here
javaserver pages and joseph pages from
entity classes just pick this one next
crud looks good next finish and you get
your crowd project so it creates all the
temples nice stories you can customize
even the templates they are customizable
this is you can see here you have here d
index HTML and you have the address
create edit list view so two clicks and
you have your crud scaffolding or go to
my busy archetype to see the
architectural workings and this is it
creates facade with with entity and the
controller so the code is not as clean
as I wish but you can still customize it
using the templates here so the
templates are absolutely absolutely
customizable if I say here again just F
pages from entity classes you will see
here with a second customized template
and if I go here all templates so you
can customize the code and and write
really decent crud scaffolding app so i
would generate and generate it until the
code is really clean this is the
properties but this looks a little bit
nicer this is the JSF user class and
this is a free market template so I'm
just go for it so I hope you are happy
now you have to be so this is great to
link so I want to learn someone with
Java implement my person project someone
with javi please give me idea how to do
this one look at key cloak key cloak
from my flight so just use this first if
it works then you can
see do with this and they also introduce
Semel so when I face a new project can I
think of it in a micro service I take
you away from the beginning or is just
for refactoring a monolithic application
and this is a good one because for me
microservices are actually no nothing
new this is what we actually did in java
if four years at least i think i would
say 2009 since the advent of java 6 and
i think we'll wait a second what I said
War is the new year should be the title
of the post 2009 so december in 2009 i
wrote this and since then it is like it
is and just pushing no lightweight wars
and i always propagated you know no
external dependencies small units and
small fast deployment cycles and this
worked always well this is no 7 years
old so what it means actually you are
absolutely right so if you if you if you
just if you are reasonable microservices
will just occur with java ee this war
would be tiny also reach the the blog
post from Sebastian tashna I showed you
at the beginning and refactoring a
monolithic applications also interesting
and got several contracts this year on
last year helping to improve
maintainability of the application by
using by introducing microservices and
what I often did I just removed all the
plumbing and boilerplate like you know
empty layers you know outdated patterns
and then was no more need for micro
services because what remained was a a
very small app which deployed very fast
and it was absolutely maintainable
okay it's the last one before we do this
I would just switch briefly to the
Twitter and Anton Apple what what what
he did this is actually interesting he
has he a nice web framework called
Oracle on oracle jet Duke script and
what he wrote I will have to check it
out a nice client for light fish and i
will take a look at this because this is
will be a really nice and lightweight
solution for for like let's see what I
will find it for our light fish and this
is j qi we just so I didn't tested this
but it really looked promising and the
last netbeans day in Munich Tony showed
me this and this is also nice
alternative to java fix because then you
don't have to install anything you can
just look at this and this looked really
really nice so I will push it to the
chat so Tony was on time
okay um question from a Novak do you
have an example using data spec instead
of our Killian yes I have if you go to
the Java testing workshop online
workshop and there is also a let's wait
a second so yeah xio there is a testing
workshop job I testing so you don't even
have to buy or rent it so you don't have
to spend the 10 euro what you can do you
can you should go to github Java testing
and somewhere they was delta spike for
instance arquillian so if you go to hear
there should be a example we still does
mike so it don't even have to buy the
course okay nice then go back to the
last question here and then go back
again to chat could be more interactive
so the question is this is a new one 14
hours hours ago GMS producing consumer
with an MDB this message listen
interface okay he's not able to send JMS
to GSF page this is a somehow it strange
because if you're a safety message
driven bin if the message to have been
receives the message what happens then
so the question is so the chilis ask me
we have we sent a JMS message and how to
pass the GMs message to JSF page the
problem is jess f is a request-response
gem JMS is asynchronous so what is
have to do is like you will have to
receive the GMs message extract the
content and then somehow pass it to the
JSF page if the content is global like
you know a global update of optical or
stock stock ticker or something like
this this would be fairly simple because
then you can just store the data and a
singleton application scope or singleton
ejb and then the next call the GSF could
pick up the content and display on the
page what you could also do of course
experiment with WebSockets and and and
push if the data arrives the D content
directly to the JSF page would also work
what other would work was long polling
and even if you the very old how is
called icefaces icefaces GMS as i recall
icefaces used GMS for synchronization
purposes so you can use GMS and send the
messages back and forth so take a look
at this so i know that they use it in in
the past i'm not sure whether primefaces
are something with JMS synchronization
but seems like they have so it's a
little bit new one they're using
atmosphere framework which is a good
great news because atmosphere users also
long polling so i just push you the two
resources and then turn this is the
prime faces and Isis
now question from chat nice anonymous
447 911 ask me I have an application
could be a pattern nice then anonymous
please say what just pink me I would
like to interview on my blog about your
experience with pc this would be nice I
will ask you a question of whether you
are building and you know I helping with
java and so forth but what let's see the
main service is stateless perfect like
the boundary as are the separate
controls the dow is using crowd service
are stateless too so on we could argue
about the dowel usually i don't use the
Dow's but if you have to use it then i
have adapted that send information to
other systems again stateless i have the
feeling my teachers wrong can you
comment on this I don't think your
application is wrong you don't need so
many stateless but it's nothing wrong
wrong with it it's just not needed so
the more of them more stateless you have
the more monitoring data you become but
there's nothing wrong with it there is
no you know performance concerns or
something like this it would just work
as well what I will look closely with
the dowels are needed and the adapters
because in my bc architecture is you
only will need boundary which is
stateless controls would be could be a
would be a Pocho Sandow do we no doubt
it we just control which axis is the
entity manager and there will be no need
for adapters so this is what please I
don't see index it is wrong you could
delete some on rotations and then would
be easier to get ok I think we are done
which is amazing we had almost 70 70 or
almost 30 questions so there's nothing
else to say except thank you for two
years sticking with me asking questions
I have great fun and as to pop way as
you see I just published today morning
at 3am near at 1000 views so really
interesting lots of interest in Java
still and if you like come to Munich
so next workshops are in June this is
bootstrap Java 7 in architectures again
and in July we have continuous Java
testing and microservices this would be
fun I think this time will be completely
different I plan just to code so
absolutely no slides and probably I will
cover more slides in the architecture so
we shift the contents a bit but now
we'll just plan just coat the whole time
with talk on the stuff and we have two
events which are little bit strange a
JavaScript I will cover akmal script es6
and the old JavaScript and it was just
coding and show you lots of examples to
better understand for instance what
prototypical inheritances and also on
html5 for java developers which
basically means html5 bootstrap okay so
thank you for watching see you next time
and see you at conferences a hex
subscribe to your hex news and attend
Munich workshops if you cannot exile or
Syrian projects all here all around the
world and back from Poland nice workshop
at blue media also there are lots of
interest in Java so thank you for
watching and bye
