let's start with the questions or topics
okay so let's start with follow-up and
news so the big news or begin uses more
and more projects Java e projects are
were migrated from from java.net to
github and there is a glassfish java DB
basically all the Java Dannette projects
are now at github there are lots of the
projects so if you are curious you can
you know go through the projects and see
also the activity which is really nice
and yeah so this is this is what
happened behind the scenes that is even
they show the old old clustering member
from Java so you can see suspicious this
is everything was updated in April end
of April because this is where java.net
closed down ok this is the Java EE news
and of course Java 9 News chick saw will
probably come a little bit late there
was some dispute but we covered this
last last month ok and tomorrow I'm at
Oracle code bristles which is a free
event so if you can participate see you
tomorrow and I will deliver keynote and
what I plan to do actually registered or
subscribe to Oracle container service
and I planned to push live java
application to the Oracle cloud and I
didn't got the token yet so if I get it
I will try it if not our record our
youtube screencasts and push it to the
to my to my channel so see you at 9 in
Brussels tomorrow there's the agenda and
yeah this is my keynote of Silas keynote
so usually I have one or two slides then
I code whatever I can in one hour and
then push it to to github to my github
account and I think the gate is life for
the code or something like that
and what was it live for code and so you
will find tomorrow probably some commits
verses from from the oldie all the work
from all the keynotes is committed here
so this is that then the follow-up from
GSF materialization first some
complaints from a from a friend of the
show John Joe and he said that in all of
my sentences I use whatever which is
really annoying there should work on my
English so this is the deal I would try
to do whatever les show so there should
be no whatever's in this ax TV so all
listeners in the chat should listen
carefully what I'm saying
and if I say whatever just ping me and I
will try what I can do I can just can
apologize for whatever actually I didn't
notice that what I noticed it that
sometimes I say so too often but
whatever no yeah let's see
so Ed Burns is the speculative subject
forest pack and GSF set and so what what
I covered yesterday we had a yesterday
last last month we had a we had a topic
about JSF modularization and and he said
why I didn't mention the JSF phase flows
which by the way are are nice so phases
flow is this is like a self-contained
flow of pages with good annotation
support and you could even consider some
module which is independent from other
modules and and he's absolutely right
not only this edge SF supports custom
components which are also good for
modularization and resource jars where
you can deliver the components and CSS
assets whatever from jars but this is
not what I meant what I meant the last
month and this was an observation for my
projects and this was that if you have
JSF you can easily inject
boundaries to do to manage spins and
which is really convenient and really
productive but if you are not careful
you can you can wire up or Y up here you
can inject too many boundaries - one
baking beans so everything becomes
depending on the presentation here so
you cannot easily split the words
anymore
which is actually not a big deal because
splitting or Wars is a lot but a very
common event but in one project they
move away from JSF just because of the
issue so this is what I meant last
shelves or 38 X okay so this is follow
up from from from last time and also
interesting so we have really added this
overflow in Java a bootstrap in Java EE
effective Java and there are also some
ourselves with around I would say 5 to
10 attend this year and over 20 here so
I will we will close as soon as possible
both of today's but if you can shift
from effective to Java testing quality
what I prepared to do the very first
time is pipe in source code with Java EE
7 or even 8 and in Jenkins 2 and Jenkins
files so this is something new here and
of course stress tests and and and
integration tests and functional tests
and whatever test you like ok so cover
that I saw some activity
oh I said whatever sorry so I should be
so no whatever so it's really hard so
pull up beautiful Java EE front-end is
the next topic and and this is which
front-end frameworks technologies I'm
using for beautiful Java apps and he's
thinking about angular 2 which no more
exists so we have own angularjs which is
angular 1 angular 2 so I'm a grower - I
consider a little bit over engine yet
and why that
actually to be if you're starting with
angular 2 the easiest possible thing to
do is to start with command line
interface CLI which is already a bad
sign so I'm not a huge believer of
command line interface - it's a portable
code generation in my opinion frameworks
and libraries should be as simple as
possible so you should be able to use
them without any code generators and
even so if you try to understand angular
you should use angle I would say you
should start without the CLI and just
play with it and you will find out that
you will have to declare a lot of things
in multiple places so it's not exactly
dry don't repeat yourself so you will
have to create the module you would have
to create a controller and if you would
like to engender septic it just to be
declared in the providers so I'm angular
is that it's a nice framework if you
need if for huge apps and with lazy
loading requirement where all the
modules need to be loaded asynchronously
lazily and I consider so I like our
react a lot better it's easier framework
there's no dependency injection this
just no almost polio framework is of
course plain old JavaScript objects
framework just front-end technology and
I don't miss you know all the backend
and I frankly I really don't need
dependency injection in the front end
and yeah and what I also like so in my
current projects I try actually stay
away from all the frameworks and just
going to Java EE stick way so just focus
on the web standards with the huge
benefit that the arm from the technology
will be always up to date because if you
rely on the existing Dom and web api is
which are considered as web standards
they will never disappear and there is
no migration so you can go pretty far
with using the recent JavaScript and
recent Dom API is and what organized our
web components with polymer too so this
is what I would I would suggest to use
for front-end and having nets at
JSF is
nice and beautiful nothing against JSF
but you are asking me I'm thinking about
angular 2 so you are already considering
angular 2 as a front-end framework so
you are forced to use a single page
application framework or client-side
client centric framework JSF works also
nice and even you know the JSF
frameworks like prime energy or prime
prime faces to even have they own their
own components which can be used in
angular and actually the old JSF
components and there are somehow somehow
popular so um I would also look at usf
so if you are building you know admit
interfaces just go with JSF if you have
requires word jazz F cannot fulfill I
will go with with html5 okay so this
about that so let's see what happens
here
and is connected now connected okay can
you explain GWT authentication with Java
restful web services I can try so this
JSON web token is it's just a
specification how to encode additional
payload how to encode and decode the
payload and you can pass the payload
between the layers and they are
different JavaScript frameworks on
JavaScript JavaScript and trembles for
different languages which are able to
encode and decode a JavaScript a token
and so there are they are our frameworks
like Java GWT or here we have Nimbus
Joe's JWT and IO JSON web token JJ WT
and yeah and we will look at this
because Antonio Goncalves someone from
just the article wrote a nice write-up
our blog post securing jax-rs and funds
widget ability so you only have
look at that it's a really great post
and so having that said the application
servers do not support Jason Webb token
authentication out of the box they
always would have to do something about
this and in this post antonio chooses to
use container request filter which is
similar to servlet filter but this
jax-rs specific so hence using jax-rs
the container request filter is far more
convenient and also more powerful and
what happens here it just fetches the
authentication token and the bearer
token and and it uses the GWT library to
to parse the token this is the JWT token
needed filter and in the in the resource
itself so this is this check Souris he's
able to issue the token and you see
issues the token on exception you always
get redirected to unauthorized which is
401 and and he can create just a method
issue token the token and then it is
copy and paste it and is decoded on the
client side so you always will need an
indirection like a servlet filter or or
container request filter and with that
you can decode and encode tokens so
there are some is actually not about
authentication and authorization rather
than passing the authentication data
between layers and to do something more
with it you will need something a key
cloak or open a.m. and then you have a
full full security solution or single
sign-on solution okay nice so this is
covered now are a question for deem pile
so I think this is covered yes something
ever in chat no nothing here
don't confuse me from from weeds is
actually 4:00 p.m. and not 5:00 p.m. is
advertised in my time it's now 5:00 p.m.
so don't make me crazy and Toby ah see I
broke down but this repair the stream so
should work right now okay here it's
done what what Dean pile is looking for
is looking for a good project where you
can focus on our business layers all
stuff are pre-built with authentication
templating cash management clustering
management and I don't think you will
find something like this so our cash
management and clustering management or
clustering management it's actually not
needed but because if you have a
self-contained wars you can use a chair
proxxon and unique so this is already
covered in go to my youtube channel you
will find that cash management I will
cover this in future but there but what
you have to do is you have to to use the
cash control methods from jax-rs so you
can use whatever case you like so this
is out of scope templating well I mean
what you're probably searching for is
something we generate templates from
from tables or something like this and
this is built into our IDs and it worked
well in the past but it didn't use it
for a long time so let's see what the
stood works so let's see whether I can
quickly create a Java EE application so
and NOC workspaces junk and call it
generated
so now it fetches from internet or took
a little bit longer than usually and I
have I think I will have to specify the
server first let's go with white light
and then I could say knew all men entity
classes from database and this is the
problem out of different server so there
is no data in the database so I would
choose the GlassFish hopefully it comes
with something do I have class version a
glassfish for one and now try entity
classes from database entity classes
from database JDBC sample I hope app no
I forgot actually there is no sample
sample data so let's see can I use the
default no in one work so there are two
wizards if you have a working data
source setup which I don't have in the
moment you can use entity classes from
database it would generate the entity
classes that then just if just have
pages from anywhere from entity classes
but if I create one entity page let's
say workshop comm a hex entity workshop
and this is an entity with at ID met ID
long ID and this is generated
this is and then let's say just name
string name something like that and I'm
not sure whether the frame book needs
getters and setters so let's generate
that so now I also will probably have to
go here and say I would like to have the
persistence unit so so distant worked
right now
so the generational entities because no
database we can still create a entity
and then hopefully I can say new can
reject pages from entity classes so I
will show you here and it recognize the
entity so you can go here and say ok
generate I wanted to say whatever but I
didn't okay and now we have the
workshops besides we have a controller
lots of generated code and most
interestingly all the templates in GSF
are generated and this is somehow useful
because there were templates and I they
were templates for Java services and you
see here for instance create and this is
the template for the create for the
create template and you can modify that
so what you can do we can generate ones
and then refine the templates until you
are perfectly happy with the template
and then generate until you get your app
I actually don't use it a lot so we did
it in the past for master data pieces or
something like this and I actually don't
believe to do believe in generation of
whole apps from from a model because it
is just to generate into simple and
there they are possibly an old thousand
or frameworks we support that but this
is what I do and this is most of the
idea is supporting this out of the box
okay so some panels ask me is it common
for enterprise project to use our web
server like Apache engines in front of
application server yes it is very common
and most of my clients have Apache
engine X is less common in enterprise
content context and Kevin told me I went
through your slightly less Java micro
service from aura dev how you went
through my slide list Java e if there
were no slides so it's actually
impossible to walk through this light
source inside the show but I hope you
like that ok so I hope we covered this
so I think cache management and
clustering management is not an issue
managing users rolls on menus so this is
what we did right now
authentication is built-in if you need a
more authentication reliant key cloak or
open a.m. so this can be harder because
you know or each company had has
different authentication and
authorization mechanisms yeah and I mean
we never had an enterprise application
which can be generated so in my project
the enterprise applications are more
like look like more like in our startup
project so each thing is completely
different what sometimes which all the
apps have in common is some
administration or monitoring part so
this could be probably generated but it
is on that small small thing and if you
generate a lot at the beginning is
really hard to maintain so what I try to
do is to remove stuff and it'll generate
stuff so there's different philosophy
okay so John Hogan front of the show
asked me that he mean he mentions that I
mentioned war in conjunction with the
cap theorem and and whether year
deployments our Posse so first the wars
and cap theorem have nothing to do so
what I probably mention one point in
time probably in the microservices
online workshop is that if you have
multiple Wars you have a distributed
application because of the cap theorem
you'd then multiple Wars means usually
multiple processes and multiple
processes you cannot coordinate them
easily from from another process so
two-phase commit doesn't work doesn't
sufficiently well so what you will have
to do is you will have to decide between
between between scalability or or
consistency and but you will get the
same problem with ear so it's not in not
an issue here so and so what ID what are
the use cases for ears and what can
happen is let's imagine you have a main
wore micro service and a sidecar micro
service which just provides additional
administration services and and our
watchdog services something which is not
not business logic rather than you know
supporting the interaction of stuff and
this both of the years of the wars could
be actually shipped in that ear it would
make the deployment easier so what you
will get one ear with two words inside
to because if the if the main war
changes the whole ear changes but the
sidecar war would probably not change
the psychical work would be something
like a pink project from from from my
repo as an example so if you go to
github and I'm being and a thing is
called pink I know it is called pink
yeah something like this this is ready
to you
swore it will probably never change and
not change frequently so you can package
both in one ear and ship them at once so
this could be an use case still I don't
do this I would rather you know spend
one more line in a docker file than
create an ear but what is the huge ban
or huge a big benefit of ears you know
the all the condenser tschappat wants
are deployed at once oh and you get also
atomic deployment so if everything is
deployed or nothing okay and there are
lots of edge case but the most common
one is you have you have one micro
service which comprises multiple Wars
one main war and supporting Wars this is
a nice question so Christian Kay asked
me okay he has an angular for a client
which is actually angular 2 which is not
angular JS no the angle one and I have a
Java 7 back-end right service and uses
angular for client and what what
Christian would like to do is just to
ship thin JSON objects so with dynamic
properties or features whatever I
understood so Christian wouldn't like to
ship you know a static DTO with some
always half populated fields rather than
shipped you know justice what would the
angular angular our project is needs and
the problem with job of course if you
will to create sub components component
class or whatever classes and then you
have the problem that in Java you cannot
just you know CLI is a subset of them
not-not-not with with the standard
Chuck's P approaches because if you just
send a half-filled objects you will get
nulls of the other at the end and this
is hard to differentiate whether a field
is null or actually does not exist and I
blocked about similar issue away ago and
if you search for atom in detail and
Jason you were hopefully yes you will
find
and old I'm not that old post but what
happens here actual is the following we
have an entity with a method to Jason
and the entity knows how to serialize
itself to Jason and how to detail as in
shred instead of from Jason and what we
have in the real world projects are
multiple jason methods and nothing
prevents you you know to specify some
criteria so you can pass here a let's
say a predicate and the predicate could
filter the attributes and just return a
subset what's needed to the client and
it could be predicates you can you can
specify here or even easier you can have
multiple to jason method like you know
to jason summary and to jason detail and
this is of course a little bit too
generic so it would be nicer if you had
to know the names like invoice date
information and invoice I don't know arm
other items okay so done hopefully
question answered and this is unusual
question because out whether I could get
an example with JP and white light
server actually there are no issues
absolutely no issues with what's right
in JP whatever I did on class official
paella should one on white paddle it
runs on white fly sometimes ending
client workshops I use white flight
Tommy and payara interchangeably and and
it just works you don't even specify in
the persistence XML which JPA provided
is so it would be pick from the
application server and the only issue is
actually answered from from Daniel is a
friend of the show
Tamara is probably you don't have
specified a JDBC driver and this is what
you can do and I think what I did once I
also brought a blog post
how to specify Oracle JDBC driver
whitefly so this can be quite a journey
because the you have to install a module
with to do this so this this could be
done and yeah really no issue is booj as
work so if just pick an example from
from GlassFish and ship it to payara and
we'll pick up the default database which
is in pi in whitefly take it from white
or pyre and ship it to white line so the
only difference is in white fly or
payara they using the derby and white
fly uses the h2 database and which has
to exist in java 7 and it does not exist
in java a6 or does not have to exist in
java 6
what about testing of asynchronous
methods are there any useful libraries
for that this is what I don't get
because solid
okay
so what about testing of asynchronous
methods which libraries to choose so we
have already here a simple project so
let's say I would create an asynchronous
method and I call that Duke service
what's going on here
so do work so pure Q has to work so um
so this how to test that it's actually
no issue you can just just test at least
I mean you can just use unit tests and
we just work a little bit more
problematic if you would use this so
future let's say string and then say
return new async result of 42 so this
could be a problematic but usually what
you will do is something like this you
would call another method
and I will call our tests this methods
rather unitize for this method but will
never test this method unit test what
you should do use stress tests to test
the robustness of this method because
whether this works or not is highly
dependent on thread pull configuration
of application server but I would never
code any valuable business logic with an
asynchronous method nor in its scheduled
so like timer methods is the same story
so how do there's a timer methods you
don't have to test them because they
should not contain any business logic or
how to test you know jax-rs resource
methods get on post there is no unit as
for them because they should not contain
any business logic the business logic is
in pojos and this can be either in in
methods inside such as service or
usually what is what it could be even a
different different class never that
issue with that so cool this is covered
so this is a daniel covered or supported
may detail with with the JDBC
configuration and now the real question
is okay so what's the problem Danny
would like to docker but Daniel is not
allowed to use docker and therefore
Daniel is forced to use Yui swarm a
payara micro or spring boot and what he
doesn't like is of course if 50 makes
mic reward which I also don't get and so
and and and he's asked him I actually
don't know what they were the question
is so if you are not allowed to use
docker what you could do what objects do
you have you have white less warm you
have application composer I think it's
the name of Tommy or you have payara
mike rizzo payara micro is particularly
interesting because and also white fly
and para micro they have white size and
concept called I think hollow jars
and what we can do you can have the
white lights warm with separate jar and
the payara micro can have the
application server in a jar outside the
jar so you in both cases you will have
two jars one is the infrastructure and
the other one is the application and
this could be the solution to use though
you will have to you know 25 or 50 Meg
payara micro jar which never changes and
then outside still your thin war which
is you get similar experience to dhaka
so you could try that yes but what I
really don't get is why to create a fake
jar and ship it with docker because it
just takes too long okay so the idea is
I think is called white fly hollow jar
well a second white fly hollow jar
hollow goober jars
you
exactly and this is exactly what you're
searching for so you will get one Leia
is the would be the white less warm and
the other layer would be your war which
is still thin and without dr. Rosenberg
and payara micro does it out-of-the-box
and tell me application composer I'm not
sure so look at that okay nice I hope I
answer the question so you get to know
still thin Wars and fetch ours which
actually do not matter because they will
only change you to get new release of
the application server so what's my
experiences with Java II batch API so my
my experiences are pretty interesting so
I like also like this Java EE batch is
it's interesting but I never used it in
real-world projects and why the reasons
because it was I never had a project
were there was an obvious case for full
fully you know featured batch API what
what my clients wanted to have is like
scheduling service or ETL service and
something like that and always what I
created for instance the the project
inhibitor which is not even Java a7
project my client asked me a few years
ago to implement a AJ batch or Java EE
batch service which extracts and
transforms data and what I delivered is
a Java 8 project which is not even Java
EE 7 which does the same without any
batching so so the client wanted to have
a flexible transformation lodging a
thought about batch and what I delivered
transformation logic without batch and
if I would use Java a batch for that it
will also work but it'll be like cargo
called if someone would ask me why use
Java a batch I couldn't say up because
the client asked but there will be no
reasonable answer for that okay so so
what it means is I got right now a
contract and I will write a thing in one
to three days a very thin scheduling
service with monitoring and specific
rest requirements and this is like it
will be sold as a badge framework but
it's actually not and I would not use a
Java EE badge for that yeah
would I recommend to build your own
framework yes what you should do is you
should always look you know a different
work and then and then think about how
simple is your homegrown solution if
your solution our view classes go your
homegrown stuff if the solution becomes
an another framework just take whatever
exists so this is what I was just so and
and and what is the what is the I would
say criteria to which with Java or what
are the unique features so it like the
check points or you can have split
multiple regions which are configurable
so how many readers you have then the
state is stored in a database and this
would be stuff which which points to
towards patch it's actually similar
story with vector workflow and of
engines I will ask a lot about the
peripheral engines of what usually
delivered is a simple state machine so
I'm just ask your client what they
really need and for instance processing
validation transformation you only need
Java 8 not even Java 87 writing a file
to SMTP fuld AF databases is very simple
and reading from is also simple the
question is what happens if you have
read the file what should happen then so
this is actually the typical question
where you can decide should I use Java
EE batch or not just reading processing
and writing I would not use Java abet
solution because for that Java Java 8 is
just enough if you would like to work on
a server I would start with Java 8
resinize unit test for that and then
wrap it with a thin war and with some
java services like jax-rs for monitor
ring or whatever whatever forget
whatever no whatever's in today's show
okay
Monsieur Monsieur
Garcia ask me okay what's the
multi-tenant in container managed way to
use my tenant container manage
transactions
I think persistence transactions okay
and this multi tenant was supposed to
come with Java seven Java seven was
supposed to be the cloud solution but it
didn't become the Klumps cloud solution
and and the Eclipse link in hibernate
already implemented this so now it's
available multi tenant solution as as
proprietary feature and what my strategy
to develop multi tenant app I tried
actually to avoid to build a multi
tenant apps because if you think about
this is it a lot easier to have single
tenant apps as a single micro-service so
you can have one microservice pertinent
of course if your 500 tenant it's not a
valuable solution but if you have three
clients I would go with that because
what usually happens in multi tenant
application that each kind has more and
more requirements and you will end up
having you know the god solutions called
solution but each client will just use a
subset of this which we get harder
harder to maintain okay so there is
nothing in Java if they you will have to
build something which is of course
proprietary or use the proprietary JPA
pictures and what we did once which was
fairly simplest you can of course inject
different entity managers depending on
the tenant so you can have a qualifier
and recognize the the users regarding
day on a location for instance and
depending on the location inject
different entity managers so this is
very simple this is what you can always
do and of course each entity manager can
be bound to different databases and this
would be even a Java EE solution so what
you only need to have is an entity
manager producer with different with
several methods which are producing
deedy managers and depending on the on
some criteria you can inject the
particular entity manager okay the imp
I'll draw a nice UML picture I figure
and ask me okay is it a good solution
what is it this is in one node there are
three words in a single database is it
good or not I don't know why there are
three words on one node this is what
what I don't get what I would do I would
put one module war and node one module
two mode 2 and module 3 and node 3 this
would be the right thing to do if you do
this you have as big disadvantages so
what are the advantages first if this
node happens to be an application server
an application server comes with about I
don't know 30 to 100 Meg's Ram overhead
so is excavated this is nothing and and
you are now you are saving let's say 300
Meg's of RAM pushing three wars to one
JVM but what you will lose is
scalability why there's one process and
one process is harder to scale than
three processes next problem is
monitoring so it's harder to do to for
instance to monitor module one because
module 2 and module 3 can interfere with
module 1 so as a so this is harder to
you know analyze the heap dump and then
profile and and so forth and ok so this
is the problem and of course Ram itself
let's imagine we need 8 gig per war
because you have crazy caching
strategies inside so if you you will
have to dedicate 24 gig of ram to a JVM
is of each of the wars requires that
much heap what could happen then you
will be forced to to optimize the
garbage collection because the the heap
is is going to be huge but if you would
split the deployments to to individual
Wars you wouldn't have to do
anything because 8-gigabyte for war is
almost nothing I would say so there's
nothing to top team eyes usually if T if
the hip is not that huge and now all the
interesting questions I feel about this
it's a fresh one four hours ago so what
I have experienced programming a
schedule message driven bean and what is
meant by scheduler message doesn't mean
what I what I think what it should do is
to register and they registered
particular times from like you
automatically which is which doesn't
happen out-of-the-box what you should so
I don't this is another part of this
pack so the message driven bean is bound
to the queue or to a topic at deployment
time but what you can what you can do is
the following the message driven bean
doesn't have to be dependent on GMS it
you could write an JC a connector and
then it can do whatever like it could be
possible and I think iron Jack are mark
so this is an project a specific from
from whitefly java connector
architecture project with lots of
examples so take a look of the source
code of this and you will find some
examples how to how to invoke a message
driven bean through our connector and
then of course you could know schedule
the invocation of the or register on the
register from the queue if you only
would like to to invoke methods at
particular times you don't need a
message driven bean you can go with
write a time a service for instance nice
all questions are covered
how option is in Java eight are used to
handle multiple if-else statements this
is what I don't get
so what what optional does is you can
have if present you can do something and
in Java nine you get if not present this
what is what you would what you will get
but multiple this is a harder question
okay all laugh like something and what
happens here so Kevin is out of control
and and he wants front don't get the
requirement so Kevin what you can do you
can write a gist with your requirements
and I would not extend the Vimeo course
what do what I could do I could record a
screencast which is free on YouTube
screencast if there is an interesting
topic okay whether I go into great
detail in your microservice training
video on Vimeo so on what means great
detail I forgot how many episodes they
are properly forty to fifty what I did
do I talked a little bit about Java
eighteen microservices in Java a seven
and development application and I think
I mean with this you can start but great
detail I mean this is a more or less
several hours workshop so it cannot be
dead detailed okay so I hope all
questions are answered
if yes thank you for watching sorry for
a stream interruption and this was a
thing the first whatever let's show with
a little bit too much so but at least
without whatever see you tomorrow at the
keynote in bristles also without
whatever hopefully and see you in July
and advert shops of course where are my
workshops workshops and what you should
attend to
is one of my favorites what standards
where I kill all JavaScript frameworks
by hacking Java istic way html5
applications ryoga's on eyes and angular
is a cover angular for if you have used
if you have to do to use it attend the
workshop what happens over time the
react courses and web standard course
has become more and more popular so the
first angular was the most popular one
in the recently ax there were twice as
many react and web standards
registrations and angular registrations
and Java tests and quality it like come
and the very first time or the second
time it's also fun there will be
performance troubleshooting and
monitoring so what I dude is like a
mythbuster show with we monitor and find
bugs and and try to hunt bottlenecks and
memory leaks at the whole day so a lots
of fun and the very first time I will
cover Java 8 in Java 9 features in
December hopefully we will get Java 9
until December thank you for watching
no questions left no no Kevin exactly I
will do whatever I can to satisfy you
and yeah see you in July bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
