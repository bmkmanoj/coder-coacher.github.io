would like to show you how to add HTTP
headers afterwards with jax-rs
interceptors and write intercept in
particular this is actually very useful
so I will start as always with maven
project and with my own archetype it's
the the simplest possible archetype for
Java EE and our chord it into
interceptors jax-rs interceptors
actually and i will create the
configuration first then the resource
and the Interceptor afterwards so still
pulling the dependencies and we will use
the jax-rs
configuration on a class so i will
introduce a class called jax-rs config
and is in the package comm ax was the c
and this is going to be an application
path resources so it's available on the
resources and it has to extend the
application and then we can introduce a
resource called workshops resource and
it's mapped to the OD workshops
and it is going to return a string
workshops and this is going to be a get
request and we are returning bootstrap
effective and architectures so and now
let's say I would like to add some
headers the problem is of course we are
returning a string here with the
response so this is actually fairly easy
so we can just a traditional class and I
call it header enhancer and so it needs
to be annotated with provider very
similar to most a message for the reader
and writer provider and it has to
implement the writer interceptor and
which will force you to implement a
method around right - which is in fact
very similar to the arm to the usual or
usual the ordinary Java interceptors so
first we have the context and with the
context we get the headers and as you
can see in Java doc get mutable map of
HTTP headers so what it means mutable we
can change that so let's do it and we
will add a header - X ax and what would
be D I don't know hello and then we only
have to say proceed otherwise you would
all only see the header without the
actual content and this basically was so
I would just test it I will run would
like to run it on the GlassFish actually
doesn't matter should one everywhere
so resources / workshops as you can see
the the output more interestingly I
would go here and I would like to look
into the into the at us as you can see
we see in addition the air hex header so
X minus a X : hello so it's very isn't
very useful on the same note we have
also really interceptor which is able to
enhance the the input to our resource so
thank you for watching and see you at
upcoming a hex fracture of the Munich
Airport or outside in Java ecosystem so
thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
