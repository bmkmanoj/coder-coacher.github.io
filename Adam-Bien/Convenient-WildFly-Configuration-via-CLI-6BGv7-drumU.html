would like to show you how to
conveniently configure the rightful
application server using the command
line interface
so first what happened here I just
opened this standalone full which
comprises all the configuration from
whitefly so you can absolutely edit just
the XML file - to change the
configuration what I also opened is the
J console which is a gem eeks edit or
coming with JDK and I just would like to
connect with the JBoss modules so which
is actually the white fur application
server switch to mbeans browser and go
to the JBoss a/s folder and you should
see all the familiar subsystems so I can
actually do the same from the command
line interface so I'm in the bin folder
from whitefly and there is a J bacilli
so I will just like to start this up and
it immediately suggests that i should
connect so let's try to connect with the
white line so i'm connected right now
and by LS i'm listing everything this is
like a file system where i can browse in
the in the folders here or in the
subsystems here so the interesting -
what I can do I can switch to something
and there is a tab completion so I would
like to come to a CD EJB for interest CD
subsystem and then it chooses which
subsystem to choose so what I did is I
just said
CD CD subsystem and then tap and it
suggests again which subsystem to choose
and we see here batch j barrett bean
validation data sources deployment
scanner eee jb3 and this is actually it
matches with that so we have a bet bet j
barrett bean validation data sources EJB
so tries to switch to e gb so now we are
in the subsystem EG b so we are inside
this so i can list that and we see all
the attributes which actually is the
same as this so there is some edge lock
system exceptions so and what i can do i
can perform some actions so what I could
do I could could say now write attribute
and then I choose a attribute
tap it suggests the name so I put name
and the name is lock system exceptions
and the value suggests false or true so
let's change to this is endemics we have
true the change to false and see what
happens
so changed so what happened here
it immediately changed the state in the
configuration and if i refresh endemics
it also changed the state and what's
also interesting just come back here
so LS we have this in vm remote
interface invocation pass by value which
is true but does not appear in the
configuration so what I can do I can say
ok nice then I can write an attribute
and the name of the attribute is in VM
invocation passed by value and the value
is going to be false so if I change this
it brought the actually the ducati
element appeared in the configuration
here and it should change the state here
in the gem --ax so it changed to false
so it is a DJ bose command-line
interface it is a really nice and an
usable tool how you can interactively
configure the whitefly application
server GJ was application server and you
can actually do the same with a gem
expressor
use the the command-line interface or
edit the XML files directly the problem
is of course if if you have if you do
some typos the the configuration is
going to be ignored thank you for
watching and see you an upcoming Eric's
calm and IO conferences and even project
so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
