would like to show you how to start with
Java 7 and move and 3 so what I did I
created a very simple Java 7 project
just minimalistic one just with the very
minimalistic palm and expose that or
submitted that to maven central as a
maiden archetype so you can access that
with maven archetype generate and the
best you use a filter otherwise you get
800 options around 800 options and the
group ID is calm a X and the just lifti
artifact ID out and you will get
suggestion - now it pulls everything
from maven central and see I submitted
two artifacts one is job of excited at
this one the name of the artifact IDs
Java is seven essentials archetype so um
this is the second option the group ID I
just use comma X it will be used in the
pump and the artifact ID is just mavin
mavin test version 100 is perfectly fine
and package ID and yes I would really
like to create that so just a change to
maven test and see the pancha game so I
can just right away clean and test ad so
it's roached so now okay switch to
NetBeans or whatever ID you like and
just open it the project essen directly
NetBeans recognize that as an maven
project and just we will just briefly
look at D at the pump so you see it's
minimalistic group ID taken from from
the command line artifact ID in snapshot
version number as well I just didn't
used any artifacts instead of I just use
the properties compiler any plugins I
just used the properties source compiler
source and targets one seven and fail on
missing web because ml false it means
now you can use war without having web
pics ml which is perfectly fine in Java
6 or Java 8 7 so let's try that out just
something really really quickly not a
JSP but probably a restful web service
or something so um I will start with
breast configuration simple class
the package is come ax and the
application path I would call that
resources and this has to extend the
application and now we just need a
resource I call the resource maven tests
resource or actually it'll be just one
test called it past finish and the
resource is bound to a path test and has
just one class just one method get' and
our show doesn't matter it doesn't have
to correspond to get and this so return
is maven rocks why not
so now I would like to try that now let
me doesn't know which applications of it
to use because the project is NetBeans
unrelated so I have to choose GlassFish
development and now everything is
deployed and the browser should be
launched and you should get an error yes
because we have to set up the path and
this is resources and I think was test
right so she seemed able rocks so this
was quick into introduction to Java 7
very minimalistic palm and yeah thank
you for watching and see you in one of
upcoming conferences workshops or even
the X so thank you and bye
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
