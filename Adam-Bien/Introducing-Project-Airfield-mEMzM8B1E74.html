would like to introduce you to you an
air-filled it's a command-line utility
written in Java 8 and what it does it is
very simple it initially installs an app
and then keeps the app up-to-date it
doesn't have to be actually a java
application can be whatever like so we
could also think you know documents
folders or whatever so um it is
simplistic so let's install the
application I would like to use the
released version here field so we just
copy the link and what I have here are
our two folders empty folders chunk so
it is empty and yeah if it get repo
where I will start the remote git server
and and also install a remote
application so uh this is not empty yet
so now it's empty
so I would like to use the curl command
and install a field so self-contained so
it should work out of the box
Java - char airfield and seems to work
so I'm usage is Java - char you can
point where to install something and
from where to install something so we
have an empty folder here and what I
would like to install is a small
command-line utility as well called
loader a loader is used to to push Java
archives to production so I will use the
recent release use this cop link and
what I would do I will I would just use
the same command or - a mistake so I
would download the loader without the -
L and what happens behind the scenes it
will just download should download an
HTML page exactly so it didn't follow
the links so there is no redirect which
is of course not what you would expect
but let's let ignore me this for a
second
so I would like to create an git
repository first
at the D loaded or char to the
repository and then let's say we would
like this was the initial upload of our
app so now we are clean so what what I
will do here there's the same directory
I would just start a get daemon which
runs on port 42 42 of course and now I
will attempt to do two to install the
remote app so Java - char airfield and I
would like to use local folder called
install install it could be anything of
course and the remote Ori is the good
get Ori local host 42 42 and trailing
slash is important here so and what
happened is it just recognized there is
no local repository so it created once
so if we go here to get install and
loader so it was installed what you see
is the same content so if I try to do
this I get hopefully an arrow hmm
so I get something yeah inverter corrupt
char file so it just looks like a jar
but it isn't so let's fix this so I
would try to to fix the problem by
redownload Inc the utility properly and
properly means with minus L option which
follows the links and let's see so
status as you can see it's modified so
get commit and let's say jar fixed so it
is fixed now go back here and I will re
install the application just reloaded
Java - char as you can see it recognized
that it was already downloaded so just
updated this and now try the same Java -
char install
and one was it Lola fine it seems to
work so what if you it just synchronizes
the folders or what you will have to do
you will have to write a small script
with Nassau nor shell or batch file or
whatever so I will prefer nos 1 and with
two lines of code you get an auto update
in your applications so thank you for
watching and see you at a hex or at
various conferences or even in some Java
Java EE projects thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
