like to show you a little tool a
preprocessor tool integrated in name is
HTML html5 project is really valuable so
let's start with html5 project without a
template without library just a plain
tool and then i would like to configure
the project once i can see there's a
pre-configured CSS preprocessor option
and i would like to use sass and say
compile and save and what it means you
will see in a second so on what I need I
need actually one folder called scss it
stands for such sass file and then i can
say i would like to create a sass file
so NetBeans directly supports satisfy
stars are basically CSS files with a
little bit more functionality I call the
style and as you can see you have a
basic satisfied now we would like to set
up for instance a section element
configure section element and see the
color is going to be red let's say and
diff color is also right so now we have
the problem that we have direct color
and in two places so the solution is not
right and of course ret would be it is
actually fairly easy so basic color but
usually you have to use the you know
color colors from from a company's
corporate identity palette so what you
can do with sass I could say actually I
can set up and say
that's a a hex read and there's going to
be a beautiful red so and this is
actually not not CSS this is our SAS
capability of using variables and what's
nice here we can netbeans this hour of
this so I can actually get a code
completion here so and now I save this
as you can see what happened and folder
CSS was created and I get the CSS and
now my color is copied here but this
file is generated unsafe so if i change
the color to to let say yellow to a
beautiful yellow you will find two
different coz it was replaced so i think
this is a incredibly valuable for larger
projects because otherwise you will have
to work with find and replace in
multiple files and sass and less
positive supported in admin so i use
pre-primary sauce helps you to to
organize or to organize CSS better or
actually make it more maintainable so
thank you for watching and see you on
upcoming conferences workshops projects
or a hex in munich airport even with
html5 so thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
