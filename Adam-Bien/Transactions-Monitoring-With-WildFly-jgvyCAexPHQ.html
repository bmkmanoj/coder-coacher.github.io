would like to show you how to monitor
transactions in the whitefly application
server so I implemented a minimalistic
java application just comprising one
class transactions resource which is an
EJB so every method starts and committed
transactions
however the rollback method rollback c
transaction so transaction is going to
be rolled back by calling this method so
everything is deployed on the whitefly
application server Java EE supporting
Java e7 so um what I have the browser so
where if I invoke commit it will
committed transactions or just just will
add some noise to that so if something
happens it's not cached and the same
should happen with the - yeah so just go
for with that so and try this so we have
hits the toms timestamp and the commit
also works so and I would like to
connect via geo mix with the application
server are using the old fashioned j
console you could use the j visual vm as
well so connect and what I'm in most
interesting interested in is the ambans
view the and what i would like to do is
to inspect the j mix beans and so there
is an AAS folder this is this what
interests us and you will find here and
transactions pin it is some more
transactions and there are a couple of
attributes and this is what's actually
interesting is always see a number of
aborted transactions application roll
backs and in-flight transactions so
let's do so we commit something and
we're all back a couple of transactions
and refresh and we see that nothing
happens and the reason for that is there
is one attribute one attribute sorry one
attribute and it's called enable
statistics and the statistics are
disabled by default so what i would like
to do is to change it to true and just
go back again and try it
and still nothing happens and the reason
for that is we have to reload all the
subsystems or even easier I would just
restart the application server so it is
a quick process so it should work so
then we have to reconnect of course
because there is a new process so I will
come here insecure and means there is
something wrong I wanted to connect with
in whitefly again mbeans and there is
the JBoss AS folder and we will find
transactions transactions attributes and
we see statistics are enabled so why do
I remember this decision and see what
happens so I will just initiate one
rollback and we see we have one rollback
and let's try a comet and we have sorry
comet comet of you comets and we have
some comets so it is fairly easy to to
monitor subsystems in Wi-Fi most of
these subsystems comes with disabled
statistics like transactions tasks and
of course what we could do we can access
the same information via rest
