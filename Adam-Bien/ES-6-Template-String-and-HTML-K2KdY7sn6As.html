would like to combine template strings
from es6 with HTML so how to do this so
I would I have just some very simple
HTML page and a JavaScript which is
empty so what I would like to do is to
create a class first and I would like to
call it template view with a constructor
and I would like to invoke the
constructor otherwise nothing will
happen so let's do this and also I will
just print something out in issue
initialized so it looks good and we see
it in the console so seems to work now
what we need here attack let's say go
with main the main tag and this will
going to be our output and I will also
need at least a button or just click me
so we have the button and if we click
the button here we will use template
which - to generate the output here so
how to do this
first I would like to reference the
domain we have only one main so I will
just use the tag selector and also I
would like to select the button as well
also this button and let's introduce a
method and change and the method is
change view with some let's say with a
date and now I will just go here and use
a multi-line string this is the backtick
in year 6 and now I can create my
template and let's say it is P and then
I have a div with let's say the
this is the state and then what I can
also do let's say I have here a caption
that caption equals Duke and this can be
also dynamic so I can say div and then
span and use caption so this will look
like this and close TP so and now I only
have to use or register a
onclicklistener
and I will use the fat arrow functions
and not interested in the event and I
would like to call this change view and
let's say I will just pass the date so
change one date this is going to be the
date and with a little bit of luck it
should work so let's see what happens so
we have this and if we change that and
look at the elements we will see that
this actually changes every time so we
use es6 templates to generate dynamic
HTML with some placeholder all
parameters so this is actually
interesting if you if you if you need to
structure little snippets with es6 so if
you're interested in web standards take
a look at web standards the training or
see you at conferences projects or even
at a XCOM so thank you for watching and
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
