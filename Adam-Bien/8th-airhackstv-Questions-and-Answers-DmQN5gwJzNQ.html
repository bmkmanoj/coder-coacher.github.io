so the first question is question about
egb scheduler versus java ee batch
processing and what are pros and cons
when using batch processing over a gb
scheduler so to be honest I usually
start with that schedule as what
scheduler is it's just a an ejb which is
executed periodically so you can you can
set basically current expressions and
the current expressions are our cause
our method annotated with the current
expression with the annotation at
scheduled to be executing in this
basically is so what you can do you can
start jobs at night a jobs invoke
methods at night but there is no
retrying no parallel processing and no
no monitoring but still we implement a
lots of stuff using basic schedule so am
and what Java EE badge actually is so I
implemented a few years ago a very very
simple example and would like to show
you the example so this is the bedrock
processor and the bachelor processor it
just reads glassfish log files and
processes them and it it is a part of
the Java EE batch specification so it
starts with job controller which which
can be configured by applications of an
XML you can see you can set properties
you are starting the batch process or
end usually what you have you have a
reader writer on processor and I even
diplomat the partitioner where we can
specify the the parallel behavior and I
can read locks and analyze them this is
the reader and there is a writer which
writes the DD locks out and we have a
seeker which is actually the processor
which in case it's fun finds a warning
in the log files that there's something
about this so you cannot really compare
at schedule scheduler with Egypt be with
with bad
batch is more complete solution and if
you have lots of data to process and you
would like to Reno to restart the jobs i
think the the bachelor process or is the
way to go having said that i actually
this year our several times asked about
implement a java bed solution and we end
up using just straight java 8 with java
ee and it worked really well so I'm just
you know I would start with its schedule
and if you if you miss some
functionality go to the 2d java if you
do the java ee batch processes
specification i hope the answer is clear
okay the next one questions about multi
data service and egb this is actually
what i do right now in my project so i
have to access different environments
from from ejbs on a host system actually
four different environments and they are
not not only data sources they are the
whole the whole configurations actually
different but but i actually really need
a data source for this so and how to do
this it is it is really simple so i
don't know whether i will start hacking
or not so usually you would use if you
know the data sources up front what is
case in my project i just used a CD i
bin and inject it whatever i'm whatever
I knew to do this to the to the CDI bean
so all the environments with ADD
resource and and name so i specify the
name it was just basically injected and
then i probably is and i think is easier
to or faster to implement so um i will
just start with project with archetype
and this is i would use again my own
archetype and it should be workspaces
and the legendary junk folder and multi
datasource multi diaz let's call it what
it is so the basic idea would be and
this is actually what happens it is the
project has in my case jax-rs endpoint
and I get the environment from the user
so I'm just do to create the back end so
i will implement a class and call the
class a data source selector is actually
a nice name always choose cool names a
hex d s so and basically what i did is i
did something like this at the resource
and this is where you can inject the
data sources and specify the name or map
name jdbc jdbc sample so there is nate i
think i use map name this is the actual
gen di named data source data source do
you want one data source this one it's
it said this is the default one default
source default es and we have a or
default there is no default the one is
dumb deaf d s and the other one is let's
say prot TS and of course they have
different injected names so and what I
did then is a method a method which
exposed the data source exposed produced
she produce first data source and and
here you can now you can you can use for
instance here the current TS and the ND
current is something produced depending
on let's say on on the principle name or
any given context so this is produced
somewhere else and if you cannot produce
this then you just call the method data
source exposed and it will rename it to
get and you will get the data source so
actually what you will end up having is
here switch case and return the data
source what you can of course do you can
select the data sources on the fly so
you can just use initialcontext look up
but I think this is more robust because
this is evaluated at the beginning you
can even put it to a start-up
Singleton's all the data source are
injected at the beginning and expose
them depending on what on on let's say
stage Prince's you can you can use the
Java service javaserver faces project
stage and depending on this you can
produce different data sources and
ejected it as sources to the user then
let's make it least compatible so this
is a you could also of course use how
it's called invocation target injection
point I think injection point or you can
use depending on own names or whatever
and I will just return the Proteas and
now what I can do I can inject this
using just ordinary at injector I would
have an ordinary JB there's a boundary
and the boundary is an ejb stateless is
an ejb and i can just inject right now
the data source without any annotations
and if you already exposing the data
sources with then you if it collides
with something in your project you will
have to use your own qualifier like
let's say stage d dependent so what I
think it's clear so what you can do I
would always prefer no no magic
behaviors or inject whatever like using
every resource when you can do equity
while using initial context and look up
them so dynamically but this is less
robust and I think you should know what
what is configure your server because it
is really hard to configure data source
on the fly and yeah I would never do
this actually so I'm just inject
whatever you know and select them using
switch cases and expose them using
produces then you can use ed inject in
Jack whatever like I hope is clear see
any questions so I'm whether the MJ I
get response here from from AOL so
regardless whether the 68 data source or
not it
actually doesn't matter the the data
source is getting to be injected to an
to this is a depending resource so it's
going to be injected to to each obese
and and then it happens to be exceeded a
source so I think it does matter whether
it is XA or not it will just work I hope
it's clear so it's nothing special here
so if you have no further questions I
will I will go on because we have lots
of stuff to cover Oh two questions
already interceptors i would add sing
why interceptors there is actually no
case using interceptors and shirley's
inject new is the request cop you don't
have to because if you're using ejb star
justin to inject it to a EG bees so um
you there is no need to use request
scoped so um someone mentioned in a
comment you forgot to say one advantage
of spring / j ue spring you can deploy
on any container and this actually fanuc
the funny statement calls a lot of
comments and a guest and github so I'm
it's somehow true but first you should
never deploy spring on java ee server
because it's too much overlap if you
just look at ed inject and produces and
qualifier most of the annotations were
even designed by Rod Johnson anyway so
from spring so if you would just use
spring con Java eaters way too much
overhead so what I would do instead is
if you would like to run spring just run
it on tomcat or a teaser or something
like this so this works perfectly and
this is very similar to java ee so you
can just do it and another interesting
part is if you just deploy whatever you
like juice or whatever framework like
you could even you know deploy hibernate
on glassfish then you get end up having
eclipsing and in hibernate it would work
the question is why right so I've and it
would work on classes you can say okay
then I will I know omit the eclipsing
problems but yeah but I mean just you
know your decision should be reasonable
and running spring on java is server
without additional requirement isn't
reasonable because it's too much overlap
so this is like using make comparison
eclipsing and hibernate at the same time
on the same server it does not make any
sense by with an application
and of course if you consider this from
the other way so if you think what
happens if spring as a problem right is
there any alternative where you can just
migrate away from spring to something
else is it something comparable so I
know I can deploy to any container on
any container I don't know what what
happens with what happens with java 6 in
Java 7 they're actually pretty portable
so what I actually do frequently right
now I switch between glassfish whitefly
and Tommy in java 6 a lot in fact my
current project is Tommy sometimes they
tested on white flight there are
actually no issues and where to expect
issues I would always expect issues in
the persistence but i think the
injection would work everywhere so um
yeah but some the the spring spring
statements always finally always cause
some discussions or keep them coming
always fun and oh we have something on
Twitter do we have something oh now do
we have the Twitter parallel discussion
whether Java is synchronous or not and
the vertex guys the vertex guys say had
a nice statement about javi so I think
generally Java is going the right
direction so this is what what the
response was so what is actually nice so
I'm a parallel discussion of Twitter
which is highly appreciated so I think
we cover the oh how do you manage
deployed microservices status house
check restarting look locally and on
service so um so we have no time to
cover microservices but I'm I will
deliver some some talks soon and even
one talk at Java user group inc dansk
Danzig and and and on conferences so I
will try to explain what is my
understanding at the micro services we
could do it the next ax for instance
there is nothing to do to do we could
discuss microservices and and what I do
is actually a fully transparent because
I do it on editorial on github so f a
project to run a pink acre and a project
and what it will do right now it will
deploy pink
on white line so and pink is just on war
so I can pick the application so plus
means it is running so i can look what
is actually installed on the server on
this is the system properties I can list
the namespaces the comp and namespace is
empty because you can end global
namespaces and I have to put time here
you see a memory statistics so the
whitefly uses right now 190 and 19
megabyte of ram and and and this is what
i use for for for basic monitoring and
this could be and this is just technical
pinging you know the application and
usually i expose more business data like
you know number of processing protest
item per second or whatever it really is
it with java and integrators as well
because this is more or less mini
classes just whether the application is
basically running not actually whether
whether it is well running right so in a
couple of this actually all my
microservices nano services femto
services whatever services have such a
pink and what i did i created a
corresponding project the name is of
course floyd and the floyd is a java fix
application and what I can do with Floyd
is I can say what is the Floyd come on
Floyd so I just builds everything with
maven and just recreated from scratch
the whole application build of course
with afterburner 8070 I can actually
scan all the ports and what it did it
found the application running here and
it will create a tab per application so
I can refresh and see you know the pink
times and what I also experimented with
is I could create a a this is still in
the making some threshold so it's saying
if the pink time decreases or the load
average somehow gets a problems then i
can create alerts or something like this
but these are using for
for basic management and i created a
watchdog.org if you go to watch doc you
can monitor your local it's not running
your local doctor service and and this
is just to see what what containers are
running so this is what I actually using
in my leisure and what I'm doing on my
clients is a I mean a little bit
problematic because lots of ndas but
emeralds i would say large companies
have the instructure anyway so they have
Santa like nachos jammies or whatever
and smaller companies we build something
more pragmatic but it is very similar
what we do right now here and if you
remember the light fish project just go
to my github account light fish project
that something similar it exposes a lots
of statistics were installs them in a
database so I see over time what the
application server is doing this is what
I actually do to manage my own micro
services and this also what I suggest to
my clients and lots of my clients is
something similar um yeah okay I hope it
is clear no questions perfect so let's
see the next point how do you I use
docker what set up locally on service um
so I can show you this right now so I'm
also funny statement so actually I used
darker for over one year i think i
started with zero for something on my
server works well but no one was
interested in dr. one year before and
now it just took off so um so first i
have a base image and in this base
images you can see it's based on fedora
f20 surges actually yeah should be about
several month old image but still works
well so i create whatever I like openssh
whatever I need as you can see i also
have a top secret password here and you
can see i can add and pink war to each
image so it's just part of the of the
whole thing and i'm using JDK 18
everywhere and what I also do i link to
jjs because I nice and
horn for automation and if you look for
instance on my block it runs on Tommy 16
plus and white waiting for Tommy 20 it
would be job a seven or more
interestingly x-ray so it runs on white
fly 810 it was a glass dish for all
earlier so there was actually not big
deal just to do in order to deploy the
application on glassfish and so I'm just
creating manually to open the image and
then exposing the parts and starting /
and have lots of of scripts with some
conventions to start this and I'm lots
of the scripts of rigging in an ass one
because it's easy as in JavaScript and
what's also interesting i have here
continuous deployment setup and what it
actually is it is Jenkins which runs in
on container but talks to the dhaka
instance and it manages all the other
images so I'm something I can meet a
container which automates the creation
of all other images and the whole thing
here is stored in a git repository this
is not optimal but but but but very
simple to use so everything at Dewey
here isn't it and then I put the changes
to the server so i will move to a dog
registry but this is what I do right now
I just synchronize both machines with
get so I have exactly the same image on
my machine as on a service there is no
difference and this one's for over one
year and prior to this it was based on
kvm and prior to this was based on
oracle vm so this is what i always did
and for unknown reasons dr. just took
off which is actually nice zone and that
now i can talk at conferences were
actually doing in my leisure ok um this
is what I what I do and this I will
probably write some blog posts about the
docker I I thought it's not interesting
enough but yeah if you ask for this you
can get some posts ok so I think we
managed okay and why doc is so exciting
for for those of you who never heard
about dakka dakka is a mix of thing
about dr. like virtualization but crazy
faster sexual
approaches running on a unix on a linux
server so and and there's actually old
story what what dhaka is it's like
solaris zones or PSD jails is actually a
very similar technology but on unix
linux based on LX c lynn linux is Alexi
linux containers and what's also nice it
comes with copy and right fri system i
think so dislike any change you do to
the image are versioned and and you can
refer to the changes so it's really easy
to you know to go to the recent version
or 2d to the current version and the
docket comes with a build system which
is actually this so you can build your
own images and and pass the images to
the server and stuff like this so it's i
would say a mix of mavin get and very
fast virtualization but at the end of
the day nothing new but very usable I
think the usability is key point here in
Dhaka back then with oracle vm or with
kvm it tooks minutes to start up an
image and docket it the same thing takes
seconds so i hope you are now dr. eyes
this was the question about dhaka so the
old question does just f play well with
javascript frameworks of course and this
is a recurring question somehow i mean
you have to be careful if you ask such a
question the question should be rather
if i'm using primefaces could i use it i
don't know jquery on top or something
like this so now plain jsf will always
work well with with JavaScript or CSS
frameworks because there is you know
nothing which which is more
sophisticated just plain components I
can do whatever like and in fact we do
it a lot too so we combined SF with
foundation or bootstrap it just works
out of the box is actually no problem
there's actually even I think is called
angular faces so there is a actually
project meant to combine yes angular
faces for instance you know we just
paste it to a project which helps to
migrate from jsf to back to angular or
whatever so there's a lot of
projects going on and there's also lots
of providers which comes with with we
just posted a chant which even decouple
the core GSF from the jsf jas javascript
widgets so i'm absolutely so there is
actually no limitation but i think the
common mistake so I'm repeating myself
but there's a recurring questions I have
to is that the people just evaluate the
frameworks like icefaces primefaces
richfaces according to something I don't
know architectural decision whatever
without showing the actual component to
the end users and then the end users
expect the impossible from the
developers and then is where the pain
starts because the poor the needy poor
developers have to implement something
which the framework was never meant to
and they have to extend dfgd components
which is beginning of the end so I think
John was just f just used to no html5
now it's called html5 friendly markup
search for this this is perfect you can
do whatever like is this a plain html5
code or if you commit to a tour to a
component vendor just stick with it and
don't even try to extend the components
I would buy support and just you know by
the extensions from the vendor and not
implemented this by yourself this is how
Jeff was always meant to the question
number 7 is interested and I had some
similar problems in the past I think
even ten years ago with the old egbe too
sorry contain a marriage persistence to
and and I wrote a post a while ago away
it's impossible to automatically handle
optimistic lock exceptions and and and
the and someone asked me what what if
there are different tables and the
problem with tables is just will not
directly answer the question because you
will see in a second is really almost
impossible to answer the question so on
how jpa and most of the persistence
frameworks behave is somehow interesting
interesting so I'm what happens is they
they they look at the table
which fields are changing and of course
foreign key is such a field so um which
which side of the relation is changed
depends where you put the foreign key in
one-to-one relations for instance so if
you put the key on the wrong side the
changes are not going to be detected in
one too many relations there's actually
no choice where to put the foreign key
but it is actually change on the wrong
side which is also also also funny no
funny across on trouble in the past so
I'm be careful with optimal optimistic
lock exceptions and relations they
probably don't work as you expect so
write some tests so this is why it's
almost impossible to answer the question
and and and of course yeah because what
you would do what what you will have to
do is you will have to model the
relation as a table itself and then you
can do whatever like so you can say okay
whether the relation is nice consistent
or not right but it happens a lot in
Java 7 we have orphan relations stuff
like this was not not not accessible
before so it is I think the question is
not answered it cannot be answered but I
hope your our right now of some some
problems by the way um don't panic we
have two questions to go but we have
lots of comments in the gist so I would
just switch to gist after after we're
done with this and to work through
through the comments right now because
the last time I forgot some questions to
answer so I would do it right now can
you share some updates on how to do
availability j apps in light of j 7 and
tackling session stored data and this is
easy easy question to answer because
what we do at the ax at the regular ax
event at munich airport we discuss
exactly this and what I my suggestion is
to turn off session clustering and stead
full session bean clustering because it
is actually impossible to find the right
strategy so um either this session is
going to be replicated synchronously and
it will be slow or asynchronously which
is fast but not consistent so whatever I
do you will actually lose end actually
you should not rely that the session is
persistent so you you should consider
session
as a cash no that's a persistent store
if you model the application that way
you will never have problems with
session and what I do in my commercial
project I try to make my clients aware
that if we if we if the application
server dies this session is lost and all
the users will have to relock in which
is usually not a problem so we have done
interesting discussion the airport
Munich there were some cases were it was
not viable to do this because it happens
all the time microservices so in this
particular case you should store this
session probably in the database or or
in memory grid or somewhere and this
actually there are some possibilities
like for instance GSR 107 je cache is
perfectly suitable for this or use hazel
house or whatever but there's always the
problem that a if you you cannot
distribute the cash in a scalable and
and and scalable consistent and
performant way it yeah it would be a
miracle so I hope the basic questions
are covered so I will switch to guests
and then switch back to my comments but
it because this is def right order so
someone asked me am so this is al you
can I was really asked me several times
the question about actually this
question about you scoped and request
scoped and I thought I answer the
question the last time but I didn't so
I'm i will try to to I did some research
actually so and the first the request
scope question so um ingest arm so what
we have to know in java 7 request scoped
in GSF is actually a request cop in CDI
and it is clearly defined so the
question was when it started when it
ends request scoped and view scope and
the definition of requests scoped is it
starts so the service method of a
servlet happens already in d in the or
or DM to filter and service
in indo filled and service the scope is
already active so what it actually means
if you inject a request co Binh to us to
a filter or service method of our
service on a servlet within the service
and so do get in the post method of any
sublet request scope will work what it
means in turn in jsf the whole face is
servlet is enclosed in request coped so
if you if you would change the source
code of the faces so glad you could
inject to the faces servlet your request
means and according to a specification
it should work if it doesn't the
application server have a back has a
back but it should and so what it
actually means request copter defined in
full and closes all the java ee
http-based components and so servlets
and filters so whatever framework we are
using you can rely that within your
servlet and filter all requests scope is
active so the view scoped is defined a
little bit differently and so what it
actually means the view scoped is active
within a single view ID job when the
navigation handler changes so if the
method navigation and the handle
navigation and the view ID changes after
the invocation the view scope is no more
active so what it actually means is that
the view scoped remains active within a
view if you swap to another view it is
no more active and this is defined that
with the navigation endless was clearly
defined and this is the java dog for
this so i can put the Javadoc to chat
and i think I answer the question
clearly if not ask me now otherwise I
will closely questioned I will never
ever talk about this okay I think
perfect now macomb see one this is a I
got lots of image from from him and it's
actually really nice guy and what I just
did that there were some discussion and
just pasted the whole discussion 2-d 2-d
2-d Vicky so it's not like he doesn't
like Java in contrary so it just was
curious what I what I'm saying about so
and this was some objections to jsf and
java i will just try to digest the the
question
and answered it answer the questions on
the right so jess f is a component and
event-based MVC framework another
request based MVC framework so um and
and their suggest is that was not
successful because it tried to attempted
to abstract away HTML CSS and HTML fun
one it was like 10 years ago but is no
more the case so if you're using Java 7
or Java 86 you could still try to
abstract if you use components or you
can just stick with plain HTML 5 so it
will nothing will be abstracted and yeah
and component based framework is not
good for large form based app this is
what I don't get because it's
particularly good for large based and I
think it's not component-based but it
took occurred to me that I saw some
session the Java one this year that eBay
is using GSF and I would say ebay is
somehow large but not from based and
there are lots of project using jsf
successfully and the problem is always
if you're using a component framework
and the component framework does not
fits your need and then you are in
trouble because then you have to
understand the component framework HTML
markup and CSS and and everything so on
the jsf generates garbage tables is not
true it really depends which components
you are using and designer doesn't have
to know what jess f is doing so it is
really of course there are component
framework to a generating table based
design so if you are using this I mean
then it will be wrong it's like saying
you know there is about properly some
swing component based frame was reaching
in by and you can find a crappy one you
can say okay swing core java Vic's are
crappy because there's one framework
which doesn't behave right so um what is
generated it really depends on your own
you're on your framework and oh we have
some some feedback let's see what
happens so nothing okay those just other
discussion
we can use JavaScript framework in
depending with jsf so we did a lot why
not you can always do this I mean there
is no you can always do it again if
you're using if you bought a component
framework for jsf and this component
framework uses a lot of JavaScript let's
say jquery whatever it could collide
with your javascript of course but if
you are just using jsf out of the box
there will be no collisions and spring
MVC scalability is higher than GSF
probably I mean you could try to use GSF
you can you cannot compare this because
I couldn't argue point three would be
plain Jessie J's piece will are our
highest callable than spring embassy for
sure there are they scale like crazy but
and and if you would just use static
page generator which actually I
implemented in NASA on a static page mr
a generator will outperform everything
and but if you would write your HTTP
server with assembler it will be the
fastest one right so this is always you
know a trade-off between the reusability
maintainability and and and performance
so spring embassy is scalable / / GSF so
i would say someone likes MVC spring
embassy more than GSF so if you like it
more then use it okay then problemy gb
32 e7 high-level transaction spring is
better than a gb i would say almost no
difference so I mean in Egypt bees there
is there's declarative transaction and
and and and being managed transactions
pin many transactions are very flexible
but mostly needed and I don't even use
the the decorative transactions egb I
just stick with the default and a few
years ago I used a requires new right
now I just don't use anything and it
works out of the box actually in code
reviews I search actively for
transactions you'll find something which
is which as in cross-section are so key
word I considers a defect so I'm I never
miss anything but if you miss something
we probably get a gb 33 in Java 8 so we
could fix this so if you if you have no
key point
why not inheritance abroad heb is not
support inheritance but spring supports
this of course and it should be would
support inheritance but with the
injection will be a little bit weird to
what happens then by the way CDI does
support intern heritance but i cannot
remember when i use it so inheritance
for service object is widely overused
and i would just get rid of inheritance
altogether if you have rather boring
financial apps in object oriented world
will be a little bit different but but
EG bees are not objects are services or
utility classes so i think is more
important that jpa support supports
inheritance not not spring or or our
jeebies the creative transactions that
were argue it gee bees are very good so
i'm actually too good so you actually
don't need us agb doesn't run on
lightweight web server like tomcat so
what we started we white right 81 with
deployed application without any tuning
what was it 107 megabyte ram I the
difference between plane Tomcat and
Tommy or or white fly is about 30 max I
actually delivered a talk I think it was
geek on or 33 degrees conference a few
years ago and compared to all the
servers I think there's rom is no more
issue so did the difference between
pivotal and and Tommy would be lets say
adverse right 100 max ram but if you try
to buy one at max ram and don't even
will spend a euro on this i mean the
receipt doesn't matter except you're
building a cloud right the deployment
issue is often challenging with the
older specs the new aspects is actually
absolutely not challenging it works
really well so we deployed the
applications on Wi-Fi and and and classf
it from glassfish to white find it
worked what is challenging is not a gb
SSD persistence but spring doesn't fix
this because spring doesn't come with on
persistent except spring data but not
like there is no i'm not aware of
something like jpa implementation of
spring so easier interceptors
interpretive spring is more easier it
can be an easier i mean
just look on my youtube I don't know
where they recorded a screencast if not
i will record one i think it is possible
to create an interceptor in one minute
spring is more powerful this is true but
easier i mean in java we have
interceptors and you are done so
actually one annotation you have to know
one annotation and it should be not
support all service and this is what I
don't get actually of course Egypt bees
are run on all application service ok so
we combat t too many think the last time
already so I would skip the question so
or short answer is I try to answer
everything right so the short answer is
one too many so I would just use one too
many if there are any problems then it
will find for solution but I wouldn't I
would never actually start with the
workaround so I'm right some tests right
simple code if you if you bump to some
problems then then do something about
this but but never start with a
recurrent this would be my my
suggestions you can see some nice
comments to about spring so um yeah and
this what i seen java 7 is lean is
actually extremely lean this is actually
my perception so I'm by the way my
docker container their server is red hat
enterprise linux and its boot so fast
that you don't even see the progress bar
so i'll probably with spring or juice
whatever i will start even faster but I
mean whether it starts two seconds fast
or not I really don't care anymore it is
really crazy fast and all the whole
deployment is fast so I'm doing mmm
implementing right now some angular
applications what's what's funny is the
java ee deployment and start is a life
away faster of the back end then running
a karma test or build for the front end
so it's actually really fun and no one
complains about this right so so um yeah
so the question is it's like java is not
not not easy enough for for security and
I have actually completely different
point of view of course so if you if you
go if you search for us java magazine i
wrote an article about this mug
America's seen Adam beam and security
you will probably find an article yes
authentication authorization I will just
paste it to the chat
okay so how much wrote that I will visit
the dance Java use a groupie I will do
in December forgot the date but it will
be December so if you like we can meet
us there so um and I will just miss use
the already created project to explain
you the basic principle of the article
so what you can do is the following
let's say oh nice name principal
principal extend our my principal
produces this is the M and I'm injecting
here the actual principal so and this is
just a class and this is will just
create the class not fear so in this
class has a name and the list of I don't
know entitlements or something like this
so now it comes the following
observation principle good name is
unique so if it is unique I use it as a
lookup go to my own database it's JP a
no sequel whatever fetch whatever I like
and exposes my principal and is
injectable everywhere combining with a
very simple interceptor I can create a
really powerful security in minutes and
this is what we did in all the project
as more than sufficient and before this
I was asked about crazy frameworks to
use and this is actually what we always
did because usually the authentication
and authorization are separated so
authentication is in the you know in the
corporate realm and the authorization is
to be flexible and this is what we
actually implement it and just read the
article so this is um if you have time
and this is what I try to show because
it is this was a few years ago the most
asked questions right now it comes back
but it is I think java 6 and java 7
handles really well something like a
spring secure and the others are better
you know in integrating with or out and
all do you know legacy or a gas heat
know the the surrounding infrastructure
but from the power java 86 in Java 7 are
just good enough so there's actually no
issue or in my eyes if it is then just
ask me right now so we can go over this
and ok so this was the last question
here and then let's go through the 3d
comments how to implement an MVC using
jacks or SSD controller I would never
use the used use this because in Java 8
will get a dedicated MVC framework which
which MVC spec while view controller
spec with reference implementation and
if you like MVC just look at v raptor we
discussed briefly at the recent a hex as
well so look at the v raptor is a nice
MVC framework just completely based on
CDI and will rule in lino configuration
or XML just pure MVC
so the repertoire open JP versus
hibernate and vs. eclipselink so I'm
hibernated was the leader and what is
funny so a few years ago as I started to
introduce glassfish v1 and v2 due to the
enterprises everyone was afraid of
eclipsing what do you have to know
eclipsing is based on top link and top
link is was implemented in small dogs is
actually older than Java there are lots
of mature code there and it was ported
to Java it is one of the oldest jpa or
persistence frameworks so hibernate an
eclipse link i would say eclipsing is
crazy fast and hibernate as well as
really to come it's really hard to
compare them there are some you know
specs and order which our that
eclipselink is faster but if you use no
hibernated with ogm it could be little
bit faster really hard to say what i am
what is funny right now and so people
really like eclipselink and if they move
away from glassfish before to to to
Wi-Fi they take sometimes eclipselink
because of the Knights error messages so
error message ischium seems seems to be
an issue I consider both as equally well
hi banana clips think I had some really
bad experiences with open GPA but it was
prior to version v2 I will have to to
retest it with v2 and see whether they
improve or not but back then it was
really bad so we created some tests it
was terrible so the third question no
sequel this is a great question so what
is preferable something like native
drivers or extraction like GPA and this
is therefore interesting because no no
sequel it could be beneficial to have
unstructured data let's imagine you have
a restful endpoint and unnu and you
sending json objects back and forth with
jpa arrow sorry with Java 8 and lambdas
it could be really interesting or very
easy to process the object on the fly so
you actually don't need our real objects
you know to talk to the database you can
just stick with native drivers on the
other hand if you have object or
anything storage and you are forced to
use no secret because of political
decision whatever then and jpa could be
interesting but for instance in my
project x ray i switch from JP a 22
plain hazel cast to hash maps and really
happy with the decision because I don't
need actually the objects another
project it would be impossible to switch
from jpa to know sickle because it would
be never an option to use hash maps to
model the business logic really depends
on a project but there is no real answer
to this but and what what is amusing a
little bit sometimes it having just a
hashmap is a good enough to not always
need to know the full blown or em mappa
to store a view data two pieces of data
to the back end and sometimes it could
be also interesting to use you know
something completely different like
graph graph oriented stores and or
document databases and then just using
you know mapping them to jpa would be
just insane I mean we way to complicate
it okay that's interesting you said that
on boring enterprise project i'm really
curious where i said this so i said it
on often so boring enterprise project
bottom is a I would be curious were you
here does al where I said is so I'm so
that i'm using a multi-module i use
actually a lot multi-module and the
reason for this is what i usually have
is I have a monolithic project let's say
X ray then I get the system tests x ray
st and then properly you I part so I get
some some completely independent
projects and would like to build them so
what i do i create and super problem
which just invokes all the project so
they can build them completely one after
another this is what i usually do but
this is not like i'm using this because
of modular ization i'm using this
because of laziness i would like to
build everything together so um this is
even more interesting question so um
this is from Mattias and the question is
microservice a restful communications so
um I think we cannot answer the question
right now but I would try so what to do
with the API and and we spent i think at
the x I don't know what there are some
prior eric has on the air right now so i
think the most discussed topic is this
and
type save vs. fluent api's where how did
you lose the API and I would say you
have two possibilities you can say I'm
have unknot typesafe API and exposing
the API to the clients but I'm really
ensuring the the backward compatibility
with lots of tests so in this case I
wouldn't expose anything to the client
so they can will be in charge to use the
api out of the box is really easy and if
you if you are using you know something
like angular you don't need details
anyway so I'm what is then nice you know
ddd API is more stable if you release
the details you are in charge ddd api
providers in charge of the API and this
come this can come with some political
issues how to deal with this you know
sign ups and stuff like this so i think
whether you will create a details and
which team will create the details is
really a political issue usually the
best would be if there is one API team
we just cares about the rest services
and the details and and this is the API
team but it actually never happens in
practice right so I'm I tend not to
create details I just create rest rest
api ice and that is indeed indeed the
rest aps are good there is actually no
problem to map to the AP is also an
interesting statement i tend to use more
and more plain jason without any without
having any the possibility to use xml
and this works better and better
actually the better and better it works
really fine so in this particular case i
don't need details at all because i have
d jason API and adjacent api from java
is seven is actually are actually
details um one question very simple one
where to put the business logic
operation database where we can use in
project both checks or s and jsf so i'm
very very simple answer in boundary so
I'm we have the boundary which contains
the earth is actually facet and the GDD
business logic can be in controls or in
the boundary and the jax-rs is just and
expose it exposes the boundary via
restful web services this is
surely what happens and and yet this is
this is this is the answer and we talked
a lot about entity controlled boundary
so it should be clear what to do just
search for entity controlled boundary my
name and probably a hex I wish see lots
of material and by the way I am I in the
last two years I helped a lot of two
different startup companies and I always
am we use ECB a lot and I ask them what
is your experience is a B and they will
like it so it's like okay this is very
clear and simple pattern just works so
this is what's their response which I
really appreciate so I'm robbery at my
old friend asked and this is actually I
will have to do some research and no
time to look at this but the question is
how to expose jndi services from a jca
adapter what I did once and actually is
described in the green book here this
initial context is a method called
rebind and you could expose whatever
liked using referenceable so there is a
there is a gen di interface i think it's
called referenceable and it worked on
glassfish but i have no idea what is
actually the d common way to expose
objects biogen the eyes or from JC a 16
connectors i will have to look at this
specification so am i cannot answer the
question right now whether there's a
standard way to do to do so and but just
try with initial context i think it's
called rebind and i would put it in the
class which starts the connector i think
it is a adapter to class which
implements the adapters the first class
and you could at the boot time try to
expose your stuff to the connector okay
i think we did we covered lots of ground
and there is one interesting internal
story so um there is a new page called X
TV so I would go to a hex TV so this is
where you probably see me live right now
so those would be interesting Oh
decoupling so and this all the archives
so this is the ddd page of exe file EXT
v
and I x Ã¬ Ã³Ã¹ which is going to be
repurposed to something else and as you
can see our I'm just in the uploading
some stuff here and what it is it is the
first part of the bootstrap online so
this would be the online course soon in
a view of you at most few weeks and yeah
so this is what I actually exactly one
hour I never thought it will be possible
do you have any questions from the chat
or Twitter if not see you in winter no
questions no questions see you in
december and by the way also also
forgotten I scheduled the shows until
2015 so so August so you can if you like
you can you can have also to register
myself here you are going to be notified
about the progress so um so thank you
for watching and see you and what I'm so
see you and one of our upcoming
conferences workshops a hex Munich
Airport so in December there are lots of
registration already and I will also
continue these special days next year
microservices workshop a lots of
registrations so where is the page
workshops so the microserver lots of
registrations actually the everything is
full so if you like to to attend do it
soon because I think we will close the
registration earlier because we get too
many registrations so I'm thank you for
watching and see you in december</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
