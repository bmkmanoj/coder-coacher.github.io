admit java one was really great so was
lots of technical contents lots of news
javelin started with unofficially with
glassfish and netbeans party + fish
party was extremely well attended as
well as the netbeans party actually at
the NetBeans day their room was full and
I couldn't get in as a speaker and the
and the organizers didn't believe me
that I'm speakers or took a while to
convince them and I came a little bit
late so sorry for that again and here I
showed some tricks with maven the
NetBeans about I think five minutes or
so and the other speakers also showed
that leads from different aspects we've
got lots of questions so it was actually
very good so DM technical keynote at
sunday was a little bit to formula would
say and they're taking the content was
cut off so this was a pity but the
community the actual community keynote
at Thursday was great so I'm this
actually really paid off and yeah I
spent the first two day 14 hours at
javaone so I'm lots of time and
listening two sessions I really enjoyed
it and I delivered a view talks NASA on
java ee about best practices or or
reasonable practices and what surprised
me the most I delivered a talk called
productive Java Vic's and what I did I
Hector one hour long some afterburner
application and this session was very
good attended and I got lots of Tengu
questions regarding javafx and
structuring and even after burners or
arm seems like a little bit hot topic so
on it was as well as well attended as
the last one or Java he talks so I'm
java java one was really great and see
you probably next year so I'm what was
also interesting Johan falls from la
John
and robo vm they will join forces and
deliver Java fix on Android and iOS so
this was great news day one actually
Duke Choice Awards inter joins openjdk
so lots of news and you know great
vacations for me and what I actually did
I recorded a short video about Java one
um yeah so thank you and enjoy it a some
impressions from San Francisco in Java
one this was the first evening as you
can see terrible weather lots of fog and
rain it was really nice weather and this
is in marina headlands headlands this is
the name of the headland so if you will
see in the near future a project for me
with the name headlands you you will
know from where the net name is coming
from so um and this is actually the
NetBeans day as you can see they've been
even taking something for the audience
this is the author of Java a nutshell
till the last edition and this was the
old friend Luke so there he was again
and this was the line to delete to the
technical keynote and so it started the
keynote so was the i think it was sunday
yes Sunday and yeah this was the machine
he the computers I actually wanted also
to record some interviews with Java
luminaries but I really had no
this
rock stars with the videos didn't even
you this and this is the exalogic this
is I think one of the fastest computers
on planet so you can see still with Sun
logo which is somehow nice there are
lots of exalogic and this is the robot
built or Birds program programmed at
least with james gosling and he does it
in Java ME and with Ned bit of course
and this is a java fix applications with
the demo application really nice looks
really nice design created by the java
league folds for folks from oracle and
this is a nice robot called now you can
program with c and java so I'm solutely
nice robot there are actually three
different robots but the smaller one
were in the booth or in the explosion
exposition in the hilton hotel and
actually i dunno time to visit the
exhibition hall because the new sessions
were so great so on
educators are free more frequently visit
than last year's also good time so just
and this is the community keynote which
was excellent from high perspective it
was full energy that James how it's
called James Weaver from Oracle was a
really great great moderator you enjoyed
us this is backstage you can see how it
looks like from from the backstage and
this is our friend James Garcia the
inventor of Java and which is branding
and invention as a t-shirt shooting and
the thing once he should outside the
hall which is remarkable and this is the
last day the last evening everyone
enjoyed erath myth i skipped and
cancelled aerosmith because it is it
takes too long and yeah so um the first
question is actually from chat and I saw
the question this was from last time
sahaja ask me we have wars communicated
with other with rest also do you have do
you use separate models databases per
service allah microservices so and this
was i cannot remember the context
anymore but it is actually the case so
what I try to achieve in my projects
built a view monolithic Wars so what
monolithic means i will just skip to
this so what monolithic means is i have
worse like this one war one war and in
my case even each were each war runs on
a dedicated virtual machine on an
application server and of course they
are isolated because there are actually
two processes so there is just java
communication is not possible so what i
use I use HTTP rest and in one current
project we use actually in memory grid
so hazel cast it looks like we've right
to a map which is which is automatically
distributed to all cluster nodes so we
use a hazel cast for communication but
you could also use cover ends or eh cash
or
ever and the hazel cast is great because
you can even register here listeners so
if something changes here you get
notified here so it's actually almost
like a GMS you could also use different
protocols like Kafka amqp or whatever
but the idea is be binary decoupled and
to be decoupled here in my project we
use JSON for communications or are the
maps come from JD case there's no real
coupling and we use Jason for
communication between Wars you can
equally well invoke this via rest and
what rest means is a nice nice business
API so now we covered the last question
from last time so somehow I didn't saw
this so and I think this is answered
this also answered yeah ok so the next
question is so I get a couple of
questions and I just have to go to the
block to CD last one so we covered the
very first one so different ways to
reference an entity manager from an
entity this is somehow recurring topic
and actually they are they are let's say
three possibilities no let's say there
are three possibilities the first one is
threadlocal so on the pattern is called
context holders we can just go to to the
patterns repository or see my book so
called pot context holder pattern and
and the context hold I and I implemented
in two different ways in one way I used
threadlocal so this is a blessing
nothing to do with Java easier even
little dangerous in Java EE because it
is dependent on on threats and you can
put the entity manager to a to a
threadlocal and access the spread local
from from an entity you like if they are
running in the same threat and what i
usually do i implement a static method
so helper method so and with the static
input I can just invoke the entity
manager with something like am and I get
the entity manager in their entity so it
looks like something like this so and
this is of course static methods so this
is the first one so the next one the
next possibility is the jndi look up so
the entity Mendes is actually stored in
jindie as well so you can access the
entity measures from jndi so it should
work and the third one is tran a section
run transaction synchronization registry
and transaction synchronization registry
is injectable everywhere with ed
resource but it is also accessible
through from Jan di so you can you can
use gender I look up to get a reference
to transaction synchronization registry
if you have the registry canned you can
store whatever like in the transaction
synchronization Reggie's registry also
the entity manager so it's also possible
of course the the last possibility is to
pass this on some parameter which is a
little bit boring but again threadlocal
Jenny I look up and actually I wrote an
article and the article i think is even
three it has to be java magazine Adam
bean Jane di resources an old article
yeah perfect and it was exactly three
years ago lots of time so what I
described here and there you can use ad
resource at inject and persistence
context to reference different resources
and as well as the entity managers or
pastors to the chat here perfect
oh I get also very good question
multiple heterogeneous persistence units
not Excel best practice it is actually a
perfect question I think this is one of
the most discussed questions during the
regular a hexa Munich so in one day I
think we spent half are they discussing
this so actually if you if you have
something like this you have different
persistent stores like let's say
database let's say flat file there are
no transactions at all what the only
thing you can do is attempt to be
idempotent what idempotent means is
let's say if you have a right you should
use an idea if you have multiple rights
not causing any duplicative course if
something went wrong you can retry until
it just works it's a problem with this
it is actually impossible to be
consistent so if you have let's say two
different databases which are not
transactional on a flat file it is game
over actually it is impossible to do to
keep all three Resources consistent so
what you should do instead be
asynchronous go to the first resource do
something if it fails you need a
compensative transaction which is not a
technical transaction rather than a
business transaction so what it actually
means if you order something the
transaction should be you know to
attempt to cancel the order and what can
of course happen it some costs could be
involved like also a hotel cancellation
or something like this so I'm the point
being is you cannot solve it by
technology you have to solve it with
with business so this is the twiddle
candle handler can not even remember hex
foresee for a 0 a 46 thank you for the
question is well good one so next
regular question so where is it
what our session scope stayed through
session means this is a quick one so if
you are using a if you do something like
this public class shopping cart and you
can do the following and i can write
stateful what stateful means there is
one-to-one relation between the state
for session bean and the client so what
it means if you have a reference to the
state full session bean it belongs to
you and you will have to clean up the
reference this is what stateful actually
means and sessions means this
stateful session bean is bound to the
HTTP session so if the session
disappears all state full session beans
get clean up as well this is actually so
the sessions code means the state full
session beans are bound to the HTTP
session and without sessions cobs means
the state full session bean are bound to
the client and only the client can clean
up the state full session means yeah
this is actually a quick very quick
question quick and good so our next one
okay perfect the next question is so
request scoped entitymanager web
frameworks so um I got a question how to
deal with entitymanager and what it
means that the entity manager is request
cope so the last time I mentioned you
can produce an entity manage and inject
it somewhere so what you can absolutely
do is the following so i will write some
pseudocode as well i could do something
like this entitymanager expose this
could be any pooja like and say
producers so and now what happens the
entity manager gets injected somewhere
we
at inject and with what it actually
means is it means that the entity
manager the scope of the entity managers
dependent on someone who uses the entity
manager so if this were a request coped
pin which requests the entitymanager the
engineer manager would be injected into
using the request scope so what requests
what the scopes actually mean there will
be only one entitymanager Peskov only
one instance Peskov what you can also do
we could say entitymanager request
scoped and this actually means only one
entitymanager pair in this request is
going to be creating regardless what
this injected sword usually also means
the framework will have to generate a
proxy for this so so far so good so we
have described the entity manager but a
question was rather if I have a web
framework it looks like I probably
drawing is a better idea so if I have a
web framework it will looks like this so
usually I have a I have let's say Jess F
so that I would have a backing bean
which is usually a model here and the
model I would inject a boundary what
boundary is a stateless session bean so
what happens right now is the
transaction is getting to be started
here and committed here so what it means
internals that actually after the method
invocation all entities here get
detached so if you you would have here
let's say vehicle and vehicle has wheels
so on multiple wheels and they are lazy
loaded you would get exception at this
point of time if you try to access the
wheels so what you should do of course
in in you should use how it's called
join fetch and in in java 6 in
excuse me in Java is seven you can load
any graph you like with attributes so
you can specify them in load them on
demand so this is what you should do of
course you could invoke together but the
problem with this is you have to invoke
together so what usually happens in some
projects they they decide to use D TOS
which is somehow crazy so they're forced
developers to copy all the data from the
entities 2d Toews to me to to solve the
problem with lazy loading so now there
is a pattern cut and this pattern says
that what you can do is you can keep the
T request the the transaction opened a
little bit longer so let's say here and
in order to do so you usually could use
a filter sublet filter and sublet filter
is applicable on na Java framework like
so if you have the filter then the
transaction could be open here and
closed here so it means that in the
entire backing bean you can lazy load
all the all the dependencies so if the
application gets a little bit more
complicated little bit more
sophisticated loading on each request
all the entity graph is not a very good
idea so what you could do instead you
can keep everything stateful and in this
particular I think what you could do you
could inject an extended entitymanager
here and and keep the model or the state
full session bean needs to be stateful
then so it and extend Identity Manager
means the entities are not getting
closed here at the end of transactions
of transaction does not cause closing
the entity manager and detaching the
entities now in someone suggested the
last time what you could do a quick
create a filter which for instance
produces an entity manager which is
extended and then the aunt Ida manager
could be injected here here or here and
the whole all objects which which
participate in the session would have a
reference to the entitymanager it would
work I never did this is actually very
interesting idea and if someone asked
the question on conference
and i will probably implement a proof of
concept right now all my applications
are rather restful and boring but a few
years ago I hadn't row 34 projects
really sophisticated projects and I
think it wouldn't be possible to
implement the application in a stateful
way but right now all my applications
are very happy with stateless
architecture so right now for me there
is every no time to implement proof of
concept for this but it will work so I
think we explain the question here I
hope so there is no full up right
everyone is happy this is perfect if not
please write something to chat or the
Twitter so I'm next one what is the next
question also interesting one should 12
month one too many GPA relationships be
avoided and error mr. Rodriguez asked
the question and there is a article on
dzone about this and it is actually
interesting reading so there is our
substance and and the point being is if
you have one too many relation and you
access the collection all the entities
are loaded at once so you have do you
have no control how much entities are
loaded and in this article suggests that
instead of using one too many relation
you should use more methods on the
boundary and use queries instead and I
have to say in most cases one too many
works fine and if it doesn't then you
can use queries instead of duration so
on what I don't like with this approach
it is too dogmatic I think there are
always exceptions from the rule and if
you really have to to optimize then
optimize only in the cases where the
performance is not sufficient but in my
projects in the one too many works okay
and what we had once there were some
problem with polymorphic behaviors or
what we had to I remember so a few years
ago so we had one to one too many
relation but it worked like this so we
had here a relation to an entity and
there was a subclass and this was of
course one too many
and and what I what we wanted to have is
to filter the collection to have just
this or just D relations which was
actually not possible back then so we
used custom queries to mitigate a
problem and to access you know didi
specific classes not only generic so
that's always there are always
exceptions from the rule but one too
many is pretty simple and I wouldn't I
would never actually optimize a front
okay next one so storing JP entities and
persistence bharuch ability is also
interesting and and what it actually
means is there are Kaskade types in jp-a
so on you can say cascade all or cascade
persist cascade merge and what it
actually means is the following so if
you store I jpa entity de masta and if
you say cascade persist all the all the
all the dependent entities the children
will be also stored as well
automatically so what kascade types are
our simplification and usually this is
the same story in more complex projects
you will have to store them by hand
because you know if you partially update
and partially persist you were always
run into trouble but in most cases okay
so what I should avoid is the Cascade
all so everything because they're a
little bit also dangerous because if you
delete you know the master all the
children is going to be deleted as well
but in general saying what is the
strategy i would say i think in
developers are intelligence right so you
cannot just prescribe some things like
the whole project should run this way
and i would just probably mentioned the
possible problems and then let the
developers decide so i think it's just
reasonable so um what i always am a
little bit suspicious if the architect
has a great vision and says okay we go
this way and so we solve all the problem
of the world just you know but by moving
this direction which is which doesn't
work at all so on another topic is
Jenkins and micro servers
so I'm also interesting i wrote a post
so what occurred to me the jacket is
actually perfect microservice and the
Kazuki wrote wash I wrote Jenkins
without knowing it probably a hoe I
guess and and what I meant by this is
the following so I'm what makes up
microservices so if you how they are
defined is the following dr fine-grained
so it means there are not there are
rather small they deserve a single
purpose they are self-contained so it
would mean there is a war they can be
can be easily started with java mean
which are for instance java my nose jar
so this is what heads in what Jenkins
also does you can start Jenkins with
Jenkins CI dou char and and it just is
built in HTTP server and just starts
from within are not jar sorry war even
from within the war and now it now it
becomes more interesting because I got
some some comments from the committee
from Jenks a yeah but as plug-in base
what I actually meant even you are
writing plugins here but if you for
instance how I use Jenkins Jenkins
orchestrates for instance in on my
server darker services this is done by
Jenkins and it communicates with get
communicates with Jenkins and many
systems actually interact with Jenkins
so Jenkins itself exposes rest api which
is exit accessible where get and it also
orchestrates usually different parts of
the system so if you desert in my eyes a
perfect perfect example for our micro
servers are really a really old one so
on it is self contained all the data
with Jenkins home is usually start
within the Jenkins you can start
multiple instances it yeah this is what
occurred to me and it costs some
discussion on my block which i found a
cruise will just dunno did some Jenkins
works like oh actually if you think
about this is a true so real
microservers so that's all about micro
services and
another recurring question is how many
stateless session beans can be added in
my application and I think because of of
performance and i would say regarding to
performance you can start as many as you
like so the overt of eg bees are view
proxies dynamic proxies and I mean if
you start millions of course then you
will have multiple instances because you
get a poor job plus all the proxies so
that it can be a reasonable number of me
instances but usually you will never
have you know millions of of stateless
session beans usually you will only have
a view and having one stateless session
bean for each entity class would work in
practice for sure even if you have
thousand entities would work perfectly
but the problem is why you would like to
do this one a one session bean for an
entity class I would rather in my
projects we have I would say one
boundary for five to ten entities and
and not one to one so from the
architectural perspective is rather
strange from the from the technical
perspective it would work even if you
had a few thousands few thousands
entities you could just dedicate to each
entity a stateless session bean I
wouldn't expect any performance problems
but from development perspective
architectural perspective and
maintainability perspective it's a
little bit crazy to do so okay so I'm by
the way what you also hear um javaone
got a really great soundtrack so you
have to check it out as homework it's
really nice so I put it here and if
there are no more questions then I would
just briefly come back to Java 10 it's
Java is suitable for big data or should
one stick to spring this is address the
question in my eyes from technical point
of view there is no difference between
spring in Java EE both are very similar
both our proxy based our p based and
spring is more configurable and
Java is more convention based is the
only difference between both and there's
also a great talk at javaone about j
batch and j barrett and someone someone
was able I forgot the name is a nice guy
from from from Portugal to download via
Jason multiple millions world of
warcraft items and process them in real
time with java so there was a big data
with bush batch processing and hadoop or
Cassandra we actually used my project
java and Cassandra it worked really well
was not a problem at all I would say
Java it just works perfectly so I don't
see any problems with this and big data
or or or I wouldn't see any advantage of
spring of a Java EE except you know if
spring is not how it's called
standarized so there are no obstructions
that we are closer to the metal so you
can configure whatever like with spring
you are more flexible in Java EE you are
somehow you have to think about the
abstractions so this would be the only
the only advantage or not the only
difference between Java in spring and
I'm actually in lots of big data project
they've worked perfectly and probably
spring will do as well so I'm spring or
Java is more questions about the style
programming style and philosophy then
then good work with equally world well
would both okay this was a great
question any other so high Z are you
satisfied I hope so if not ask something
usually and if you migrate a java ee the
code become simpler because usually you
don't have any XML nothing it's just
plain business code and it spring you
have usually more java config and more
XML but you are more flexible so this is
the trade-off and what you like more is
actually your personal decision ok back
to jump on what are the news d breaking
news java one so what I actually blocked
the first stage i know blake breaking
news test was actually not true what
inter joint openjdk which has great news
because of optimization and then what we
get is Java eggs on Android and Java fix
on iOS not actually by Oracle but by
community guys one is called Johan force
from the from the company called Lodge
on a really great guy a Java champion
and this is the same company which
provides support for less fuel
remarkable what they are doing and they
join forces with robo vm and robo vm is
a kind of cross compiler which cross
compile java fix to iOS and i know is
working well because some some friends
are running after burner on iOS directly
without any modification and they will
also provide this was this was actually
interesting on android and iOS java edge
was lambdas which is really great story
so this is this organs were actually
breaking news let's let a second your
hand foss i think and uhand false
android javafx this also the guy behind
or a lot John
large I think this is the yeah and he
also won Duke Choice Award so check this
out this could be interested interesting
and robo DM and they both join forces
and then provide together it could be
interesting in couple of my project
because I'm constantly asked us Java
Vic's one on iOS and Android so this is
interesting and also I will block about
this but you will hear first here check
this out pyara what this is it's a clone
of glassfish they cloned glassfish and
for on github and provide and pitch them
and provide twenty four seven support I
just clone it and build glassfish it
works perfectly and I will actually
contribute some code and I will try to
make life is running on this and this is
a great story also for my clients
because I can constitute a scanner who's
that provide support for glass fish and
with this glass fish could take off
again because there's a nicer puzzle and
github it is it is it is back up by our
company called see to be too there's a
larger company in UK and had the Java
one meta TM the the guys behind this is
a really skilled developer so I think
this could get a lot of momentum so I'm
I will block about this promote is a
little bit and also try to contribute
source code right now I'd I had actually
no it no intentions to do contribute
source code back to oracle because they
are running subversion and and actually
is terrible so but it was github why not
it just takes a few minutes so just
check it this out and of course on
github tourism if you go to github there
is also pyara repository of course and
this is you see 20 Monsieur millage push
something to pyara and this is the
repository so Crone it build it it
doesn't build on your
platform please write issues so and now
I saw a question in chat projects bring
bio spring data yes bring data is nice
is like abstraction of all these like a
bowel obstruction but in Java we have
data nucleus and we have all the stuff
all the stuff in in Java as well and on
a java 10 it's called David Blevins did
/ am on stage performance and he rapped
cmp 20 cm p2 entity beans and they look
like spring data from the outside and
everyone's delight and turned out there
was 14 years old technologies oh yes
spring day that could be nice but it's
just another perfection ok so I think we
are done Oh what do you think about
having pl/sql as back end someone asked
me what do you think having pl/sql as
back end so pl/sql is extremely
depending on oracle and what it means is
yeah if you if you would like to swap
the databases it is how does also a
little bit harder to unit test because
the code is in india database but if you
have a really huge amount of data
sometimes you need a sub procedure in
fact right now one of my projects I'm
exposing stop procedure by RS through
web services with Tommy this is my
current commercial project and
struggling a little bit with callable
statements and name parameters and stuff
like this but yeah in this particular
case there is no way to move these Todd
bridges out to somewhere else it doesn't
make any sense so sometimes a pl/sql
make makes a great sense but as a
strategy the problem is or what you
should do is you have to think about
where to put word to put the geologic
either in Java or in a database I think
you should not spread the business logic
between the database and and java
arbitrary because then then it becomes
unmentionable this is the problem
because
you will have to know to look at Java
code and so procedure code at the same
time to understand the business logic
which is never a good idea okay I think
we are done yet right any questions I
think I answered everything right now
from chat it spring view more suitable
than GSF also interesting to a question
is a Jenner a general question what you
should do use how it's called look at
jsf html5 markup I think this called yes
HTML friendly markup and this is
actually great what you can use you can
use GF absolutely with bootstrap and
doesn't make an primefaces is just a
component library on top of just f you
don't have to use a prime faces
and-and-and primefaces com who's on
styling and bootstrap comes over also on
stylings if you would really like to
style it components just use this I will
pest it to chat and just use this
without primefaces and yeah I mean
another great solution just look at this
the Raptor just as I showed this at the
last a hex this is an MVC framework
which pue SI de is very lean and then
you can style with whatever likes or
just look at this okay any other
questions so if not I have to move to
Berlin and tomorrow in a conference or
what they asked me to deliver talk about
soft skills they don't know what they
are doing I think
I'm talking about soft skills but I will
deliver talk rationality driven design
without any coding so I'm curious what
happens actually tomorrow with an HR
conference and I'm not pretty kind about
a gel because from my perspective it's
just reasonable you don't don't have to
call it a gel or whatever so but if you
like see you tomorrow in Berlin it's
called those those d OS e conference and
for one hour and then I have to code a
lot my stored procedures so thank you
