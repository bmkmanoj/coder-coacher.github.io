fun with Java and Java EE and now let's
start with the very first topic as
always you can you can tune in using the
IRC and twitter using the hashtag
hashtag a hex or fee note a hex channel
or just use the ustream chat is also
connected to the show so I'm the very
first question or question the topic is
an organizational topic so what I did
before before the show I just created
all the new events 4 2016 so on as
always almost always the first monday of
the month and six pm so you can keep
asking me questions i will try to answer
them if you go to the ustream channel
and adam mean you will see all the
events 4 2016 so um so i think it should
be the third year of a hex TV and now
start with the real topic a shiny new
server so what i did and this was funny
as i sent the ax news email and i got
some feedback like Don Hector whole you
know Christmas with Java and I actually
didn't hacked at all what I did instead
I didn't hack the software i hack the
hardware so this is the inner workings
of the new servers are posited this
image on twitter and now it's actually
life so I thinks it's three days its
life so I migrated to soft from the old
one to the new one and the only thing
what i did is i replace the power supply
so this was a little bit oversized i
bought a cheaper one but it's more
efficient and surprising surprisingly
the power consumption in idle mode of
this machine is 25 watts so which is not
a lot and some experimenting with some
no dhaka i was able to see a consumption
240 watts which is still not that much
what you see here is an ice cooler
so I just reuse the old one from knock
21 also an and this is a huge thing
which keeps the server cool and this is
a ECC ram I think 32 gigabyte of ram and
it's the recent Z on a cpu which is a
little bit more expensive because it's a
low-energy one but still extremely fast
is a lot faster than the old one as you
can see is a rate of SSDs I think this
is the Samsung 850 series and dhani was
a little bit older so I i bought all the
all the parts I think I don't know half
year ago and something like this but now
I find found the time to assemble this
and you know now it looks a little bit
better than this this was just I replace
the power supply so that this will look
a little bit nicer and it runs Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 72 and what I will do
now if it runs table and seems like i
will just upgrade the old one as well so
i will have a staging environment as
well so I'm nice thing so if you're
interested in this what I also would do
I will cover this during the
microservices workshops because I got
lots of questions about sizing and
hardware so I will spend probably I
don't know a few minutes talking about
hardware as well we have also one
question here Dax TV ok so this is the
server i usually don't talk about
hardware but i get more and more
questions about hot via so it seems like
it seems like it's interesting topic
also for for the hex TV listeners ok the
next topic java 8 progress what I
promise you the last time I would track
the progress of Java Eden more closely
and you know there was some there are
the Christmas and their vacations so
there is not a lots going on in the
indie java ee a GSR world what i notice
a little bit slow down since Java one so
it's not like lots of activities what I
will try to do and i hope i will do it
this week i was little bit overloaded
with my client work and with
hot via who is the server but right now
I would try to to post you know like
overview of all the Java 8 spec and what
the progress is and if you like you can
participate so what I'm thinking about
this if you would like you can adopt at
GSR so one GSR one API and Po and and
and write a post about the progress then
if you pink me I will try to aggregate
it somehow and make it more transparent
so this is what about Java 8 so what it
means it slowed down a little bit I'm
concerned about I'm concerned about a
view API is like the management and
monitoring which which I will pink the
respective actually and yeah so if you
liked you can participate if you're
interested just pink me which jsr you
would like to monitor and I will try to
aggregate once a month and covered it
this as I know as the now it's called
stationary topic of a hex TV okay so on
so this is not a lot of content the next
one or let's see whether there are
something from the from the chat as you
can see the chat is a crazy so I get
more and more life participants it is
hard to measure this or Twitter but this
this chat is really busy so if you would
like to ask them something or you like
suggest a topic just do it right now ok
multi-module builds for Java EE so let's
switch here I got a really sophisticated
question here and it repeats from time
to time but i actually will cover all
the questions won't like to know to to
do to relate to all the shores to the
past shows because yeah because you know
i will have to scan what I actually said
and what I whatever so I will try to
answer questions regardless they were
already answered or not so the first one
it asked me ok the reasons is basically
it's small projects but it grows over
time and there are lots of ears and
modules and interfaces and there are
some problems like you know if you do
this there are some duplication because
the interfaces have to be in different
modules and also the problem was in jp-a
and he also asked me questioned what
about jax-ws
which is soap is it better than remote
interfaces or not and so what I did i
expanded the questions to multiple
questions here first multi-module built
for java so so best practice so i always
ask about this practice so what can tell
you is the following i always start with
the war and if i get a multi-module
builds is just because there are some
you know there are a view wars which
belong together and I use the multi
module built to to to to package them
I'm going to package them to be able to
build everything at once so I don't use
the multi-module builds to to have an
ear which which which contains the words
this could be also the case at the at
the very end but I use multi-module
builds for convenience and but usually
most of my project adjust single Wars
and I think this should be the best
practice if you don't manage to deploy a
war your project is probably too large
and I'm actually more and more confident
about this last year we we we performed
some refactorings and in a larger
projects and we will really we were able
at the end to ship a view worse and
prior to this there were ears with
hundreds of EGP jars and jars and stuff
like this so I'm first one multi-module
built isn't I wouldn't consider such
this practice I would consider the
workaround or our convenience what's
best practice deploy small wars so um
the next is dealing with interface and
applications first as you probably know
me already interfaces are not the best
practice in Java EE so what comprises an
interface in Java EE our public methods
of an e gb or public method of CDI beans
is a interface enough so um we I only
allow interfaces in case you will get
additional implementations or let's say
you get two implementations of something
of an algorithm then you will need
strategy pattern and the strategy
pattern I think a stretchy openness is a
it's a good idea if
if you introduce an interface or
abstract class photos so on and the
application so this is also interesting
i think the application is either best
practice or or or worst practice but
nothing in between so in the micro
service world the application is good
because with the application you are
independent so you are buying
independence with the application in a
more classical world object oriented
world application is evil because you
are replicated algorithms so um what I
would say I think so if you are worse
which communicate with each other then
then you will get some duplications for
instance all the parameters return
values even exceptions there are no
exceptions in rest but all the you know
all the API stuff is going probably to
be duplicated because there is no binary
representation of the API would you just
get a set of rest endpoints or HTTP
endpoints but if you have a really
important algorithm so which is crucial
for your enterprise this algorithm act
for instance insurance the I calculation
should be never duplicated so what you
should do instead to create another
service which encapsulate this algorithm
and then it stays somewhere so um this
is the point of view but what I think
what do you mean is with the question is
no and if I have multiple jars you know
how to share commonalities and I would
say you know forgot about ears forgot
about jars just thinking in worse and if
they have communicated use rest and then
and then you get it application but this
is a good one so what it means you can
move independently so on I hope it is
enough if not hey what you can do right
um it's really hot I mean you should
iterate over this topic you know and see
whether it still feels right so this is
actually the key point regardless what
you are doing whether you are going the
micro service route or you you're going
no I'm just having one war with a view
modules inside
it should feel right if you have the
feeling you know you your architecture
slows you down is this a already a very
bad time okay the next question related
question is soap or remote so jax-ws or
remote and I would even say probably
soap is even better than remote right
now why because as you already know
properly there are lots of
vulnerabilities with serialization right
now and we covered it actually in the
last show and and which which soap is
also vulnerable but the serialization
can you hit you harder and with every
mode is a little bit painful because
what most applications ever do they
require you to use the library of the
application server on the only using on
the client side and this usually means
you have to know to ship the the
application server jars or to the client
and if you upgrade the application
server you have to update the client so
there's this is not a really good way to
communicate what i would say at remote
and add local are duplicated in all
projects jax-ws is also dart application
so if you actually you should ask me
jax-rs restful web services or remote i
would say jax-ws is is really duplicated
so on don't start a project with jax-ws
so how to share JP entities between
layers so if you would like to share jpa
between layers it's actually not a big
deal what you can do you can create you
can put all your or your entities to a
chart and then to refer from another jar
to discharge and say because the
persistence.xml has one entry i think is
called jar file and it can point to the
jar file where all the gpas JP entities
are are residing but having that said i
think is this this is not as a bad idea
to put all the entities in one huge jar
because if what happens then is you know
the entities is actually really domain
this is the DRD concepts of your
application if you put everything in one
jar it becomes meaningless you can even
you cannot name it it will you get
probably a meaningless name like you
know domain entities or whatever so um I
think what you should do instead is to
put the entities to to to our packages
to assign entities to a package name the
packaged properly like for instance I
don't know insurance life insurance so
all the life insurance life insurance is
too too too big name like Princeton's
patient or client and our patient
related entities are in the patient
entity so what I tend to use is the
boundary control entity pattern what I
also did I get a lots of good response
last year and the year before about the
BCE pattern boundary control entity pce
and even if you're interested in this if
you search and ambien and BCE so there
is the boundary control entity pattern
and it even comes with an archetype so
it was a sample app which shows you the
packaging so if you like just try this
try this out probably you'll like it
okay so what I tend to do I don't share
the JPA entities between words what I do
in status each war gets an own set of
entities so the question is what happens
if some entities have to be shared
between words and then it could be a
good idea is you know to create another
war which encapsulate the entities and
expose them via rest this can of course
across proliferations of of wars but
usually you are able to manage this
without any complications which you
shouldn't exaggerate you know so usual
java ee projects i would say there are a
few Wars no 125 Wars and this basically
is it's not like you will starting to
create 50 words and call them
microservices and then get some head H
how to how to orchestrate them okay I
think we covered this and let us what
I'm pretty sure I've wrote a blog post
if not i will write one and i'm being
persistence.xml and
thing is called jar file or if not
outright one no just seems like not so
I've read a small assort short a short
blog post about this so it will document
know how to point from from a from a
service jar to the entities so what you
can do you can package the
persistence.xml in one jar and group all
the entities together in another one
okay just briefly look at the okay the
connection to too slow but it seems
right to the others okay packaging
background jobs and I just picked a
question because there's really
interesting so I'm the the the packaging
background jobs would would would i do
right now is for instance i have i pay a
background job created actually today
and this is this one what it does this
is the whole archive of my blog and this
is our background jobs which which runs
behind the scenes and creates if i
started it creates you know the static
page which comprises all the blog posts
from starting in 2006 so the last 10
years of my block crazy how how long i
already right so on and what it actually
is is an ass on this is actually you
will see this is this an hydrated SPG so
both nice one but the interesting point
is and it is actually a docker image so
the whole background processed is it's a
doc image which is started and then
stopped and it just creates this so it
like for me is like a command button
comprises multiple steps and in Java EE
world what you could do exactly the same
you could have one war with jazz
background job so why war because you
can expose via rest services for
instance on a simple administration or
monitoring interface to the outside
world and show you know what the
application what your application is
doing and this is perfectly possible
with with jax-rs so on this war could
just you know become active using for
instance the schedule annotation or a
time and service do something and then
just sleep and wait until something
happens from the outset from the outside
world so um so the background jobs could
be a packaged separately they don't have
to but it could be so I'm basically I'm
just back to the best practices what I
considered best practices if there are
no additional requirements regarding
lifecycle versioning or whatever I try
you know to put everything in one war in
very lean war and kill all the bloat and
usually everyone is happy but if you
have to if you have multiple teams which
they have to know to work independently
then I would introduce Wars additional
Wars but not from the beginning I hope
we covered the first question if not
pink me so the next one is nice because
this is what actually somehow related to
the shiny new server so on and there's
about 500 concurrent users with soap and
this is a little bit vague because you
cannot you know with this you cannot
actually you cannot write a proper
sizing for this but the question is no
regardless what the requirements are
what to do Pressey ask me specific
questions which linux version 64 bit of
course jvm is the latest one always and
hardware size which server ram sai cpu
core so first I think the total cost of
my server are about I would say it's
really hard to say less than 2,000 euros
a far less than 2,000 euros I would even
think even 1,500
so for our enterprise this is really
nothing and so what it means which
server ram size and cpu cores as much
course as possible and ram size my
server has 32 gigabyte of ram and i
think it was ECC it was crazy expensive
ram so this ECC ram cost me it is from
from actually from IBM it was like a
view hundred bucks so I spent I think
300 or 400 bucks for euros for for 32
gigabyte fastest ram and as a backup i
bought a non ECC ram and i think i spent
for 16 geek 70 euros 70 euros so what it
means for 140 euros you will get 32
gigabyte of ram so what it means is RAM
size i would say 32 gigs cpu cores so
I'm my cpu did cause I think 400 or 500
euros and I think it has now is the
question I think it has four cores and
16 threats or something like this and
yet the more course you have the better
of course it is because you can start
more independent containers so but does
this is usually so why why he asked me
the questions probably because what I'm
telling you is the reality and emotional
costs within the enterprise are not real
so you are spending per month I don't
know seven thousand euros for one
gigabyte of RAM or something like this
so if you really have to save money with
heart via so how much RAM you have so
and we have several application servers
in production this is a payara this is
glassfish white lie weblogic with they
are really happy with two gigabyte of
RAM so with two gigabyte of RAM you can
you can run perfectly 500 users usually
so um because you know it really depends
what the usually the user is doing right
if the user is I don't know streaming
video into a memory you would get some
problems with ramp so i would say in a
typical case and i remember last year i
was involved in a project with jsf based
projects
there are two a half thousand users with
tour gigabyte of four gigabyte of RAM so
I think it started was two gigabyte of
RAM and at we ended with for geek but
but we didn't optimize the JSF at all we
just you know in this company the ram
was cheap so we just increased the
memory so i would say memory is not a
problem in general well if you if you
have to spend or to spend to assign too
much memory in one point of time you
have to to to tune the garbage collector
which can be problematic okay bandwidth
is really hard to say but i would say i
don't i mean i have one gigabyte
bandwidth because a 1 gigabyte network i
just created it because it does matter
right so in a company as if it is an
Internet application it really depends
what you're doing if you look on my
block for instance is extremely lean why
because on my block there is adjust
there's not even JavaScript so I don't
know how how big the DD the origin page
is it is generated by template foam
roller but that try to eliminate
whatever I could and and my connection
is very thin actually so um this is how
to say to navigate a beaut so now what I
always do in commercial project so this
was a little bit mixed mixed answer but
what I do in commercial projects I do
the following I'm we start with a
prototype or we have some initial use
cases then we run a stress test so um if
you're interested this is a little bit
so there is the java 7 testing course
and i try to show you how to how to
performance measure the DM application
so if you are interested in this so this
is a commercial one but you can rent i
think for one week for nine dollars or
something like this so i'm so what we
what we do is what we tend to do is the
following we we starting a stress tests
using for instance jmeter and i would
try to create
founded users with sessions and then I
use memory analyzer tool this is eclipse
mmm 80 and Eclipse memory analyzer is a
really nice tool and also see the clips
you don't have to install plug-ins it
just comes out of the box and is usable
so you can just download this and with
so during the tests or after the tests
we create a heap dump and then we can
analyze with memory analyzer the heap
dump and you get a rough or rough you
get a really detailed view how big
actually the memory per user has to be
so this is what I do is a so we get a
rough estimation rough actually precise
estimation precise estimation how how
how big the memo requirements are and
usually CPU is not the problem in
enterprise apps what's the problem is I
oh 2d to the database the database
itself you know locking strategies
transaction strategies all the
integration points this are the problems
CPU does not matter so and usually so in
banking apps of course if you have
encrypt a lot or whatever or if you have
to generate some you know I don't know
random numbers it could you know need
some more CPU but usually CPUs another
problem the more cpus you have two more
modules you can run independently this
is actually the the benefit of this okay
now question in the chat no chat this
time chat is really lazy no questions in
in Twitter okay so the next one
interesting one questions related GMS
and web socket so basically what's the
difference and can i use both and this
is interesting one because web socket
and GMS are somehow are somehow similar
the GMS comprises two parts
point-to-point and publish-subscribe
communications or the publish-subscribe
communication is similar to web sockets
so you can send as
and and receive messages and this is
publish-subscribe means you know many
listeners many subscribers the same as
in web sockets the main differences
WebSocket the standardized protocol so
you can go to this pack and you will see
what goes over the wire GMS is just a
set of interfaces so you don't actually
you don't know what how the protocol is
implemented so actually you could
implement publish-subscribe / WebSockets
JMS over WebSocket someone would
probably hopefully as you can see GMS of
a WebSocket so there is even so you see
an older post open mq 501 is seems like
it is able to to perform this and
there's a different protocols so so what
it means the main difference between GMS
and web sockets just WebSockets a
protocol implemented by Java EE but also
JavaScript clients and html5 and GMS is
just a set of interfaces and the and
which is small it is just the API to
point to point into publish-subscribe
communication so transaction the real
time so to community each transaction so
web sockets is not rendering sectional
GMS is transactional but i think what
you mean here is to communicate you know
the actions in real time so then you can
use either web sockets or GMS with
WebSockets you have the advantage that
you can also subscribe you know java
ex-clients angularjs clients javascript
HTML 5 out of the box GMS is usually
proprietary protocol so you have to to
check first whether your application
server supports something more portable
ok i hope this question is answered you
know no activity here ok now a bunch of
other questions how do you make a
migration
from pl/sql to Java so if from tables to
Java it would be pretty simple so what I
do is TM I go to NetBeans and say just
oh I thought there is a dirty I don't
have a project so there is a new
entities from database and it will just
generate JP entities from database and
they are usable out of the box so but PL
sequel is more like usually it means
Todd procedure and so procedures more
like service and the stud procedure has
and has a how to call it a interface
like or this it looks like a method
looks like a java method which can be
invoked from jdbc callable statement or
from JP a 2-1 so on these thought
procedures are integrated in JP 81 now
how I would migrate this first i will
use either jdbc or JP a properly jpa
because easier and then invoke the PL
sequel stood procedure and write an
integration test for it why integration
tests because of does the fastest
possible way to invoke something right
so and then I just would write a simple
asserts and see whether this thought
procedure behaves like what I expect and
then i will move this todd procedure
call to a CD I control it is probably a
CD I control or even a boundary a drew
depends but we have already the tests so
you could repeat the test and see
whether the Java code behaves like the
PS equal one so this would be my
migration strategy for PL sequel but if
you expect you know some magic where you
can just magically convert Peter sequel
to Java I don't have the answer for this
but you know algorithms algorithm you
can just copy and paste the pls equal
code to Java make it compile and see was
a test passes so my strategy would be
rite of rep around the pier sequel
procedure don't touch it first right at
code in gem write an integration test in
Java which ends with IT and make it run
if it's green migrate the code to Java
run it again and see whether screen
so the next one is if you want to
compare spring which vs Java who will be
the winner especially in the performance
part I don't think there can be a winner
why because Java is just a Saturday p is
it could be as fast it could be a no
twice as fast as a spring or could be
also twice as slow as spring it really
depends which application server you are
using and because are small differences
between application servers recently I
in a hex attendee just measured this
because what I actually did youtube Adam
bean I registered what is faster a gb or
CDI so let's what is faster see CDI or
ejb so part of the java testing course
and what i did i recorded this and what
the attendees did they performed some
some benchmarks even with spring and as
you can see the performance was spring
was a little bit faster than eg beasts
on websphere yes so this is one test as
you can see there's not a lot of
difference so I would say it it really
does not matter spring looks internally
very similar to EG be so CDI there
should be no difference and usual you
have other problems then then you know
five percent of the performance okay
something happened here in Twitter can I
use groovy with jpa I think and JPA for
data table class yes you should be able
to because Grails is doing this so it
should be possible so Groovy's supports
annotations so annotations supported it
is compiled to bytecode it should be
possible
and exactly someone says there could be
a problems of performance because Pierce
equal runs in a database you should
choose very well what can be magnitude
jeebies of course but if you have to
migrate you know you have to test this
and what you also have to think about is
of course you know if if you're the pl
sequel is near the data in the database
if you move the appeal sequestered
procedure to the application server the
data has to be serialized / / sockets
sent to jdbc driver you know on the
other side you get jpa there's lots of
overhead of communication with the
database so on but this was not the
question but you are absolutely right so
we covered I think this one is also
always know what you should say like now
java e is twice as fast as spring and
wait for the reaction so I know five
years ago it would be I don't know i
think my server would know would get
some flames because of overload someone
we said something like this to be
realistically i would say should be no
difference from the performance point of
view for java 8 will be we will have a
support for no sequel dba's in jp-a 22 I
don't think so java 12 to Jeff ones ago
there was were one buff about this topic
and it's really hard because there is no
there is no no sequel database in every
no sequel database a little bit
different and the question is that the
basic question is what we could we could
do in jp-a to support no sequel it's not
obvious answer now we have already meter
data and they are all ready for instance
eclipselink and can be mapped to two
different two different no sequel
databases so if you go here eclipselink
no see cool
or even here to 5.jpg Sanchez more
recent so there is no sequel annotation
already in eclipselink and even out of
the box supports it supports you can map
JP entities to to to the database so no
sig and hibernate is called ogm no
sequel the same is true with hibernate
ogm what it does use MongoDB CouchDB is
supported with with jpa so I don't think
something will happen but again what you
can do if you're interested in jp-a 22
just track the progress what happens in
this pack you know write some blog posts
and pink me and I will aggregate all the
all the all the results and we will
cover this one month later so I don't
think it's something in this area
happens soon because this the no sequel
databases are two different so I think
it will be hard to standardize anything
do you recommend using search engine
like last excelsis so if you have the
requirements we use elastic search
successfully in view projects works
great if you have the requirements if he
has which engine you recommend there are
elastic search in sola the solar is so
this one they're both similar it seems
to me like elasticsearch gains a little
bit more momentum than solar but i could
be wrong but is my personal perception
so elastic search and Sola and what you
use in in the past is how it's called
hibernate eight search so it's directly
integrated with JP entities all the
difference hibernate search uses jpa
annotations not GPI rotations own
annotations to to to provide additional
metadata what to index and this is perks
fully perfectly so what you can even get
the relevance of T of the of the results
so this is like white box integration
right because you will you will provide
additional metadata to your GP entities
to your JP entities and make them
full-text searchable so sola and and and
elastic search are like services
accessible via rest so this is more like
no sequel database with full-text search
capabilities i actually i would say i
would suggest both again I've did I
think elasticsearch gains a little bit
more momentum than solar at least my
perception so what happens here very
good just hibernate Oh Jim as well
perfectly another most 4405 you all
right so this is all I also said this
it's not censored it's perfect so we
have this there is no censorship in the
X so then move to the next one the box
France netbeans de Paris DevOps Frank's
probably let's see what it is so this is
a nice question because it reminded me
of something so each of a capable of the
right choice for a VoIP service the
answer is yes first JCP dark and I think
359 so sip stands for session initiation
protocol and it was approved in 11th
April of 2015 Steve final release and
this is the session as the SIP is the is
the first stage of voice over IP and it
is meant to run on top of java 6
standards and so java java 7 as you can
see it will align with java 7 but it's
not that integral part of of java 6 with
java 7 it's more like extension but it's
perfectly integrated and if you do an
older product called sailfin it was a
glass dish based so look at this is an
older one and then don't think this well
maintained anymore but what is this
okay this one so look at this and i
think is glassfish communication server
and this was our a glassfish server with
with voice over IP capabilities so it's
not only supported it is implemented I
don't know what the current state is
which server to use currently but it was
used a lot and there were or even
several sessions about this so I'm yes
it is supported and and look at this
specification and yeah this is I think a
good starting starting point for you ok
next one and now we have a really nice
question so with some pictures and I
know mr. manga because he attended the
x2 recent attacks in Munich so it was
this one behind me so this was exactly i
did it during the XO it was the
Christmas ax and in Munich there was
about 5 degrees Celsius wide so funny I
already explained the the story mr.
mungus is from Costa Rica so an Costa
Rica a little bit warmer than the Munich
and there was some attendees from from
north of Sweden where is usually called
in the Munich but it was too cold from
the attendees from Sweden and was
perfectly fine for mr. manga so this was
the funny funny topic actually so and he
asked me something interesting so we
have so he asked me a question know how
to implement single sign-on for
angularjs and I just suggested this key
cloak from redhead or there's another
one is called open ID I think so it's
this one orky clock um also my
perception that key cloak is a little
bit more popular so and now he asked ok
he says okay we have one realm and
another realm and they communicate with
each other and the question is you know
is it possible to do this so there is
one key crow grown and the another one
and this app rest api would like to call
this one and this is called federation
so what are you are searching for is
federation and if you search for key
cloak federation you will find answers
and what key cloaks are posted said
array federation i think only for Jane
di and active directory but this is
supported if Federation if this is not
this way I'm searching for you can also
plastic o'clock but I think what you
would like to have is two different
rooms I think what might work is
inversion of control because key cloak
has mouth what you could do this rest
api could register in this ray api and
you can you could free than the you know
you can assign the token that this this
server can call this one and then it
will be like integration of twitter apps
this would work like this like oh with
the with the out of the box or of
protocol but if you just would like to
call from this one to hear you would
have to look at key cloak federation
yeah because they have two different
data sources and so they are independent
of each other and this was the very last
question i would just look at the Edit
chat but there is nothing specific so
this was a fast one 45 minutes which is
actually great so um if you don't have
any questions left i covered everything
i would say thank you for watching think
about you know tracking java 8 i will
argue get everything and see you soon
there's in april there are already very
well attended a hex addition the spring
edition without spring and we get the
micro services continue
you in Java 7 in January end of January
and this is already pretty well attended
so I'm really looking forward to this
too and what I did I change the micro
service wreck shop completely i think i
will coat all the time right now and
because it is really hard to explain
microservices on slides and so end as
well there's javascript for java
developers and html5 for developers what
I plan to do here i will start with egg
mass script 6 as well and we also
extended course and html5 i will also
cover two and probably you react ok so
on thank you for watching if you liked
subscribe to a hex news this is the AIX
news so this is like meet our mailing
list and yeah see you in munich in
projects or in java walls so thank you
for watching and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
