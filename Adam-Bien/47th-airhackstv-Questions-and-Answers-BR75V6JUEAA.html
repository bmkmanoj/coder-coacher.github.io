welcome to the 47th edition of AIX TV
and welcome back so first we have a lots
of questions but what I want wanted to
share with you there are the two courses
web standards ignite and web components
and what I do is so and they are paid
courses and they comprise lessons which
are not really interesting in isolation
so therefore there is you know on I
don't know six to eight episodes but
what I do more and more I just publish
bonus features and they are completely
free so if you like to watch for
instance what is a polyfill and this
makes sense without watching everything
so I published more and more content
here the same is for web components so
on what I did recently I published you
know how to use a date picker what I
also will do and next this week or next
week is to publish a video about how to
use a more complex data table or or grid
okay this about that and on the courses
note good news all courses are well
booked which is amazing so everything
will take place in March and April and
by the way and I think for five years
right now all all courses were well
booked so there was another time where I
have to cancel a course which is a very
good news and the podcast is doing well
so there are already several hundreds
episodes download or several hundred
downloads per episode and recent podcast
is about you know a little bit history
of persistence eclipsing in Java EE and
serverless and Java okay now back to the
questions so um let's start with the
very first one and it's not right the
very first one is by Twitter a few
minutes ago and the question goes and
how to monitor transactions on Java EE
servers preferred JBoss whitefly I would
like to know what eg be open
transactions and when it started so on a
white fly I recorded a video I think it
was before Java one last year so around
October how to activate monitoring in
white fly in pionen and GlassFish you
will see the active transactions the
problem is of course they are they are
changed so you have a many multiple
concurrent transactions so it will be
hard to catch that so what you will see
is which egb was successful and its
successful invocation of a particular
AGB so if you have a set for instance it
will it is equal to two to our to our
two to a transaction and what you can do
what you should know is that transaction
usually means a threat of execution
threat so what you could do is and in
the green book and I think I even wrote
a blog post about that is what you can
do you can implement an interceptor
which changes the currents friend name
to the method name this is actually
doing the monitoring workshops in a hex
common Munich and if you rename the
current threat to the name of the method
you will see it in the stack trace so
this is what you could do and and the
problems know how to visualize that
because the transaction takes a
millisecond or a few seconds so it will
immediately disappear but you can
monitor transactions in all all servers
and and whitefly and and and payara can
do this really well okay so this was the
question number zero okay now database
of syndication would you recommend a
large company to use SSL as sha-2
certificates or rather username and
password for database authentication and
I have to say all larger companies are
so so far always use the principle or
known it's called resource used on
application servers and they always used
username and password I never saw a case
where they use certificates even now in
cloud native environments there's always
user name and password is used and
forces the passwords are stored in in
config maps and Cuba natives or in a so
secret and certificate is a really
interesting but I never saw it in action
so I'm from the fro
so a little bit problematic what do you
have to do of course is you you have to
redistribute the certificates of somehow
this is username and password are way
easier because it's basically just a
string and if you have staged
environment you will probably have to
have you know multiple certificates per
stage so I would say with cloud native I
see a more chance that they will take
off because it is easier to attach
certificate to a volume and just attach
a volume to a docker container for
instance and so having said that
whatever I saw right now was username
and password and I'm not sure whether
database is like for instance Postgres
or my sequel even support SSH
certificate so what they support our SSH
tunnels but I don't think certificates
out of the box ok so next one any
questions here no questions here
Twitter's happy and he asked me were to
put my question so I think this was
perfect to use Twitter so a question is
already was already answered okay now I
just want to know what do you think
about micro services with JSF front-end
doesn't make sense for you if it does
what is your architectural suggestion so
in general just imagine so then we have
of course which of course - let's go to
primefaces again primefaces
and demo and there is like primefaces
showcase
and let's say data and data grid and is
the source code so the question is you
know let's say you are you are building
a page for a kindergarten or school and
what you need is a table and you have
asked a database of pupils and you would
like to show it to the grid here so if
you copy and paste this you are
basically done so your application is
ready to go so it will bind to the back
end with the render the data correctly
you are set you can easily create you
know or implement hook action listeners
you can sort a newer set so if you if
you develop you know if you can use the
components it's just kill app so who
cares them it's a really just F let's
say would die in an INT or will die in
three years then you can but still you
know you save money now and in three
years you have the problem so but if you
are planning to have an or new I
strategy and building something like
Facebook so I wouldn't probably use JSF
right now so the question is no do JSF
make sense yeah absolutely
so if you know what you are doing JSF
are just perfect and some of my clients
and some are also startups they really
laughs JSF because if they can really
quickly build admin interfaces worth
Jess F now so it makes absolute sense if
it does what is your architectural
suggestion so the question is is JSF the
only UI front and strategy so is it or
will you really have to implement
something else
so if there is no rest interface let's
assume that then what the architecture
would be you have two packages
presentation and business and in the
presentation you put your backing beans
and they access the Fassett and if you
get rest services you have the resource
on top of that so this is the
architectural suggestion okay next one
what is your opinion about business
logic
business logic data and user interface
modules and Java a charge of a Java e8
and wanted to say so in Java EE two
separate Wars which share the same data
jar and between UI and business logic
web services so let's assume user
interfaces Java Script so then it
doesn't have to be war it can be a zip
because it could run for instance on how
it's called Apache web server and the
other one and the very famous HTTP
server right now so Apache or and just
on a web server you can just extract
that and it runs and and or one war UI
contains business logic with locally GPS
and data HR mod module and and web
services only for out the communication
with other applications so um therefore
we always have two modules one is a war
with rest services and business logic
and one is a zip with just JavaScript
and and why that because you usually get
two teams building that okay and what
about project organization so and what I
don't get is the data module data jar
module because you don't need jars if
you have JavaScript and if you user
interface is Java like Java X then even
in this particular case we use JSON
objects or JSON communication between
Java X and the backend and for for
JavaScript Java chars do not make any
sense multi modules yeah I kind of so I
like multi module pom without
inheritance I just miss you or misuse I
use the the DD prom with a type pom to
build one module after the other I don't
need I never use data modules so I don't
like it because this is like shared
classes between the yeah this doesn't
make any sense data modules here and all
in all modules in one module so this was
what I would start with so by the way
you have really designed No
the this is an architectural choice so
what is what do you think how often do
you I will change and how often the
business logic will change usually my
observation is the user interface
changes more often than the back end and
at this particular case it makes sense
to have two deliverables one for the
front end and one for the back end but
let's say usually it is like data driven
so everything starts with a table and
then the business logic is affected then
the user interface then I would just
like to keep once one wore for
everything and how do you organize new
projects exactly what I said so usually
80% of my new project is one war with
rest services and then a zip with
JavaScript how can two developers
develop application with use locally
chibis for business logic I mean locally
jeebies
for business we always have locally
jeebies and you will see the
organization later because someone
submitted me a use case article
management so if you will see the source
code you will understand what I'm
talking about this so do we have one in
GB which is the boundary everything else
is just pojos in the control interfaces
and in in in this eg B's exposed via
rest and the JavaScript just consumes
the rest the application runs on one
server no separate service for UI and BL
ok then you could and if the two wars on
one war and in one war you have
JavaScript HTML and CSS and the other
one is the business logic ok cool so
questions here no no questions yeah oh
the Beretta cars here so hello to a UTA
I think and yeah no questions here
perfect
so I know this is simple stuff um this
is actually nothing is simple or even in
simple projects I try and know to
rethink what I did do over and over
again and then improve you know the
situation and make everything a little
bit more streamlined so there's thank
you for your question so the first
question is I'm building a new
application from scratch which is great
because lots of fun just a front-end and
legacy Oracle Hebe and HR department a
big company so they like Java EE which
is also great they use primefaces CDI a
GB also nice and so I have to mention
the database is all old and generally
not standardized which is actually good
news because if I had to work with in
some projects were I think is not
standardized normalized what do you mean
in in projects whether it was highly
normalized this was really painful to
map the objects to the tables but if
she's denormalized it could be even
easier
so what I would do is the first is to
generate the persistent from a database
I have NetBeans running somewhere so
let's see that means what you could do
let's say here you could say new
somewhere persistence entity classes
from database persistence entity classes
from database and then choose your
legacy Oracle database I don't have
installed Oracle right now and then it
will generate for each table one entity
which is a good start or JP entity okay
so something happen here okay Julian
punch had a good laugh I don't know what
I mean he's happy or not okay so um
how you would handle it yeah generate
the entities from tables and start with
that and then and then refine the
entities is there a way to authenticate
users from Active Directory yet there is
most of the application service have
so-called realms and they already
support active directory directory and
if not look at key cloak key cloak and
there was a an older so this is a white
lie and a picket link I think is no more
supported but also picket link
implemented the security yeah they are
merging
so both support active directory and the
next one okay and we use in one project
for instance WebLogic server and it
already supported cameras and windows
user so really take a look which
application server this some of the
application service already have there
come with Active Directory realm out of
the box so and now identity preservation
how did an authorization that the
database can record out it and know the
actual user so this is somehow common
requirement in insurances or sometimes
banks and what we had to do sometimes is
we've wrapped the JDBC driver from
Oracle not the JDBC driver the data
source from the application server and
then we unwrapped the JDBC connection
and then you can set I forgot the name
DISA properties not JDBC it's a
proprietary method on Oracle or db2 so
you can actually set the actual user so
or set the user information so the
database will lock which user actually
did what so we did it once for Oracle
and the other one did the other time for
db2
so how should the authorization to
jax-rs
web service go and it just uses jax-rs
is just a servlet so it uses a standard
Java EE security so you have to decide
is it basic authentication is it
it's just certificate is it is it the
form are based authentication or the
fourth one I even forgot because it was
not really secure it was like digest was
called digest which was not secure at
all so what do you so this is what you
can do and it will just use the same
realm whatever so whether you you hit
the application server with via servlet
JSF for jax-rs is exactly the same
security everything else is a separate
based what what are you use for
development in a closed internet
environment were they want a low
internet connection no Center rapport
nothing how do you handle that so um if
there is nothing you can it cannot use
maven so this is actually impossible so
what usually happens is I never have a
direct or I rarely have a direct
connection to Internet what you usually
do we have a mirror so you will have to
set up a nexus or Apache our Kiva which
is Apache which is an open source
completely free and this Apache archive
ax or our Kiva what it does is it
connects to the Internet
but you can selectively say ok these
dependencies are ok and maven will use
this the the repository manager as a
mirror so this is what you can do ok so
and now I just read this and use like
what it is and then I recognize it's not
Java is and it's a real question with
the most perfect sense so the old Java
Java listeners so what we can do you can
specify it like type safe additional
property
to specify which component has which
types and the question is how how can
providing variables to a subtree of your
component hierarchy without coupling so
the idea is I have one component let's
say table and another component
component table row and there should be
no coupling between them and thankfully
this is exactly what I showed you in the
web components workshop and to
demonstrate you this this is actually
the the example which is also get up so
is free so I have a post element and I
have a block element and the block has
to know the post otherwise it won't work
so if you think about what so what do
you really get let's see there is an
index.html so this is one custom
component called block with number the
number is a attribute and it's the same
like the header it's also an attribute
with this slot header and the post has
an attribute slot and data title sorry
and this is also an attribute but it's
an empty one here script is also an
attribute source and what it means is
usually the components communicate
either worth attributes or de content so
there is no other way in HTML to do this
and if you look at the implementation of
the elements everything is an HTML
element and you can set attributes and
properties and usually the browser
synchronized between properties and
attributes so properties is what you see
in the Dom tree and attribute to still
like the private internal view of a
javascript object with sometimes getters
and setters and the attributes belong to
the Dom so what the post doesn't have to
know that a block exists but the block
has to know that title and the content
exists so otherwise it won't work so it
has to know we have a title and we have
a content for instance so this is what
the block has to know so how its
implemented that is implemented in it
looks totally dirty but is actually
clean so what happens here is I
loan from the template the post I set
the header and the content and this are
attributes so if you look at the post
there is a content and header so it's
not like I'm manipulating the internal
state the header and content is is a
getter and setter this is a construct
which is not available in Java just in
JavaScript so instead of what happens
here is instead of invoking instead of
invoking the or setting the attribute
value it actually invokes set header and
set of content so um so this is like
conceptual coupling of course you have
to know this is the interface of my
component and this is fine
so if you had for instance a polymer
component framework you would even have
a binding on the attribute level I hope
it's clear okay so next one this is a
very good question as infrastructure
management and application deployment
becomes easier
it means like with OpenShift or cuban it
ease becomes easier with cloud platforms
darker communities and abs and AWS do
you foresee a near future where
developers will cover all aspects of
their life cycle and the price will be a
thing of the past
there's actually or do alright what I do
in my current projects so we set up the
so everything is automated so it's a
full pipeline with Java it runs on
openshift so we can we have one
deployment pipeline in dev one in int
and one in prot so we actually don't
need operate anymore so we can set to
production whatever we like in seconds
so but we still need operators for for
different purposes for instance we
recognize that you know depend width
between the cluster and the docker
registry is not that great so we need
someone who fixes that so I would say
the the task a little bit different so I
don't need operator node to set up the
server for me but I need an operator who
will let's say provide volume
or or no tweak the performance behind it
seen something like this so it's exactly
the same like you know at the beginning
there was separation between the name
was not operators who like deploy and
developer on java application service
and and and then developers took over so
there were no roles it was like a DevOps
on application service but we still need
administrate you know to set up the
Linux box so this is like what will
happen I think or not will happen it's
already there and this is great so I got
now from monsieur sorel cheat sheets a
two examples he prepared something a new
example with that aspect data and
without and i just opened that and yeah
it was beautiful code java a code very
simple so let's took at this so what i
just did i have two projects and i just
renamed that so one is article
management yes and the other one is is
without yes and the DSS data spike and
he asked me why the deployment of delta
spike was slower than without what i did
i profile the server or i find out in
delta spec more reflection is going on
on this would slow down the deployment
payara not significantly but a little
bit and now it was interesting because
you have direct comparison between the
repository pattern and without so this
is a nice example so this is like this
is the locally gb so we'd head earlier
so on this is articular surface and a
G's modified a little bit because I
could was able to simplify that so
without that a spike it will look like
this article service with inject
Identity Manager and you can directly
work with the entity manager the
resource cares about exporting this to
the outside world
and the entity is just the data so this
is a perfect example for Krotz so really
like it and the jax-rs configuration
just exposes with resources okay
now take a look at Delta spike so first
the entity manager is exposed where
producers in order to be injected via
@inject we don't need it here but this
year then the boundary we have the
articles resource but then we have a
dowel I will put the dowel here what is
the only thing I have so and this is
repository abstract class article
repository extends abstract entity
repository with article and lonk and it
generates the crud and then we get the
entity and we have two more dependencies
so and so if we switch to to the example
and I build that and let's now go to the
plane if you take a look at that you see
the article management r7k now if you go
to DDS example this is one MEC almost so
it's a hundred times bigger and of
course the class has to be parcel parsed
and because of the generation so the
repositories is an abstract class and
the implementation has to be created
whatever I saw just in the profile is
that is a there were reporter that
there's refraction stuff going on and
this a deployment time and this is what
caused the performance and of course the
implementation needs to be generated so
and now you have to do the nice case a
direct comparison between you know a
plain code and Delta spy code was
repository pet and the question is you
know is duty worth to use Delta spy call
this so it really depends on the project
if you just have scrapped for everything
Delta spy could be interesting erotic
and the answer is the what I did I just
wanted to repeat that but this is a
little bit tricky because I had to shut
down the application server to take ten
minutes to show you this
but what I did is I just attached JB
jewel VM with a sampler and then deploy
the application shut everything down
deployed again and compare both with
results and des was a little bit slower
just a little bit because because yeah
there was some reflection going on and
you even notice with Daka
so if we go here and say may even clean
install there's no D and let's say yeah
article management dot so this is the
performance of oh my doctor is not
running so I forgot to start it and they
rebooted EDD machine before the show so
um it would be this a little bit slower
because one mech has to be submitted to
upload it to docker and the other one is
just a 8k so thank you for example is
really nice and is it easy to understand
so how to persist multiple entities at
the same time or in parallel way with
JPA so if you have tip identities at the
same time at the same time is this is
it's the same so and and I mean at the
same time always happens in suits in the
sewer way and in parallel what in
parallel means is that you are starting
threat so this is a more problematic
because the entity manager can become
inconsistent but what you could do you
could have multiple entity managers and
then you know per threat to use one per
transaction one so it's pretty
transaction 2 3 3 independent
transactions and then you can do it okay
then I got unquestioning Twitter and
this was how to handle transaction time
out on unpredictable wrong running tests
at managed bean methods so should I do
not support transactions at all should I
fire an see day event and work on the
task at another class I'm not sure what
would be the best approach so I mean if
you have unpredictable long running
tasks or forget transactions adjust you
cannot use transactions block everything
for two hours so I'm it already means
you cannot wait for that just imagine
you have user interface and you will
have to wait two hours until something
happens so it just cannot be so you will
you will have to split it in in subtasks
and what each subtasks does is it does a
part of that and if it's done you you
proceed and and this is hard to explain
because what you need is some you know
business background so for instance if I
will book a flight and loop the flight
then I will book the hotel and don't
attempt to book the flight and book the
hotel at the same time so this would be
a difference and the idea was the CDI
event is not that bad because with that
we are almost at saga pattern and just
learned there is a saga transaction
pattern and what the saga transaction
says is exactly this it is just like
didn't knew that it is actually a
pattern called saga this is like you
have a local transactions and then event
the next one event the next one it is
just natural this is what you will do
you will have to split an and main
transaction in subsequent transactions
and the problem then is of course you
will have to have a compensative
transactions for each sub transactions
which will significantly increase the
complexity so um so just saga is not a
best practice just a workaround if you
if the if a if a distributed
transactions does not work properly or
it just takes too long
yeah so if something takes longer than
30 seconds is no more local transaction
you will have to split it and how to
split it you will have to understand the
business logic first think about
compensative transaction that then you
can use CDI events or not so there are
new questions so let's see I have a
custom authentication filter that
implements container request filter and
sets security context I can easily
access this user in each rests ok
context curriculars how can integrate
with the jeebies so with the jeebies we
added already it is not enough to set
the security context you will have to
use a realm or you have to proper
authenticate and take a look at Soteria
so the answer would be Soteria
so the RIA jsr I think 375 and there are
lots of examples and the cool story is
Soteria is Java 8 but it also works on
Java 7 server so you could use it right
now and there is somewhere there are
tests and the test comes with lots of
examples so take a look at this and
there is security context off for
instance so take a look at the example
ok
I mean the yeah
it's already solved in with so Turia
yeah so this extension and there's I
think it's called HTTP authentication
mechanism so you can set it and then it
is available until eg B's what do you
recommend for authentication over SSL
TLS or oath on GWT why does it better
idea to resend the password on each
request I mean it's not a bad idea
because if you look at or our two or JWT
you don't sending at us a password you
are sending a token which is which is
the proxy web of your passport so why
they are doing this because you can keep
the token and password separated so you
can use your password to log in to our
admin interface and then revoke the
token or delete the token and this is
just this indirection so you can use the
password actually we use it we use that
also in the past which jadibooti it is
better because there is a decoupling so
you can just you know issue as many
tokens you like for different
applications and then decide you know
which token should die and which should
be renewed for instance and what is your
checklist to have when writing code on
both planet servers like oh credit card
information so you cannot have a
checklist checklist will be provided for
you so if you have to implement credit
card processing I forget to has a
standard there's there's a certification
party which will certificate which which
come and review the code I forgot
actually the name and so then who you
will get a checklist from them and I
think as a good starting point is this
is the OS it is um so you will find a
lots of checklist here and this is a
general website to start a great website
website you know how to deal with
security in the web context this is my
general go to and if I'm working with
clients all my clients have a kind of
you know security department
and the security department classifieds
usually the apps and and and then I can
ask you know how sensitive is the data
and then give me some advice about that
so what do you think about the next one
so let's see what happens here
so questions perfect yeah and I'm not
sure burritos but I think the last time
I even show you some source code if not
I will probably implement something or
create a screencast with this eight HTTP
authentication mechanism if that I
showed you at the x.com or at the Lex ax
TV but if not I will prepare probably as
short screencast to show you how it
works but it's something like HTTP
authentication mechanism take a look at
that yeah hello Brett okay so what do
you think about it bits netbeans future
so I still like NetBeans the funny stuff
is recently someone asked me to help
them you know to set up a Java EE
projects with IntelliJ so they really
like to use IntelliJ and I actually
found and always the first step is the
hardest so um I created the GlassFish
and there's like general plastic or
payara whitefly configuration and then I
were always for cotton I forget is in
the right upper corner you have to use
project configuration to add the project
to the server and and I spent I think
half an hour you know to try to to find
this configuration and in Edmonds you
just go to projects and and push one and
ask you know I don't know what what do
you mean there is no server setup so you
choose the server when you are ready to
go
so NetBeans is really nice to start with
and really easy to use and really nice
for beginners and an IntelliJ you have
to invest invest some more time so
having said that as an Apache they're a
little bit slow with the releases and
the problem is of course they need some
committees and I shouldn't go complained
rather than commit I know it but I have
absolutely no time
and and conservation not good for open
LibreOffice yeah I think NetBeans the
future should be bright whether there's
bright and now or not it really depends
on us developers so the question is who
is who we'll use in our NetBeans in the
wild still and if it's used a lot there
the the plugin ecosystem will grow and
the future will be bright so if NetBeans
will die I will properly take a look at
Visual Studio code or IntelliJ one of
both and I already saw that Eclipse also
improved a lot recently they don't have
you know to download several plugins to
implement a small maven project so I
will probably try Eclipse as well but
right now I still use NetBeans I'm happy
with it
and I hope the future is going to be
bright so someone follows my warning
that data and Trust objects are widely
over use there absolutely are and they
have several hundred applications
different ear flowers ear files called
most of them very much on the same ichi
b and this kept dt o--'s and then they
get on the client cannot locate runtime
code base and we had something similar
problem with top link or eclipse thing
back then and so what you can do is the
you also have top link because there is
the weaving so you can swap weaving to
static so will enhance the code or
dynamic and what we did at the end to
those ten years ago but you you will
have to play with the weaving and what
do you what you will have to do on the
client the client needs the code base
the back then it was eclipse link or
sign some at least some JP annotations
because the entity travels with JP
annotations is the first problem and the
next problem is the entity travels with
JP annotation so the next problem is of
course is
that that if there are dynamic classes
within and the question is why because
of lazy loading so if you have lazy
loading collections for instance there
is no what happens then is on the first
hit the collection gets preloaded and
what Eclipse link or toppling or
hibernate have to do they have to change
the code and if they if they change the
byte code and the byte code is not
available on the client then you are in
trouble but we make it work it was a fat
client Eclipse RCP with GlassFish back
then and it worked so you will have to
enhance the clients class path and at at
least JP annotations and then try to use
I guess we used static weaving and back
then it was a there was a nun task but
later there was a property on on the
persistence XML okay so I hope all
questions are answered
let's see now there's the last one
person with columns ID and name name is
annotated as column there is a ratio to
inject session being positive sender so
flash if you invoke flash what happens
then the exception happens earlier
so flash I have to think about it I
don't even get what the question is so
we have idea name and the column is
unique and there's a rest resource with
injects session which this does not
matter was a session bean so post means
the ID is generated on the server side
so it means nothing will happen because
post mean Ian persists but it also means
that the key generated on the server put
would mean this a business key I think
it should be put not post and the goal
is to throw business exception from the
session bean when constraint constraint
violation happens so the EM flash will
am flush or persist will both cause it
and then you can throw web application
exception yeah this is wouldn't be a
rest condition because you are in the
same transaction so if you find the
object and then save it you have the
reference and then the reference is
store so there will be no race condition
and the race condition can happen anyway
because in a short amount of time you
get the value in in memory so usually
you should use optimistic locks okay now
I think we covered everything
so then thank you for watching and see
you in March so in spring and in March
we have a x.com so see you in at a hex
and conferences and tomorrow I'm in
Rotterdam at CGI and a company is a free
event about cloud native Java so I would
probably hack something on stage why
probably I have no slides prepared so
what I can do I can always can show some
source code so thank you for watching
and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
