would like to show you how to integrate
external resources legacy resources
synchronous resources with the
application server with the application
without violating the programming
restrictions or without starting threads
in the application I will use Java 7 for
this so I would like to start with a
maven archetype and the group ID is
called Java Central's archetype and
let's call the project managed threads
manage stress looks good and what I
would like to do takes a while because
fetches the maven wizard from from from
maven central and creates the project
and yeah manage threats and then I would
like start with a very simple eg be a
thread starter we'll call it packaged
condo a hex doesn't actually matter but
I would like to have a package so and
then we could use with that resource we
can inject managed managed execute or
service which is which is pre-configured
so I would use the method name is
execute async and I would like to submit
a runnable so new runnable and do
something crazy expensive here which is
waiting for a second
so it waits so actually prior to Java 7
it wouldn't be possible to do this
because you will have to start your
threats or execute your legacy code with
at asynchronous which would work but
here you have more control over an hour
amount of threats and so forth and
threats creation and and by the way the
manage executor service is actually an
ordinary executor service but is managed
by the application server so then I
would like to start a sublet to create a
servlet I call the servlet threat tester
yeah looks good and I would like to
inject the thread starter to the a
thread tester can be accomplished with
at inject and let's write something here
so there is a context path and then I
would just execute async and then write
some nice semantic html5 input output
sorry done so and let's see how drugs so
run and let's see what happens so it
starts the application server deploys
the application compares everything and
we should see a browser with 404 because
it was I thinks read tester write tester
so as you can see it was very very fast
took far less than one second so um
thank you for watching and see you one
of the upcoming conferences workshops or
even in hex and yeah enjoy Java bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
