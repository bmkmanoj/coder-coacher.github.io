would like to share a little heck with
you which allows you to combine Java 7
with lambdas so I started with a little
maven project and I changed the settings
from JDK 1 7 to JDK 1/8 so we will use
Java 8 and I would like to create a
legacy component called legacy component
and the legacy component is an EJB and a
very slow one so heavy lifting and to
indicate the ever lifting I would like
to do something expensive within the
method usually I would use a thread
sleep but sometimes someone from the
Java user group in Romania in
Transylvania told me you could use of
course log support part Nino's and you
can park a threat so the problem is NATO
so we have converted to two seconds so
now we have one second and warnock of
course could do we could annotate a
method with asynchronous to be executed
asynchronously but imagine first it
could be this a legacy components that
there is no source code available so we
have to use the component as is or
equally what you could also do you could
say ok this asynchronous we have less
control over awesome asynchronous then
then over manage thread pull from the
application server so just skip the
asynchronous and to get some feedback
and the feedback is called is lifted so
so after one second we get the amazing
result lifted right so um now this is
the legacy component and now I would
like to create a class called job
executor and this can be an easy B as
well so let's make it an eg B and what
we can do we can inject the legacy
component here
and we can also inject not inject with a
resource we can inject from the jndi
namespace the managed executor service
and now I would like to implement a
method called execute job and this
method will use the manage executor
service a managed executor service is
actually an executor service so there is
a method called submit and I can submit
as you can see a runnable or a callable
so what a difference runnable is one
method called run which is void a
callable returns something and the
amazing thing what I could do I could
say the color blue goth type string is a
job and what it actually is is the
method called
heavy lifting and this is called method
reference and now I can submit the job
to the executor service and what I get
back is a future and then you know use
the future for for future reference to
get actually the result but really
amazing is what you can do you can use
existing method from existing legacy
components to be executed asynchronously
in a managed executive service and again
this heavy lifting is a method in the AJ
be is this could be annoying old even eg
beat or if you want it could be even a
POJO doesn't matter and what we can do
we inject the EJB and we are using
method reference to be executed
asynchronously it's actually interesting
and of course would you shouldn't forget
this EJB doesn't know about this so it
will of course start a transaction here
and and will execute whatever needed
here in synchronously which is decorated
by the asynchronous behavior from the
manage executor service so um I think
this hag is useful so thank you for
watching and see you one of the upcoming
conferences projects a hex or
and the first Monday of the month in a
xqa where you can ask me questions about
Java EE so thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
