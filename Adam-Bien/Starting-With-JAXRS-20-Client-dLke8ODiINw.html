would like to show you how to work with
Chuck Sora's client I will just
introduce the jax-rs client jax-rs to
client and to this I will just create a
very simple maven project jax-rs client
and I will use the ERC
the reference implementation to it
demonstrates you how it works so I will
need a dependency in this project and
the Jersey dependency so a trust created
Jack's step here a simple dependency
what you actually need is Jersey client
T jason implementation I will probably
demonstrate in a later episode of of the
screencasts and this is the binding
between the jax-rs client and the nd
JSON API okay so now it starts with a
Jerry test a hex test and the packages
come ya X finish so as you can see it is
absolutely test-driven so there is
nothing and we start with tests so net
for NetBeans data just added JUnit tests
and so let's start so what I sometimes
to are using I'm using Jack's or s for
system testing so test of jax-rs
interfaces so before I will have to
start with a client tilde new client so
you can use also a new building and past
and configuration so what I get back is
the client so you can remember the
client if you like and then what we need
is a target this is a link so I will
just test my site so it doesn't even
have to be a java application on the
other side so it can be whatever we like
a x.com so this is the virtual page
and I would like to remember the web
targets and I call it sometimes target
on the test so and then can we say these
Java EE virtual and what you can do you
can say hey target
I need a request and I can pass the
media type and this time I would like to
have text HTML mr. son now if you just
can do it text HTML and then I can fetch
it a string get I will just pass the
class I'm interesting in and this is
going to be just a plain string I could
also use JSON but in my case is just
plain hot EML so Jason will not work so
this is the content and let's say let's
check whether it is actually my side so
I search true content contains Java but
this is easy verification and assert
true false content contains let's say
Scala so I do not offer scholar courses
let's see test nice everything is green
so and what you can also do you can do
it in async way so then you have to pass
an invocation callback async invocation
and it's going to be a test another test
public methods and what you can do this
request this is very the same request
media type is
text HTML and then async and now I can
pass an invocation callback so let's try
this new invocation callback of type
string and I will have to implement this
callback so there are actually two
methods failed and completed so
completed is this methods we are
interesting in and what I get here check
the whole content of the of the page and
as I sprinted out respawns okay and then
we have to wait a little bit
otherwise the unit tests will complete
before we actually see anything so sweat
sleep was a problem yeah request a sink
and get this was the problem and we also
forgot plus so now it looks better and
of course we cannot sleep interactive
exception so let's see whether it
actually other works so this should be
always green and yeah as you can see
this is the content of the page
Javy X so thank you for watching and see
you at one of upcoming conferences
workshops ya x and y xq a this is the
monthly show up and where you can ask me
questions about java ee so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
