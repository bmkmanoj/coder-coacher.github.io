would like to setup a java 8 project on
Java 9 and using open Liberty for that
so I'm first I would like to download
Liberty so I will like to use the
development builds and the current one
so it was just copy the URL and download
that with with that and and it's
downloading then what I would like to do
is to setup a java 8 project so we
actually do this at the same time so
it's setup Java EE eight project and
call it proof of concept or call it Java
8 so it's nicer name and what it does it
it goes to maven central pulls the Java
8 essentials archetype and creates a
maven project with that so now we have
it and because Liberty is tiny so our
112 makes download size it is almost
done and what we can do here in Java 8
so I would just look briefly at the URI
and it would and pom.xml then you see
this is Java 8 project what I would have
to do is to adjust to use JDK 1 9
there's actually not necessary but let's
do this in NetBeans so I will just
switch to to travel tip today's created
project would like to use this Java this
and what I would also like to do is I
would like to add the war plug-in and
the reason for that is there is no
plugin for NetBeans and from open
Liberty and I would just like to build
in NetBeans and deploy to open Liberty
so how to do this what I will have to do
first is to unzip open Liberty
and this is the project wlp so and I
will just name it open Liberty Liberty
death and then go yeah and say okay what
I would like to do is to create a Java
e8 server so how it works I just say
server create Java EE 8 and what Liberty
does is it does the following in user
service there's a server Java 8 and
Robbins is the folder were open Liberty
picks the Wars so what I would like to
do is to copy that and add it to the
directory this is a trick what I usually
do if I have to work with service where
there is no NetBeans plugins or for
development it could be nice so I think
we have whatever is required to test
that and of course I would like to use a
Java 8 or Java 9 feature here to show
that it actually works so what I would
like to do is to create let's say a
logger let's do that
log exposer and what I'd like to do is I
would like to use the new logger from
JDK 9 and configure that
and then say system dot get logger and
the name of the logger is derived from
the name of the class so like that so
good enough and then we could inject the
logger here let's say do it stateless
market a stateless and then inject the
logger and then just use it block do we
have level let's say yeah info and then
hey open Liberty on Java 9 so this is
only available in Java 9 so it should
work that way so we have that and yeah
so let's see what happens so what I
would like to do is to start the server
so I will just switch to the bin and say
server start Java EE 8 and the server
starts it started so what I would like
to do is I would also like to use or to
show you the log files tail - F and this
is a thing it's called cons of the lock
so and what we see here only JSP 2 3 &amp;amp; 3
1 &amp;amp; 3 Oh is activated so it actually
doesn't make any sense
to run the application because we need
Java 8 support
so let's activate the Java EE support
and the cool story is with open lobby
Liberty we don't even have to restart
the open Liberty so let's do that so I
need another window and there should be
a folder or folder file set of XML so
just open that
and we have the GSP to three feature
which is a little bit boring so let's go
with Java EE 8-0 save it and what
happens is it automatically it installs
automatically the Java 8 features on the
fly which is amazing so there you don't
even have to restart the application
server and now try to deploy the app so
I would just clean and build that and
what should happen behind the scenes it
should copy the war into the drop-in
folder and it works as designed so we
have open Liberty dev user service Java
8 drop ins Java war and let's see in the
folder so what we see here we get an
error and the error is it says it didn't
launch any applications because the
default SSL config does not work and
what the server UC application isn't has
not started in 30 seconds web web
application available in 98 e
Java EE 8 and now is the suggestion what
we should have to do we will have to use
here a key store or define the missing
elements so just go with that so I will
do this I will just switch back here so
ok here is your element go back so it's
saved
and let's see what happens so I would
just rebuild that and test it so and
here's the web application Java updated
in 0.2 seconds so it's available how - e
is does and there should be resources
pink and we get the enjoy Java 8 message
and what we should also get is is the
output hey open Liberty so this was the
logging from Java 9 what's what's also
useful yes you can see this deport 90 80
I could actually on running system
change the port to 8080 so let's go with
that so okay nice just do this 8080
switch back and now this does not work
anymore and if I switch back to 8080 it
works so thank you for watching see you
in upcoming workshops Java 8 Java 9
conferences and triad try out of Liberty
is an amazing small little server
perfectly suitable for micro services
thank you and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
