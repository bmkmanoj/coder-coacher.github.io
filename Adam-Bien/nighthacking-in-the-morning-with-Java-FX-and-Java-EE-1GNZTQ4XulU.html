our night hacking session in eunuch
thanks for thanks for driving across
town so to do the session and we're in
Tony's Tony's studio / training so she
can use he's hiding in the background
say hi Tony hi all right you're out of
focus but close enough so what post why
don't you why don't you say a little bit
about kind of actually I maybe I should
ensure you see you so a 10 MV n is most
known for we even though slide
introducing all right i'll put that up
there we go most known for doing a lot
of java ee work java SE work i didn't
see me posting our javafx and you know
hacking your rounds and talking about
technology on your blog then you do err
hacks will tell us older that what Eric
says so an exam just to minimize my
travel I organized three times a year
and jolly workshop at Munich effort and
the interesting story so people came all
over the world the last time and yes
three times a year three to four days
just chubby hiking java virtual very
cool and you get a lot of people coming
out to the sessions yeah last time about
50 pieces will all our on the walls so
we have already the biggest room from
Munich Airport ok so so you go to the
airport and instead of going to the
airport to travel somewhere yeah you go
to the airport to meet people and go
home yeah that's one of the meters from
the terminal was the idea ok very nice
so what sort of what sort of stuff have
you been working on recently what sort
of projects and technologies actually
I'm working almost exclusively in Java
EE face java and java SE space and it's
unfortunate we actually using javafx
because you always need a kind
UI for your back and stuff and I
actually did a lot of swing stuff back
then and Java VIX is just the natural
replacement and in some projects is just
on i think is this lots of advantages
over HTML HTML 5 for instance and is um
yeah so this is in some projects in Java
beaks and on the on the back end almost
rubbery actually okay very cool so
besides just java where they're sort of
hobbies you know yeah the problem the
case with java is if you really like
java you have no time for anything else
here we are true hacker you hack on java
and you study each other i started i try
to learn java and the problem is
regardless how much I'm running it is
just impossible to know everything so my
hobby was fake tan netbeans but now i'm
using it with all the times was like a
professional way official stuff again so
um I've actually no real hope this one
time I would probably would like to
learn guitar or something and but I have
no time yet and i exactly know that
would start to do it right now it would
be crazy no sleeping just guitar playing
and java hacking so I just only think of
those episodes in Java nothing else you
do good java and sweeping and sleeping
okay very good oh alright the business
school is this one is this is a solution
form Tony Apple I need this dream team
member yes this could work Wow alright
that's pretty good for your first try
this was perfect yeah thanks Tony so we
were thinking with we do today was a
show some of the projects eboard 14 yes
I'm ideas actually I gave a talk and
drawn about stress testing and I got
lots of feedback about going more deeply
to that so what we can do today is I can
we can
through a open source project of my
called life fish it monitors java
applications and running on light on
glassfish and i could probably hack a
very little java application and try to
stress as to what light fish ever think
life and unprepared because i had really
no idea what what will happen here yeah
values that's how we like it is to keep
things crazy live unprepared product
just to go that is a perfect furia yep
yep is perfect for exactly how we
operate okay so I've tricked out your
desktop with video so you could see a
long video okay perfect so you can see
us while we're while we're doing hacking
that's the right video and then lets the
wrong one I chose source a its to a
source p okay your computer your
computer's octane my computer's octane
eous yeah so can i stop with hugging or
adjust are there again searching for
your sources alright yes we can start
hacking Thank You match so I'm two books
so you can just this is the most
important slide our view lines of Java
code say more than thousand slides so
this is my famous last slide and thank
you as an excellent talk yeah but now it
actually starts and I would like to find
out netbeans I just use the development
bill because I tested this is the only
reason I could also go with the
production release but see you're on the
bleeding edge yeah for stuff like that
i'm using the leading edge and for time
to time we will probably see an arrow
netbeans error then we will submit the
arrow on the fly so we have a great
internet connections from tony studios
so you could do that so this is actually
right fish and there are two parts
there's a wide view britain with java
eggs and the like fish written this is
actually did back and very simple
application which monitors periodically
glassfish and glassfish exposes all the
monitoring that data via a rest and
finally
sorry I started actually for the
application about five times for my
customers from scratch because I don't
know why but unit testing and
integration testing seems to be
important and stress testing not at all
for some reasons people are thinking
that single threaded unit tests are
sufficient to prove to you I
functionality of Java applications so
what I wanted it I i wrote small scripts
which which persisted the d monitoring
data and after the fifth time become a
little bit to use so i just really
actually we factored it into a real
framework she can read yes the problem
would be factoring I have to sign lots
of any age and not only sure what it all
seem to vary from start from scratch and
actually I was some see you know one of
my first experiences as a programmer
when I was in on when I was learning in
elementary school so I was writing I was
I was hacking this is before Java this
was like in Pascal I was hacking my
really old computer writing a great
evening software for my wine teachers
and I had a hardware failure I lost all
my data for like three months worth of
what yeah but it taught me that when I
when I went and rewrote it it was so
much better and I got it done I got what
I originally done did in three weeks
done in three months done in two weeks
so what I found is you know code is
chief you can always rewrite code yeah
but the ideas and the skills you learn
coding or what really counts so how was
your experience rewriting this program
five times I've never learn the same
program five times yet it wasn't it the
same program program dual 5x and the
light switch is the best one I think
because it is on my program and it just
is more generic the other one will just
waitin for for service if expressed a
tumor or customer self but in your case
I would just just write a very little
conscript which TV show your machine
every two weeks or something every three
weeks ago it's not that hard removes
asterisk / and something that should
work so it would be actually a business
idea yeah and then on steroids or
something yeah it forces you the end of
the generation edge yeah because this is
tony this would be a great story for
trainees scrum master certification
feeling happy yeah exactly so I'm and
story is getting even funnier so I
actually do lots of my open source
projects and trains so I travel a lot of
with bicycles because I think hanging on
bicycle is really hard without voice
recognition writers on therapy and on
trains is really really really nice so I
had 33 our time between frankfurt and
munich three other thing or 323 our time
to hack something and a good idea okay i
have no time after the train but right
now i have to do things done and my
first idea was to establish java SE and
then i found ok with java SE i will have
to write Java util timer to be really
college how to the timer then I will
have to use jpe persistence so there's
only three three lines of code just to
put up the entitymanager like if I do it
with java ee itself it is like a breeze
just have one annotation that schedule
one annotation inject entitymanager and
i'm actually done with the flow of
concept so i just after a few lines of
Travis echoed I drop the project as we
created it from scratch shoe for java
and what light fish did it it captured
the GlassFish data and persisted in a
broad table and the idea is so you can
perform stress test and after a night
you can just connect you with the table
with just two reports or whatever
burnt reports or whatever you have just
to see how your application performs or
whether it is table of note ism it's
more about robustness not performance
yeah say you're collecting all the data
during runs during the day and then you
can inspect it in fairport on at night
using this tool yeah but then the idea
came I would like to see in real time
because it's more exciting so collecting
is the d major use case but real-time
data is more exciting and I thought
which technology to use and then the
decision was made Java bags and it was
extremely simple with some charts and a
table and data binding I did it a thing
in a half an hour I had 21 charter on
table data and with service and and then
I ended as an interesting story the
first feedback of life is one guy asked
me why I didn't brought a live fish with
with java javascript HTML 5 and Raphael
GS assume javafx a JavaScript framework
and I told him I had only one hour time
for the pool hundred of it and it's a
okay then it is understandable so it was
about the right and this is right he's
so he was actually proving the point
that actually javafx is easier to get
started with those yeah applications
absolutely I show him that the code is
ok if you can revert it with Chavez
cooked and it will be simple then it's
like now I would just do it I don't care
that it was ok not knowing right now it
and this is one on it yeah one of my
points of why Java X is great because
it's java and most of my projects if we
have impact and java it would be nice to
have Java underfunded as well so to be
able to debug and profile everything
from from from from the UI to the
backhand because you know mixing
languages is cool but not very pragmatic
in bigger projects and particularly not
in project 95 projects so I think we can
take something right otherwise it'll be
a night talking and that's not like my
vagin we can do some night and I talking
during the day ok i think i think it's i
think it's night in latin america yeah
so we're we're not hiking in some part
of the world yeah hmm so come my texts
oh it's now Jim oh he lives right so we
can just keep the I text so there will
be no problem with him yep okay yeah he
is he was our first night hacker okay
grew by the calm night hex and just some
stress so I will start with a maven
project why not we are made meat and
tony has internets so it's good work and
I would just run it and I expect to have
an application deployed on glassfish
java application with actual you are
single jet p and the idea would be to
stress the staff will occur jmeter and
life ish Oh failed but able to start
then I have very important command kill
Java some process is running from today
morning I heck something and I think my
pots was that that's a nice tool so you
know you have those random java
processes and you go hunt them down
slowly know a little program as clearly
pillow- 9-9 java this is actually yeah i
need to get that for before i start my
presentations because i always find i
have old processes run actually it is
kill kill all i think- knowing java this
is how it operates so it's two most
important but it was the UC useful if
you create an alias for it no it doesn't
like to start like this which is
actually glass the truth is very very
sad can it be that you use some of my
8080 parts
if not we could just because my class
which doesn't like to start and I think
it can because it doesn't say so to say
the port is in use on the house 00
invalid says invalid property yeah but
it didn't did anything doesn't care I
will just show you the source code from
from right fish so um the the
organization of life is just consist of
components and the components are
organized are always the same way so
boundaries exposes to the outside world
these services control is some logic and
entities to persistence and the most
important stuff is the monitoring
component and the monitoring controller
is the heart of light fish and what it
does it it it just covers these two
snapshots and here you have the schedule
expression so it can set up the you can
set up to gather the data every few
seconds and it takes the data and
persist the data in our you know entity
and the entity is actually a very simple
one is just a snapshot with some data
like used heaps heaps eyes thread count
pic thread count weather threats AB is
an odd number of committed transactions
and so forth and then I just would like
to see the connection pools and
applications and there is actually very
easy to extend in fact some of the of
the wreckage Abo's guys ask me a java
one whether they could extend light
switch for Chavez and if you replace
this class you should be able to gather
the specific for tables or Tommy or
whatever bye is any application server
yeah they were just you know every
application server has the same data but
the department is different so in this
actually that is the source code for
this open source is entirely and it is
actually light fish is the page with a
introductory video
and on you have on github go to my
github page github you should find life
ish and everything is so what do you saw
already this is everything exposed on
github as well I'm the apache license
cool and the idea there's a link to that
on the plague fish page yeah perfect
okay so I'm going to send people the
light fish so they can try it out and
hack along with us yeah actually it for
me already paid off because life is
didn't support it authentication because
it is needed for from my projects
because it was an integration stage yeah
and someone contributed the ssl an
authentication code so it was actually
very good friends oh right right now
second assault about ssl that's all open
source rocks actually if you are lazy
you should expose everything you know so
um so this is the bag and a little bit
boring for you more exciting to see like
you ok so the live view is a java fix
part and the java ex parte this actually
starts with UCD apache license takes
eighty percent of the source code so it
starts like an application yeah and the
idea is it is web stop it is and send
along a network so i packaged it three
times and the main idea was as well to
show how to build more more enterprise
javabeans applications because at the
beginning there was actually no good
making integration so I did that and
brought actually optical java magazine
as well no due to how to do that and
there's nothing better than open source
application because I mean you can you
have to share the associated code and
that you're working on yeah without any
any problems and the interesting stories
in Java eggs if you start with Java fix
your arm you could use a main method
ected the whole point is to use the
large methods because well what whenever
it is an applet and web start or main
class adjust just delegates to the
launch is the first first idea and the
second idea was just do it right on the
right i mean i just tried instead of
hanket or the reasons behind as i
started with a light switch it was very
early and what i expected as 20 to 22
have some challenges and problems and
the idea was just to to build
encapsulated modules so if a problem
occurs i will be able to identify it
more easily so i try to separate the
view from the back end logic from day
one and actually i got lots of problems
with comet style communication with with
bacharach to turn out there were some
problems was with long polling and stuff
like that so it was actually a good
choice to separate that so everything
starts with a presenter so the light
fish is built in Model View presenter
fashion so what means the arm you look
at the presenter the presenter presenter
implements an interface which is a usual
a lot except
purpose and the purpose of this
interface is to specify what the back
end is able to deliver so actually if
you would like to monitor a given
property you just have to extend this
interface and then write a view
component for that this was the idea to
separate that and what you see is a most
of the properties are we the only
properties yeah with as you probably see
as a properties or i can use binding for
that and there's actually simplified
things allowed because if you think
about this and one single property makes
the interface very narrow usually I
would have to have interface with with
with a method like give me a property
you get a float bag but you have
constantly twofold interface that
there's a lots more infrastructure so
this this gives you properties gives you
your vent callbacks exactly without
having to actually write all the event
listener isn't adding event handlers and
all the things you normally need to do
for the exactly so I would say do you
think this would also be useful in some
your java ee programs having property
support yes and actually fold already
just to reuse the java big stuff for 440
bacon logic and actually is i hope i
hope help mark reinhold is watching us
yes but i'm sure she got very smart we
want properties and in java so mark lost
property so whatever it right whenever
yeah yeah yeah we just want to ask if
you would like to introduce properties
since 1995 yeah yeah what suppose let's
go to man up John I'm John I'm or in
Java 8 actually now that they don't have
chicks over there enough time to build
properties you know yeah yeah possibly
may book maybe we can hack and I'll find
somebody wants to properties and we'll
do a project coin style orientation and
a compiler yeah in a doobie in apple
valley then we are Apple root app oh I
key and everybody is
our properties are built but exactly
what he said I'm actuary this interface
is everything but usually you will get
10 or 15 interfaces to cover everything
and this is what i like and java weeks
of oz it minimizes the amount of code
necessary and actually they have to say
and one of the few crazy guys you are
another one i guess i really like javafx
script and they actually it would be
even better to convince the code even
more they actually wrote a whole book
about java java java script and then I
got a call from from from gerawan or
home and say your trunk is great but we
will kill them java big script you'll
still like to talk about this it's like
they're talking on the problem the book
is another problem so I called the
publishers ok we have to cancel the book
but but for our horrible and no problem
I mean yes or no problem so you don't
make money with books anyway so whether
they are published or not is just no but
it's it's all time it's it's it's like
my investment of time to write a book
but it was good for me just to play with
javax a little bit more and right now i
just applied the same ideas to java fix
in java oh yeah yeah so we're trying to
get the new JavaScript visage working
with javafx too and that will be an
option I mean Java aprs are good because
everybody can use them learning language
and for the same reason you have you
know people writing MVC frameworks and
server-side code and groovy like rails
or Scala you know lift or no it wasn't
what's the more recent one to do for
getting the Scala it was and these kind
of glad I play different work Griffin's
quickens it more of a client frame
working for groovy but the same reason
people are doing those languages on the
server side nobody has a good client
side language which has dedicated
features like you know animation
syntaxes built-in properties tell jeff
closures what those those belong in the
baseline weave fabric are
this but if there's no place for a JPM
language specific to you yes interfaces
this was absolutely my opinion as well
and actually a live java script a lot
because it was concise look a little bit
like adjacent so it wasn't too totally
good syntax the only problem was Nedved
support this one was not as great as
JavaScript or Ruby either so it which is
crazy so I you know the Sun Microsystems
programming language wasn't well support
it was negative but this would be my
only complaint but it works right and it
actually some point it with that so it
works really well yes so back to reality
right now yeah we have a Java with light
fish when we that is not an interesting
so I think instead of launching lights
which we will stay in Java weeks right
now okay so we have the bindings and
bindings they're just an interface them
to make more clear which beckons comfort
which they can properties actually
supported and I have the desperate
presenter which actually implements that
and you can see this is are all simple
properties and observable sets
collections which are also great if you
would like to use tables for instance a
lot easier than swing for instance so on
and what's also very very useful what I
use one here our services and what what
a service here a snapshot service and
what service does my snapshot service
extends javafx service and jelavic
service is something like swing burqa I
would say it is able to fetch to create
tasks in and what the toss toss it just
connects with the back end losses which
is as natural fecha and this is actually
a very simple call and get call which
gets the snapshot from the back end and
the snapshot is actually identical to
the entities or before but this is from
different running space there a little
bit
coupling so that the same properties the
same names but it comes from other
projects so there is not the same entity
but this is the single liner from Josie
I will replace it later which are with
Jax Rs 20 but it just deserialize the
exam l screen to dis net shot and the
snapshot is exposed with the snapshot
provider and this is part of the service
so whenever a new snapshot is ready to
be displayed it's just it arrives in the
presenter and the presenter has a
restart service so I've just say ok if
it's it is running and we're starting a
little cancer reset and start fetching
and they start fetching it just creates
the snapshot provided a service with
theory the auras bounce 2-d 2-d 2-d you
I against on every change of the ureter
services automatically restarted which
is actually very very simple to do so we
start and then I just use you see
another technique in diabetics a very
property at listeners I will never
change do something about this and in
this case it just involves on snapshot
arrival for instance in Java X script
there will be just one method and we
just we just have a code to say whatever
happens as it open you know citizen
described you get sure that once we have
closures yes hello Charlie java a gonna
kiss a lot nicer and what would also
make nicer is approaching us home I
think if it comes jdk 18 and you know
java pics with Nassau an enclosure it is
actual a dream I think so what you can
do is will change a lot of things and
I'm here and on snapchat I will so we
work through with you what do i do right
now is hsm fetching the usual properties
so this is the converter between the
integer and the integer property java
vex so it is a little bit I just
thinking about to make it more concise
because a little bit get us and said
invocation but yeah it is very very old
code but this should be probably somehow
easier just to parents so we got a
question for you from glasses so have
you tried on white fish on 312 to build
yeah yes it's Rhyno on
should I answer with futa no I mean he's
listening to you talk okay thank you oh
so did I thought this is a Twitter
string is a Twitter stream it's so this
is a Twitter social stream okay but I
mean everybody here is watching love it
obviously yes I'd fire them it seems to
work so talk to him yeah I tried it
seems to work but if you have if I if
you manage to stomp glassfish then it
will work yeah so getting a last wish to
start was a little hiccup yes so um I
get the I get the entities and then what
will you see here I've here is what
light switch does it adds the snapshots
to the lists which is going to be
displayed in in a table and the app day
off yeah I have 18 presentes for for the
main logic and escalation presenter is
responsible for managing as scripts so I
now is little bit hidden functionality
light switch what we can do on the fly
you can register JavaScript filters to a
light switch on the fly they are they
are managed on the server and what they
do is you can you can set up in real
time channels you can say when heap is
higher than one gig notify me and you
can you can play the splinters on the
five hi guys an escalation channels you
can you can subscribe to the filter by
arrest yeah this is some covered by life
is loads all the whole yeah that's a
nice way of kind of having server-side
filtering and querying it to fetch
custom data back from the escalation the
idea exactly so let's so we have the
whole light switch is organized in model
it's just the rd plane pojos entities to
script which is actually javascript has
just named and content and the
annotations and XP annotations just
necessary to be able to see a nice
initialize data and yeah so the
snapshots to present this actually decor
presentation logic and what's also nice
with presenters with presenter is
on what we can do with presenter you can
is easier unit has that because if you
have representative can just write unit
tests and unjust knock out the
properties without hiring interview
which was also nice in my case because I
wanted to test the back and logic
without the UN drink and eat a big line
so here's some stream crash hours if he
did this tutorial stream is ok who cares
about Marcus oh no problem my fear is
high yeah and I do so so Marcus time
weren't you weren't you supposed to be
here in person so if you if you want to
get one of these stickers and I don't
think so you have to show in person oh
thank you and this is a this is a
limited edition so only only if you
actually are brave enough to come on the
stream and chat with folks online do you
get one of those perfect thank you you
have one okay vodkas spot hoppiness car
driving that yeah because my vision you
know you can come to this afternoon with
Tony we're gonna do tony is a 33 camera
yeah yeah yeah so come by at sonia's
recording Marcus and while pointing out
that okay take the glasses with you in
the life is over exactly may the life is
be with you right yeah so few very
important in Java pigs case yes so um
without you there is no you I I think so
we have to talk a little bit about the
view and the most creative thing in Java
fixes the browser so there's an embedded
work it and the idea of that is so the
administration interface of lights which
was in Jessa was written jetta and that
was just too lazy to to rewrite it in
drawbacks to adjust embedded that in
about here what you good and in top I
have to work you and and the interesting
story with the webview is
it looks almost like javafx because I
just adjusted dtss so it is looks almost
exactly the bottoms everything of the
viet worth you they are look like the
native but for some applications because
you can skin javafx with CSS and if you
use the same statute this is almost
identical oh nice so you're using
styling on CSS for java hut styling CSS
for ok Jessa yeah and then you can make
them get out somewhere oh yeah nice uno
identical identical crazy and and yeah
the webview is very very simple this is
actually the exciting stuff you just
need to create the webview and the
engine and the engine is the depositing
part on the web view is the rendering
part you know I think I we're all that
right when you yeah and that's actually
the the only thing what happens this is
the deep aggress the progress bar and
what I do here is I have the possibility
to install light fish from the web page
and I don't like to install already
installed light fish so what I do with
the webview is either I remove some
links from jsf which is very very easy
it's just simple Dom operation so you
can actually manipulate so they be on
the web page you're going to see
additional stuff to get live fish yes
and if you view it inside light fish
those are all hidden by doing dominic
reaction and this is very simple does
the entire code like fish I mean paying
a page and get element by ID what i do i
get the lively element and then I say
starve display none and then it just
disappears it's just disappears from the
dump so this is what it actually takes
by the way we don't need system out
print lies anymore so and now we have
knife on my packing right one more one
more one one thank you very much so yeah
so now we change the code that I change
the culture smaller ones I
the sticker serve you this was the
abbasid view as is actually 120 lines of
code with about 100 lines of system out
print line but it's very very simple
words were very well but a more
interesting is actually the the snapshot
itself so snapshot is actually
visualization of one property so the
idea is regardless how many properties
do you have one property is visualized
by one charge and one charge is a
snapshot so my enforcer is a little bit
unusual I guess so all my views do not
extend from anything is just simple
poacher and I am just encapsulating the
charts here and I have one method called
view and in this view it returns the
note and the one component dashboard has
organized the notes without knowing what
actually comes and the the triggers each
snapshot gets on with all the long
property and the end the end the
property is just the the value is going
to be displayed and so although in this
case is very narrow interface between
the present and abuse because each views
gets its own property to the display but
there is no coupling between them and
this will be lot harder without having
properties in javafx sexually yeah so
even though you're returning a note back
you can always update later by just
injecting a new chart oh gee the view on
the fly and then it'll change downstream
forever is currently looking at this so
on exactly so there is a there's a
snapshot there's also the dashboard for
instance is just key the dashboard view
and it just knows these snapshots yeah
yeah I could use a list or whatever but
there's travel list of snapshots and the
the whole UI is very very simple just
use these using H box and B box so I
fancy layouts no
and just one CSS I like 10 pixel spacing
so there's actually very very easy so
this is the whole layout layout think so
I was no not interesting layout rather
than organization of the different parts
yep so and even more interesting is
probably what I did there is one
specific one specific view code scripts
it looks exactly like the others so
there is one create you would create and
pop up and the interesting story is i
use seen builder in this case so instead
of crafted by hand I just used symbol de
and was curious what how it will work
actually and I would start with symbol
of the beaker but what I started with
whitefish before single there was a
yellow so right now I would just use
symbol therefore for lots of stuff and
what's your experience in building to
you k GM like the development experience
for building site obscene builder yes
and I just open system builder and this
is the JavaScript the escalation you
very very simple but the idea is why I
like seen builder is not because it's
very capable to love visualizing view
rather than it works with inversion of
control if you think about this and in a
pinch rollers intership control because
of the controllers yes instead of of
creating source code for you you
creating a controller and symbol the
uses that and this is what makes is very
very interesting for real-world projects
they did actually one of the things i
learned so i did an initial integration
of spring and java FF of what spring
framework ok do you know her no no just
kidding so the other things i learned
which applies to ja ve IRC containers as
well is the f xml actually has support
for injecting inversion of control in it
so you can actually populate all of the
controller methods with things that come
from the container yes yes this is what
it is I you can inject into the contour
did use yeah this is what wipers you
have to do that yeah yeah this exactly
you have on you have a you ability
controller and then you can inject the
views and there the tag is epics ml
annotation yeah so let's show your
controller I have to find that first
worse so wait a minute should be where's
the code called pain script presenta
this is the control arm
okay yeah so and then where do you where
do you inject your your view stuff so
this is no objective from the from the
class yeah I think some outtakes people
it takes for a piss Willy I wouldn't eat
so what I was talking about is you can
actually instantiate the controller
object from your ioc container and
inject that into the power of XML ok I
did something similar I had to do this
in scripts I used to ethics alota here
and then I you have to present a year
with the controller you can you can
fetch from the loader the controller to
be able to you need you need an instance
of the of the controller right yeah and
you can do the you can do the opposite
so rather than using the instance of
controllers gets created you can
actually push your own controller class
that you instantiate that's container
manage and then I think some alota will
work is JC your ginger learning
objective properties it's over you give
up so that makes it a lot more
compatible with let's say you're using
juice or you're using the job you see p
dependency injection and you can just
use that out of the box with the objects
which are container manage yeah this
this will be great and or this will be
great if I had the I here on my javac
side so i didn't use dependency
injection yeah because one wasn't
necessary in my case but i see the point
for welfare for like very big
applications yes dia is actually nice
because it lets you separate out all of
your your different views and screens
let's go get results modules that's
going less code so um so we have these
cuts and what I actually are pushing
exactly as I oh just would like to show
you the script view again this is the
scripts and if you look at this what
happens actually I get back to the root
element from the lowdown so and the
scripts here it is somehow
able xml and what I like here is for me
understands the F XML like like
scripting of the factory so I have two
approaches either I can build the UI by
hand what I did with just combining the
notes page boxes and glasses yeah i am
using i'm using a fix ml laura which
creates the mood for me so i can just
mitigate the risks so in bigger projects
i can just from the outside there is no
difference whether it was created by
simple de or buy my stuff and even the
controllers could be the same and this
is the huge fine because before then i
use a net and head feels letís and
swing build up yeah it's real great but
it generate lots of coated sometimes it
just became inconsistent so what do we
did we checked everything in we
committed everything you've become
india's were like horrifying wall back
commodification was somehow treaties or
what you did back then was so Sam you
generated by netbeans we just everything
which was essential was respected out to
an interface as I and the controller
just no nudity interface and just
interacted with the interface but right
now it is a lot simpler because the view
itself is screen from the outside yeah
this is what makes the citizen versus
you to have a clean separation between
your view and the controller and the
tubular with your writing and what is
nice and light fish so I introduce one
view generated by symbol de afterwards
and it's actually no difference at all
in both views on the dashboard doesn't
even know whether it is generated by
simple de or the other yeah so signature
you're such a chav effects curve have
you considered giving any javafx talks
or conferences I didn't jump on actually
ok was very well attended and I will do
it here actually the my next attack
would be Java you I and I think several
hours would be John effects I will talk
about how to structure java fix
applications because in my project is
not about effects is more about
organization because enterprise know
good 3dx and enterprise applications are
somehow critical but even as a Java a
developer mixing in some small user
interfaces with your application it's
quite easy to do since this all java
yeah and so this is some Java Vic's I
like it a lot should be available on
iPads on all other devices as well this
will be one of the Keith killer features
in my perspective by the way because I
came up with a medic jug last night yeah
yeah and I'll tell you why because if
you are java developer i think you don't
interest it a lot in objective-c except
you you have a lot of Apple stickers on
at home so I would say I'm not under I a
now or we can we can replace one ok we
could do that the problem is machine is
broken i will order to apple store area
if we do this i would we need another
sticker for my new machine but we can
write that yeah thank you so I consider
the diff some jello thick stalks and
then always did actually I did one of
the first job I've so you just return
the machine to the apple store and they
fixed glass fish for you get a new
machine back for class which works less
please I need you might this glass is
broken as well so there is a 1 pixel
damaged oh that's unfortunate you can
actually see the pixels on the retina
display you can find a little yeah it
could do that probably nano nano nano
meter never really know thanks aware
there's on several problems but um yeah
javax so what had begged to symbol de
syndulla was a welder symbol biasing
hacking so a wise guy to inversion of
control is the number one the number two
it seems to to be used by the jibjab
Jovetic skies as well so internally and
i attended some great travel one talks
about simple actually and they were very
passionate adore some French guys I
from grenoble maybe I think and did this
distance were extremely grated the guy
was passionate in the show tweets with
CSS so you can even find out from where
the CSS style cars you know whether it
comes from there from the CSS default
from CSS file or from frog from
inheritance this was actually very
useful and CSS is also great for for
some kind of effects in one project we
have to have fun somewhere by validation
and the labels of text boxes had to turn
right for instance and so you could do
it just changing the changing the color
or it could also do with with feathers
just to add and remove and CSS class
which is very simple and they're the
cool story was they their developers
were not that java fix &amp;amp; javas killed
but CSS was very simple with netbeans so
they were able to you know to create a
comma and a slightly out and we just
replace the CSS class and it worked
perfectly nice so on so this is the CSS
is a finger at the beginning I was a
little bit concerned that is too much
but right now for me conceptually CSS is
nothing else than dependency injection
again we are you are injecting into UI
components that values from CSS and CSS
happens to be a standard very well
supported by name is by the way this is
an arm you can you can use netbeans for
html5 and css3 which fits perfectly with
our strat of X so grateful so and the
last interesting stuff probably so we
have some questions regarding life
insurer sure or structured java X not
lighting that is not an interesting
probably busy the G
so we all sing the common tation
impossible is it missing missing
attention javadoc exactly javadoc is
evil if you ask me so on I could just
for just for my crew right now example
that's Marcus wait a minute Adam so no
Jonah adam says Charlotte X is evil no
Jonathan chau doc yet no n0 marcos i
will just document this is a default
constructor it creates an object oh and
this is very surprising you see you see
the power right of hacking and an open
source returns a return a note and it's
very variable now we have Charlotte's
yeah and now we internal doc says I
actually done that that javadoc actually
is good because because it's true yes
the Javadoc which is evil is the Javadoc
where they actually explain something
and it's wrong it doesn't match the code
that's evil and this is perfect because
if somehow haven't get that perfect
understand what would you know what's
that so I mean I hope Marcus like that
an ogress is invited to create even more
java book
in his own Fork it's possible he get out
Indian he can go to a pusher person
you'll never ever we request I will just
try to skip the another the filter out
the Java but everything else will be
accepted no in them what I really do my
project I just am from time to time my
job is to perform code reviews and such
javadoc is defect in my eyes so really
so everything get a servers constructors
everything is just not documented at all
if you would like to comment something
you should comment about the intentions
and the purpose of the class not you
know well no I think I think the as an
example the Java fix team does a pretty
good job with their javadocs so they
they explained at the very top of it how
to use the classes and give examples of
it and I've even found for the layouts
and some esoteric methods i found
interesting hinson things in the Java
Docs which I would have had to read the
implementation to figure out otherwise
yeah and this is the point but if you
look for instance on the note there is
no single you know single line about
this is an old it is a constructor is
how to use that and so I mean this is a
great javadoc but this is actually
another javadoc to the dock yeah yeah
this is like how it's supposed to be
yeah and most of the project javadoc is
like obvious of this crap it's like
they're they are documenting something
with all the sub you know somebody told
them they have to do each other yes
exactly
yeah very popular on and unit is the
same so 100 person unit test coverage as
my my favorite and recently I saw a
project one hundred percent case
coverage without single assert this
little next complaint from my verizon
where are we as a DA ed Jerry test but I
could ride them with one hundred percent
code coverage in few minutes actually
yeah without a source of course so the
janitor is really great from from it is
getting better and better but it started
already good with Java fix but the end
the beginning was on mixed between the
old calm some stuff and the new Java
extra right now it is clean and clean
and actually looks good you didn't see
with with nice images embedded so this
is actually java java book which tara
doctor which is usable analytics oh yeah
baby is really documentation at this
point it's a lot of work to put this
together there are lots of good examples
like my favorite is makita as well
mojito framework is unit test framework
make sure the whole documentation of the
framework is Javed off from the mojito
class this actually fare very well done
so you don't yeah but actually so now
Marcos now we documented live fish and
and I would like to show you something
so Java Vic's comes with Java Vic's
packager and what what you can do easily
so this is just a maven integration it
can create for your native package which
is actually perfect because what do I
always did was swing back then I think
it was not always legal to some time and
what it could do you can put in a folder
dedicate then or Joe Jerry then your
application then one batch file which
points to add points to teach to to
Jerry and the application package
everything in shipping the end it worked
it worked perfectly I got out there is a
redistribution clause and sun and the
old sign it I think it was not that so I
am my take on this was we do it and we
have to ask the legal department and the
project manager said always of course we
will do it ok now and now everything is
is done right from my perspective but it
was not that clean so I think you
weren't able to reduce TV Jerry you have
to download it at something like this
and with Oracle is I think a little bit
easier because yeah there is a tool
which package is the application yeah so
this is this is the way I look at the
packager so here's applets not that good
and here is web start it's a little bit
better because you don't have the
plugins and it works on more machines
and this is where you want to go i mean
this is this is the official a would
even with oracle logo and this is this
is official because i made it say
something yeah but ya know we're
encouraging folks to do packaging
because you know you can ship the jvm
version you tested with the people don't
have to have java installed on their
computers and this is going to get your
application and app stores like the
apple desktop app store or the windows
market what was what's windows calling
their app store yeah prob stop you know
yeah i'm gonna say windows 8 has a
Napster i haven't played with any marks
market is it windows market so hopefully
maybe we work with your software Navin
clean sorry we just stopped or store
store of course well we've got folks
from Brazil online so is it is it it's a
night in Brazil yeah let us know let us
know if it's night in Brazil what time
is it there
if you if you if you tweet Brazil you
should jump someone should shout out
Breslow so now it happens now a time
light which is going to be packaged
natively nice forward and the dmg should
be the output actually and this is
actually great have to say because what
start what's good technology but a
little bit shaky and the problem was not
website itself rather than you know the
proxy servers and caching mechanism and
enterprises we had always travel with
them yeah but just packaging everything
like in single file and shipping that is
actually the best you can get and right
now we do it without packaging in one
project because before that so we do the
zip distribution in several countries
and we get the answer what is it it it
works great well regardless where we
move this it just works you know because
everything is self-contained and I think
the self-contained deployment is just
great okay so now we have a light fish
dmg somewhere
installer
when I'm going to work oh it's I can
assess morning and results 8am over
there oh damn yeah so order to be nice
probably aja aja it's night none it can
be you know Thank it's always mindful
sure Australia this is for somebody who
travels as much as I do we're I'm
horrible at time zones I have no clue i
think i think the Sun rotates around the
earth but I didn't quite figured out
this is what about what I love you son
yeah some of the sun goes in the orbit
around he returned and so once in New
York see also advertisement speed behind
every culture is a son how do I follow
from the cloud above your company three
o'clock three o'clock oh so it's it's
night and yeah that's right there like
45 hours off yeah so it's jay's gym
actually up Jim Weaver's online he's in
he's in India Indianapolis or Indiana
without aura kampra you right yeah it
just to break all over the world over
there clock yeah buddy kiss thank you
something so I think I could show you
something but I think the core pieces we
already here and without launching
blasters you do be really hard let's
let's look at the GlassFish area just
quickly because you know we what we want
to see all right well I can show you
just don't break netbeans is for is very
sensible piece of software wait a minute
what I can do I can launch it is to live
fish without review shredding your son
this is how it looks without without
with all gray said charts ya paranormal
activity it was the best charts i think
there's not gravy I you I in trouble
performance commits per seconds robux
per seconds applications and this is
actually the beautiful WebKit yeah this
is an out of the box you can feel
without without any design skills which
is remarkable and the what you can do
you can create new scripts to select
relieve you from the symbol that you see
here I say all right let me check
something which is beautiful right I'll
even resize is probably of course nice I
spent several minutes oh alright so
let's let's talk about what we're gonna
what we're going to do so for folks on
the stream after we're done with Adam
we're going to swap places yes and Tony
and Adam are going to interview me about
the night hackings whore and it was our
idea yeah you said yes yeah I somehow I
said yes I should have said no yeah but
you would like to have this pick the
right so also i was thinking what we'll
do is we'll actually will take the
camera wireless and go walk outside and
look at the bike and walk around and do
stuff so i'll be fun and then to finish
out the stream let's let's let people
know a little bit more about how they
can get air house or attend air hex of
course I mean so keep our photos and
it's always perfect yeah hats is the
excom just a tool yikes yeah i was about
to show you with a night making it so
just getting good is the X you get to
get in line no
think I think they're here like as well
a judge I have a sticker don't know
everything settled yeah so air hacks go
10 can I come home we can connect them I
think so we have this we have we should
we should do we should do a virtual like
you know you can do air hack so we could
put my camera there yes and stream it on
all night actor yes yeah what's working
on but this would be march but we can do
that no problem and this is my fish nice
yep I sent out that link on the on the
online stream and if you like just
contribute or I've found with that cool
thank you I said upcoming schedule right
after this hang on the screen five
minutes and we'll go back live with a
reverse interview and then at 3pm which
that's it 24 hours from now we're going
to do Tony perfect all right and thanks
everybody for attending night hacking
with Adam thank you very much and thanks
for coming
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
