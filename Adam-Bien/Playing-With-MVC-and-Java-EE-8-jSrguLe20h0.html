would like to play with Model View
controller and the Java EE 8 spec and
what I already did I just created or set
a dependency to the ozark which is the
reference implementation and what we
have to start with is with our class
called jax-rs configuration actually it
should be MVC configuration this time
and just start the project in the index
dot MVC and what I would do we'll start
with the to configure the pass first and
also it is jax-rs
as annotation is actually configured
this time the MVC framework so I will
call this views and it is going to
extend the jax-rs application please
change and now the framework is setup
and what we would like to do is to
create a Java class and the Java class
is something like the view helper or a
class which interacts between the view
or just prepares the data for the for
the for the view for the template and
fetches the data from somewhere and I
will call it hello hello helper and this
can be a model which happens to be a
request scopes named pin and what I also
forgot is to use a pin 6 ml to enable
the dependency injection everywhere so I
would like to use all classes will have
to ejection everywhere and of course in
the same folder I will create the actual
boundary the business component greeting
service and this as always is going
bein a GB and this is a GB returns the
message returned hello and I would like
to add something which very system
current I'm Millie's so it has been and
I can inject that into the hello helper
so my greetings service Gia's at inject
and I would like to expose the message
let's say get message and say return
return this GS dot message so the
interesting part is the view helper or
actual D model knows how to fetch the
data from the backend and now what we
need the controller this is actually the
key part and our controller the name of
our controller is going to be of course
a hello controller and what we have to
do is to use the annotation controller
and the annotation path hello
and what I would like to do is to expose
the or route to the to the welcome view
and this is going to be
hello JSP and just be are actually great
so webpages new JSP with the name hello
and I would just ignore instead of to
omit the hello static hello world I
would like to use the
dynamic one and this is the head Oh
helper and message so as you can see it
was recognized by the ID and now let's
see what happens
I will like to run it and you should
start the GlassFish and everything so it
just runs on daily builds a glassfish
rodent right now but of course in the
java e8 timeframe it would run on the
release not only of GlassFish but all
other service and MVC what we had views
and hello as you can see it seems to
work so so and this was one way to
introduce the D model so what we have we
have the MVC configuration with the
application so again this is the jax-rs
part we have the model actually helper I
don't like the name helper should be the
hello model and we have the controller
which actually only routes to the view
so there is no connection between the
control and the boundary and we have a
back-end service creating service which
contains the business logic and of
course the view is a template and
actually GSP s are really great so thank
you for watching and see you an upcoming
conferences workshops or even a hex at
Munich Airport so thank you and bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
