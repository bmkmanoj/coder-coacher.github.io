would like to implement a Java back-end
service a angular 2 app and connect both
or the angular 2 app is going to to
access the backend service so let's
start with this simplest possible Java
EE project with actually two
dependencies today's the first one is of
course Java 7 API and the next one is
course because we would like we would
like to to be accessed from outside our
server this is a real world we could of
course put the angular app or bundle the
angular app together with the war but
this is usually what what what not
happens in in the real world so we have
a Exchequer's core
0:02 looks nice and what we would like
to do is to expose a Duke's resource
which emits Duke's and this is going to
be a resource with the name Duke's and I
would like to use the or expose chasing
ray and u-k's as cat and then let's do
let's create a dupe Duke Duke has a name
and H and then I would like to return
this JSON dot create create object build
up and this is name is going to be the
name and H is going to be the H and I
think Java is old but it should be
enough so
and then we can return our JSON array
create Jason and create array builder
and I would like to add a Duke with the
name smart and smarty is 18 and the nice
Duke is 42 so should work so let's try
that I will just rebuild it completely
and run it so where's our payara server
let's take T this one and then so it
only runs resources Duke's and we have
the name smart is 18 and the other one
is 42 so what I did I created a also in
angular 2 a project from scratch and
this is based on the angular 2 template
so nothing special it just comprises all
the dependencies to angular 201 and some
dev dependencies like the light server
and I would like just to open it in this
way and then I can already start it so I
will use NPM script for this and this
will launch the project
to see my first angular app so looks
nice and now try to connect it with with
the back end so what is it so we have
the the main which is comparable to Java
main and it just says that the angular
app is going to be rendered in a browser
and we have a module and the module
already has a browser module but what we
would like to do I would like to use the
HTTP module which is a kind of jax-rs
client or HTTP client and this is going
to import that from HTTP and then I
would like to import the browser module
and the HTTP module so what is the app
component the app components actually
what outputs here so if I just put here
Dukes you get the Dukes and what I would
like to do is to use the multi-line
string so a feature of es2015 and now
try something I would just use here
the Dukes the Dukes equals and just
create an array and in this array we
have the first Duke name is smart off
line and his age is H is 2 and the and
the other one is named cashed and th
test3
so so we have two Dukes and what you can
do right now I would also like to import
ng in it this kind of post construct
implements ng in it all in it not NJ in
it and then what I will have to do so if
I go here you see that I forgot the TNG
on init method so I would have to
implement this ng on in it so and this
is going to be called when the component
instantiates so what I will also like to
do is to import the HDP class or
function from at angular HTTP I always
hit the wrong button HTTP so and then I
would like to inject the HTTP service
and I will use the typescript shortcut
for that which says private HTTP on what
it basically does it creates a private
field HTTP which is available in the
whole class so now what you can do
already I could say this HTTP dot get
and add the order here so but now I have
to be really cautious ins swap the tap
here to see the output of the angular so
and then I would like to use the promise
the problem is this gastric returns in
rxjs observable but I would like to use
a promise so in order to use a promise
regular egg mask I promise I will have
to import an operator our XJS add
operator to promise and then I can use
it so and then I can call dot
to promise and this will convert the
observable to regular JavaScript promise
which is comparable to future what we
have in Java and I can say then let's
say I convert the roll result to Jason
and after its converted I could say then
the converted result is this Duke's
equals R and so still the same output Y
because there is no iteration here so
what I would like also to create in a
list and the list comprises it comprises
a single Ally and it has an NG for
directive and it's a let Duke of Dukes
and then within the list I can say Duke
dot name and Duke dot H so smart 18 and
nice 42 this is exactly hopefully what
we get from the survey yes so if we
change it on the server and say we would
like to have T get cool Duke
and a cool Duke is 50 and just reloaded
is 50 here and 50 here so Java is just
the perfect backend for for html5 apps
whether react angular or whatever thank
you for watching and see the upcoming
conferences workshops or even if
actuated Munich Airport particularly of
course in angular 2 workshop so thank
you for watching and enjoy Java and
JavaScript bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
