would like to use a date picker web
component and I would like to use the
Varden elements date picker which a set
of web components ready to use web
components and I would like to use a
free component called date picker and in
order to use it I will have to use Bower
first to install the dependencies and
the bower is what power does behind the
scenes like a glorified git clone it
just clones existing repositories so um
and I would like to use the Velo theme
so let's do this just install that so it
pulls all the defer dependencies from
from the git repository and now we can
switch to the editor and now what I got
on top of it the bower components
repository which was created right now
and I would like to use the date picker
component so how to use that we have to
add two dependencies to the project so
let's go with that
and so let's do this so I will add C
dependencies right now and this is the
old web component syntax the new syntax
uses es6 imports this is the old one but
it shouldn't matter you should use this
you should use whatever your component
provider provides you so this will
import the component and what we will
have to do is to start the application
with these dependencies so I would like
to use browser thing for that so I would
say browser sync
browser sync and start and I would like
to start from source and browser sync
they'd pick bower components folder so
it should serve from sorts and power
component but only watch the source
folder and I would like to launch the
Google Chrome browser Google Chrome
browser so and it's already launched so
we see now that you see the hello from
from this is a this is the hello from
here so let's see whether it actually
works
and it seems to work so now it's
synchronized and I would like actually
surf the components from here so let's
see what happens here and we get to 404
because it cannot find the components
why not
because we serve the the contents from
power component folder and now all the
problems are gone so now we import it
our date picker not yet so what we have
to do we have to actually use the tag so
let's take a look at it looks like
so HTML examples and let's say with a
label so I would like to use this tank
so we switch to here and our web
component appears here but so we can
choose something and so it looks nice
but I would really like to use the date
here so on every change I would like to
subscribe to the changes so let's do
this in the plain JavaScript klava
script file I have here so instead of
just logging out this hello web
standards what I would like to do is to
say okay do not just do it in a proper
way so I would like to remember the name
of the component this is this one and
say okay custom elements custom elements
when defined so in case they are already
known to the runtime you Vardhan then do
something with it and what I would like
to do is I would like to fetch the
component first so I would like to say
document query selector and I'm
searching for Vaadin date picker and
this is my date picker and let's see
whether it works so I would just say
console doctor
date picker and we have it the reference
so it looks somehow interesting so we
have $2.00 here it seems like two is the
genitive Vardhan component and what I
would like to do is I would like to
subscribe to the changes and we can use
custom events for that so I can ask the
date picker at event listener for value
changed so I can register a listener
value changed and I would like to do
retrieve the value console.log and the
value without the semicolon note date
Parker date picker so let's go with the
date picker so let's see what happens I
pick something and I got the custom
event but what I would like to do so
every custom event has to contain a
detail don't can content a DJ payload
and this is your detail and we see the
value so what I can actually get now I
can ask the event for the detail and
then for the value and now if I choose
something here I get the value of the
actual date so the nice story of web
components is you can pick whatever
provider you like and you are still
compatible with the web component and of
course no one would create a date picker
from scratch right now so you can use
for instance Vaadin or primefaces
components for this purpose so thank you
for watching and if you're interested
web components check out our web
components training too dark or see you
at conferences workshops or a XCOM in
munich so thank you and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
