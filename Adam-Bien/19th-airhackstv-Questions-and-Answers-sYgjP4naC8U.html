very first question is that or question
topic so first welcome back to ax and
this is going to be the last a hex
before Jeff one and what happens we will
get an a special event at javaone so it
is going to be above birds of feather
and usually the birds of feather the
first days take part in the moscone
center where java one was at sunday's
but it is now in in cyril magnin i think
yes in in a hotel and it is going to be
at 7pm so um and what we all do we i
would like to cover is the java on news
so what happened so far and 20 years of
Java's if you have any other questions
or put them here and otherwise i would
just cover the life questions there are
already I think 40 registrations which
is a lot for such a show and the room is
not very big so if you would like to
attend hurry up and pre enroll to the
sessions okay this is the first one and
the the next topic is practices for
securing third-party API credentials so
I got the question already and I answer
the last time but basic basically the
question is as I will just go to the 2d
regular gist is AP IEDs and secrets
beckoned from cloud deployed
applications and the question is what
are the best practices and I mean best
practice there is no best practice if
you don't know what the goal is right so
how secure has and that doesn't have to
be and is it an enterprise application
is it a private cloud as a public cloud
so we did once in a private cloud so we
just generated a token in the back end
and we just at the past back and forth
the D token and it was either header I
think was even I had a HTTP header and
it worked well
if you are going to implement the public
service you have to a little bit of
cautious and especially if someone
modifies the data so what you probably
would like to do is like compute some
hash on the client and and then and send
a hash along with the message to the
server and best practice is what i
usually do I look at the popular api's
like YouTube github even Twitter or
whatever and and try to to review what
they actually did and some parts are
good and some are not so great so just
take some inspiration from existing
api's and we covered also that the last
time so but the best and of course this
practice so what you will probably have
also to do is if you are securing the
API you have to implement something like
a throttling so you have to decide you
know someone who's the ID 42 should be
not able to access the service more than
I don't know five times a day so you
would have to implement such things and
again there are no best practices
because I really don't know what the
requirements are and if you just you
know if your server service is just
another public Weather Service it could
be perfectly enough you know to to have
just SSL and nothing else but yeah so it
really depends on your building so a
billing service is going to be has to be
more secure than a weather service okay
it's a next one and this is an
interesting question actually and is it
really needed for a professional java
developer to read a whole book on ide or
a beginner to spend so much time to
understand and i D rather than focusing
on the language and this is interesting
one and I think I tweeted a question
about the book the question a statement
about the beginning NetBeans IDE for
Java developers and I got a copy from
Heidi and velenka vilena which is who is
the product manager at Oracle for
netbeans and I took a look at the book
and I like parts of the book
particularly refactorings section so I'm
just glanced briefly over over the
sections or two interesting topics and
the question is is it any added value of
doing so or not and what you have to
know I actually read a book about a
whole book about an editor
bbedit and I learned a lot and I don't
regret this so um i would say what
happens if you read or Easter any book
out there so if you read the book it
cause you harm you know this is the
question so I'm the question is what do
you would do instead right so what is
the alternative to reading the book just
spend more time or language this could
be a great idea but you know reading a
book about ide instead of watching
Netflix could be could be even better
idea so I'm I read lots of books and I
never regretted to read a particular
book and various topics so I'm so it
should be not necessary to read a book
about ide but i would actually reach the
netbeans book and there's lots of
screenshots and adds really really fast
read and and to answer now the question
more clearly i'm actually not interested
in books who would which would display
and explain me you know particular menus
of features what I would more interested
in particular ideas behind an ide like
for instance eclipses all about plugins
you know that you can configure
everything and and and and whatever and
IntelliJ would be more about usability
and out-of-the-box experience as well as
netbeans so knowing such ideas at the
beginning can be really helpful knowing
this just give you an brief idea let's
see whether it is still the case so I'm
the beginners ask me a lot about eclipse
so if you go to download my Dean most
frequent question is if I'm started with
Java developers know which ID to
download so if someone if there would be
if there is a kids book if you read the
book you you would not know I don't know
I need this one but not this one and not
this one no so um I would say if you
have time read the book if you don't
have the time reach London language so
this would be my official official
answer ok this was a 21 and I have heard
and read read about paga seven platform
from Pegasystems I am I never had this
before and I got a tweet phone seeker
and I tried to look it up and it is
really hard to find any technical
materials from Pegasystems you know
without giving them a dress or whatever
and I say okay forget about bigger
system so um and I try to review my past
projects and and the statement is let's
say that C ask me it is possible to
build a web app six dot four times
faster than Java EE so um in my current
project which are fully implemented I
think I have I had 15 days yes 15 days
to implement the whole application with
no with meetings reviews and and I don't
know installation whatever so it would
mean with with whatever I will be able
to do it in two days so i would say
impossible so the question is you know
how much time are you wasting with java
ee comparing into any other technology
and i say it can really hard imagine
whether there is something out there
which is seven times faster or six times
faster than java ee what it can be for
instance java is is not this is not a a
domain-specific framework so let's say I
would compare Java you with a content
management system and I would have to
build a content management system then
naturally a content management system
has to be more productive than Java EE
because I will have in Java implement
everything from scratch but even in in
in this particular case you know I own
be build everything from scratch I will
just download no slingshot or jack
rabbit or whatever I try to do to reduce
something but you know seven times is a
lot so it means instead of seven months
one month or two weeks two days or you
know let's let's boil down it to one
week so instead using one thing one week
to one day is really hard to believe
what could be the day comparing to the
old you know I don't know nine years old
j2ee then I
could even believe but even then we use
no aunt was with predefined X doclet
generators so we didn't implement
everything by hand so it was almost as
productive as Java EE is right now so um
it is hard to believe in as a
general-purpose platform what can be so
there are systems out there which are
domain-specific and then they have to be
more productive than Java EE otherwise
what what is the point right okay so
authentication seems to be an unruly hot
topic and a next question how to
implement authentication in jtree
application I'm starting any application
which just FEG BJP and so forth and it's
something similar to spring security and
what what happens frequently in project
I just shall we know the out-of-the-box
security and every set and everyone says
oh at the nudists so is it possible
these annotations of courses are built
in j2ee security called roles allowed we
also cover this in there in the last
workshop and I think I would even call
it record a online workshop about
security because I get a question a lot
and before I'm ready with this I had I
guess spring next year what you can do
you can search for a free article of my
it's called and it was in java magazine
and this was magazine authentication so
and this article is free download this
on what i did in this article i
implemented a small example using glass
which which is reference implementation
I used jdbc security runs ice taught the
use and the user enrolls in gdb serum
and then I exaggerated a little bit and
implemented my own custom roles and and
and and and security actions or
entitlements and when this article comes
also with a sample application it is
already how old is it two years so check
it out and and look at this so most of
answer most of the questions already
answered in this article and i think i
will record our workshop about
authentication and authorization
security with too broad for just you
know java authentication and
authorization might be a good idea ok i
will just paste the article to the chat
so and there is again joseph putting ask
right now interested in you in your
thoughts on oracle getting rid of java
evangelists so we had the question i
think the last time and if not i also
answer the question during the pyara
pyara interview with the payara guys so
a short answer would be it's a really
pity but no one knows what's going on
inside oracle it's a huge company and it
could be just a decision from one
particular manager who would like you
know to save some money on save some
budget in order to look good on paper so
this could be a reason you shouldn't you
know interpret too much so let's see
what happens in java one they are going
to be key notes and then people could
ask you know the the oracle people
directly what's going on so i'm really
curious about java ones or so come to
jump on the debuff and see what happens
then okay Tony sees a Twitter asked me
when is it a bad idea to use ejbs if
this is not a server-side application
probably so on the survey always using
cheap is because it's incredibly easy
and there is no overhead so the question
is why not so with that single
annotation you can achieve a lot without
a gps you have to think more what we are
doing this is your business just
easygoing some I'm always using it
should be even more trivial applications
because there is there is no downside on
this on modern server of course if
you're using a know some ancient
technology of jdk 10 application server
it might look differently so um very
good hope so so we have TM okay and now
the question we can always answer the
question as in this way it should be jpa
matelas GSF is more interesting so the
question is what is SF and Jess f is a
servlet and most of the applications are
server frameworks web frameworks are
sublets knowing that you only have to
look at the Soviet security which is
based on these oh it's a standard HTTP
security which is very similar to for
instance Apache security so what you
always get in java ee is is basic
authentication certificate form based
authentication and the last one I think
is called digest the digest
authentication so it boils down to form
based authentication and and basic which
usually is base 64 encoded username
current password which i would would you
have to encrypt with SSL and this is
what it gets for free and you are
sending a realm which is like the
database and on the server the username
and password is taken is is transformed
to a role and they're always used for a
role based access control rbac which is
very similar to unix through unix
control as authorization system so this
is what happens always hope I or always
it was never different on the
application services from day one this
was how it was and if you access the egb
through servlets the egb inherit the the
principal and the role so what is there
all is like a group of principles okay
the next one techdirt and I think tech /
attended one of the IX Munich a hex
fracture of at munich airport so I think
he should know
the answer but what would be the
behavior for method overloading in
jax-rs so the question is we have a
jax-rs method overloading and what is
the default behavior and he has two
methods one is a Singh response and the
other one is create new transaction and
what I understood this you would like to
pass a transaction and collection of
something so and this there is I think
no right answer to his question so what
I would what I would ask for this is um
if there's a actually it is not a matter
of a rolling lag like because a
collection is another object so I think
the job would be also not possible you
know to have like overload methods or
could be possible it is actually
possible to having a string and string
array in Java but the question rather is
why then he needs a type-safe parameters
so if knowing this rather true choose
JSON object why does yeah because with
Jason Jason object i get i was method
overloading for free the method is just
invoked with the with the payload and i
can decide within the method what to do
by converting the parameters so instead
of doing tricks with this i would rather
use json p would you actually do a lot
in the projects and then there will be
no problem with this and what you also
can do is like the method overloading
and HTTP and this is the mime type so
you can just define your own lifetime
even the version of a mime type and you
get the natural dispatching how it would
work you could say a post and consumes
application / xml call on version 12 or
whatever you like and the jax-rs will
try to match the the consume types and
invoke the particular method so what are
you asking for is probably the mime type
but i would rather question you know
your approach to using Jax p at all i
would rather like to use JSON p in your
case
okay now let's see what there are any
questions everyone is happy here oh just
supporting a did 10 have any of the
observers first service pack was with 11
he's absolutely absolutely right and
jaws we know which one java web server
was the very very first one you're
absolutely right so so next next one is
a payara specific otis pyara is like
glass fusion steroids or a glass with
glassfish with commercial support
optional commercial support or pet
glassfish is actually pay out a lot in
my projects what I don't use a lot this
is the payara micro edition version what
I rather use is the is the full
supported version so the D standalone
version and a question is what are my
options for adding jdbc drivers and
configured resources in pyara micro so
what is the problem so what I what I
downloaded here is the payara so i can
say java manage our pyara micro and it
will boot the server so fine and you ask
me okay but you know how to configure
anything here and because if i stop it
everything will disappear and if I say
Java minus jar so what I the answer is
what we could do you can provide a
domain Excel and the domain exam l could
specify data sources and the jdbc
drivers the problem with jdbc drivers is
of course if you go here with java my
nose jar and invoke this this way there
is no way to add the classpath or to
influence the class was from the outside
so it is really hard to put the gdb see
drivers from outside here so what you
can do of course instead is the
following so what you could do you can
you could open I think it's called
better zip yes
pyara micro so I'm just opening the
payara jar so it takes with with
basically winzip and there is a meta in
and within the emitter and I'm searching
for manifest MF let's say there should
be one and within the manifest MF there
should be manifest ok and you see the
main class and this is what is actually
executed so what it means is if I just
copy does and go here I could invoke
this with Java minus CP pyara with the
main main method and as you can see it
starts so but having used to CP sorry
now I can put my GD pc drivers here and
they will end up being in the classpath
so this answers the question how to put
you know the d-class bus or how to set
our class dojo pyara so the quick heck
should work so but do you this is a
direct direct answer for the question
but i would actually never do this so
I'm what I use a lot is a docker for
instance and the docket there is no
difference whether you are starting with
Java mean my nose charity pyara or the
full fledged application server so
because the the doc image is build once
and or once always if the release of the
application server changes so I'm
therefore i always use in dhaka the
full-fledged pyara and never the micro
edition so micro edition is more
interesting if you're running something
without dhaka and then this is the
answer to your question and what you can
also do you can run pyara in a bedded
mode and in this particular case in this
particular case let's switch the gears
this is actually an example from
microservices workshop in Munich Airport
so what I just did there should be a
payara micro yes I will just open this
folder here and show you the app so what
you see here I this is I just implement
of rapper 4 PI R as I'm starting Park
pyara here on port 80 and 882 and I just
used the setup jdbc command and now I
can do whatever I like so I use as admin
to set up the data source it happens in
no x is extremely quick and what I will
always have to do is of course to put
the jdbc drive and the classpath which I
can absolutely do because it's my app
and this is the d different answer or DD
another answer to your question you know
how to setup pyara persistently and and
the last thing you can do I think there
is there is a a method called
installation route or something
installation directory and then you can
point to existing glassfish dominicks ml
and then the payara micro will just pick
all the settings from the existing
glassfish configuration so i hope now
the question is clear is this a little
bit pyar specific but i'm also
interesting because there are lots of
bars you know regarding regarding micro
application servers and the payara micro
is 60 megabytes download size and if you
download everything is about 200 mix so
i'm actually not very interested in the
optimization so this is why i always use
the full distribution and so questions
here
Oh Joseph putting a was working on on
some professional services project chick
so yes from from Apache if thing was one
of the Apaches service and if you work
for some professional services people we
know the job the whole history with java
java what is called GW sdk like the
predecessor of actually tomconn and
everything else so thank you joseph okay
then go to next question he the mr.
femara I think he's name first name is
Daniel he also attended the he attended
for sure the DX at Munich Airport and
his question he actually has to know the
answer so I'm he asked for how to inject
resource bundles in Java so this is his
basic question and in Java sometimes it
is easier to just to just show you an
implementation and give workspaces is
junk resource bundle dependency
injection so the answer is very simple
you would like to have something like
resourcebundle producer or factory is
actually a factory instead of resource
bundle we just use properties
Steve Roehm produces this one and this
would be properties props cause new
properties then crops read wasn't in the
read from there is a method like a load
not read load from input stream this
would be a RB factory class get resource
a stream my properties I actually don't
like the my Duke is far far better Duke
return props and of course catch some
exceptions props so this is how to load
properties and you could load whatever
you like here and now the properties are
ejectable so it means if I would like
would like to have a class let's called
air hex service so then I can go here
and say add ject properties props props
yeah and you can this may break but
because i think properties come with a
different constructor so what you will
have to do is to introduce a qualifier
and i will just say configuration and
this is a qualifier which is going to
have the retention runtime and target
methods and field yes and field and of
course this has to be a notation so now
we can say the ax service at
configuration and our be factory at
configuration and because they match
it's unique and even netbeans recognize
this so if I click here I end up being
here and this should work so that was
cutely deployment but it should work of
course what I also need do properties
here and I will have to modify the
pom.xml in order to pick you know the
properties from the right folder I hope
it is clear and resourcebundle would
work the same way so questions here and
knock tune ask me is it necessary a
special configuration for priority
production so we are using pi are in
production there is no specific
configuration what we do we increase the
the heap size a bit and we add the
drivers in current projects it is Oracle
and there is nothing as to do so on this
is what happens in our current projects
with with pyara and of course what you
will have to do is you have to test the
performance and then the robustness but
this is nothing special with paella so
another question okay
so so this is so Danielle I hope your
your question is answered and this is a
bunch of good questions what are
javabeans enterprise javabeans managed
beans and baking beans okay what is a
basic java bean basically something with
a default constructor I think it's
efficient just with default constructor
usually you would like to have property
accessors so what it means there was old
conventions so that each field is
exposing and get and set up and if you
don't like then the getters and setters
you would have to implement I think
what's called property descriptor which
describes which method manipulates the
internal state so there has this this
you know private string name and get
name and set name is just a javabeans
convention if you don't like convention
you could even change it with java bean
so this is javabeans enterprise
javabeans sadly have nothing to do with
javabeans okay nothing to do that they
had usually they require a default
constructor this is what I have in
common so what the deal with javabeans
with enterprise with ejbs enterprise
javabeans so in my eyes enterprise
javabeans are pojos with default aspects
period so if you put at stateless on a
POJO you get the pojo will get
transactions monitoring security logging
and self-healing for free and sell
feeling is actually also nice feature
and throttling for free so I'm for
instance what we have right now the ejb
accesses a llegar legacy resource and
the legacy resource is not very stable
so it could throw exceptions so in the
case of exception with which to another
node and this happens automatically in
EG be because on each runtime exception
the adobe is going to be destroyed and
if it's going to be recreated it
automatically points to the healthy
resource so this is enterprise javabeans
and managed beans are as a very thing
this simple is one of the simple
specifications in java ee even simpler
than
simpler than servlets so what managed
beans are our or baking beans is almost
the same so managed beans is Peck and
what it basically says is there is
something which is managed by a
container and it has post construct in
prettiest post construct and pre destroy
life cycle methods and it can also have
fields which can be data bound to jsf
but I'm actually not sure whether the
data bonding is a part of managed beans
or GSF but managed beans are usually
tightly coupled to jsf or struts or
frameworks like this or UI frameworks
because managed beans are usually used
as view models and what backing beans is
is actually a viewmodel baking beans is
a managed beans which is used for user
interface' managed beans like more
generic term let's say managed bean
would be a pojo and baking beans would
be lets say a factory which is of course
also a pojo with specific purpose so
they are baking beans are managed beans
yes usually if you would rely on
container services or baking beans are
managed beans if someone mentions baking
beans it becomes automatically clear
someone thinks about having a poacher
with property accessors or java bean and
this poachers the poacher was created
just to uh to expose some state to you I
so does inject work in here if we want
to inject something from jars to our war
it should work I have to admit I didn't
use years for years so I always use war
but it also should work in ear so I hear
from time to time problems with with
with ears and injection my answer is
always you know drop the ears so and
extract everything and put everything on
war and go with this and the third
question is can you use java 7 into a
java vicks applications and kind of so
what i implemented is the project
afterburner and and what it supports is
at inject dependency injection but it
has nothing to do
java 7 I just you know use the same
annotations for implementing the
dependency injection so it looks like
well dependency injection but it is not
so Java 7 and Java Vic's has nothing in
common java VIX is more related to swing
to do as to Java e7 so and now another
afterburner specific question is someone
asked me there is a java fix view with
afterburner FX in DM and so how it
usually works it is like the afterburner
there is a peer peer it is a view
written in Java and the layout is done
in FX ml so usually the view is empty
and he asked how to extend the or how to
extend the view with Java code and not
with F XML and the answer is very simple
just overwrite some methods and I think
the one method is like get view and if
you if you invoke this method you get
the DD view and you can do whatever you
like you can add you know components you
have basically the denote and you can
actually note whatever you like it is
similar like DJ panel in swing so you
could you know at text areas text boxes
whatever like so on and the example it
would be trivial so the example is
trivial so and you will have to override
methods this is the answer so it is
there's nothing as to do in the
framework and I thought about an example
but it's really hard to find an example
were it this is needed so actually from
day one I thought it would be necessary
to implement something in Java and I
don't know a single project who uses
actually does so everyone relies on
ethics ml and by the way the afterburner
fix is far more popular than I ever
expected so it is like took off and and
there's really interesting because
people say okay Java VIX is that no one
uses Java fix and I got lots of
questions regarding Djokovic's
so let's see em probably I could even
let's see what I can quickly swap the
rub spaces here so after burner and this
should be an example to follow me and
the follow me has to have some dashboard
and view and this is how it looks like
this is the view it is backed by ethics
ml and I can say override methods and
there is a method get view and there is
a good view without root container and
you get the note just the base note so
if you override this this is actually
wrong and you have the note here you get
the note here so this was created by F
XML and now you can add whatever you
like get this get notes or get children
something and then you can add the other
nodes to this an extended you note with
the waiver you like and you can hook
into this method okay or even get view
this is what what is what is called out
of the box by the way afterburner what I
implement it because lots of requests
but I cannot test us you will find a new
snapshot of afterburner in the sauna
type it should be you know one week old
and what is implemented it is no more
case sensitive so you can name you know
this a fix ml however overly likes like
lowercase or camel case everything has
to be loaded so in my case on a Mac it
always works but I get some complaints
that like someone named the ethics ml
filed in camel case and afterburner
couldn't find it so I first I try to
improve the error messages and attempted
to make it case insensitive so if you
can please test it and give me a
feedback ok
let's see what happens in chat everyone
is quiet which is a good sign or a bad
sign so the next question what are good
ways to inject the configuration in the
docker image so you can use the same
word document in different steps of
staging or with different configurations
for different customers so we're using
docker right now and we have three
stages and there is no injection in the
indie docker image so what it actually
means is we have one base image with the
application server and from this image
our application image inherits so there
is something like a layer inheritance in
in Dhaka and the application server is
configured in that way that is always
the DN name of the application is
exposed to the application the same way
so you don't have to change anything in
the war and what you sometimes have to
have you have to change the applications
of a configuration so it points to
different two different two different
data sources and what you can do what
what were to do this usually in within
at the build time of the image so you
can add additional statements usual
usually they are no one to three
statements like you know a data source
at GMS or change the data source and
increase the heap size if you you need
in production or heap size then in then
in integration if you if you're thinking
in larger scale it might be a good idea
to provide a configuration service which
pulls the configuration from a central
area and there are already ready to use
solutions for this but it will out
immediately think on a restful web
service which goes to a database and and
and and and and gives back properties
which you can easily inject for instance
and or usually what you will do as small
as small not dsl but yeah a script
nastran scream for instance which
changes the application server
configuration
but if my very first attempt would be
you know don't change anything configure
the application server and don't change
their war at all so the war has to
remain the same so there's no discussion
discussion about this also the data
source names all the resources the
naming has to be the same what only
changes is the administration of
duplications of though what it means is
the configuration where the data source
or the cube points to so what can change
IP address or port number but nothing
else one of the last official questions
I have some more questions on my on my
blog how would you annotate a JP a
one-to-many relationship with lazy
loading for jack's b and this is a
little bit contradicting because Jack's
p requires eager loading and one too
many per default is lazy loading so if
you are using 12 menu without anything
in jax p you get like lazy loading from
JP a which is immediately loaded by
jack's be in this particular case out
got eager loading i would rather go the
eager loading route because then all the
depending entities would be loaded once
and then expose via jacks p so um i
think that it does not make any sense to
to do to load something lazy first and a
milliseconds later eagerly loaded with
Jack's p and expose it to clients having
said this in more sophisticated projects
i always tend to use Jason P and this is
my ultimate layer for all right dto
layer and this is the last official
question but what I gathered some
questions from from my block block
comments and this is one I mentioned in
earlier shows that you don't need
clustering with eg bees and some Danny
asked me in the indie block comment
there is an older comment why no need
clustering so this is actually the the
the questions the question about this
where it's actually my yeah and so I'm
it is hard to explain but very easy to
draw and I will try to draw the solution
here so the egb clustering how it works
back then it worked that way so we had a
class and this is and we had a remote
interface and the remote interface was
implemented by so-called smart stops and
the smart stops were smart because they
pulled the IP definition from
application servers on jboss the name
was class the view back then there were
different application servers or one
application server another application
server so beautiful service here and
this is the implementation so and the
smart stops new were the implementation
living so we have one it should be here
and wanted to be here so I'm they you
could implement here you could you could
specify an algorithm usually in
proprietary diploma descriptor and say
you know take this one run Robin and
this one or the best one was random and
usually such eg bees will directly
access by swing or some crazy
applications decided to put everything
from here to a UI layer which run on
different application server and the
hope was to increase scalability what
you usually never happened but this was
actually the idea back then so why it
doesn't matter anymore because i would
say using using ejbs is an anti-pattern
so what do you what you should use
instead is a locally interfaces so what
it actually means you have 1 GB which is
local and one and this is directly
injected to let's say we have it all
ready to a backing bean right
or a jax-rs resource which is exposed
via HTTP but because this is a local
communication in protest there are no
more smart stops involved and normal
clustering so the egb clustering is
pointless if the whole transaction is
executed within the same process within
the same jvm so this egb clustering
makes only sense if you would distribute
one call among JVMs and processes which
is a really bad idea actually doing this
so um this is the the reason why I
mentioned several times you know don't
use clustering Andy jeebies it doesn't
make any sense anymore yeah hope it is
clear so question is there is a good
alternative to GSF session scoped
actually session scoping GSF is
duplicated the only way is to see the I
session scoped or I don't know how to
interpret the question you could use a
view scoped for instance as well okay
and I was interesting why did you stop
using apache gems in a service so what
James is this a Java patch email
enterprise server i use it for on my
mailing system even five years ago I
think what I also had I had a my own dns
service and I extended the James a lot
with so-called mallets it was like an
applet and what I mail it was is yeah
you could is reckon James plug-in and
what I implemented and the different
spam prevention systems whatever and it
was a fun but and in one point of time I
didn't learn anything new so I decided
to to go to just to drop James and use
an external provider and yet this is why
did and also the EDD bend which was the
problem because of bouncing males and
one point it was really heavy so um yeah
bandwidth
maintenance and reliability i would say
because everything run on one machine
and if the machine went down you know
everything was down yeah this is the
main reason but I used James I think 10
years or something so I had to really
fun with James so and i still use James
oh this is actually if you have you know
to test for instance a mailing service
so what you can perfectly do you can
install James as you as your maid
service set up James and send image to
James and then you can pull your mails
from James and test the whole
application which is really hard without
James so back then we also evaluate it
there were the typical linux linux may
service but they are really hard to to
set up and james was real easy so I'm
what Tony Destin says so I would just
have to look at the dnd at the comment
and he says I don't like exposing my
domain via rest and under reason is
because the domain contains delay out of
the data and if you if you exposes it
violates the encapsulation and if you
have more than a couple of plans you
will be you will never able to change
your domain again yes so now my answer
to this sentence is the following
violating in capsule encapsulation so I
would say I don't care about us but the
consequence he's absolutely right so
what what he says is if you have more
than a couple of clients which is
absolutely right so I would say if you
cannot control or if you don't know who
uses your API you not only cannot expose
the domain object objects what usually
means it is a bad idea to go types of
route because if you even introduce d
TOS you cannot change the dt OS for one
client because it will break all other
clients and instead always put a dto
layer so I'm I'm
not I'm not agreeing with the always
because always is always prismatic a DT
or layer in front of the domain I would
say if you have multiple clients it
might be a good idea and I wouldn't
suggest to use dto for the purpose what
I for instance use I use Jason P so the
Jason Jason objects and Jason race and
this is a built-in dto without
implementing a dedicated layer and
always put a dt earlier in front of the
domain is a really very bad idea so I
performed several code reviews this year
and what I have to say in eighty percent
of all projects dto O's whir whir whir
nearly identical two entities and they
caused lots of code duplication without
any additional benefit and the detail
should be modeled on exactly what the
client wants and the question is you
know why the client needs something
different than the database and the
answers again if you have couple of
clients so I would say if you are
building an internet scale service and
you're exposing to multiple different
applications first it you you have to
invest a lot in in backward
compatibility and this is really hard to
achieve with type-safe objects so it
might be a good idea not only to
introduce an anti-corruption layer it
could be even better idea to use
something like Jason which is not
type-safe ands or more flexible but
requires more testing I hope now is
crystal clear and everyone agreed
hopefully so and the very last one he
asked me what your thoughts on TDD I
have never seen your comments about this
topic and the green book is this one he
likes the green book so um test driven
development so if let's assume we take
it seriously TDD and let's yeah let's
assume we take TDD so we have test
driven development we had a contract
first development we have multiple
driven developments my point being is
you know how much developments would you
like to have right you cannot be test
driven contract first and whatever you
could be but
I would say so I delivered a talk it was
like I think it was it was like just do
it or I just forgot the name I just just
made up a name it was something like
driven development and I would just say
okay if you just you know test if
something is copies and tested but don't
test getters and setters and knowing be
very dogmatic like always write the test
first it it's virtually rarely in
practice so I would say test driven
development for specific specific parts
of the application like the rest service
it's a very good thing because you are
forced to look out on the specification
from the outside on the API from the
outside you know using test-driven
development and pair programming and
contract first for everything I would
say is a huge waste of time but I never
saw this in reality so I'm if I perform
a code review for a project or broken up
projects you know the developer suspect
me to be another TDD protagonist which
i'm really not because i say okay here
you should write here test here at S&amp;amp;T a
test because i'm believing that you've
write a proper test you really will save
time but if you write test first for
everything in very dogmatics way you
won't save the time and you will
probably spend a lot of lots of time on
testings things which are not not
relevant so I don't like any dogmatic
processes and whatever driven is always
suspicious to me okay I think we were
actually incredibly fast I would just
take a look on on the chat and take a
load on Twitter and there is
no questions Oh the last thing someone
asked me about the diva me occurs here
so the effective Java EE and it works
well I got lots of comments he actually
lots of interactions so it is a really
interesting feedback from from the users
and it was bought from 36 countries
which is amazing i never thought about
this lots people from Africa which which
is crazy so that Java is so popular so
which I really like and I mean right now
already recording some another course
which is good related to the first one
so I'm thank you for buying this and and
thank you especially for there for the
comments and if you don't like online
courses come to Munich otherwise see you
at javaone and probably we can after the
birds of feather session just come to me
and ask questions whatever say hello I
would really appreciate this as we spend
the whole week a job one will attend as
many sessions is only possible and yeah
and it will record or so a show and try
to publish the show a Java one session
after Jeff one so it will be almost a
part of the regular a hex workshops so I
thank you for watching and see you a
Java one and then as always next month
first monday of the month thank you for
watching and bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
