flex layout so first I would like to
introduce some markup and I would like
to have the main tag and some content
and also navigation so content and let's
say it is a link so we have both content
and link and what I will also like to do
is to introduce some colors and I would
like to use for the enough a let's say
light blue and for the article a
different color light coral so now for
both I would like to both are enclosing
the main so I can use the main as a
container so I can set layout on the
container and say this is going to be d
flex layout so now continue link flex
layout now what I would like to do is
let's say for for 800 pixel there should
be a different layout or or less than
800 pixel let's assume you would like to
change the layout so how to do that so I
would like to do this with media query
so I can say media media screen and mean
width equals 800 pixel so and what this
mean here it means everything which is
more than 800 pixel this will apply and
what I would like to do is in this
particular case I would like to say flex
direction and if it is wider than it had
an pixel it should remain the same but
the link should come first in any
content so what I would like to do is
column reverse so I would like the
column reverse so if this is larger than
800 pixel now a column row reverse not
row row reverse now we see the first
Dylan comes and the content so I would
like to meet a little bit larger so
enough and article flex grow grow one
so both should grow and is we have 50/50
percent okay and now the opposite is so
if I make it
I need another media query and this is
max width and this should be column so
now if I make it smaller so it now
telling comes last and the content first
is a mobile like design and then make it
larger and you see now the difference of
course what I could do I can say the
height is full and and now it looks a
little bit nicer so now we have it
changes this layout adapts to the device
side so um thank you for watching and
see you an upcoming conferences here hex
Munich or in exile thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
