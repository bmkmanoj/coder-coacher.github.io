welcome to the third test addition of a
hex TV so to a half years ovx and let's
start with the very first announcement
and it was due to d tweet from hendrick
ibis and what happened is I'm I have the
so I initiated the docklands project
it's a github project at it comprises
docker images i use regulary in my
project so it's the base off would
actually started on my server so my blog
everything run on docker and then i
extracted the images or simplified them
and this was the idea to the project and
but it was just the deed aquifers and
build scripts and what i did in addition
and I pushed them as I created an ax
organization on half.com and what it
basically means is you can just run all
the images without building them so they
are going to be pulled from the central
dhaka registry and central dr registry
what it basically means is comparable
with with maven central for instance so
you can just run and without without
building them actually i'm using this by
myself is really convenient so this is a
significant or just insignificant
announcement so depending whether you
are using doc and and the docklands
images or not okay and then to our
significant news and the first
significant news is lightning fast java
8 and java 9 releases so what happened
is there is an email from bill shannon
and java is pec users it was almost one
week ago so tuesday last week and and
what happens is the oracle is
reevaluating the scope and plans for
java ee eight which is interesting and
it says we believe we need to do more to
java e to make it better suited for
developing
the next generation of cloud and micro
service application so what it sounds
like like Oracle would like to to push
even more or even more to push more java
java 8 in java 9 as you probably know
aware of so we had we cover the several
times and nothing happens in the last we
last year nothing almost nothing
happened in on the jsr and JCP lists and
now something happens shortly before
java java one conference in san
francisco the current generation of
enterprise java application is already
well supported by java 7 which is
absolutely true and in cloud services
yes i also evaluated them and will
probably write a short blog posts about
this and a needle GAO said it in his
recent presentation at JCP the following
and so what what he would like to see is
HTTP to which is very important support
from servlets for instance would be
interesting configuration which is
important but not as important htb to
state management eventual consistency so
I'm really curious how this can be
supported by a Java EE and eight and
nine I i think is like we get something
like properly based transaction so basic
availability soft state eventual
consistency and multi-tenancy okay this
was also an issue of or this was a goal
of java 7 but it was cancelled well open
ID connect and so far so this is also in
a significant of an open ID to be
supported by java and there's another
communities serve a similar to the sobe
we did in 2014 so after three years we
get another survey and and so i will
watch and probably blog about this so
please participate in the service so
they are significant and discussion with
java licensees so this is actual
interest we also be looking at the
results of other service and community
input and we'll be continuing our
discussion with java ee licensees so
what i still dont not get
it's the following so it seems like
there are some IP issues also with JCP
so I heard it over and over again which
I will trade don't get so what how
usually JCP works is the following if
Oracle would be inactive someone else
could could could escalate this and say
okay look this jess r is inactive and
could take it over so I guess Oracle
could I don't know could postpone the
process but in one point of time someone
else could take over the JCP or jsr no
no the JCP the GSR but what I heard
multiple times not that easy because
there are IP issues but still even if
there are IP issues someone else could
just initiate in all Egypt before or CDI
five or whatever so I'm not pretty sure
how this works internally how many
political involved so from from the
formal point of your JCP point of view
it should be possible to take over and
in active inactive jsr so i'm not sure
what it means java licensing is whether
there are the licenses which are sold by
oracle 2d to third party or whether
other IP is meant here and watch have
one so something happens there and and
now it becomes even more interesting
with a goal of delivering Java age
within a year this would be great like
you know one year nothing happens and
then we get to know triple speed in one
year so I'm really curious about this
and this can actually happen why so
Billy Shannon and all the others java ee
spec leads are really great people with
lots of knowledge and they really
delivered nice just ours in the past so
i think is absolutely possible that the
dayquil derivative or there they were
pushed forward DJ's are specs what I
also assume that bull Shannon all the
others were not on vacations for one
year rather than they develop at some
proprietary frameworks or whatever so
now what I could do is just to know that
to extract the the ideas from whatever
edit and and the
should do to a standard with of course
involving redhead IBM and the others so
much of the initially planned work is
nearly complete those interesting and
and then we see also they're also
planning Java in nine so if it's if it's
true so we get java 8 very soon and then
Java is javi 9 is in the making switches
which are actually great news and why
it's significant because there is java
SE 9 chicks or module system and this
will have significant impact on the GS
ours so i would say great news there are
also some some articles so check them
out if you like and yeah this is what
happened so it was surprising surprising
official emails you can just drag the
email is nothing you know hidden or
private she'll just yeah check it out
and now no future of java is even
brighter and then was before as I
already said multiple times I'm not so
concerned about future of Java because
even if java 8 could will come later
let's say we will have to wait two years
for java 8 my clients or most of the
projects i would say most of project we
are doing are really innovative already
happy with it i think the only issue is
if you would get HTTP to support so this
is the most important thing to have HTTP
to support is really soon because it
will also change how html5 applications
are built okay so we already have it
covered two things so let's see what
what what happens here no questions from
the chat so now switch to the official
just so we just reloaded because i get
some last-minute questions like the last
one here two hours ago so last hours a
question okay now the first one do you
use the GMS provided content in
deprecation serve or do you use a
separate GMS server application so first
i always use this which is delivered by
the application server so i never try to
replace it with something else because
of support issues and
and and maintainability in micro service
environment it's a little bit more
complicated because the GMs server has
to run somewhere so and if you would
like to live or if you would deliver or
each microservice with an owen GMS
server it is going really hard to to
communicate between micro services
because you need something you know in
common in this particular case you could
launch a central GMS server somewhere
let's say in a docker container but then
it is really this would be a single
point of failure so GMS is not as easy
to scale have you may think because at
the end of the day each queue and each
topic are actually Singleton's so there
is that there has to be and then way to
replicate them so there is usually a
proprietary way to replicate them but
this comes with some some problems of
course because if you have a singleton
is a single point of failure if you
would share a queue it is 102 to keep
the queue consistent sore arm so it is
the cap theorem over and over again how
to use MDB to listen to mqp 10 qmq PS
and is in standard and what you will
need an application server which
supports mqp and our GMS server which
supports amqp and then is this fully
transparent and for instance i forgot
what is the whitefly amqp i think amqp
it already comes with amqp so what you
have to know is the JMS itself is just
set of interfaces there is nothing about
the protocol specified in java ee so
most of the application servers come
with with multiple protocols so what a
white-collar job was is able to do you
can even use a no in-memory message
passing and without any external
protocol it was called i think in the
past JVM IL Java Virtual Machine
invocation layer and white light comes
with amqp
is that there should be somewhere a
protocol so there is some amqp and coop
remote client and and what you will have
to do is you will have to configure the
GMs server to support to run as or to
expose the cues as sm QP and then you
can just just map message to them beans
to a regular eq so what it means there
is no changes in the in source code and
you will have to reconfigure the
application servers so there's nothing
to change in the source code you don't
have to recompile the applications what
you will have to do is to map your
message driven be to message driven beam
to a queue which points to a which
reduces amqp for community of
communication actually in the past we
use the same the same approach to
communicate or with with the legacy host
or with house mainframes and we use the
MQ serious protocol for this for
instance ok so we cover the first one
and no questions from the chat no
questions from the Twitter m where do
you keep the environment specific
configuration URL credentials to access
external system so first we if I use
docker throughout there there there are
multiple possibilities to do this for
instance currently I'm using multiple
microservices in Java microservices
which communicate with each other and
all the URLs are hard-coded so they so
and if you're hot code are already hosts
sorry the hosts are hard-coded so the
URL should not change what usually
changes the horse than the port number
and how it works in my case or the host
is hard-coded and but it is the name of
the container and if all the micro
services are running in the same token
network
dhaka will resolve the hard-coded name
for you so this is what how we usually
deal with URL there is one problem with
resources which are not authorized like
for instance databases so in this
particular case you can still hard code
the name of the of the external resource
and there is a andhaka a thing is called
hot I'm Dhaka and host if you run if you
run the the docker service you can run
with the ad host sir was there is at
host exactly minus my nose at host and
what happens then is it will it will
manipulate this ET SI host for you so
let's say we have a Oracle integration
database oracle dot integration then you
can launch the docker content and say
minus minus minus minus at host Oracle
dot dot integration and the IP address
and then if you launch the docker
containers multiple times each instance
of the running docker container will
point to different resource and and the
other so let's say it was not fully
answered the question were just close
the gist so okay and then it says but
the nddd the question is simpler then
they mentioned the database seems to be
the simplest solution but what if you
don't do not have the database so ah get
up I think it was JC to just a small
tiny project called je cache
configurator for Java 7 and what is able
to do it could fetch the configuration
from je cache and injected so make
injectables there are just a few classes
and could use environment entries or JC
to so there are there are multiple
possibilities to do this and you see how
it actually works you can say cash put
that return the cash and then it makes
injectable and so this is the D
headlands let's see JC to and had lens
and there was another one let's see here
the marina project and what the marina
goes a step further what is able to do
it could just inject you the cash
entries from a remote hazel cast hosts
you can say at cache entry house
headlands pot cache key and it will
inject you the value here so this disco
step further and it is not without any
involvement of the database and of
course instead of using you can just
clone the projects and not used to know
a jay cash or headlands which is which
this X is actually headlands via remote
REST API so it could be a remote service
you can build the same to use for
instance etcd for the configuration so
you don't have to use the two to user
database so etcd is something like a
distributed no sequel database for
configuration purposes okay so i hope we
covered this i wouldn't use Jan di
naming bindings why because usually you
will have to know to start as singleton
and put something to Jane di and then X
isn't from JD I and it's not as flexible
and you will also have to convert to
modify the configuration from
application server but what is the point
of modifying the the configuration of
the application server if you get it
very easily with daca and by the way JC
JC to and and
and the JC to and marina you don't have
to to restart the application you you
can just did they will always inject the
fresh value if you don't like the cash
or if you like to cash it it will of
course inject the string ones or integer
once and then never again never again so
how do you suggest to stress this web
sockets endpoints so another project in
github I call that hands o cuts this is
a simplistic one by I use this once and
and what it actually is a java a7
application where you can deploy on the
server it uses the concurrency api and
then is able to to to to generate lots
of messages and you can you can
communicate with the hazards orchids via
rest and if you are interested in what
we spoke about the configuration and of
microservices there is a java ee
microservices workshop so i actually
explain how to configure dhoka dhoka
application in this in this workshop i
think is called so configuration there
should be another one this one and
service configuration was environment
entries within memory grits and remote
configuration via Jack's arrest is what
I would I would I explained right now so
this is a 15 minutes videos and java ee
testing it's the another one and in here
are also test or performance tests
WebSockets ok so this you can just look
at the hyda gogit project and of course
modify if you like I whatever I do is
Apache License so it should work out of
the box or for you to do works out of
the box it should be also commercially
commercially usable out of the box is
what I meant whether it works or not has
nothing to lose the license ok using
geometer with web socket extension
a little bit cumbersome but yeah you
could do this and Autobahn test suite is
actually a nice tool I never use that in
production but it looks promising we
just open that so it is like Autobahn
framework looks nice never tested in
production so it looks it looks really
interesting and what about implement
implementing assume our little server
with a WebSocket client inside the doget
method then using apache benchmark to
metric this servlet absolutely so I did
something something similar for jax-rs
recently so so I created to get method
to which we done access by Apache
benchmark so this is this is my default
way to do tests to stress this
application which is not exposed
directly by API so you can you could
absolutely do this but this is very
similar to the 2d ahead look at an
approach but he'll socket is not
accessed directly it actually translates
rest calls to WebSocket calls so with
jdk do you use to build docklands not
documents with doctored images and what
he mentions here is absolutely right so
what actually happened is I use nice
form for automation unlocked but this
exit command from mass horn it caches
the results so what it actually means if
I launched a script using nice one it
will cache the string internally and
after the execution I will see the whole
output at once so if I would build
docklands with the standard nice one
let's say the build will take the docket
build would take one minute the first
time because it has to pull to fetch the
resources from the internet so i will
have to wait one minute after without
any any any output and then see
everything at once and what I got is a
secret char from the JDK team and this
secret jar doesn't does not catch that
and it just i use SE interactively the
output and this is what i'm using it
will it will come to standard jdk in one
point of time not yet but what did you
uses instead it just uses a threat and
it just pushes the output in real time
2d 2d terminal so i will probably have
to change that but now it is not as
relevant why not because we have
everything in docker hub so you you you
don't have to build the drop lines
images of and over again so another
great one can you please explain or give
an example how to use concurrent contact
service so i'm i try to use it several
times but it was without any effect we
have to say it worked as well as without
the context service the idea is very
similar to contain how it's called
container resource i think jax-rs jax-rs
contain resource context so what
resource context in jax-rs is you can
pass a class a sub resource to the
method in it if you have the instance
and it will inject all the jacks or a
specific stuff into it if you if you
need this and the contact service is
similar but the problem is if you have
an instance of a class in Java II with
new and you pass it to the 2d managed
managed executor service and there is
nothing you know valuable from the from
the managed executive service to to
associate with so it was not for my
purposes it was not valuable for my
purposes what you usually would expect
is that if suddenly the dependency
injection will work but this is not the
job of concurrency management rather
than from CDI so I have to admit I never
used the contact service I we had once a
problem with CDI and context but we it
was the contact service didn't had us a
lot it was just the same effect using it
or not it was just no up in my case but
could be a server back
so I'm no project experience with
contact service i have to admit okay
another good one oh I would just look at
d hi Greece is back and the details are
coming now someone from Greece nice so
and this question is about using dto
this is a nice one because usually you
know I hear details data transfer object
and and is ok what about encapsulation
no they kept see a decoupling and this
one is not about decoupling rather than
encapsulation and the idea is ok if I
would expose entities one to one then a
permis take I could expose more more
than I like and I will see this for
instance i will see ella no secret user
ID or DNA of the user or fingerprint or
whatever which was not supposed to be
deserialized or exposed via remote
interface so what you could do you could
annotate the model with something Jason
provider whatever Jason ignore or just
XML transient so you don't have to use
the providers just use a no start
standard Chuck's p xml transient i did
it several times if you go to my youtube
channel you will see this already so um
or somewhere you will see this because
this is was back then one of my favorite
you know features to hack on stage i
will just use a POJO annotated with Jax
p and you will see a JSON and XML output
at the same time um okay and what I
usually do so actually it won't happen
for me to me easily because usually what
happens i developed a system test first
it's like a unit test which accesses a
remote interface and and then i see now
what comes over the wire first and why
I'm doing this because of productivity
so I would like to to be able to test
the API without
deployment so without my system test I
will have to do to implement another
service first then access the remote
service and hope it will work out of the
box so the next one create details the
only contain a subset of fields you want
to see in your boundary and this is in
my eyes absolutely okay the point is a
subset so what I see in projects is one
to one but if the entity has I would say
20 attributes and your dt OS has only
five perfect then convention or the
configuration does not work anymore
because you will have to use a note on
each field of the entity and at XML
annotation just to just to say please
don't serialize me so then dto makes
perfect sense and this is actually a
best practice but if you have a no 20
attributes in the entity and you would
like you know to hide one I before I
would introduce a dto I would just I
would just annotate the one filled with
at XML transient so XML transient
javadoc this is what I'm searching for
and xml transient and if you annotate
something with xml transient and you
don't use external provider it will m it
will deserialize the field as json or
xml right out of the box okay and there
is a third thing which i'm using right
now i'm using the JSONP the json object
so I don't have a dto but I'm
serializing indus realizing everything
using the D JSONP java 7 library what i
am using this because on the other on
the on the other side i have reactor
angular 2 right now to start to two
libraries i'm using currently and having
having html5 clients requires you to
have a nice JSON format this is easier
to to use to consume and to debug and
therefore i would like in order to
create to do to hand to her
craft the JSON objects and this Jason P
is the best one so I would say the third
option is Jason P this is my preferred
one if you if you care about the quality
of the API otherwise it is really hard
to have nice Jason objects and nice java
objects at the same time to maintain
both sides at the same time so a good
one I saw that you are going to do some
workshops about angular 2 and react this
is true I did it them actually for a
while so they work the direction to it
for two or three years already so the
lecture was called html5 and in the
html5 application workshop we did
everything and P and a dentist told me
you are crazy you can do this in one day
so and therefore there are upcoming
workshops and the upcoming workshops are
in October is one as we react and the
other one with angular so this is what
this the question refers to recently
some investigation order to understand
which technology to use in our company
and it seems like this two phrases are
all but standard um yeah and for
instance they don't follow the
specification of web component at least
they are not compatible so um I would
say it is not entirely true because what
web components are you can create your
own tanks like for instance html5 tank
and with shadow DOM and all the
specification but what it could do
actually for it is one component is a
google map there is a component or a
google hangout or whatever you could you
know hide entire entire application
become big select map application behind
such a component so i think the web
components are coarse grained then react
or or angular components a react
component could be for instance or is a
row in a table is a react component a
web component would be the whole table
or yeah a whole table would be our
could be a web component sao paulo mia
is like polyfill of framework for for
for web component so it probably feels
the ddd non-existing functionalities or
the problem is web components are not
supported by all browsers and therefore
polymer you know fills the blanks and
this is called polyfill so our le I is
interesting one this is actually really
interesting I I like it the problem is I
wouldn't use it in projects because no
one knows Aurelia but what you have to
know is the the committee of irelia was
also have involved with with angular 1
and 2 and was the angular outer and and
and now he just did world Sam you know
if they had different opinions and and
and then he kept working on or Elias
already Isis I think he's an as old as
angular and ember is a little bit more
extreme I would say so what ember is is
like angular with extreme convention of
a configuration so i would say m vs
passive special case for the in a camper
in a company i think it is a harder to
introduce ember because all the
applicator all the developers will have
you know to follow a really hard path so
all the conventions so what do you think
about so my personal point of view right
now is the following so angular 2 is a
calm I would say I complete framework
with right now a little bit crazy setup
so are usually you have to choose the
language typescript or yeah typescript
is the preferable one and the setup
could you know take easily at least one
day if you do this with the first time
and then it comes you know with it looks
actually angular 2 if you are familiar
with Java EE it really looks like like
java ee there are annotations like
things they're called decorators but
they'll actually look like a regular
connotation so Java developers will be I
would say we would would be productive
in a few days with angular 2 it's
absolutely i think it is not compatible
with angular 1 so um right now i do two
projects in in peril angular 2 and react
so and so now about my opinion so um my
personal opinion is angular 2 is a
little bit over engine yet so I don't
think you need all the stuff in angular
2 22 to write an enterprise application
or whatever application and react from
facebook is a little bit i would say is
a lot simpler so what react just is you
are building text you combine the text
together and and and this basically is
so there is nothing else involved there
is no dependency injection nothing is
justice but to give you an example so my
react app has to communicate with
back-end rest services implemented with
java 7 so and i was actually looked at
the reactor coo and examples and what I
saw there are lots of no libraries which
are using which you are using which
hiding HTTP like we have in Java and
what's okay do I really need the library
so he already know my opinion what if I
implement is out of the box with xhr
this is xml httprequest i did it and
there were five lines of code to access
on external systems okay nice I don't
need any external library so actually
neither my angular 2 nor react have any
external libraries projects and I think
if you if you have to decide between
react in angular 2 I will start with
react first and then see how it goes
because angular 2 there is a lots of
stuff involved dependency injection or
whatever and react is just no down to
the metal what I already thought in the
next project if we have our smaller
projects not to use any external library
just go with the standard JavaScript and
html5 it could be actually viable why
because the access to DOM is it was
greatly simplified and and you don't
need a lot of fancy libraries to be
productive if you are manipulating Dom
there are there are nicer CSS selectors
and yeah but so this is my personal
opinion so I would choose angular 2 or
react the others one has already
suggested earlier and and amber but it
never took off because it is not as
popular at least in Germany or Europe as
angular reactors and react is a smaller
one it is it owes you the shadow Dom so
meanwhile angular 2 also relies on
shadow DOM and the difference is I mean
that there is there is one and an
advantage angular 2 comes with a router
out of the box and react also has a
router but it has to be it is right a
little bit more separated from reacting
then angular 2 is so and ten times more
productive it's hard to say I used
angular 2 and i would say i was really
productive so 10 times is i don't think
it's true m and the web component
standard specification i would say and
do what i did in the workshops i created
some web components from scratch and i
would say this is a lot of to write
actually so i don't think you can
actually just write an application with
just the web components of course you
could it but there's like you know
developing GSP apps with just G stl so
did this would this would be a there's
javis wow it's called Java standard
template library it was on old spec so
you could develop your own tags in gs
piece and this is like more like web
components of course we could you could
do you can say I can develop everything
with Jesse L which I actually saw the
project attempted to do this but this
was in a terrible or terrible it was not
very productive or some projects also so
does in jsf they say okay and everything
is the easy component is e C or custom
components in jsf and this a lot of
of course lots of work and by the way
the custom components ingest ever also
similar to web components so I hope I
explain it somehow so if you like attend
the workshop so we can discuss you know
this in two days is really hard you know
this is yeah so my general impression of
html5 and JavaScript it is exam the same
state which we had in jdk 11 i would say
we got to know 55 new frameworks every
day and the people seems like the DD no
hardcore javascript and html5 developers
really like modularization and
dependencies is like the more you
included a project the better it is so
this is my personal opinion and and then
coming from java ee i have to do the
opposite attitude i would like to know
to be as lean as simple as possible I'm
developing ddd html5 apps okay there was
a longer one and any questions yeah
lisbon portugal hey and xml access type
is used by acceso type to a size of
feeds and properties okay so and what I
wanted of course you can do this I
always use this and if you watch my
examples i use evan ddd bootstrap
workshop what I usually do is the X so
type is always filled in my case okay
have you used MVC or zurich with white
fly is a nice question from art martine
and no i just use it with pi r up it
worked out of the box never tried one
white fly okay so now the next one and
this is a little bit harder so we have
one entity and the entity would like to
access gnd stuff from Jan di so first I
would of course and capsulate the jndi
accessed somehow because and and it
cannot be accessed with a tresor
sanitation just does not work the the
entities do not have any
any possibility to get to have injected
fields with CDI or whatever so in this
case getters and setters are calling
static methods to retrieve the setting
from JD Iser static methods are okay so
this is what I also did several times so
what you can do you can have a static
method of a utility class import static
and then just access the things it rocks
but you need Jay units on service
methods with ether marks are not are not
looking nice of course and what it could
do of course ah what I did in the past I
passed additional information to
entities and I called the pattern
context holder hopefully yes and thread
local context holder and what I did I
how old is it actually Oh seven years so
seven years ago for the context hold up
a pattern and the idea is the following
so what threadlocal isn't represented
transaction in java picture the
transaction usually runs synchronously
and therefore in one threat so you can
store additional data in a transaction
and you can put stuff here like JD I
variables whatever you like and then you
can have there is no more example of
this but what you could do of course you
can have a static utility methods which
exactly this is this one with get where
you can get your your key back so what
you could do is you could use for
instance a interceptor in Java of a
service method the Interceptor runs in
the same context as your service you can
inject with at resource whatever you
would like to have from JD I and this
can be stored in in the thread local and
the entities could to access this from
threadlocal em unit tests is similar the
interceptors actually not active in unit
tests but the unit tests in you could
just before that tells you can write a
rule if you would like to see how how to
implement a rule
check out project rules from me I use
that for for entitymanager
initialization in Java EE and you could
use it to to in order to create a rule
to hold to to keep the jndi stuff
somewhere and then access them so this
is what you could do I hope so and
whatever you do there it does not matter
so it's just you how to access to know
the data first and and how to manipulate
the data it could be actually stored in
in in the static utility methods martin
again do you think is secured to store
anonymous user data for example ID for
the user base against acute cookie in
theory it is as you probably know they
are already some hex where was it we
just closed some so what I found is this
one so exploiting browser cookies to
bypass HTTPS and steal private
information so that there are there were
already problems with browsers they were
patched but still problems and what
security cookies are there are cookies
which are so what cook is our first
cookies as a small amount of information
stored in browser and cookie means a
small amount of informations or cookies
and small so small therefore the name
cookie and so but the secure cookies are
meant to be just transferred via ssl to
the server so the data can be only
accessed by am it's only transferred
from browser to the server via ssl
therefore it's secure but what you
probably know is if you are on
university on any public place what
usually happens the the admins install
ssl certificates and are able to decrypt
the data so you can you you are still
using ssl but the provider the not the
internet provider out the quality yeah
the de proxy is able to do to access the
data and it will be able able to access
the disa cure cookies as well so it
meant to be secured they were already
some hacks involved with the
browsers and of course if you are
environment where someone is able to
decrypt the ssl communication because of
certificates and this is a major this is
very common in larger enterprises then
someone will be able to read your secure
cookie so on what reporting library
would you recommend for java ee app to
generate PDF and i think which in which
a lot of PDFs are generated and it uses
jasperreports which breaks glass fusion
whenever whenever the report gets bulk
is i think he would like to generate a
lot larger documents so and we use
several times this i text but i don't
know how it behaves for large data for
huge data and documents what I we also
use product for generation is this
course called J pedal it's a nice java
library actually also runs in java but
we use it rather tune or we evaluated it
to to extract the data from PDF i'm not
sure whether you can generate the data
but you can contact the guys from IDR a
really nice group of people they usually
attend java one and this was heavily
tested on glass efficient pyara so it
should run on java service without any
problem so I cannot find you know the
conversion so there is an i text is used
in larger projects and of course you can
use fob we use for in the past but it
was always a little bit slower so a
patchy fog is called Apache fip f 0 p
and it is a very old library work great
but if you have a huge documents i don't
know how it will behave so i'm in the
past it so it took a time until it
generated the PDF and I can remember we
had some problems with memory as well so
I would but it's easy to test so
generally no a huge xml and try to
convert it to PDF
okay I would start with FOP and I text
and then probably pick the J pedal guys
okay so the next one and what I find out
is really easy to include tweets so what
I did I just scanned my twitter timeline
and just copied some interesting twists
someone so this is the tweet let's see
why does aj proxxon need a java centos
based image it's hardly called this
Manimal istic so what's that so what
what what he is referring to is the
following so this is the Docklands
project and the H a proxy here this is
what he refers to it is based on my ax
Java image or layer and then proxy so
what it basically means this image only
runs in conjunction with the Java image
and this Java image is based it has sent
to a 7 it uses it installs unzip and
even jdk 18 so you can say you are crazy
so it to run H a proxy you will have to
insert everything but what do you have
to know on my server I don't have in
just H a proxy what I also have is why
try so what it basically means this Java
image is exists only once on my hard
disk in Nevermore and H a proxy and
white fly are sharing the same image so
if I would use alpine lyrics for
instance and the end of the day I will
need more hard disk-based and just using
centralized 744 for everything why i am
using sent os7 because most of my
clients are using sent to a 7 or in view
cases souza enterprise linux i know that
ubuntu is also crazy popular on server
but not in my projects and my projects
sent to us and aunt Susie they just
dominate and therefore docklands is
fully based on CentOS 7 and it's fully
based on inheritance so what it means
the Derby and
and everything else everyone else here
or everything else inherits from Java
even with multiple levels for instance
the payara image where is it just pyara
plain pyara here inherits from java and
pyara configured inherits from pyara and
pyara pink inherits from configured why
does because the java is only built once
pyara is gets only builds in case there
is a new PR release pyara pyara
configured is the project specific
configuration like for instance queues
and memories memories and heaps heaps
sizes and this is only rebuild in case
this changes in my projects and pyara
pink always changes so whenever we get a
new war it changes ok so the answer is
Christoph is right you could deliver
alpine Linux and then you will save few
hundred megabytes of hard disk space but
no one company one cares about how the
space usually if there's just a few
megabytes once and if you are based
everything on the same image like Java
sent to us then it is really
minimalistic because this image only
exists one so everything like it is on
my service so um there is an uncomment
from my block and he would like to see
the he would he said ok observe and
observable are in the same war when I
when I put the observer been separated
gb modules the observer in war modules
the observer was notified this is true
so the CDI events only work in in in the
same CDI module which is always the case
in my projects I always have worse
usually without any internal jars it's
just war and there was no name for this
now we can safely call it a thin war or
micro service of course so using JUnit
based system tests in Jamie to do basics
mode tests on performance this is what I
actually did he refers to the
java testing course and yeah this is
what I do for basic smoke tests i use
apache benchmark a B or just jmeter and
to create a massive massive load quickly
on my application and and see how it
behaves so see how would how it behaves
means i use usually java mission control
access the remote service and see what
happens behind the scenes okay there are
some one so just ask me hi Adam do you
think the micro proper can became a new
official profile for java service
possibly this is one of the goal the
problem of it is now oracle woke up and
now they are active so what can happen
ah so they're actually already announced
that they would like to participate the
micro profile but I personally always
use the full profile so Java 7 full why
because of Dhaka and there is no
overhead whatever so it's the startup is
very quick there is no actually measured
it several times on my youtube channel
because people usually don't believe me
they try not to to optimize the
application servers and in that end of
the day you will save an 01 make of ram
and no one cares about this so I'm
possibly it would be nice to have but
first it I may I should it should track
should should should gather some some
traction from the community and then see
whether it can be standardized so what
the the hood what Josh refers to is
micro profile I oh this is that and this
is we already covered it in at the X it
is like what's the guys right hat Tommy
tribe and pyara say okay look we can
define a micro profile with some
additional functional requirements and
then yeah six years six years six weeks
later Oracle said okay we would like to
push Java 8 as well could be a
coincident or or not who knows okay
okay and I get some from hunts ask me
about my opinion to my fear it's it it
is a former redheads employee who quit
redhead and now works for a light band
the company which was called type safe
and just focused on Scala and and
recently they also use Java and then he
he had he wrote a presentation about
nine nines against java ee microservices
i have still no time it was already i
was asked the last time to to look at
your his presentation but i think all
his nines are probably right the
question is you know if you if you look
on on java e from let's say ik
academical perspective i would say it is
not really nice why not so we have still
koruba there J&amp;amp;E I lots of things can be
standardized and if you would you know
study all the api's is he okay we don't
need fifty percent of T of the api's you
know to be to be productive but byte
code is small and you don't have to use
everything which comes with Joey it's
the same strew like you don't have to
use everything which comes with angular
2 and in my eyes it is far more
productive and easy to use if I get
everything at once like javi I would
prefer this over you know using java ee
micro profile let's see with three api's
and then in each project configure my
own server this is what I did before
java and really liked it once and then
hated it because it was really pitiful
work over and over again and right now i
just say oh I who strike as new Micra I
would like to start a new micro service
which is based on full profile and
probably I only need forty percent of
this but there is there is no real
impact neither my performance no size or
whatever so um I don't know what he's
criticizing here what I can tell you is
my clients don't care about java at all
so they could say i could do whatever
like microservice we could use an OG as
java ee or whatever but they're usually
surprised how productive we actually are
with java ee and productivity for me is
king I don't know whether he refers to
productivity here or not but if you
would I don't think anything else can be
as productive as productive cannot be
significantly more productive than Java
in standard enterprise project okay so
and the Christoph there was a nice
interesting tweet I'm sure Kabul
advocates advic Kabul advocates find
their happy client just as fine he said
ok Java is the new COBOL and this is
similar of course we could use I don't
know instead of Java 8 we could use of
closure with groovy and reactive
programming but the question is first
how many developers will understand the
mix this is really more understandable
to an average developer then the mix of
the the most shiny libraries on earth
and my my personal opinion is I would
stick with a simple Java technology as
long as possible and if I would like to
do something funky I would choose
something completely different which
does not even run on JVM like for
instance Swift or go or whatever but you
know yeah this is this is my opinion but
we never had to do this in project but
this is what I would do instead of I now
search for new possibilities on JVM
because Java EE or what ever became too
boring for me does like a visit to
boring Justin no forget java and do
something else okay and my answer was we
migrated from Kabul to java ee several
x and the clients were happier after the
migration so you can follow this also on
this is a tweet so extremely interesting
from from from from mr. Hogan what is
the current state of ESP so in my
projects they were removed if we had the
power to remove them why because they
serve no real purpose this was my
observation that there was no additional
value in the esps like they were
prescribed by an architect but no one
could explain why they are there and
will it will it or something like this
become part of Java it actually there
were already there was an attempt to
standardize the ESB i forgot the spec it
was like the business connectors it was
ten years ago and it was like business
connectors pack or something like this
never took off it seems like the
popularity of soya okay SOA in my eyes
is not popular at all so actually in
some projects if you mentioned SOA as a
consultant you get you are in in danger
with in a contract danger i would say
microservices yes they are very very
popular but also exaggerated this is my
impression so avoid area in the
architectures a lot of companies
absolutely true companies end up with
very large collection of services yes
because architects exaggerated so i
don't know where they remembers maven
was introduced i was in some projects
where developer developed in shortest
amount of time several hundred maven
modules in the hope they will replace
something in one day this we had the
same story with osgi and eclipse RCP
everything had to be a plugin because to
be reusable and i don't i don't know how
often it was actually there were some
valid cases for for plugins but all
projects try to find something pluggable
so in in my projects what we do is we
have one micro servers per team or
obvious part of an application
so we get at most i would say five yeah
at most 5 25 microservices per app and
then you have already five teams
involved so it is Nev access if you have
more than this you will have to justify
why you have so many services and seems
to create a lots of redundant
configuration it was Dhaka is not that
bad i would say and this it makes a lot
more difficult for developers to compare
different parts of the system absolutely
but with microservices done right do not
require you to do this microservices
done right would mean that one team have
only would look at one part of the of
the app and this happens to be micro
service and it and it communicates via
via business api or or Jack Suarez
interfaces to do a different
microservices so in current react
projects what what we decided to do is
that there are several parts of the
application and each part of the
application becomes a micro service so
it will be easier to maintain to replace
to version them and to find external
companies who will care about or
designers or whatever to care about part
of the system I don't think an ESB I
will help and it is actually if you
think about this web or rest is already
an ESB because ESB was crucial for soap
because what ESB did is it gathered all
the fine-grained messages and created a
course I'm message and this is not
necessary for jax-rs api because it
could be DD it could also contain links
which are lazily resolved or lazily
loaded nice let's see what happened here
would you consider to use secure cookies
to avoid session if i have problem with
session yes if there are no problems in
session why to change something so uh so
i would just use
no and I mean why you would like to get
rid of the session you know I know I
know some architects don't like sessions
but I didn't ask them you know what's
the problem and they cannot explain
survey with memory with the kind of
scale and if we have sticky sessions for
instance in the old balance and suppose
does it it would work okay so i think we
are done i would say see you see you
next time or next month at age of one
actually next next month is September
and I'm delivering 11 session in Java
one about microservices only one did
this time I try to avoid you know what I
did did last year's we just delivered
several sessions and and couldn't
participate in the conference actually
as a listener and I will I would be on
their short period of time at javaone so
if you see my java one feel free to come
to me pink me and now we can drink a
coffee but I will only spend three days
to chof one next year longer this year
java java one is earlier and the problem
is i have too many concurrent projects
going on right now so thank you for
watching see an upcoming conferences
javaone workshops a hex in munich or the
online workshops or even projects so I'm
more in morning projects and yeah we can
properly develop and heck something
together so thank you and bye
