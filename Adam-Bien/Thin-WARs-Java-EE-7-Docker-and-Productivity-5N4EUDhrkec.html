would like to explain you why Java and
thin or small Wars in particular a very
good for productivity so in smaller the
war the faster the deployment and
particularly in micro service and like
environment like for instance docker
so to demonstrate you this I would like
to introduce you my server by how to
actually wear my block is running so
what I'm actually doing is I have one
base image and this base image comprises
just the basic Java installation and
what I also do I just deploy a pink war
if you are curious about pink just go to
github but what pink does the pink is
like basic monitoring stuff so and I add
JDK I said to Java home so this is the
basic setup and this image only changes
in case the operating system changes or
in case I would like to deploy a new
Java version or would like to change the
password and the next image is the
application server image so and this in
my case right now
it's a white fried h2 and what this
image does it just setups Wi-Fi so and
as you can see this image relies on base
Java server image so I only have to
build the white fly image to in case I
introduced a new white version and
finally today I created an image which
is simulates an application image it
inherits from a bean white fly and I'm
adding a pink and I have one wor hex
which is going to be contained in the
image and this is basically what I do
with with my blocks and the other
project as well the point is in case I'm
a diversion of the application changes
or I would like to redeploy the
application I only have to build this
image and what the hex war is is this
very simple application to demonstrate
you this so just comprises hello
resource
hello thin and jax-rs configuration it
actually does not matter in our case and
what I also did I defied the Maven World
plugin so if I
built the application it will place the
war in my in my dacha image so what I
can do right now is I can build the
application as you can see it takes
around one second so I can do it again
so then I switch to to the dacha and as
you can see I will measure the image
size and it's tiny so usual all my wars
a tiny because they only contain
business logic and all the
infrastructure persistence or whatever
is actually on the application server so
now if I build the image on Daka so it
takes not even one second so in total
the image was built in around two
seconds so each 2 seconds I could deploy
a new version in production on Dhaka in
microservice architecture and so what I
did just to show you the difference I
will copy the JDK to source main web app
this wait a second I will just have to
to copy a JDK which is around two
hundred Meg's
and now I will build it with maven so
what happens right now if we go to net
means we have JDK 8 I just copied to web
app to demonstrate you to emulate you
know some additional dependencies and so
if I build it with maven maiden as you
can see just building to take
significantly longer it takes about 10
seconds or nine seconds so I'll do it
again
so 9 seconds so if we switch here and LS
- LH you see the hex is 200 max which is
actually a realistic size for a work
containing the application server or
whatever fetch our technology are using
so um so so the point is now I spent 8
seconds more just you know - for zipping
and now the interesting part I go to to
Dhaka and I build a dock image as you
can see the image has to be uploaded
first and it takes about I would say 4
seconds so what it actually mean is I
lose about 12 seconds for 200 Max in war
so and I do it several times a year here
a day I would say about 20 to 30 times a
day so for me Java EE is the fastest
deployment of Dhaka and if you don't
bundle the application server all over
again which is actually crazy because
this image never changes you can you can
have a significant productivity gains
just you know for for for faster life
cycles so I thank you for watching and
see you at Medicare put a hex workshops
particularly microservices and of course
conferences Java 1 and projects ok thank
you and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
