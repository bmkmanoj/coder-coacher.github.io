implement a web component and connected
with Java 8 back-end so let's start with
Java 8 back-end what I would like to do
is to create a project from maven with
that so called archetype and I would
like to use the Java 8 template with the
recent version it's already in maven
central and we'll call it how to call it
pink pink pink is nice name so and this
is going to be pink anyway so I'm using
the pair of 5 which understands Java e 8
now the templates is fetched and created
and it template as what the project is
fetched and created and the name is pink
and what I have here is just the
dependencies Java 8 and I would like to
add the dependency to course and this is
my own dependency because it only
comprises one simple class so let's add
that so does the course dependency we
will need it because I would like to
create the html5 web component part in a
separate project which is more realistic
so now I have this and let's focus on
the business logic so it already comes
with simplistic resource and I would
like to to create some a little bit more
functionality and I would like to add an
entity pink entity and the pink entity
has one property message and I would
like also add a constructor for
convenience and one method string to
JSON and this time I would like to use
the Java 8 API this is Jason bilder from
Jason bind create and then to jason and
say this so for consists for consistency
I would like to name it the same so to
Jason done and then here in pink
resource what I can do is just to say
return new pink
this is not JavaScript yet so I feel
good to Jason
so should work done so now run it and I
would like to use the power of five so
run it and it opened the project in a
browser resources pink and I would just
remember the URI and switch to terminal
because if I do this you see the these
are the course headers which are
required otherwise I will get an error
in Chrome so now let's start with the
app so what I prepared is an empty HTML
which only imports or imports which only
yeah includes a JavaScript there is
there's nothing else included so this
this beta is just a hint for mobile
browsers but there's there's nothing
else included and so let's start with
the implementation of a web component so
class pink extends HTML element so we
have that and then I would like to to
register the component and the name of
the component has to have on - included
and I will have to use the class for the
registration so works and then let's
let's introduce a guitar and this is
going to be or setter said you said you
said this is a what I actually wanted to
do or E and what I going to do is or get
worried it's more and more interesting
return this.get attribute and the
attribute is going to be URI so this is
what I need
then in the method connected callback I
would like to do the following
I would like to fetch and what the
audience so this URI so it should invoke
together and then say if I'm done
then take the response and convert your
response to Jason response to Jason and
then I have my Jason and after I have my
Jason I can do the following I can say
okay I would like to this is my Jason
and I would like to set my own man own
content - and this was message J dot
message so should work and let's see
what happens I can write a the a slash
post or e equals this is the URI and
then post a post and switch to web
components and you see I feel good so
this is the first component the there's
our our post component I feel good and
of course we can say J message with
prefix that you see that it actually
comes from the component and prefix I
feel good so this was an intro to web
components custom elements I didn't used
shadow Dom yet but if you are interested
in it take a look at the web components
on that workshop see you at Munich
projects conferences and enjoy standards
so thank you for watching and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
