there's future logging standard called
which defines the lock functions on on
the window or a document objects which
can be used right away without the
console but we would already use it
right now the problem is of course some
browsers might not support that and so
if I look at this at the console we see
uncut reference error lock is not
defined which is very true because Reno
defined so and we would like so what we
will have to do is we will have to patch
the browser's to support lock but just
conditionally patch the browser's or how
it works so I will create a JavaScript
file and let's call it poorly lock dot
GS and I would like to include the file
here source and poly lock DOJ's and then
in the poly log file first I would like
to check whether my windows does not
support that the log function if it
doesn't I would like to patch that so
patching and because javascript is a
dynamic language what we can do we can
define a function on the fly and say the
window lock is a function and this
function is the definition as just the
message is going to be passed to the
concert the lock so what it means is if
if the lock function is not defined so
it is not defined then I will patch it
otherwise nothing happens and as we can
see patch Inc hey future standard so it
seems to work
so what polyfills are there are scripts
which are providing not standard but not
supported it doesn't have to be standard
but usually standard api's which are not
supported yet by some browsers and this
patching is conditional so usually you
would check whether functionality is
there and if not you will provide a
workaround or a patch
and if it is there nothing would happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
