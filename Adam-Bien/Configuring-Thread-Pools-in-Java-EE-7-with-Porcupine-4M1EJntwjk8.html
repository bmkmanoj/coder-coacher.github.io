project porcupine and show you how to
inject executor service which is
something like a thread pool but the the
interesting part is the threat book
contains manage threats spreads managed
by Java 7 service so by the concurrency
for utilities for Java EE specification
which is which standardized in this part
of the Java 7 so so what happened the
last time we executed the default the
first pork or who injected the executive
service fast pork with default
configuration so we can just briefly
test it so this was the output and we
see the statistics you can see is the
name of this Red Bull is fast pork and
the task was completed once so double
check that and now it is executed twice
so Sims 2 seems to work so on but let's
override the conventions a little bit so
first we can easily change the name of
this fat pool by choosing anemia custom
pork it's probably better
custom pork I would just redeploy
entirely to whole application and run it
exactly and then see whether it works so
I will just execute the pox again and
statistics as you can see the name is
custom pork so this is a very basic this
corresponds with this very basic
configuration but now we can overwrite
whatever you like and this is based on a
template pattern gang of a template
pattern which is actually built into the
Java is specification so what we can do
we can override a method and I will
introduce a class cost called custom
configurator and override the class
executor configurator which comes with
porcupine and to make it happen I have
to use the special
is a notation which says please take me
and not this class and then of course I
will have to override a method and the
method name is for pipeline so I would
like to override the configuration for a
specific pipeline and how to do this
simple if and I would like to use the
custom with papules the name equals name
so then we can just override something
and how to do this there is a porcupine
comes with a build up so we can use the
Builder pattern properly so I forgot the
new executor configurator configuration
builder and now let's say the max pool
size should be of course 4242 always
works better so let's do this and what
happens if there is a different pool in
in the case of a different pool we can
either create something different or
just return for consistency the execute
configuration dot default configuration
which returns of course the default you
could also we invoke the other methods
default configuration so I would just
rebuild it again and we execute the
pipeline and see whether it works
just cleared so executed and as you can
see we partially overridden the
conventions so what was just over it was
the maximum pool size everything else is
as as it was is conventional and of
course the pipeline name customer was
also adjusted so thank you for watching
and see you on upcoming conferences
workshops or gex admitted at airport we
for instance we use the porcupine to to
build some micro services and if you
like to subscribe to a ik news this is a
mailing list where I write usually once
a month some a very short email about
upcoming events workshops or articles or
whatever some meta information it's
let's say this okay thank you for
watching and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
