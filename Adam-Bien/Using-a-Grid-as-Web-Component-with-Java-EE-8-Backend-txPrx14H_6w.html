would like to use the VAD in Grint VAD
in great web component access it from
JavaScript and connected with Java e8
back-end so how to do that so now I'm
and Eve adding elements page and I would
like to use the free one and one of the
three components is the VAT in grid here
is the grid so let's take a look at that
and to install the grid I will need the
power power tool so let's do this so I'm
installing with the Bower the van and
grid and what power does it basically
clones the github repo and what happens
behind the scenes now I have a folder
Bower components here and what I also
created is just an empty HTML page which
references an empty CSS and one-liner
JavaScript okay so now I would like to
start this and usually I use browser
sync so with the following configuration
and this time what I would like to do is
I would like to serve the contents not
only from the source folder rather than
from source folder and the bower
components folder components so let's
start that looks good first and then
what I also would like to do is to
install the the Varden grid and to
install that I will have to introduce an
link import and because I'm serving the
concepts from the Bower I don't need the
reference here and now let's see whether
it actually works so to check that I
would like to switch to the HTML
examples and there is one example with
what is it first name last name so just
do this I will just copy this Vaadin
grid example and to my code so I will
replace the hello
with the Varden so just do this and
switch here and we have that strangely
enough two times and what we don't need
the data binding example here so this is
not needed and we have the header we
have we don't need the address so this
was two times so we have the index first
name last name looks good
Eileen quit good good okay so now let's
say I would like to to access that oh
this is therefore because we have to
futa as well so we have T header and the
footer so therefore we have the header
it is the footer okay how to access the
Varden grid from our code so to do this
I would like to use the standard native
component custom element API custom
custom elements when defined and what is
when defined is Vardhan grid this is the
name of the tank in grid then then what
I can do if it's defined I can actually
fetch it document query select or and we
have only one grid so I can just say
Varden grid Const grid and with a little
bit of luck you should see something
grid okay Vardhan grid so it looks good
this is the the volume component but in
web component or custom element and now
connected with the Java EE 8 back-end so
we have empty project here and I would
like to use or to start with maven again
and use the Java 8 template with the
latest version
and let's call it hackers so now it
creates it pulls the the maven archetype
from the from the internet on and so it
seems like the Nexus is slow and I would
like the maybe in central Nexus and what
it created is a Java EE eight project
you could call it thin war or a micro
service with only reference to Java
eight API and with hello pink and what I
would like to do is to create a new
component and the component name is
hackers boundary and hackers resource
and the hackers resource is annotated
with resource resource with hackers and
what we need we need a hacker as well so
just do this we need a class and the
class resides in hackers entity and
hacker is the class name and the class
has a string first name and has also
string class name and then has a
constructor and convenience constructor
first and last name and then we can here
say I would like to return a list of
hackers and import the hacker import the
list and say the name is all gat and
then say return array as list and now I
would like to say the first hacker is
the name is Duke and the last name is
chief the next is heck
masta Vardhan so now we have a list of
two and we have to deploy that so how to
do this I will switch to a Java 8 server
which is payara 5 and I would like to
deploy the project so do this run and so
now it starts the server and deploys the
project and I will have resources
hackers and now we have it there's a
small problem with that so if I switch
to the command line and say curl why - I
as you can see there are no course had
us so we have to install the course
filter so another big deal is just one
class in Java 8 so I would like to
install the filter and this is the
course filter and then I will have to
rebuild everything because the filter
has to be pulled from the internet so
it's similar to NPM install probably a
bit quicker and just retry that so
where's my terminal yeah just do it
again looks better now we have the
course control so now we can actually
communicate from the from the web app to
the backend so this is the URI and now
take a look take a look at at the
example so in the tutorial there is HTML
API and I would like to have the HTML
API of the grid element and here you see
what we can do we can specify a data
provider so let's do this so data
provide a function which expects two
parameters param singh callback so let's
do this grid data provider data provider
equals and just use
or modern syntax params and callback
this is what you would like to have and
so and this callback expects two
parameters the first one the first one
is the array and then the total size so
what we can do now we can say okay then
fetch the data here with the URI and in
case you are done so use theory then
convert the response to response Jason
and then we have Jason and if you are
done asynchronously then we can say then
the Jason can be passed to callback and
this is the first parameter is Jason and
the other one is the length and this is
I think a method called length so with a
little bit of luck it should work and it
doesn't because I have two brackets so
as we again missing after a list so we
have here and just do it again and jason
length is not a function because it's a
property and now we have the objects
coming from the server so we have the
dupe chief and master Vardhan and it
uses the fetch API which is part of the
web standards so we build a Java 8 thin
war and connected that with a web
component provided by Vaadin using plain
years 2015 so thank you for watching
take a look at web standards ignite
ignite or OD web components training or
see you at a XCOM or at conferences or
Java user groups off thank you and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
