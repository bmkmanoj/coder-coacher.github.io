would like to show you why I don't use
private visibility for injected fields
anymore for this purpose I would like to
create a Java six project called why not
private for injection and I would like
to use the at inject dependency
injection as well and then deploy @je
created JSF page called index in this
page I would just like to verify the
functionality by running the application
so looks good then create a class called
index it's going to be the backing beam
I've been why not private and this guy
is going to be a model with a single
master method called get message or get
greetings from backing pin and
I'm going to test that with so high from
baking beans seems to work so now let's
create a boundary the boundary is going
to be an EJB so it's gp3 one so just ate
less public string get message I would
like just to return let's say the date
something dynamic and inject the eg b3
one into deep packing bean so how we
doing right now
as as you see I just don't use the
private here it's just package white
visibility so I call that so I checked
it with at inject hello from baking bean
with the message so looks good as well
so then I will I create additional count
class called control and the control
returns a number let's say a long gate
number
and would like to inject the control
here as well not to string but I would
like to use them so as you can see it
works as expected
now what I can do I can easily create a
unit test yes and inside the unit test I
can just Y up D control the boundary
with the control in the inject method
which is going to be before and I'm
using a boundary class on the test and I
can do something like this cat equals
new boundary and now the interesting
part is this guy here so I can just
directly inject the instance into the
field because it's private visibility as
you can see it's it's private so if it
if it were private I would get an arrow
here so it's actually more convenient I
could use getters and setters and I
could use constructors but why the this
this way of working is more convenient
now I hear lots of criticism about that
that the actuality the encapsulation is
broken so let's try to break the
encapsulation so what we can do we could
do something like public string
heck it and just let's try to get the
reference to the control actually here
is it so we have it here try to hack
as you can see the container recognizes
dad and throws an exception so try to
access field boundary control from index
so it recognizes that we attempted to
access the injected field so this is
illegal access error which is actually
nice so as you can see the encapsulation
is not broken at all so actually nothing
can happen but interesting if we made
this guy private and expose this filled
with getters and setters then the
encapsulation would be truly broken
because now the public get and set
methods belong to the no interface view
of the boundary so now we could access
we could access the field directly and
and you would see it's a reference so as
you can see now I can am able to access
the control the the the instance of the
control so why why I'm not using private
anymore because I prefer package wide
visibility and then actually don't like
get us and setters superfluous getters
and setters and this guys are
superfluous or lots of problem because
you can see just for one field I need
two methods and just for reasons which
are hard to get so usually I don't use
getters and setters I just make all
injected fields package wide visibility
and I'm able to access them directly
from unit tests so thank you for
watching and see you on conference's
projects on one of my upcoming workshops
so thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
