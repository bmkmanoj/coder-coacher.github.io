would like to show you how to easily
link to widgets together in Java fix so
I would like to start with a very simple
project I would use on maven archetype
for that which creates a travel except
vacation with maven 3 so I would call
the project linking and yeah the Maven
architect already creates a very simple
application and the application
comprises a POJO which is a placeholder
for business logic and a visual
component called follow me which
comprises presenter view and the F XML
file so let's create just two additional
fields here so I will just put it back
near and I would like to enter to get
the text field so I will just put the
text in here and the name of the text
field I would choose the name is flight
number is the St name this is very
important Java fix and C builder so I
use the ethics ID in code so if I can
inject the field directly to the
presenter so and I would also look we
would like to use a label and yeah
the label should be flight number output
output this is the name of the label
then I'll just put here
three - so on the idea is if I enter
something here should automatically
appear in the label so how to do this
actually very simple so what we can do
right now we can just inject the label
in the text field so I would use a fix
event and the label it was a think
flight name number and the F XML F F X
and the text field it was flight number
and this is actually Bronco but we can
double check this so the label so the
the label is the name of the label there
is no label because we didn't save that
so saving is important save and now
those better the text field is flight
number and the ID of the label is fine
number output so when we spend that go
back to the presenter Lynam output and
site number should work and now we can
look them link them together so you can
say flight number output dot text
property bind to flight number text
property so and now see whether it work
so I'm this amazing project it comes
with a very simple build script we just
set Java home assigns java to java 8
home so i usually work with jdk 1 7 jdk
1 8 is not released yet so um I'll just
make it exit to the executable and then
execute the script so and now it should
build the whole application JavaScript
and soil project was built by the
ignitor made an archetype which is in
solar type central so you can just use
it for your phone for your project
I would use Java 8 to launch the
application target and this was linking
I think at the top and if we enter you
something you see it appears in the
label so this was probably the simplest
possible extension with for applications
with afterburner afterburner and yeah
thank you for watching and see you on
one of upcoming conferences workshops
projects or even a hex and soon in a hex
online so thank you for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
