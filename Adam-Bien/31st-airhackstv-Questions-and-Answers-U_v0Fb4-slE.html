to the 31st edition of a hex TV so this
time with Java one and Java enews those
kind of special edition so i would like
to start with giovanni impression so
start with the fisherman's wharf and so
i took the streetcar to the java one i
was late so i just spent two days java
one so it was nice experience because i
could just reduce the right away so i
order ordered a coffee at the elysee and
hilton and they couldn't get that the
Duke so always wrote puke or something
else it was funny so this is the booth
is do you know the home of the whole
micro profile movement and there was a
night taking booth where I gave later an
interview about the keynote and Java EE
and as you can see here there's on the
right side there is a redhead with the
whitefly IBM was Liberty profile this is
a part of the interview kind of endless
loop because I'm recorded the monitoring
screen so it was fun as a nice hack and
so you could get some micro profit
issues at the booth this is the payara
booth pyara fish like commercial
glassfish the gin astok cloud and this
guy is an IOT guide propperly nothing to
do with javi so Mike right hold with the
modularity session and I had no time to
be outside so there was just one shoot
about 40m closed streak and so Microsoft
laughs open source and Java there are
lots of stickers about this and this is
the old friend Yoshio so it's like the
Java evangelist from Japan works for
Microsoft and he presented a nice
service where you can upload your
picture and it estimate your happiness
you can see my happiness is one hundred
percent and also your h and i was
estimated to be i don't know 10 years
younger this actually is the case or
nice and intelligent service from
microsoft so the next the neck thing is
java 8 News contents roadmaps and
caveats so um let's start with that and
now start with these lights with the PDF
so the programming model extension in
this this actually comprises
v8 and Java nine so we get reactive
programming extensions which are which
will come with partially java 9 and java
ee a unified event model so what it what
it probably will mean us so probably it
means nothing is set in stone is a new
jess r is going to be launched so you
can participate and this unified event
model would means remote event is going
to be sent back it back and forth so it
would be nice if it would be the case
like adding Mode CD I we get jax-rs
extensions and this is already on the
roads to one and HT be too sore subject
for and better lambda integration and
Jason bees or like like Jack's be but
for Jason I was a packaging extensions
particular interesting for a cloud
providers key value store so I'm curious
about this one because what key value
store what key value store there were
means is that we get a new API for this
and there were already several attempts
at javaone and previous travel one to
extend jpa to support JM no sequel
databases and the audience and and the
speakers had actually a no idea there
were no no good ideas you know what
actually is to do because jpa already
works fine with some data stores I'm
curious what happens here eventual
consistency would basically the idea is
you get a data structure and it changes
to the data structure occur via via
event sourcing or stream of events and
in one point of time this data structure
becomes consistent so serverless what
the definition of server less according
to the keynote that java one is like
you've just focus in a programming model
and don't care about the application
server so we already have similar
experience right now with Daka but this
is going to be formalized in Java EE
configuration so there is a thing is
called tamiya apache tamiya spec and
these peg leads from the configuration
as peck will or the JS r is going to be
heavily inspired by already existing
configurations and what we get is the
configuration spec like get config
for out the updates and and events ours
and and probably and also integration
with already existing api's like
persistence.xml where we could for
instance specify configure data source
on configured username and password so
multi-tenancy was already a part of java
ee 7 but was postponed so this comes
back lots of persistence providers
already support that because it was
meant to be support in java 7 so state i
guess this is like formalization of j
cash this is what state is going because
this state api in JK api is going to be
very very similar resiliency like
built-in patterns like resilient
commands and so it was not mentioned you
read a keynote but what I hope the
concurrency utilities for Java are going
to be to be included as well because the
concurrence utilities for Java is it's
an integral part of residency is built
in bulkheads basically an application
service and security lots of work has
already been done in at the Soteria
reference implementation and yeah this
is this is going to be a part of Java EE
eight so how it looks like what is the
platform architecture so API gateway
load balancer and this is the container
java runtime as iran time and it runs on
operating system hypervisor or container
runtime and this is how it was presented
at the java one so what we can of course
and not everything has to be load
balanced right this is like just the
idea how it could look like and these
are the specs so what we get we get
configuration and health check as a new
specs security and jason bein going to
be enhanced or enhanced are going to be
to be heavily enhanced they are going to
be changed so the deep blue one and did
these are not going to be changed
because they will remain as they are and
there is some discussion about the MVC
model view controller spec because
because
it is almost already done and it will be
a pity if it doesn't make it to the java
ee 8 and from my perspective embassy is
a great spec for server-side templating
but for instance you could pre populate
your your angular or react application
with with server data and the roadmap is
actually really nice so what it
basically means in one year we get 2000
we get a Java 8 and one later to tell in
2018 Java a 9 which is which is which is
actually perfect so what it means we get
a very soon new specs so one year is
actually a bold statement but I think
now they have to execute it was right
announcer right now and what's also
interesting is I just listened 222222
lots of sessions about Java e8 in Java
nine and and every speculate or every
speaker at the session just invited the
audience to participate in the survey so
just do it as well so this is the
GlassFish dark survey and just ask for
feedback so it seems like they are
really open for feedback which is a nice
thing so what what I was curious the
whole time actually is what happens if
Oracle becomes inactive again so let's
say these packets for unknown reasons
they are alive but they do nothing so
they do you want react to image and
nothing happens and that was curious
about the situation so I got some
behind-the-scenes conversations and what
I understood is if as peclet becomes
inactive there is no way to take over
the spec this was new to me so what it
basically means is if I would open a
spec let's say i don't know EXT v-spec
how do you know who record screencasts
and then I become inactive there is a no
way to take over this peg by someone
else so um so and this is actually a
pity so I think it would be nice if the
JCP would be extended this way then in
such a case all the eegees could decide
you know to vote for another speck late
so this is the one possible
disappointment or desired disadvantage
of JCP but Andy
other side what I'm really happy with is
you know we got we get the already guru
spec leads from Java EE the old the old
the be really nice spec leads and now in
my eyes it is another bad things to her
to have no really competent people who
drive forward to java ee really fast
then have an open discussion and nothing
happens for years so on this was the
Java 8 in Java EE 9 news and what was
also interesting micro profile was also
mentioned during the keynote and micro
profile was started without Oracle but
now Oracle will participate as well
which is also on a nice and I statement
so this is about Java in Java one so on
did this rd if you have questions asking
the chat yeah we had a keynote crash
half hour ago so i restarted the show so
you can still ask questions if like yeah
stream is offline now I'm online again
so let's start with the questions so the
first question is what about proxy or
API gateway in Dhaka this was one of the
questions during the last heck show
Easter in dockland an image yes there is
what I showed you was this H a proxy
configuration tests like an indirection
this age a proxy or is it not necessary
if you have multiple image running so in
my eyes it is not necessary to have
always a API gateway and I don't know
whether you remember at the beginning of
Java EE there was a almost that could
practice everyone attempted to do is
like have you know like a web gateway
with the web presentation logic
application server and the back end part
with the back end business logic for
unknown reasons and this make the whole
architecture more complicated so I think
in on my project we have multiple images
running but we never had without a
reason api gateway so far so in my
opinion can start without service
register your api gateway and then if
you need one when you will notice that
if you have for instance swap differ
olymp limitations different providers at
runtime
api gateway could be an interesting
thing usually in my enterprise project
there is no need for that that was you
know at the runtime swap the
implementation of the services and and
the API should with with a stable API so
our next question from coco vika or cove
it'sa so let's say hello back again just
reactivate so am i want to do load
balancing for my application running on
glassfish i came up with two possible
solutions so there are several what to
do is create dhaka for each individual
glassfish server server this would i
would propose so and what it means is
this would include installation and
setup yes of course and what i did i
show you for instance here we have here
pi r are configured and there is a
payara configured image and what it
basically does this is what this is
actually the part of this connections
pull chain the eye and so forth this in
my case I just configured the JVM
options what you can configure as you
know the GMs options data sources and
whatever like can be everything can be
configured here and then you have one
image which can be standard several
times and you get your load balancing so
this is what we do and just the payara
raw image it's just the payara without
any configuration this is a project
specific configuration and what I did as
well I added a project nope sorry and
monitoring configuration as well so by
the way I was what I also did I recorded
a screencast about load balancing Java
microservices where I actually did it I
implemented a cluster with AJ proc seen
as a part of the docklands image so you
will see it life and what I also did I
implemented or recorded a service to
service configuration with microservices
this screencast and while and I go a
little bit into the depth during my java
one session the problem is the java one
session for
the reasons my terminal became very very
slow and for the first 10 10 15 minutes
I just had to wait until the application
server starts in two minutes had no idea
what happens behind the scenes as thing
is had something to do with the
conference network but what i did i
recorded the first part here in this
screencast we can watch both if you like
and by the way what I also did I
recorded some screencaps about react and
an angular 2 and then another another
screencast with just going with playing
javascript and and dumb without any
framework if you are curious and because
we already here what's also interesting
is on that note for both workshops
angular 2 and react there are almost the
same amount of attendees so it seems
like both workshops are or both
technologies like react and angular are
equally are equally popular which I
thought no angular 2 is going to be
massively more popular than react and so
I'm really glad because I think react as
a little bit linear technology didn't in
angular so okay so if you would like to
you know do to take a look at load
balancing and with H a proxy for
instance and just just take a look at
this okay and of course you can use yeah
and this is actually mix of both i use a
administer noticed within the docker so
nothing against that also works so our
do you use linux server for dhaka yes i
always use linux server so I personally
always use linux servers some of my
clans use windows but the vast majority
of my clans uses linux as well do you
use openjdk from fraud or from oracle in
production as well so I used always from
oracle jdk since i used oka is OpenJDK
what was announced at the keynote that
the oracle jdk becomes also
containerized out of the boxes easier to
install then i will probably use the
Oracles jdk again but my server runs on
OpenJDK and i'm happy so far with with
the performance I have no no
comparison between oracle jet Akane
openjdk but but I just switch to openjdk
without any major issues so that's doc
at work if you have a swing kept based
application yes it works but it would be
strange so what do you will have to do
is you could you you will have to export
know the determiner not a terminal the
screen with hoosick server so and this
is actually a bad hack so you should not
do this am yeah and this is just an hint
in the thirties a hacks Alamein is one
of the attendees mentioned that the
jasperreports that uses glassfish for
large pdfs and what they used they use
the virtualizer here and this is
actually a nice a nice feature from from
jasper reports to support large PDF
files okay so and this is very similar
question to this one how important is
the role of the JVM oracle versus
openjdk vers IBM in your projects do you
even bother so in my commercial projects
projects I've a lot for instance some of
my clients have the Java for business
license or the Oracle JD Oracle license
if they have the license we run JMC Java
Mission Control in production which is
really nice so if they don't have the
license so we cannot run this but still
if something happens in production in a
che environments it is of course you
only only get support for the for the
JDK and it was necessary sometime in the
past we use that from time to time in
larger deployments and and IBM so if you
are running you know on mainframe is for
a little or whatever then I will always
use IBM JDK of course and
recommendations for JVM tuning for
server-side applications I will as my
recommendation would be start with the
witan with no tuning at all and then
perform some stress test and then
monitor your application first and then
tune the JVM I would not expect too much
with JVM and garbage collection tuning
usually you can achieve more with the
application but
yeah and so for tuning the JVM the best
tool I know is the Java Mission Control
from from Oracle from from the Oracle
JVM there are similar tool from IBM it
verts the best on the IBM JVM I actually
forgot the name and you have to look
this is like eclipse plugin and it
provides you with profiling information
okay so take a look whether we have some
questions no questions and I think so no
questions no questions no questions so
questions about CDI and clusters so
first there is no cluster for CDI so
someone could implement clustering for
CDI but there's not a part of the spec
so and see inject is not suitable to
work with ej peas beans yeah what it
basically means they have ear with HIV
modules oh and this is when my
experience tops because for years I
didn't deploy ears anymore so what
really happens in all my project we just
have wars and only in view cases we have
jars with in the wars so I have no
experience here with ear packaging on
weblogic or with no experience and my
experience is five years old or even
older since we got java 6 so we have to
check out how how all these pack
actually is and so and so ambiguous
dependency error and what I don't think
the cluster environment rrd problems
with CDI whatever I what I remember this
was in one glassfish project if you if
you would like to communicate between
between nodes we had to configure in EG
BGR the ILP this iil or this is like how
it's called interop identifier in order
to to communicate between the cluster
nodes and
and what's also a little bit problematic
sore how cluster works is is the
following you have you have the web
application in the heb and usually also
in cluster the web app gets injected
locally jeebies and if you are if you
have a soap service or checks or a
service then it's the same so you're
Egypt bees your local views of the Egypt
bees get injected 2d 2d presentation so
it's not like you get clustering between
within your ear so I usually the ear is
not cluster our so um what happened or I
don't know 15 years ago 15 yeah 15 years
ago that there was the idea that EG bees
are remote so there are so-called smart
stops and they were a cluster our but
there was no dependency injection what
it basically meant is that a swing
client for instance just got Peggy I
look up and EG be stopped and these tops
were cluster our but this is normally a
case so i think this question something
else is going wrong because the egb are
not class terrible even on a cluster
because it doesn't make any sense the
whole transaction happens in one cluster
node nothing is remote okay so the next
one so what i could do is actually just
a little
so what I met meant by that is so we
need a new so even if in a cluster if
you are in a year let's say this is an
ear so what we have we have two ears and
what you would like to do have is the
following that if this is the incoming
transaction and this is your ejb so
before the egb you get jacks or as you
get your servlet servlet or whatever so
this is injected here but this is not
clustered so he always a local
interfaces get injected and even if you
have a lots of each be a best practice
would be that everything here has to be
local so what it means the whole
transaction happens in one node so what
should not happen that this cluster that
this note calls the other one because
then we will have to have X a
transaction than whatever so in case you
have something like this I would
reconfigure the whole thing and just
remove all the remote interfaces from eg
bees so all EG bees even like last
environment has have to have local
transit local interfaces if they have
local turns interfaces just look at
interfaces it should still work and yeah
and this would I will propose is just to
remove you know the remote interfaces
then you remove to remove the cluster
availability of the jeebies already plus
the ability of the jeebies and then you
don't have the problem because otherwise
it doesn't make any sense that that the
one transaction will you know leave one
node and and go to the other ok so how
do you combine jax-rs and GSF so very
similar very very similar problem so if
we have the our no boundary control
entity boundary control entity
boundary control entity architecture and
if we have GSF the great advantage of
GSF is that jess f can work in process
and get injected the boundary so if we
have jax-rs is similarly the jacksons
resource it's here and access the same
boundaries or the eg bees and the Jets
have shared the same boundary what the
question implies which might be a good
idea so eat your own dog food that you
have the boundary here which is remote
and you have somewhere else at GSF and a
jsf is the placeholder you know of this
could be angular for instance as well so
and this and this is a remote call here
and this exposes the browser windows or
we did it once this was a migration
project and what it basically means is
you expose one nice business API and the
the the baking beans from the GSF use
access remotely via jax-rs and HTTP the
remote server so there's no difference
between jsf JavaFX angular to react or
whatever html5 or whatever all the
clients access the same the same remote
interface so what it basically means my
backing bean backing bean has a
reference to jacks or s2 client and the
jax-rs to client talks via HTTP to a
resource and the resource accesses the
boundary so this would be your
architecture so basically you're backing
bean behaves the same way as your system
test ok nice
so is it a good approach know what do
you care what i would do is that jax-rs
backing bean and the jack storage
resource get injected the same boundary
and the boundaries are clean ejb at
stateless i think i did it in the
effective java ee online course so just
look at this so they're all between dog
and project cumulus or white fly swarm
this is um this is a very interesting
questions or what cumulus does is just
packages this a set of mavin the awesome
set of mavin plugins which package the
application and just the applications
already application and just deploy no a
small part at small jar white dress more
swarm or pyara micro are the same and
what is the advantage of doing so so in
my eyes such project map have particular
make particular sense if you don't have
docker because if you have dakka dakka
comes with inheritance which i present
it to you so this is the java java image
we have the payara image and which
inherits from java and we get the
configured pyara image which inherits
from pyara and what it basically means
is that that it is already optimized
that way that if we deploy an
application here and just comprises the
war and there is already the separation
between the larger application server
file and the smaller under and earth
smaller this is like you know tiny and
the very tiny wars the wars are really
small so just look at the interviews
that are usually if you are reasonable
beyond one Mac so and if you would use
cumulus pyara micra whatever there will
be no such separation instead you know
of having pyara pyara pyara configured
and pyara monitored you would you would
get in the in the pink war here
everything the application server and
the war so the whole deployment will
take longer so in my case on docker and
does not make a lot of sense but
probably I miss something so so I think
the great the great advantage of Java is
the deployment model where the
application server is strictly separate
from the business logic so the
application server image only consists
once or recites once on a note and can
be started multiple time so this is I
think great advantage why because it
speed speed ups the deployment and the
startup times what is the best way to
configure a driver jdbc jdbc jdbc puller
and data service in 87 running in a
dacha so hard code as much as possible
in the application server and if
something has to going to be to be
replaced as use these system properties
so I also recorded a screencast here I
think let's see staging external
resources with dr. at java application
just take a look at this and what we
also had we had a conversation at
javaone i was in an elite buff with
connection oracle connection pool
engineers and i think it would be nice
if the connection pool would pick up you
know some environment entries as
configuration sources or with we could
configure everything with darker with
the minus e with minus e toggle so and
what what kumu loose what they suggest
is to use resource local and what I
suggest is use JTA transactions whys of
is far easier to use transactions over
using resource local and manage
transactions by yourself and blow to
your code so i would if i don't have I
would never use resource locker so um do
you know I just pick server
authentication module for summer
authentication so there are actually two
possibilities there are very similar
open am from Fort Rock and they have
they don't have a some module rather
than what they would they have is a lots
of adapters like agents and what they
also have a Soviet field test so this is
what I look at and of course picket link
is a little bit outdated but key cloak
from jboss let's see whether we find
this
actly and this is similar story what
they have they have several providers
like servlet filters where you can
integrate it from outside but it is not
like plaque able just speak just be
provider which I know of okay so this is
this what I will suggest you then that
question that's where the second there
is something going on here no how can
the neck question is in the last time I
had the feeling that javax is losing
traction well the Oracle does not you
know push Java fix a lot and the problem
with Java X is actually a complicated
technology so you have to support low
level in our GPU drivers or whatever so
it's really hard for community to
contribute meaningful code and on the
other side html5 becomes and browsers
becomes more and more capable so on so
then of course like java weeks we'll
lose the traction but if you think about
this i'm actually still a huge fan of
java fix if you would start a javax
project with before angular 1 happened
so now we get angular 2 and react and
everything looks actually completely
different the java thick subrogation
will still look the same and we still
probably support it until java 9 so it's
not like you know so what it means is it
loses traction this is not as sexy as
was you know a few years ago this for
sure is it worse to invest time in
learning java vics nowadays I think so I
mean it's not like it would spend in no
month of running java vics so if you are
interested in the UI technology with
java just do it and nothing prevent you
know to know java figs and html5 so so
questions about communication between
between applications using rest so
design api for instance a service to
verify if a customer has a credit should
i return 200 to show that this customer
has recreated in 404 to show that it
hasn't or 20 for it means a document
contains no data if it doesn't I will
just use this 204
and in the consumer service where i
consume the service should i treat their
the respond jason or justice status so
right now i'm implementing such as such
HTTP client for react and angular 2 and
so there is no no problem looking at the
HTTP header so you can just you have
full access to the headers or you can
just do it so um of course you should
looks at ahead as as well so for me the
headers like a metadata additional
information and the payload is the
payload so I would prefer the 204
solution over state 20 return true
message has credit for instance so but
you know this is like there are many
opinions about this topic so for me 204
is the way to go and by the way what
let's see NFC post HTTP HTTP what I do
before frequently my projects let's see
whether post for instance if you look at
this pack here this is post there is put
on the fourth so it already proposes you
know the head is who two or four no
content is the appropriate response
that's in the case if it won that ok
I'll 204 no content and if you stand
with Jax or s and you return void it
will convert this automatically 204 so
the conventions jax-rs conventions are
already good enough so um so just take a
look at this and there is put ended see
get do we find get here yet and you
would probably find here as well
and there's so just read the spec so
post is our most interesting because it
suggests you know to one to two hundred
and 20 for and just what I also
frequently do there's another section
with the aldi HTTP status codes and see
whether I find the right one for
instance on validation errors tourism
code for validation error as well okay
problem je application an ear Wi-Fi 9
and it starts it consumes one hundred
percent CPU how do how to find the
problem I would deploy this on oracle
jdk connect Mission Control recorded
session and data will probably find the
problem it will lock the gc's as well
you will able to do to profile the
problem so this is fun a long friend of
the show and he asked me ok big
communication between micro services
without dhaka and which which tools to
use and without dr you don't have the
problem the problem with darkest the
localhost points to the docker container
itself on outside the dock at the local
host post to the host machine itself so
what I did in a prior to dhaka are just
on one machine the the might and the
micro services communicated using the
local host and in the book called night
x this is this one actually described
that so those like my blog sends you
know events to the x-ray and both run on
on both rent on the same machine without
dhaka at the beginning now they run
within the docker but back then it was
outside outside dhaka and i didn't had
any problems because i just used no
localhost and an open port and it just
worked so on without doc I don't you
don't need any any additional services
of software what if this is a
distributed system
first thing to look at is Justin on DNS
because what you will need is like no
symbolic name in the Orie which is going
to be resolved to the IP address and in
all enterprises it already works that
way that behind the name there's already
a hot v load balancer or software load
balancer but we just get the name and
invoke the service that there is no
problem at all so Andy Andy zookeeper I
mean if the old in directions are
already needed if you want to achieve
more like you would like not to swap
service implementations or you have
massively scalable solution but even
then in one project we have for each
service to HR proxies which are
clustered this high available solution
we still don't have any any additional
in direction so on the next one which
javaone 2016 session would you recommend
for viewing what I suggest you all
sessions delivered by Oracle employees
why because usually such sessions are
only delivered at javaone at and all
these sessions from from consultants you
can also know here at different
conferences or or other conferences to
travel on travel on I would just you
know as much as possible listen to the
Oracle engineers who are pisa behind JDK
and and Java EE why because they just
speak no in San Francisco and and they
they actually building the stuff so this
particular interesting to listen to them
ok m22 Wesley what you can do just check
out my BCE artifact BCE archetype and
the archetype comes with with a simple
app and this simple app I hope I just
implemented a crowd with some HTTP
status code so you can look at this and
inspire yourself so
yes the so there's a code driven micros
microservice session what I did at the
info share was 20 minutes I had some
services and showed the monitoring pyara
capabilities is there something
available for white as well yes and it's
also available via restful web services
so whitefly monitoring and they have
even a console called air HQ I think
several know there's a okay then oh it's
this one so there is how Cola and there
is similar as similar projects for
monitoring on white fly and what the
other half is a thing is called jboss
operation network is like a console
where you can log in and watch the
monitoring data so they have ok XO
exactly how current monitor agent
exactly is the hackulo so they have
something similar after install and is
called how Cola and there are agent and
matrix and there's a rest api for this
so you can go here and say so this is a
generic api which returns you know the
generic generic information about the
application server and and then you can
you can expose which services are you
are interested in exactly and this is a
part of the jebel is a bit more modular
and the GlassFish comes with this out of
the box and the payara comes with even
more they have like request monitor so
if you get pyara request monitor it even
what I showed so they should have
exactly but they have even extended this
was called a request monitoring and it
comes on top of glassfish that they
implemented in own monitoring key and
Isis
were request request racing pyara
request tracing mm-hmm and there should
be a picture someone this is fairly new
and it then looks like this so you can
see for each request to know where the
time is spent is also nice so this comes
with pyara what I shown an info share
was the generic glassfish glassfish
monitoring and jboss is the same so look
at the ocular and the agent has to be
installing they can expose everything
via rest and the Tommy also comes with
nice monitoring solutions actually all
application service comes with nice
monitoring ok so this was about
monitoring Oh neighbors wanted to just
to say thank you so I thank you for
watching my my microservice workshop so
this is what I actually do in projects
so so thank you and really nice that I'm
glad you like that so um I would like to
hear you about the pinion of event
sourcing have you've worked in a project
that use this pattern of course so I
mean what event sourcing just means is
like let's imagine you have one system
which sends events and the other
consumes two events actually my block
works like this so if you are if you go
to my blog there are some stats on the
right side should be this and all these
statistics are actually not a park part
of the blogging platforms on each click
a message is sent to the x-ray and it
aggregates the stream so if I would just
recalled all the all the whole stream I
could just you know I could I could
record the state of the whole block so
what's event sourcing means there is a
queue you sending events and you can
reconstruct the whole state
from the judge from the contours of the
queue right now I'm in project with with
react and in this project there is a
architecture called flux f lu x and what
you can do then is also events are
things we are sending just events
between the UI and the stores and dee
dee dee dee events are fully fully
encapsulate the state so if you just you
know send the same events in the same
order you always get the same feedback
is also event sourcing and the whole
cluster cluster synchronization is also
events or things or events are thing is
is a nice thing what do you have to be
careful you know you have to have their
checkpoints or from time to time
otherwise you know the question is how
many message you would like to send to
reconstruct the state of your app so on
but yeah i use event sourcing where
appropriate and usually it's appropriate
in all you know fire-and-forget
architectures where for instance if you
sends messages to the payment gateway or
whatever this is just perfect case for
event sourcing but what you should never
do is just you know introduce introduce
event sourcing just because we can
because it will over complicate the
architecture so what we'll do you
recommend to generate rest api doc so i
can so what you should start with is see
whether i will find out
plugin exactly there's a plugin from
Sebastian tashna and what it does it
creates a swagger swagger file and
either to Swagger plain text or a ski
dock from from the metadata from from
the jack storage resources and this is
actually a nice a nice plugin and I
always start with that and if this is
not enough then let's see but I would
start with that and it creates for you
ask a doc PDF or even swagga input okay
so so Thomas asked me do already use the
health check command support interest in
dr. Lee's 112 yes I experiment with this
particularly with together with the pink
project actually wanted to record a
screencast with that and I'll probably
will do actually how it actually how it
works you can start a docker image with
run command and specify a health check
which is executed without the joker
dhaka and then you can use docker
inspect commands to see we know what is
the health of the doc image do you have
a favorite zero downtime diploma
strategy with java in dhaka right now H
a proxy and dhaka edger proxies mature
comes with the start stats so to take a
look at the at my screen casts how how
easy it actually is and there's a used a
lot so I would start with that how you
would wire programmatically the entity
manager without using persistence.xml so
without using persistence.xml at all
it's going to be hard but we already
mentioned the BC boundary control entity
what you can always do you can just you
partially provide the data and
persistence.xml and the rest provide
with with via the programmatic API and i
use it always for testing for system
test for instance so i have a
persistence.xml which and I just boot
the entity manager without injected dant
and and thus the only way would be to
rely on vendor specific feature I mean
the entity manager is created with the
properties and the question is I think
at least you will have to specify the
resource local so we will have to
experiment with that but if it's not
possible what I would do I will
implement one classes one class which
produces the entity manager and this
class would be vendor-specific which is
not not not a huge deal you know then
you would inject the entity manager with
ed inject and is going to be produced by
the vendor specific lets say by white
fly or by hibernate entitymanager which
creates is programmatically so are the
mr. probably left sir but M probably
Michael rift sir ask me what is you set
up for four years six development
webpack Babel and he refers to these
screencasts I think this one's the
angular react and JavaScript so what I
use right now i use for JavaScript
development netbeans daily builds or
Visual Studio code from Microsoft
without any plugins and I prefer webpack
so web pack is a really nice solution it
reminds me on maven with the with
assembly defined so the output in output
just one single jar Babel is a standard
I use baby right now because I rely on
es 6 or X 2015 and is not supported by
all browsers yet so need a kind of
transformer with JavaScript lips do you
use for unit and integration tests from
time to time just mean with chai because
chai comes with with janie or hamcrest
like asserts which I prefer over the
gherkin style but i have to admit in my
current projects I don't have a single
unit test because almost nothing happens
in the UI so I don't know what really to
test I mean
there's not lots lots of business logic
going on so I will focus more on system
test or end-to-end tests okay Sonny
greetings from costa blanca so nice so
greetings back to costa blanca from
germany so we have today is colder than
yesterday but the last week was also
nice so we don't have to travel to costa
blanca we can focus more on Java and
Java EE so um what is your point of view
of Rommel restful IP modeling language
for document aggress api's what the
problem with rommel i have is in I don't
know the larger the project the more
overuse it gets so some project I
already saw that everything was
generated from Ramel with custom
generators and then I asked you know the
question why we just not use soap then I
mean we could use just no vista land
generate everything both sides and then
why you need to know rest van ramble so
um i think what you should start with is
think about the business logic expose
nice business api's and if you have nice
business api's there's almost no no need
to document them so I'm so what you have
no time or once again hopefully we'll
find this paypal let's go arrest API
let's see whether we find something
useful okay just um we found you know
the paypal the rest api if you look at
this payments payment post so if you
just look at this post payment I mean
what you would expect I would expect
that something is paid on radius critter
payment execute approved payment paypal
payment payments payment payment ID
execute so this is not what I don't like
the EDD execute but update payment show
payment details so if the API is nice I
think there is almost nothing to do so
you or what you only need to do is to do
to define let's see whether we find
something else to define you know the
data here this is the de main challenge
and even in this case the credit card if
you look at this is almost self-evident
you know what it actually comprises so
instead of folk
generation I would focus on the quality
and I know that it's hard in larger
companies but this is a no you always
have to reason why you're doing
something like this and to generate to
generate code is always you know
suspicious at first so on I will wait
with that so are we were you know there
are lots of questions and because i
restarted the show there were no
questions from chat and no questions
from Twitter which is a good thing
because it was a record time for
tweeting questions and we drive one
report so we had 20 questions in about
one hour and so again what I did last
week I had a bad feeling because you
know if you look just at the because of
a lot there were no to a one month
without any screencast so I recorded the
most asked question the screen casa de
will have five screen cars in a row I've
sang in one day I just recorded a couple
of them and we're also records have
still some ideas what to do so watch my
youtube stream and so and thank you for
watching and see you an upcoming
workshops actually they're around the
corner and particular looking forward to
both of them and this is also well
attended in in December so if you would
like to come do we get again you know
attendees from all over the world so
thank you for watching see you at
conferences a hex watch my youtube
stream my block and and enjoy java and
java ee x</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
