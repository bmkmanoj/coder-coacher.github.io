would like to show you how to use Java
e8 CDI dependency injection in plain
Java SE and for this purpose I would
like to create a java SE maven project
and call it CDI SE stands for standard
edition and then at a single dependency
here so I need the dependencies tag but
this dependency to the reference
implementation which is weld so weld as
e and this is the dependency in scope is
test because I plan to write a unit test
so Jane retest comm air hex CDI se
injection in plain Java test so we have
that and then of course we need a method
inject to test that probably injection
would be a better name injection test
injection so now we need some classes to
inject so the most important class is of
course coffee so coffee and then drink
and the result is great so we have that
and we need developer and we would like
to inject the coffee to the developer so
we have the developer and the developer
of course has to be application scoped
this is what developer would like to be
Singleton's and inject coffee coffee and
then string develop and what the
developer would like to do is first
first to drink some coffee and then to
do some work development almost ADSL so
we have this so now we need AB in 6 ml
which is diploma descriptor so it was
created but it was created in resources
main and it has to be in test resources
because we are
in test mode we are in test mode right
now so this is good I only would like to
increase it to one one so done so we
have coffee and developer and now let's
boot the container so s e container
initializer initializes the so creates
itself so initialize a then with the
initializer we can create a container
and then I story is it is auto plausible
so we can use try with three sources
so let's do this so we have to
initialize method and then this
initialize comes with select and what I
can select is the developer taught class
and what I get back is a lazy developer
why lazy lazy developer because it's an
instance so and now till lazy developer
get and now I get the developer so and
the developer should not be not this is
also important in practice so we have
that and develop and we get a message
back and just print it out and of course
at least a search ha assert that know
assert that message
contains string and it should be great
so this is what comes from coffee coffee
so we have that and now see whether it
works so launch that so and we have
great development and everything is
green and we even performed this
crisscross screencast in test-driven
development mode so um thank you for
watching and see you on upcoming
conferences workshops projects or even
yeah exit mini app at Munich Airport so
thank you and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
