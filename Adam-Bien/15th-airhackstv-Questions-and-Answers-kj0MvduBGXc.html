0 actually I got lots of tweets and
questions you know I can dig the people
cannot attend Dax in june because of
vacations or in july because of
vacations and when is the next day the
next day is going to be in in december
from december 7th to 11th and the whole
week because i will also give an
JavaScript day and html5 day I have no
time for special days earlier so this
would be D you know the only x44 window
x4 for this year and even more
interesting I forgot to mention that
three javaone sessions were accepted and
one is particularly interesting so what
I did I got an idea and I registered the
first time ever above there's a feather
session and the titleist most popular
java each question and answers from the
EXT v life so actually your questions
and my answers it is going to be live
from java one I have no idea whether I
will be able to stream but at least I
will record everything I can and and and
then post it later so this is what will
happen after jawan and and what I will
try to do is know to organize some BF
possible if not of course not so we have
to we get the regular Cola and coke and
and water from from Java one but if
possible I would try to do something and
two other sessions want a sensation and
from Mike macro to micro services and
back is another java ee 7 session I will
probably code a little bit and and and
implement some stuff on stage or code
this was question 0 so the next official
question its twenty years of java so as
as you probably know this year this year
this week or last week we celebrated 20
years of java for me it would be is like
two two two two two years actually so i
started with java in 1995 and i'm free
lenses since 1997 so i was was a
freelancer and always take with java and
why why i also interested in this
in this topic because it explains a lot
wire for instance like j to your java
and not just you know using each other
year different framework and what I did
is I i looked at the version history of
java from wikipedia in standard 1995 and
i started with alpha or beta of java and
the whole history was our C++ programmer
back then and someone mentioned that
there is an oak or Java cannot even
remember is the Thule object-oriented
programming language and I back then I
try to get the object-oriented
programming with C++ right and I think
there was worthy templates were about to
come out or at least they didn't worked
out Linux properly so i tried to make it
make it run and then I saw Java and the
first time what I saw this was an applet
with the Duke and I was I don't know I
couldn't understand why it is so
exciting you know to see animated Duke
all the time but then I stick the java
and i would say in after a few weeks or
month i got the first project and they
happen to be the mini projects like
implementation of a proxy server and an
editor and then around 1996-1997 i was
asked to implement an e-commerce shop
and the problem was I had no idea about
CGI which was very popular common
gateway interface this was CGI back then
so i used to java web server and the
java web server was the first
implementation from sun microsystems and
and it was it understood servlets and
javaserver pages and we implement the
whole solution which the java web server
and it worked actually great the problem
is we only had servlets nothing else so
we had to implement our own persistence
layer with jdbc and transactions and
connection pooling there was no
connection pools back then so are we
implemented everything actually and
around 1997-1998 ejbs came out which
interestingly with pojos as
configurations that there was no xml so
you had to implement pojos little dsl
like language
and poachers were sooo allies in the red
by the application server but no one was
interested about pojos back then because
XML was sexier so there are lots of
books and the resources about XML so the
M you know the subsequent versions of eg
bees were xml-based and I was not very
interested in EG bees because for me it
was too complicated back then
particularly with the realized
deployment descriptors which were really
hard to handle and around jdk 11 as you
can see we got javabeans and jdbc java
database connectivity and our MI remote
method invocations or what started
implementation of application service
and what's funny what I remember was
jdbc we used prior to jdk 11 direct for
instance or occur or db2 connections so
you had to use the Oracle connection
instead of Java sequel connections for
instance and yeah and as jdbc came out I
got you know lots of people of project
complaints or why we need gdb see we
have already oracle and db2 drivers and
jdbc is not a huge improvement and what
also happened at the same time GMS came
out i think other around 1997 there was
exactly the same discussion like why we
need GMS if we have already emco serious
for java i think the library is called
client emco serious client for java it
was from IBM and it was similar to GMS
but not standardized so you saw
everywhere come IBM whatever and it was
of course more powerful than GMS because
GMS was just a set of interfaces and
back then i attempted it was 1997-1998
to to to to introduce JMS instead of
using directly the the IBM classes and i
always go to know from from developers
the the feedback i don't know we don't
need it forget it why you are using GMS
if you just can rely on em is and
what's funny right now no one even comes
to the idea or many developers not even
know that GMS is just a set of
interfaces and not
and and not a banner implementation and
this is particularly funny because right
now I hear you know the statements like
GMS cannot scale or GMS is too slow and
this is completely wrong because GMS are
just interfaces this can be fast or slow
it really depends the performance and
scalability depends on the
implementation and not the interfaces so
um this was interesting and remote
method invocation what we did back then
we started to implement our own
application service they don't know
there we first started with Singleton's
and then they we get some concurrency
issues and then we saw it just do what
now they're all application servers are
doing right now and what also happened i
remember right now is this a WT i think
prior to jdk 11 there was only one event
i think it was called event handler
which handled all all the UI events and
after GDK 11 we got like in our action
performed and all this finer events so
this was also a huge story and of course
we go to reflection and Bank 10 also
there was a discussion of why we need
reflection what also happened a little
bit later i think around jdk 13 jan di
came out java naming in directory
interface and this was exactly the same
discussion again you know why we need
Jay and I i if we have MDS and the S
stands for novell directory services and
there was one of the of the i would say
main drivers to have jndi and as well
ldap lightweight access protocol ldap
lightweight directory access protocol
exactly and with jdk 12 so on or 20 we
got the java plugin so far for the
applets and cobra was integrated
collections were huge so this was also
an interesting so back then we got in
jdk 11 there was no collection framework
so we used a lot of third party
collection products and you had to buy
them I actually forgot the name so if
someone knows from chat please remember
me so it was there were three or four
which we evaluated and we use them and
JDK one to introduce an own collections
frame
look and Ross the same discussion like
right now right why we need collections
we have already to make so many
collections framework so why GDK
introduces an own collection framework
and right now I don't even know whether
we have commercial still commercial
collection frameworks all of these
frameworks are gone and JDK 13 came
synthetic proxy classes which is
actually huge the modern most of the
modern application service are using you
know a proxy generation based on
synthetic proxy classes there's the
class proxy I think
java.lang.reflect.method.invoke spot and
hotspot acquired I think son acquired
hotspot from from from from from another
company there was integrated to jdk 13
and what it was is like a mixed mode it
was evaluated bytecode at runtime and
decided whether the bytecode should be
optimized or or or translated to native
code or be interpreted and so jdk 14
which was just a little improvements or
lock we go logging and XML parses and
now I think now we have modern JDK so I
will just keep that because I think what
we can of course mention a little bit
jdk 18 which is another revolution and
yeah this was actually my my my way of
being a Java enthusiast and what I have
to what I have to say it was a widest
you know this introduction this history
of Java because I get the same the same
statements over and over again right now
I got several comments like why we need
MVC model view controller in Java 8 if
we have spring MVC and or view wrapped
up for instance or why we need to know
jpa if we have hibernate or eclipselink
so it seems like you get the same
questions over and over again and a few
years later and the one even asks why
jpa is suitable because everyone uses
jpa and and less and less projects are
are depending on on eclipselink
hibernate or open jpa so this was a 20
years of java and what i have to say is
Chavez tolix
writing to me I really enjoyed and a lot
and I learned a lot and the problem is
Java is so huge ecosystem so if you
learn a particular thing you will forget
something else so you can learn the
whole time it's like you know iterative
learning and you're also forgetting all
the time because of our garbage
collection mechanism in our brain so it
gets never boring so this was a short
introduction of 20 years of java I would
just briefly look at a chance nothing in
chat nothing in the Twitter so so let's
do the very first question and this was
a meter question oh by the way what I
wanted to mention as well the Java a
bootstrap course the online bootstrap
course is the second most popular course
after Scala f by Bill vanners and igual
at Polly's which is also remarkable you
know Java EE and second most popular
course people tend to you know to think
Java is boring but it seems like it is
actually really really interesting and
exciting so thank you for for for for
buying the course here and now what I'm
using for recordings I got several times
it's in question and really depends all
right now i'm using Wirecast pro which
is a streaming tool and i'm recording
the screen with now is called ScreenFlow
and i'm using final cut for processing
and compressor for compression and
several smaller tools so there's lots of
two links and i need all these tools
because usually I use the same the same
tooling for former VPN sessions with my
clients or is nothing special here I
just using the same infrastructure and
yeah I have our green screen it's not a
green screen is a green sheet and I'm
not very happy with the green sheet so a
proper will paint the wall green but I'm
just too lazy right now so this was the
major question so I'm another question
and then the real question the first one
is moving a process from I Easter over
to a micro service
maybe rest on a live system without
impacting the users or how to do this so
I'm if you would do something without
impacting the users you have basically
you know two possibilities or indeed MDD
simple as possible one is to have
something like a chai proxy or a kind of
proxy and the problem with our proxy
sees if they fail everything will fail
so what you could also do you could have
shared nothing architecture with for
instance infinite span or a hazel cast
and store the information on which IP
what is running so you will not have any
downtime but i think what without
impacting users so what it could mean a
persistent session so the main problem
of the of the high availability are HTTP
sessions I try to ignore them in my
project so if so what we assume is if
the server goes down the user will have
to relock in usually it's not not a
problem at all and and the yeah the ddd
business department or the product
illnesses has to know know this but if
you have to have persistent HTTP session
either you will store it into database
which is slow or you can asynchronously
replicate the session which is fast but
not consistent or you could use hazel
cast which can also is not always
consistent but it's usually good enough
so for instance if you use pyara this is
the card and hardened application server
pyara pyara know this is pyara this is
the github but there is pi r co uk this
is basically glassfish with based on
open-source infrastructures or what it
uses it uses hazel cast to store the
session information for instance in high
availability mode so then it would be
more available so um you could do this
of course the main problem is but is not
ask here if you're from analytic system
you can rely usually on a seed
transactions if you go to the micro
service route there are no more acid
transaction usually now usually
no more no more acid transactions and
what it means is you will have to
rethink the business logic or you know
think about competitive transaction so
basically you will have to change the
business logic so let's see what there
are any questions no questions here no
questions in the chat hopefully I just
ask okay so oh now it's the visibility
of instance variables inside egb our
stott taught to use trig visibility as
possible that mean that means in most
cases private yes i will also taught
this as well but the question is what
happens if you just keep private and
usually the answer is nothing so and so
now will complain and i think java
developers as i cannot i never saw that
the java developer will attempt you know
to access the private feeds directly or
public feeds directly so on the always
used method so actually there's not
another huge danger in the project and
the reason why i'm using this you can
just try it at home so i would just
install one of my projects and this is
and we just use the maven project from
archetype this is what i wanted to do
and if you go to the bc archetype and i
would say this is a dax edition and it
will create a sample project it was lots
of injected package private fields and
now i'll show you the reason why I'm
doing this so let's say boundary
registrations you see or everything is
injected what is it's not it's not
private adjust package private alt
command T and I'm in the test and what
you can see I can very easily mock out
all the fields so this is the actual
reason so i'm just not using private
because testing
is a lot easier the next question i
usually get is yet but you could use a
no you can introduce constructors and
setters additional constructors and
digital setters but additional
constructors and additional setters are
additional artifacts which are not
needed and why to write more code if
it's not necessary and I actually never
saw that someone attempted not to break
this and also you have to think that
never the egb is never injected what is
injected already proxies not to eat your
peas okay so the next question do you
agree that concept of Egypt be poon is
dead end it is actually very good
question and the question go goes
further is if you could use no
applications corpor Singleton's it would
be equally powerful and I think it
really depends how its implemented so
what is the big benefit of pulling the
big benefit of pooling is that you have
control you know about the parallel
execution so what you can easily do you
can you can put you know that in
additional instances associate them with
a thread pool and you can you can
configure the thread pool and of course
you can configure the max pool size so i
usually use the pooling to to control
the maximum the maximal amount of
parallelism in a system or to implement
throttling and without up a pool is
going to be harder so you will have to
use an oath I don't know properly
dedicated the North red boots for
Singleton's something so it's going to
be harder and also um I think Red Hat
JBoss back then they did a study about
pulling versus Singleton's and and and
pulls scaled better so I actually forgot
the talk there was on talk from I think
mark littell even about pulling the
walls I don't know five six years back
and and they actually proved that the
pulling comes with scalability and
performance benefits and if you have
Wi-Fi right now and you activate poulenc
you will see a lot better performance so
in a default case if you deploy EG bees
they run as a singleton so they are not
pulled but if you activate the pool
afterwards you will you will you will
you will encounter a far far better
performance however actually write a
post about this and measure the
performance difference I actually wanted
to do this but no time for this okay I
hope answered how do you test with our
Killian arrest jax-rs method and by the
way I usually use arquillian just for
special cases I never use our Killian
for do you know for the for the usual
flow so I just for usual testing I
always use unit testing for this but I
actually testing starting jax-rs with
arquillian it's actually good idea to CD
jason structures so i thought about this
is if i start you know with rest
services it would be actually nice just
to have the boundary with the rest
endpoints and jason and then we could
and then we could just you know the test
a client and see how it feels and
without any implementation of the
business logic so I'm it's actually good
idea so the answer is I never did this
but I better think about this and what i
would do is to start tummy even jetty or
jersey just use jersey with nothing else
and then with our Killian you could just
no deploy your boundary with mock out
your audio resource with mock out
boundary and this should work out of the
box and in the next open source project
I will actually try it and then check it
in so we will write a post about this so
I don't have any examples but I would
what I wouldn't do is an ode to start
the full application server just to test
the rest so if you just would like to
rest you could just start rest easy or
Jersey should be should be good enough
so another question Robert is the long
friend of the show why or why you should
use web sockets and he asked me you know
there are 22 ideas long polling or web
sockets why web sockets are better so
first what are the disadvantages of web
sockets the disadvantages are you have
to configure the proxies firewalls and
potentially the d
the web servers to accept socket
connections but the same is partially
true for long polling so what we did we
kill to his long polling Apache
instances because we are able to know
the application server was able to
handle thousands of block connections
but Apache died with too many
connections so it is something similar
with HTTP so what is the main benefit is
if you look at the web sockets pack the
overhead is negligible it's like a view
bytes overhead per message in long
polling you get the HTTP overhead which
is orders of magnitude higher than long
polling when it when it makes a
difference if you have lots of smaller
messages then the web sockets our way to
go it's really hard to do it with long
polling also web sockets is a
bi-directional protocols you can pass
messages back and forth and with long
polling it it is actually
uni-directional from server to client
and you will need another connection
usually to send you know the payload
from client to server and web socket is
as well integrated to Java is security
as as Jax arises so there's actually no
difference is the same story and with
long polling you've always the problem
if the server break speed between the
messages the messages can get lost so
you will actually have to remember what
you send to the client what was the last
message and store it somewhere if you
would like to have persistent delivery
and with WebSockets is a little bit more
safer because there is no waiting time
between the poles so you can just you
know if you push it you push it so and
you can even wait on the server side
until you the message arrives on the
client so to summarize WebSocket is non
blocking its as bi-directional protocol
is this Java independent but really well
integrated to Java EE is very simple and
the problem is of course is a binary
protocols we have to prod to configure
the infrastructure properly and long
polling is basically a hike so what is a
little bit better than long apologies
sse service send events it is like long
polling with a predefined format so you
open the connection then you sent a
thing semicolon separated list of items
so
then look at sse i hope so but from the
management perspective you know it is
hard to argue because you know managers
or higher level product owners don't
care about the low level protocols so i
would say websocket is more like GMS
topics i would say is very similar but
similar to GMS topics without the
overhead of without the administration
or administrative overhead okay question
number eight the next one and meanwhile
i will just look at whether i have some
questions here in the chat no questions
the chat no questions in the twitter so
our lazy audience which is a very good
sign because it could be the fastest a
hex show so far so since introduction of
GSF 20 jsps are considered as duplicated
view technology i understand that there
will be just please come back with MVC
Oh slovak says yes GSP's are deprecated
because we are faceless in GSF but GSP's
outside jsf are not deprecated so on and
MVC is not GSF so and someone is here
let's wait a second I got no there are
nope one of the spec answered wits so
the Samantha dream is the one of the
spec it from from from mvcc's okay there
are different templating engines like
free market handlebars mustache what's
that time leavin don't even know it and
velocity so you can use a lots of
templating engine you don't you don't
have to stick with chess piece but if
you ask me jazz piece are really nice so
it's not like what's hard with Jas
pieces views in all directions descrip
'let's this is what makes it harder if
you if you if you implement java code
within the GSP but as templating
language chess piece are excellent
actually very easy you get a really nice
support in netbeans out of the box like
auto completion there's a really nice so
I would say GSP's will come back also
for for for for other reasons and the
problem right now with with single page
s pas single page applications is that
if you put push everything to the
browser you will have to do you know the
latency is too high so that it takes too
long until the browser is able to create
the whole application so what the major
website vendors are doing they have a
hybrid approach where they prepare the
templates on the server and and send it
prepared to the client and the client
just pulls from the server whatever the
dips whatever changed and for this
preparation you could perfectly use jsps
and in some project we even created
angular services which were generated by
jsps because we have some very instr so
jsps are actually great GSP's and GSXR
duplicated this is right so perfect
Thank You Slovak and now the question I
would like to know what is your thoughts
about MVC specification seems a bit a
little bit late to me than you think and
this too late I had to think about this
a lot too late and I have to say this
never too late so if you observe our IT
community and there are really
frameworks tools and hardware which came
really late and they and they just one i
remembers the iphone came out i hear a
lot of know Apple is way too late so the
others big vendors already there if you
look right now an iphone is quite
popular and Android was emulator is
still still popular so it is never too
late and in my feeling list it is right
it is the right timing actually because
right now we have more there are enough
projects out there which gained
experience with angularjs MBG as jsf and
we can talk a little bit more freely
about this you know two years ago to as
lots of religious religious fights
between gfs and struts and rails and now
we can just be more objective about this
and the question is what is the V it is
also interesting
this where the V should be on the server
on the client and what you should do
look at my interview with skylight this
is a startup that it was at the stylet
founder attended the heck show the heck
show DX workshops and and yes she is
really impressive here's impressive Java
startup in Munich and they use a
server-side rendering and the ND page is
beautiful if you go to the page it
doesn't look like a typical enterprise
you know enterprise application is more
like I don't know typical fashion side
and they use server-side rendering
because of SEO because of the crawlers
of the of the robots so if you use the
view on the on the client side it is
harder for the Google robot to to to
index the page you will have to use
frameworks like pre-render for instance
which comes with additional effort but
if you use server-side rendering
technologies like radius jsf MVC you
will be i would say preferred by the
robots and the end in the search engines
so you you also have to take this into
consideration by developing web apps so
and the question is about je vs pink i
just don't know why i should use je my
projects were spring can do the same as
jg application and I get such questions
a lot and remember what I thought you
about you know J&amp;amp;E I and nds and and JPA
and and hibernate in fact as high as jpa
came out the Gavin king of hibernate and
gave an interview and said whenever
possible use jpa and we only cannot live
with a standard then use hibernate
specific features and so the question is
why I explained ISM is so much about the
history of Java because
with as Java I came out I could rely on
a set of api's and if you learn this ap
is you will be able to write your
application to whatever survey like so
this is actually d because you only are
coding against the API and there's a
symbol jar API and it contains
everything so there is no need to know
to think about I don't know just
downloading something it is just comes
out of the box and you just write your
business logic period and and spring
could be a nice implementation of MVC I
don't know where those fingers
interested in implementing the MVC
specification it shouldn't be a lot of
effort it would be nice but there's
another really nice framework v raptor
and it also came before MVC and it looks
really nice and this video apto
hopefully will implement the MVC
standard so look at this it's a really
nice framework very well integrated with
CDI and EG bees are tested already so um
it is never too late and the question is
why je veux spring is different
philosophy no spring innovates but it's
just implementations an open source
project and java he looks at different
implementations and there are enough
implementations they can come to the
idea oh it would be nice to have an API
and just do it so this is the difference
and the question is no why you should
use gdb see if you have oracle driver
it's the same question I'm very happy
with no Oracle connection why I should
use driver for name and load the the
driver connection indirectly if I just
if I just could use no new Oracle
connection and and it works the same is
basically the same so it's more
philosophical question for me because I
stick with Java for 20 years I would
just like you know to write code against
the API and don't bother about you know
any particular framework but people just
look like spring and don't like you know
the AP is and of course spring and
hibernate eclipselink the repeater will
be always more innovative and and and
always more oh it's called
we'll have more features than Java
because Java is just an abstraction so
it should be no innovation in Java and
there is actually no innovation just
abstraction so briefly look at the any
questions and any idea on dates for
December 2015 ax yet can't make in July
so this was one of my questions and and
what would I it is where a second what
was it it was december the seventh to
11th is going to be so and this is I
have no question don't understand
anything but but because i'm starting
with java alejandro why you are not
understanding anything because I don't
showing any code so usually I code a
little bit more so it is more
understandable this is just short show
with question but it is it should be
better nice so so um someone asked me on
youtube adam is there any way to
download examples you showing your
videos usually not so I I hacked the
exam examples along with the video I
don't prepare them in advanced but if I
get an idea everything whatever is a
more mature I try to publish it to my
github account if you go to github Adam
bean for instance so you can see this
Java example but here you will find a
lot of lots of open source projects and
this is what i would i share if I can
and what I also do if you go to Ken I
can i drip it slow and to java ee
patterns and best practices book and
source code and then hex you will find a
lot of stuff if you look for hex and
what i do i submit you know some code
snippets from
conference talks and sessions but not
from my screencasts why because usually
the code is just you know low quality
code and this also low quality but
people ask me for this whoever tends the
session would like to download this so
so this is the question and the question
number 12 someone is using the
afterburner java vicks framework and the
idea of the framework is there are
actually three parts so um we get let's
see whether I could show you this life
you project and by the way and someone
asked me which netbeans ide i'm using
because it is able to do a lot more
javascript stuff if you look carefully
i'm always used to daily builds because
it comes with better JavaScript and
html5 support a lots of interesting
stuff as well so i barely use the
released version I usually always used
to release the daily daily builds it's a
problem with that some sometimes you
will see the exception window know if
some features not implemented so you
usually once see in the release also
someone asked me the question earlier oh
this is wrong what I wanted to use is
the archetype and chrome I X is the
right name and there is the igniter
which is a java fix sample project and
the question is really interesting and I
show you the reasons in a second so it
tried to pull the archetype definition
from the internet and it actually worked
so the question is I have a dashboard
view here which is usually empty then I
have a dashboard presenter with
dependency injection which is not empty
and I have to dash pot if XML which
defines the view and the question is why
the dependency injection does not work
in the view and the answer is this view
represents this so what it what it means
it is charged
it just cares about for instantiated dis
and two for the for for the for the
layout for the components and you
shouldn't implement any business logic
here what you could do you can override
some methods so if i go here and say
override method there could be a method
get view and what you could do is you
can you know add additional components
kinder components or whatever but it's
not meant to implement the business law
under the presentation logic and the
dashboard presenter is loaded by the
view and if you go here and see edit you
will see the presenter here so call me a
hex follow me dashboard dashboard
presenter so they are bound here there
are actually two parts which stick
together and the presenter is loaded by
the java fix runtime and here the
dependency injection is working so so
the idea is this never changes this is
just no idea fix the scene builder is
used for for layout the dashboard
presenter contains the presentation
logic and here you can injective Ephixa
melody inject and what you inject with
ed inject is either configuration orgy
services so we have two parts presenter
is to present our controller this is the
purest igloo there should be no business
logic no injection and and the for
instance tower is the service which is
just a poacher so this is the basic idea
and because this are this both are
separated the idea is to know don't
implement any business logic here put
your business logic here ok so we are
done with the official questions but not
right so first i have here twitter write
your business logic exactly so we
covered this but what i did yesterday i
said last chance to to ask questions
and and people ask questions so first
question is about Dhaka so what darkest
I would just make the font larger and
and he asked me whether I separate data
only container in my case so on my
server I don't do this because if I
started with Daka it was I think the
version 0 3 and 0 4 there was no data
containers there was just ambassador
pattern I think it started but there was
no data only container so what i use i
have a for instance the big container
which in my case on my block is I think
Derby yes they're very hyper Sonic I hey
now H SQL to there's already posed a
stored so I have one image with called
block TB and it comes with the with the
H SQL DB version 2 and it comes with
volume mapped to the host to the
container so it contains the data so
there is no separate data container but
what is the benefits of having data
container and explicit one the benefits
are you could connect to the same
container from other container and used
backup for instance so it would be
better and I would do it right now i
will use data containers and another
interesting case for data containers are
log files so what you could do you can
create one data container with just
called an old logging and all containers
could use this container for logging so
you have all log files in a centralized
place so it's a good idea I don't use it
yet but as I mentioned several times i
created my a new hardware new server and
i'm in if i will find some time i will
transfer all my stuff to the new server
and then i will improve the all my
daugher infrastructure even further and
if you're interested I can show you
something in screencaps or he had in a
hex and this is a nice question so this
is bidirectional bi-directional
reference so we have a dress and users
and users have a dress at addresses
users and as you can see this is a dress
name address ID
and we have met by address ID and the
question is why it doesn't work so and
and or why it does work so the question
when I start the server and run the
project I get different address ID in
the user table when I save the formula Y
and it works as designed so if I key
because we have Java and we have a great
and we have our great specifications I
look it up and you see the example here
bi-directional one-to-one relationships
so we have one-to-one get assigned
cubicle and set aside cubicle and here
we have employee has a cubicle and you
can see map by assigned cubicle so you
are mapping you are mapping to the
attributes not to the foreign keys so
what you should or to the primary keys
you should forget the database layout
and you should use the relations that
met by should refer to the field not the
not the column in the database and then
it should work next question is what
this one and this one comes with a
little bit longer or the question is one
interface two implementations and the
two implementations have to be switched
on and off without recompiling and the
question is how it works is it possible
yes I even describe it in my book in the
green book real world java patterns and
it is you can do it with stereotypes so
you can have stereotypes and and and put
the alternative on the stereotype so
what will happen then is it will
deactivate both sides but you can
reactivate one side in benzac similans a
great story about this you could have
multiple implementations a hole in a
hierarchy of classes let's say
connection and no sequel connection and
rational connection then we have let's
say connection pool no sequel and
relational and then which one entry in
the bin 6ml you can activate you know
the no sequel all the Oracle part which
is basically a bridge pattern for free
so you can absolutely do it and just
think about use and stereotype put
alternative in the stereotype
give the stereotype are nice name and if
you mention the stereotype in bins XML
with I think alternatives stereotype tag
it will work so next question is how can
I simulate a java application deployed
with dr. on AWS with thousands of users
to test scalability can you show a
practical example I cannot show you a
practical example but actually what AWS
is there is no difference between AWS
and I will say a local linux instance so
what you will have to do is you will
have to prepare locally your your linux
image with daca which can be installed
usual you as one command dhaka and then
put your application on it and then you
can start thousands of AWS images or you
can start on one images thousand of
instances a practical example i don't i
don't have practical example because
this is more example about you know the
the infrastructure but we did it for for
testing and what you can also do of
course in Dhaka's particularly you could
start a jmeter with jamie 10 minus n in
headless mode and you know and perform
the nail of service attacks of your own
server so on it is actually easy if you
manage to do this on your local linux
machine it will work should work without
any problems on AWS so um what's
interesting i got now a nice question
four hours ago from gilbert toca for
some who knows for someone who knows
java works with spring spring data
spring security in jsf and wants to
study land which java but doesn't know
where to start if you book appropriate
isn't outdated my book is not outdated
but i have no idea whether it is
appropriate so I'm if then you see our i
would say real world night hacks is
thinner than the green one and it
describes actually in my block
infrastructure and and why I did
particular decisions is not outdated it
still works that way now it comes with a
little bit more features hazel cast i
could probably one day upgraded but the
principles will remain the same and how
to start
what I would do if you have a hobby just
implement an application for this
weather are recipes or running or I
don't know what you know DVD collection
just implement a simple application from
scratch try to use as few annotations in
Java EE technology as only possible and
put the business logic there i think
there's the best possible way to learn
and it's a problem with java ee there
are lots of api's but you don't use them
you don't need everything if you now
implement a simple application you will
probably know start with with this
dependency injection than jpa and then
you are already go go pretty far and i
started the maven archetype the bit CBC
archetype look at this this is a small
best practice how I see boundary control
entity pattern and if you look at this
and try to modify this is also I think a
nice way to learn so what I mentioned so
this is what I what I started here at
the beginning Dax it comes with testing
and comes with registrations
applications a very simple one with rest
interface and two components boundary
you have the resource with injection I
will look at this make it run and then
modify it and try to store something
different so I already know at web
sockets to it or something like this so
this is what I do all the time so don't
spend too much time with books I would
say take a little bit more this would be
my my suggestion here we just look at d
yeah Mycroft sighs this is useful for
load testing with AWS so there is the
dresser block and there are two TM one
client of my use the loader I think all
loaded ra is this so also a web hosting
tool so there's lots of of testing tools
for this so I hope so the online course
this is what I mentioned so
yes perfect and what I found actually so
I will shout show you at the end I I am
here in the in the virtual machine show
all windows this is the window and what
I was able to launch here java studio
and I don't know who remembers this and
as you can see it runs like crazy what's
funny was back then it was critically
one of the first IDEs like a dependency
injection even IDs it was connection of
javabeans back and forth and let's tree
there are some examples and you see this
is the jihad browser how fast it is and
help about javis to do you see it runs
in jdk 113 and they were the origin
engineers back then who created the in
1997 so a piece of history i would try
to find the java workshop i have to
install somewhere but it is actually
amazing it it still runs and this is
virtualized my machine and how click it
is really how quick it is really amazing
so and you can start with the designing
the application or let's say can I just
make it smaller
and then what I can do you can I can you
can put buttons and give two buttons a
name and there was a cool pipes actually
data flows and you can have database
beans and you can create a know if I say
run it generate applet application
javabeans package design so an
application finish so and this is my
application so I generated you know from
1997 and JDK 113 application with Java
Studios one of the first licenses i
bought as IDs it was java studio and
java studio workshop with some funny
background so this is a piece of history
20 years of java i will just briefly
look at d no questions are no questions
and let's see I just post it to Java ok
so I i would say thank you for watching
and see our upcoming conferences
workshops in july and most of you are in
in vaca on vacation so the next one is
going to be in december and of course
hopefully the first monday of the month
so it would be the next month regular
and send me questions I will answer them
once a month and thank you for watching
and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
