like to show you how to integrate jax-rs
with bean validation in Java 7 so let's
start as I would like to create a very
simple project called bean validation
and I would like to use the GlassFish v4
and just use configure jax-ur as first
which is which works as usual who would
like to have a class called a class
jax-rs configuration almost the name
actually doesn't matter I won't fix the
spelling right now resources is a let's
do it
just jax-rs calm configuration and it
has to extend an application but the
application has to come from jax-rs
so now jax-rs is configured what we also
need is a package xbv so what we also
need is a resource class and I call this
messages resource and it's going to be
annotated with messages messages and I
would like to introduce a method method
which returns a message and we don't
have the message yet so let's create us
and this is going to be a regular class
annotated with Chuck's be so I would
like to rely on field for serialization
and I would like to use the class for
XML serialization or JSON serialization
so a single parameter called
content should be sufficient so two
constructors and one to string or stiff
drink
to a string okay it looks nice and of
course what you would like to have is we
would like to return the message new
message Duke
42 and and I would like to safety
message with post and displayed on the
server so arm got message plus message
so let's deploy the application and one
our very first time first test
resources slash mess juice looks good
copy that to our terminal
so curl still works what I'm more
interested in in Jason so let's try
Jason because it's easier to I forgot
accept so now we got Jason so what you
can also do I can specify right now is
the content type application Jason and
yes looks nice
then I would like to use post so - -
exposed and then the data is going it's
a data is going to be content type
with some escape characters just the
first one this is this and this and the
Orion oh and the Olli and the Ori
was this one so no news good news let's
try this - II know content looks nice
now let's validate this so Duke 42 as
one two three four five six characters
so let's try to break this so how to
validate a message so we can use bean
validation I would lies like to use the
annotation called size with min equals 1
and max equals 5 because we had 6 let's
start with 2 between 2 and 5 and I will
also have to use annotation coming from
bean validation called valid and what it
means actually it means that these
checks are s runtime should validate the
message so let's retry this so what we
got back is bad requests which is
actually nice because our request is too
long so let's go back it's too long and
this works so this was a brief
introduction to jax-rs Java 7 and bean
validation and see you at one of
upcoming conferences projects or even
workshops at Munich Airport called
a hex and or perhaps a hex i/o the
online version of the workshops so thank
you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
