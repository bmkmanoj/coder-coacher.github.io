are lots of automation scripts with NASA
on in Java 8 and I would like to show
how to do it this little trick with
gallop and nice one so for this purpose
I will create a project and this is
going to be a very simple straight java
library and call that automation so
there is an automation library and i
would like to use gulp as a helper I was
show you in a second and what I intend
to do is the following so I just delete
the default script and we use this
instead so what is supposed to do is the
following it will watch all changes in
source source folders or JS files and
our changes in the world initiate
initiate the copy task and the copy task
will copy of course the script to the
destination folder which happens to be a
folder which contains all my scripts
which are in path so i can just execute
the script from wherever I like so I'm
to write a script I would just would
like to start with the last one
directive so what it actually says is
use to the operating system use the nass
one as a scripting system scripting
language the nasa own interpreter jjs
and then just very simply i would say i
would like or before we do this i will
just launched the guard file so i will
say here default run it I have to save
it so again right as you can see it runs
so so I would just implement something
print and say hello save it again as you
can see it copied to the destination
folder only change so hello Duke cop it
again which is really nice and what I
only have to do I go to the terminal I
would like to make the script executable
so let's go to dynamic ranges and then
just go to whatever a fold I like and
then I can execute my Jets hello Duke
and you can see if I change it net
is or God will copied in a background to
the folder and I just have to re-execute
it now we have Duke with two excellent
exclamation marks so thank you for
watching and Syrian upcoming conferences
workshops or even a hex in Munich
Airport ok thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
