and you know welcome to today's question
and answers or what I thought is a lot
easier to answer a couple question at
once instead of writing millions of
comments so I'm just a test can you
actually hear me and see me I think so
it looks great
so um the first question is from my blog
and there Jeff P click asks how to to
convince ivory-tower decision makers to
leave plain old Tomcat and spring in
favor of Java 6 or 7 I wouldn't even try
this so I would say Tomcat and spring a
viable option to Java 6 so if you have
this is the question number one for my
blog this is the from Java click so if
you if you have already Tomcat and
spring and you are satisfied with it
migration to Java 6 or Java 7 will end
up in very similar architecture and even
code so I would say having Tomcat or
jetty with spring or having Java 6 and
application server perfectly viable
options what's a little bit crazy is to
running spring on an Java 6 capable
application server Java even Java 7
capable application server why it's so
crazy yeah because you get lots of the
applications or spring supports
dependency injection CDI and the world
are supporting dependency injection so
the question is why you would like to do
this right so um I would say if you have
Java 6 or Java 7 application server
spring di core spring is it's a little
bit crazy because you get to too many
annotations too much duplications but if
you're running Tomcat on jetty with
spring it is a variable stack to Java 6
but then I would rather invest in a
thing
pivotal is the name of the company
behind spring right now and they have
hardened Tomcat called as I think the
name is t server so I would rather use T
server than Tomcat and then run spring
on T server and whether you spring or
Java six it's not our decision as
architect is rather decision from the
from the customers ponds or whoever has
the money so we as architects or
developers should explain the options or
Java six full stack with nothing with
without any dependencies if possible or
using a spring on jetty or Tomcat so I
think this question is hopefully
answered yes hello is on yet so I think
is answered are you satisfied with the
answer if no then write me drop me a
tweet or chat or write something to chat
let's see whether you are actually
satisfied so there is no feedback no
news are good news so let's approach
with the next one actually pick all the
questions for my block so and this were
dddd latest questions so and there's
half how asks do I even need or ask it
states actually is excerpt from his
comment do I need even need a Java EE
monster so I would argue no Java a
monsters anymore so if you use a
reasonable application server like for
instance now it's called GlassFish
whitefly tommy of course Tommy's are not
even you know a cute insect I would say
is very very lean so it is not not
monster at all and even the web series
is it's pretty lean right now so um the
web celebrity profile is very very very
small one so it's not a question of size
I would say scalability can be achieved
at a much lower price so actually in
Java there is no price so you get the
most application service for free and if
you if you like you can you can buy
support but this actually not mandatory
which is good so so
one point of time if your company
becomes successful uf will have to make
the decision would you like to buy
support and save time or if you have
time you don't have to buy the support
so actually this is the decision and for
instance I've I bought support for my
Linux box for for for Linux operating
systems there's actually not unusual to
buy support but you don't have to and
this is actually a good business and
then state something like in terms of
learning curve and complexity so the
problem with the statement is actually
at the end of the days you will end up
having something like Java or at least
you will you would like to have
dependency injection you would like to
have a some notion of configuration of
data sources and and connection pooling
you would probably also have you would
like to have transactions or at least
something like binding context to
threats or scope and of course you would
like to have proxies so um you can get
rid of Java EE completely and just
developed for half-year and then at the
end of the day you will end up with
having something similar and I did it
actually several times before j2ee so we
build lots of application servers web
framers whatever but the one point of
time you have to concentrate on business
logic and from my point of view Java is
six or Java is six and seven and even
Java five were perfectly viable for most
enterprise applications and and and the
teams were absolutely productive with it
and if they concentrate and focus on the
business logic if you focus on the
technology not their business logic they
will end up implementing layers over
layers and patterns and and forget about
your customers yeah and controversial 80
characters makes with so I just um makes
with the typo here
so actually I'm brought I hope later
second I have to get your feedback
otherwise I will have to restart the
whole stream so is the question answered
so is our D questions answered are the
questions answered the
can chat what on answered or not if no
no feedback is good feedback product so
um wait a second just waiting ah how you
would do that which chess are two three
six two three six what do you mean b-26
you mean pulling concurrency utilities I
think and I really world hangs in j2 in
the throttle x-ray for statistic refers
to this static thread pool
static thread pool I forgot actually
what I did
no it wasn't me someone refers to my
open-source project and I started a
project in a train and actually it and
and someone actually took over the
project and and developed two weeks for
full-time and it turned out that was a
think Canadian government and they
wanted to to gather the statistic from
several from several application service
and they implemented the thread pool and
this was before Java 7 and I think they
use static thread pool but I plan to
remove this altogether because I don't
need us and we would like to migrate to
Java 7 and even and the reason I had a
hex brought shop we decided to start a
very lean project is what's called light
moon so with together with the attendees
of the workshop where is it it is an
empty repository and this one who is
going to it be even leaner than the than
the attendee light moon but was actually
a good feedback at least interesting so
question answered yes perfect so I think
I hope from Christian Chi the question
is answered hopefully if not we can
discuss really so we can
move this to the threat pool and and and
replace it with concurrency utilities
and I think the guy who was behind the
the implementation of the thread pool
used asynchronous first but it wasn't
possible to set set the max pool threads
on glass which back then and then he
decided to use the thread pool this is
the whole story
inside a story behind light fish and the
project was light moon right moon oh the
first one this is why I didn't found
this so this is the project and we will
just pick the core from light fish and
start over with Java 7
and of course Java 8 lambdas and all the
goodness okay next one I hope it's
answered Christian Cheon he are you
happy with the answer hopefully yes
thank you
so our controversial 80 characters max
with so I've wrote a blog post that
actually it's ancient comes from ancient
times the 80 characters mix with and I
don't really get it because so if you
create something on or open up a linear
NetBeans you will see later red line
does the 80 with waiting 80 characters
with and I have no problem with it but
sometimes what I saw in projects that
the either you get stretch formatting or
you have to rename your variables and if
you are using lots of lots of generics
and it was actually before before the
diamond operator it wasn't actually
really hard to write expressive code
without breaking the rule so what I just
mean by that it is better to write
expressive code which is was with larger
than 80 characters I would go with one
120 or 160 before I just have to do to
reformat the whole code for 4-inch for
purposes we forgot about just to fit you
know some strange rule from from from
the 60s so this was actually the the
idea of the post about 80 characters
with I got lots of comments and I
actually couldn't even respond because
it was like I mean it was more more
religious topic than
and then actually with with some meta
behind and on that note forget it it's
on now next topic
Java fix and class path so it was a very
basic question what's the deal with Java
Vixen class path so if you if you deploy
Java X sometimes you get problems that
the platform class cannot be found in
sometimes it work
what's the deal with it and so what's
the deal with with thisis I think
starting with Java of JDK one seven
update 45
I think suddenly Java fix old Java fix
classes were in the class path before
this you had to put if you had for
instance used maven you had to push the
jf x RT torch are what I did I put this
as a system dependencies to pom.xml so
it was in the class path and right now
is Jerry key 108 is absolutely no
problem at all as the reasons Java JDK
one seven is also another problem if you
are using an older version of JDK one
seven then you can then you can get some
some some stranger problems like if you
are building with maven it won't find
your classes of if you just start Java
fix from the command line you will have
to put job jf x RT in the class path so
um I hope it's answered all better Gauri
asks from my blog if ok he assumes that
there is some performance implication
was flashing and say if this is true I
would say better to call am clear just
after Ian Flash for better performance
and he I actually this was the question
with hibernate he hurt with open entity
manager and find out the trash can take
some time so how entity manager should
operate so the entity manager for the
duration of the transaction this is the
default behavior they have to remember
all the entities and in case entity
changes
they have to keep track of all the
changes and in the end of the
transaction they call basically flash
and what flash does it flashes the
changes so computes the changes and
flushes the changes to the database and
what commit does it just basically says
JDBC connection commit and so if you
call clear after flash manually what
will happen then it will clear a cache
and we'll just send the DD commit to the
database so on what it actually means in
in in transactional entitymanager
flashing in clearing will have basically
no effect on performance if the entity
manager is extended you you have
sometimes to call clear otherwise you
will end up objects will get more and
more objects your entity manager in so
called unit of work and and you will get
even problems with memory so are you if
you call clear it will basically detach
all the entities and this is sometimes
too much this is why in Java is 6:00
a.m. the DTH was introduced which
basically detaches and single entity
hopefully answers right now ah Christian
she already started to clean light which
I think this is actually the attendee
from the ex and he does something behind
the scenes but I will start with light
money well get some time oh nice to have
my attendees so welcome Christian is
actually he's not as Christian yeah a
Christian ok yes
mantle Paola you stayed you never design
your application by technical structures
if I say never never is relative I would
say most of the time so you shouldn't be
dogmatic in software designs or if I say
never say I attempt not to do this if
there is no other way I will just do it
so um but where you pack exceptions and
this is very interesting question
because of all my recent code reviews
all the exceptions got an exception
package so
and especially if they are used through
the whole project which is also
interesting so where I put exceptions
the the question is not the where I put
the exceptions but where the exceptions
are usually because who cares about me
this is about you know the popularity of
such decisions and if you looked at JDK
Java II for instance I don't think
there's any exception package
so the exceptions are within the package
where the exception can happen so if you
if you I think I hope not think and hope
if we get I would just like to start a
small Java project test and yeah
for instance JDBC exception is in the
root source or SQL exception is in if
they're in the root of Java sequel dot
where all the JDBC lives there is SQL
exception there's no dedicated exception
package then I don't know the concurrent
modification exception for instance is
in Java util what actually happens if
you traverse the iterators in
concurrently you get the exception there
at the exception there and this is
exactly where it happens so for me
exception is just an object like class
EG b pojos are is just no difference
between an exception and usual java
class so i wouldn't also not never put a
java class to a package class and an
interface to package interface an extra
class to package abstract so i would
never do this and never yeah i will
usually not do this and so so what what
i just said would i would just - just
put exception where it belongs another
question especially if they are used
through the whole project what I tend to
do is to organize my project after after
business responsibilities so what it
actually means is I will show you what
actually means is the following so I
will
would have I would have a package for
instance business I'm referring to Java
right now and a package court orders and
I don't know metrics on whatever we can
get and this are actually business terms
here and if the exception belongs to the
whole project I will put it right here
in the root if the exception just B
belongs to the order's output exception
just reorders and if the exception
belongs to business presentation and
integration I will put the exception
right there which is probably the name
of the project so the name of the
project would be I don't know happy
selling right HS dot and there will be
presentation business and integration
and the generic exception will be here
the exception which belongs to all
presentation components here exception
which belongs to all business components
here and exception which just belong to
the orders here so I would say it's not
only obvious I mean there is no other
way to do this right because anything
else you will have to invent your own
structures I hope Manfred the answer is
the question is answered hopefully if
not just asked the next time I will try
to answer it in May so also a good one
yes asked try to try to my my old
example what I usually do I use I've
write actually the following for unit
testing it's imagine if this were an e
gb or an POJO a java ee something and
this java is something needs an another
object which is going to be injected
another thing and the age of a something
a java is something oh no another thing
what a team so what I'd never do it
don't right here private so I would in
Java yeah I don't have to class path
here but I will just inject this here
and in my unit tests just a
non-degenerate just I always do it with
maven the first time I do a result maven
okay no JUnit so in the JUnit test I
will just set the dereference directly
and setting the reference directly is
only possible if the unit a unit class
and in the package class reside in the
same package and they do of course
because in the source - Chavez the
package would be the same test so I
could perfectly inject this class but oh
nice it worked I was too fast
so I'm okay then we couldn't can even
show it is what was it a Java is
something class under test and then I
would get oh I need a whole bandwidth
for this streaming this is why it was so
slow void in it let's say before let's
change it to three okay and then say
this class under test dot add and we set
it directly right and mock it or just
create as another topic how to mock blue
just set to another thing directly and
now the thing directly so this is what I
would do and the problem is of course if
you if you say here this is private I
get here in the test class and error and
what I could do but this I will never do
really what I could do which is really
strange
you could say now I expose this fire
Gator and set up and now this is public
if this were an EJB now you
really set the dependency here via
public getters and setters which is
really it breaks the encapsulation doing
this this way it wouldn't break the
encapsulation because what whatever is
injected is a proxy and even if you
would see this this reference in the
proxy you couldn't just change it
because yeah because it's a proxy so now
everything is hidden with public getters
and setters you would violate the
encapsulation with package getters and
setters it would work similar way but
you will end up having three times they
are the amount of code and the question
is why
okay I hope we covered this hour someone
is converting light fish to scripting
one ass one which is also cool yeah and
I think so nice one is is great so I'm
using this one with other projects like
SPG and yeah go for it just in chat I
got a feedback that Jeff is trying to
migrate light fish with NASA on so just
do it so light horn would be a nice name
for your project so um thank you I think
we answered a question from Yassa
hopefully and Team B asks me if you have
two applications communicate via rest
and details are forbidden and you know
me videos are not forbidden but doesn't
make a lot of sense but if you like just
use DDoS but what I say I don't use them
because they are they are not forbidden
they don't make any sense
according to D to the origin to the
origin idea from Sun how do you share
the model between those two and the
question is more political than
technical actually so if you have two
applications they and they have to
communicate if the application a let's
say I think I have to draw again so
let's go to the drawing board let's say
we have two applications
and the application a offer services
application B if you offer the DTO for
the application B you will have to
maintain the DT OS and you have to keep
them in sync for application B but if
you just offer the restful interface
yeah it doesn't even have to be types if
it's a design decision whether it is
type save or not then the application B
could use D TOS a map or even a JSON
object to do whatever the application B
likes and belong a compatible that you
could even provide this is more a
political question about the contract
here and really you get the binding
actually for free on their own there on
the client side you could even use
completely different frames out there on
the server side so I wouldn't limit the
application B for for using the a having
that said what I always do on the on the
B side I would encapsulate the whole
rest service in a class which
corresponds with a component on the
server side and naming a colleague if
this were orders I would get here the
orders on the server side and the
service on the order and the orders on
the server side would be just one class
which provides a nicer API to do 2d
jax-rs because even even if jax-rs
is really very very lightweight and and
very very easy to use it is you the our
application doesn't have to be the whole
client doesn't have to be depending on
the Jack's arrest on all the api's and
having this encapsulation would work out
and sharing their model I mean if you
look at the most of the internet
services there is no model of sharing at
all you get the Jack's arrest
sorry no Jax or SD res specification and
you have to only you have to just use it
we knew whatever language you like and
if you are building details you are
already assuming that the two
applications are build in Java which
doesn't have to be the case and what you
can always do of course provide the DT
OS like a goodwill to the other
application say look we have something
for you can use it or not
us to test it for instance and what I
usually do I start if I build restful
Web Services actually I started with
these system tests whose the unit test
and then I'm forced to think about how
to interact with a service and as a I
would say collateral damage
I get details JSON object or the API and
sometimes I give the API there are other
applications sometimes not it really
depends on the other department
applications or what the you know
political climate is between two
departments right okay I hope it is
covered right now but I would say jax-rs
is absolutely not about DDoS
okay Christian mentioned he would like
to start the moon light moon what I will
do soon I will extract the essential
parts for GlassFish to light moon write
a simple test and then make it work
probably and extend it to some more
interesting stuff so the idea um so the
next question how one generates rest
grant stops in Delphi for Java endpoints
there is still no widespread visible
like tools for rest this is actually
very similar question to the question
number 8 from Tim and I'm not sure about
Delphi but but in all other languages
you can very easy to interact very
easily interact with HTTP so the
question is at rest the question is
whether Delphi is is able to deal
efficiently with Jason and we can just
test it Delphi Jason binding and let's
see whether something like this is
actually there and there's even Delphi
Jason viewer so it seems like Delphi
they have nice integration with with
Jason
it looks reasonable and there is so I
would say even in Delphi there's
actually no problem so I assume Delphi
is able to inter interact by via
HTTP with the Java back-end server this
is my assumption if yes who's and you
have Jason binding I would say with a
few lines of code you have to
communication done without any vistas
and the vessels or web service
description language sounds nice in
theory but in practice it's it's only
works between Java and Java or the net
on the net if you try to be a little bit
more cross language you have you don't
you have to do to to make the API
simpler to make it work and we had
already problems with dates even strings
and end of lines and and whatever and on
that note I reviewed a lots of soap
based services but I actually never saw
a really nice business driven vessel all
the visitors I saw I just you know
misuse of soap in terms of remote
procedure call you could equal equally
well use remote method invocation just
call the methods you don't need to know
business specification or vistas to do
this so this was actually D my feedback
to Vistal and there are Vista like tools
that they are even built-in to NetBeans
I don't there's nothing JT project but
there is usually generate rest client
yeah so you could point to a tour to a
resource class and it would generate a
client I would never do this because or
at least do it once to see how it looks
like but then you will see it is very
easy to build is a one-line and to call
a resource and this is your code you can
just format as you like so I don't like
generate code a lot generated code a lot
but even it build without any plugins
NetBeans eight or even seven provided
you plug in to to generate restful
clients from from from a resource class
and class which comes with or charity
comes with Vatel web application
description language it's a summer
proprietary but at least documents the
Det endpoints I hope the question is
answered
okay very good question
so let's answer it straight away so
Christian asked what type of apps you
would like to see doing a better job
using node.js on server-side and which
one better with Jie
so what no Jesus it is a server-side
framework which a single solid framework
but callback based what it actually
means is you can you have to be fully
asynchronous to make it efficient they
shouldn't block so if you call the
database you just fire and forget the
question to select to a database and you
get an answer back if the database is
ready to answer so it's really
interesting programming model no GS and
so what no GS is perfectly suited for is
for instance like chat applications
probably the social stream even we're
using right now or the social chat is is
it's not GS based who knows I'm probably
something like this or you know in
applications with lots of messages
twitter twitter could be a good good
thing and i would say i'm thinking more
and more about integration so if you
have a C code legacy C code it I would
say it is a lot better to use no GS to
integrate the C level code and then
expose the C level code or C++ code via
rest like service and consume the
service from Java yep this is a lot
better approach than even writing and
JCA connector and using j'ni to interact
with the C code because if gni breaks it
will kill your server so what I used in
the past I used remote method invocation
to isolate the legacy protests from the
application server process and with and
with with note it would note will
decouple this and this is this is
actually would be a nice nice use case
for for note but I but I think it is
hard to use Note 4 for building web apps
or boring database applications then I
think is Java
well better suited for and you shouldn't
forget avatar Jess this is no js' on
Java actually so if you have to use note
look at this it uses NASA 1 and and and
note they built even they implemented
the native note layer in so you can run
node.js applications on java application
server and even interact with with Java
II components ok and the other
interesting question via Twitter so I
had a nice conversation with Jean
Boyarsky about ignoring unit tests what
I brought is actually ignore in unit
test should be forbidden or that is
deprecated and I got lots of interesting
comments and why I think this way
because what what often happens I don't
know whether it is a general rule or not
other what I see in project is like if
something doesn't work it just gets even
it was commented out back then right and
what I did I wrote a comment and did it
uncommented code and though with at
ignore there is no more commented out
code they just put at ignore on the test
and forget about this so there are lots
of unit tests with etic nor for you know
for multiple releases and what I would
say meanwhile I think it ignore is
useful as a temporary tool but it
shouldn't checked in unit tests with it
ignore on them I would say this would
prevent you know the degradation of the
quality of the code so sometimes I put
ignore if you would like to test
something quickly I know it will break
my test but I attempt at least not to
check in something but I think you know
hopefully you won't find something in
the github repository is it at ignore
but this is at least my attempt and I
thought more and more about this and
actually will avoid to use ignore in
future or this will be my attempt
altogether
cause I think it causes lots of harm and
I don't know whether what is actually
was today's what is the balance between
the benefit and the heart and harm using
it ignore so um now I will ask the chat
again whether they have any questions
and I have one no there's actually no I
think no more questions from chat then I
will go I got eight questions today on
my block and the question is here about
transaction that if you do not support
it in persistence context type extent in
entitymanager and describes and behavior
were hibernate can behave strangely and
the problem is also the transaction
attribute not support is not propagated
and so forth so first what's really
important there is an unsecured NIH's
context in in Java 7
so then hibernate should behave and
eclipsing and others as well
second I I don't suggest the this
architecture for for everything it is a
specific kind of applications and if you
build in such applications you don't
have to propagate the context and why
not so back to the drawing board
why not because so what
because usually I get one EJB to say
this is eg be and I call this gateway it
is a kind of anti facade and this
gateway publishes to the outside world
entities and the entities are attached
so on this gateway all the methods comes
with transaction level unsupported and
one method often called it safe starts
and ends a transaction which causes the
entity manager to flush
so the UI and users directly the gateway
without any in directions to find the
entities or set of entities works with
this entities and then the end of the
work it's called safe and then
everything is flashed to our database so
i will never i don't need here any
propagation because there's nothing
between and what could happen of course
that this needs a service but this
service is just unusual service and is
usually stateless and would even use a
transactional entity manager but usually
from different persistence unit not not
the same one so this is the basic
architecture and when i would like to
use it
so here i think we spent at the last day
acts at least three hours discussing
this and i think and in the last day or
on there was an was a little bit beer
there was the wednesday we committed
that it's actually how to how to how to
tackle a problem so there are some
specific kind of applications i would
say which are network based so the like
transport system or some computations of
nodes and stuff like this and you
mentioned you have own server lots of
nodes like you know ways waypoints or
something like this with different
qualities or numbers or whatever which
can be computed and it could be even
persistence and they are built with JPA
so and there's a huge graph of objects
right and on the client you only you are
not capable to transfer everything to
the server so just a subset so on the
client if you only need a subset and you
do some operation you cannot just merge
back this thing with this because the
server had no idea what happened so what
you will have to do you will either
transfer you know to clone the whole
thing here and computed delta or what
you can also do if the client is on the
server like for instance in this case
for JSF and most web apps you could keep
the entity manager open and manipulate a
graph online and then save the changes
to a database so this is what I refer
and this is I don't suggest often I
would say in fact I use it very rarely
in my projects I would say one project
out of ten uses such architecture but
in case you need it you really have to
go this way otherwise you will spend an
infinite amount of time just creating
dto s got facets and and the whole
infrastructure and you actually forgot
about the the business logic okay let's
see we planned 15 minutes it's a little
bit longer but I think is not a problem
so um how Davida asks I think is awesome
and Erica so he asked how can you
propagate a Beck and exception for
example an optimistic Rock exception to
the front-end GSF or Java VIX and so
this example is really bad because it
will cause discussion so this particular
example but imagine is something else
not optimistic exception and another
exception how I would propagate this so
if if I would use Jax or as services
what I would do I would catch the
exception somewhere and this exception
transformed to HTTP code this particular
one or let's stick with this let's go
with this exception optimistic log
exception what it actually means it
means there are two users to Windows and
they fight with each other to get access
to the same entity on the server and one
wins and the other loses and the server
recognizes the inconsistency and throws
optimistic lock exception which which
causes the detachment of all entities
and rollbacks the the the whole
transactions and you get this exception
in particular what's better with this
optimistic locking exception is
sometimes it happens at the commit time
and what you have to know is is the
following in on the application server
everything or the jeebies are proxied so
your method is here but actually the
method is invoked by by a proxy so the
proxy will call begin here and commit
here so that the exception may happen
after the method was actually called
this is probably what what what what
Davide asks here so I'm in this in
what's happened then what do you have to
do then is you have to create an
interceptor and within the Interceptor
begin and committed transaction then you
will be able to catch this and this is
actually a specific case and because
when you catch the exception what it
actually means is it means the one of
the users is faster than the other and
what it usually means in practice it
means sum is something wrong with the
business process so actually the
optimistic clock exception is rarely a
technical one it is in most cases has to
be transformed to a business error so
what you will have to do then is to
throw another exception like
inconsistent the another user was faster
the new exception for instance and then
think about an improper HTTP code and
write the message with a X message this
was what I would do or Excel header
additional header as additional
information of the client this is what I
would do and there is another a great
interface called exception mapper and
the exception mapper interface in jax-rs
allows you to map exceptions to http
codes this is a little bit harder
because it depends when the exception is
is caught you know when the transaction
were and when the transaction is
committed I hope that video is as
crystal clear right now hopefully see no
questions what where is Twitter stream
yeah also nothing ah I got another two
questions marek science asks what about
the message persistence when using async
annotation so the basic basic answer
there is no persistence what I
marek refers to asynchronous and what
asynchronous means is that the message
is put first in the queue and then
consumed by the done consumed by the
thread pool what can happen if the
server dies it behaves like a transient
message and I'm when you would use the
async annotation over traditional JMS
queues you could replace transit queues
with with this because transit uses the
same quality as an asynchronous and if
you could even replace you could even
replace persistent queues with single
action timer which is persistent and why
to do this sometimes it is really hard
on the server to to create queues or
hours in companies where we were not
allowed to use cues from specific vendor
or whatever so it's a little bit of
hassle but CDI and and at asynchronous
works everywhere but events the CDI
events is very natural it is actually
observable in Java this is the
implementation of the observer pattern
in Java and JMS is a queuing system so
if you are misusing JMS for for eventing
I would say then you could use CDI
events but you should never replace the
messages with deliver once and only once
quality to replace JMS with CDI events
and or asynchronous processing I hope
marek the question is answered hopefully
was rocked wrong tab on Twitter so this
is why I answer the question half hour
later than planned so back to the
questions Davida
I think covered what do you recommend
for Java 7 beginners and in terms of
getting expertise in building enterprise
class applications I think there are no
more enterprise clip class applications
anymore if you if I think about this so
what enterprise could mean a little bit
more thoughts on quality the
could be enterprise for me but if you
think on consumer apps they state the
scalability is even greater than gent
and in most enterprise apps so I'm but I
think I know what what our beach shake
means is he Abhishek means I think that
you know that you use all the Java API
were to begin here for instance start
with something like light moon what I
did before Java e5 came out I hacked my
heating system the project is thrown and
called green fire it was the I used a
bus back then and the I remember it was
so early implementation that even even
the packages were wrong for for
dependency injections I had to recompile
the whole application because it's
broken and on the JBoss release but this
is how I learned Java if I've before
before Java 5 and j2ee before j2e sj2
e14 came out I've wrote for me and I
think a Star Search application which
imported several hundred thousand stars
and visualized the stars so my brother
helped me with the visualization and
with the back-end system and just to
test the performance the necessity
performance different servers so I would
say if you if you have a hobby then just
hack the application and put it on
github and in and get feedback this is
probably not for me because I'm a little
bit too busy right now but to get a
feedback from the community and think
about something exciting yeah or what I
did during the eggs actually during what
I started a small project called SPG
static page generator because I had to
maintain all the dates for the upcoming
workshops and it just doesn't for me so
I started small NASA on projects so just
do something and have fun with it and I
would never start with you know reading
books
not if my ebook right so start hex hex
off the first and then if you some
questions read the book so assume that
they have Chavez in knowledge yes and
what you should do always business first
what I see over and over again the
beginners start with a framework
they started with a logging framework
configuration framework dto mapping
framework what else
just frameworks you know you don't you
learn nothing about the Java if you
start with a framework so it will learn
that CDI is pretty powerful but you will
have no idea how to apply it to a real
world scenario so you need challenging
application first and go for it and
build something great with Java our next
question from Abhishek lots of question
for now Beijing so I will go with the
next one and the skips so our managed
beans just are three six sixteen and
c-d-i what are the difference between
both so um but I think the Abhishek
should be online so let's see oh my
Davida
I think thank you for asking but I hope
the question is answered if not you have
time just to write another tweet and
let's see se answered then is answered
otherwise we will meet next month so
just our three sixteen so and if you go
to preview pretty sure this is my PDF
viewer and I will just open this so what
I did I just opened my specification the
J's are three sixteen and what's the
difference first this is I think the
leanest spec ever
it comes with 22 pages and it was
created afterwards and extracted from
from the component models and all
basically states you know the lifecycle
post construct pre destroy at resource
injection very basic things but it says
for example in the basic component model
manage means must provide a no argument
constructor but a specification this
business before so you see okay no
argument constructor comes from this and
specification that builds on managed
beans such as CDI J's are $2.99 so what
it means is CDI uses managed beans so
whatever you do in CDI is called CDI
managed beans and CDI builds upon this
specification so I think it is
impossible to have a CDI
CDI application without having managed
beans correct me if I have wrong someone
from this peg but I think it is
impossible also or
agb's are managed beans so um you always
have managed means and this is just a
subset one why it was defined because
just fo so users manage means so and now
all the you know all the modules from
Java II can can can have something in
common and this common interface is
management specification but as
developer you don't have really to care
about and why the is included in CC di
di spec enough what so many difference I
think the next question is there is JCP
dot orc DS the 330 specification the
famous one which was designed by Eero
Johnson from SpringSource back then this
is this at inject and this is the same
story so at inject came after Java EE or
Java was almost released and dependency
injection for Java came out and what I
did is they change all the internal
annotations and replaced us with at
inject here because the originally a
thing in Java is six they used it in
from seam and it was replaced by at
inject and yeah and this is why you
cannot have dependency injection without
jazz of the thirties or 3:30 we have two
ninety-nine which uses 334 dependency
injection and man it means 316 for
managed beans but as a developer don't
care about this just used to 99 and each
obese and you are fine so
GSS too fast and complex okay this is
the next question from abyssion a little
much
let's see what a Twitter size and
probably we will have to postpone this
for the next session otherwise we will
spread several hours here talking about
stuff ah very curious so if you okay
with it Abhishek we I will answer
whatever you like in May but let's see
what
so just this is larger topics I wouldn't
start with it so but I think the point
was just efforts JSF is extremely
productive for simpler perhaps more
complex the application becomes the more
you have to know about JSF and the nd
and the even HTML and one point if you
can build everything by yourself or you
at least use Jax or essence stuff like
this and so I would say what I always do
for not so challenging applications I
would always go with JSF but if you have
to do cutting-edge web development you
have to go with plain html5 jax-rs and
some JavaScript frameworks but not with
JSF this was my personal opinion and
this is sometimes it's hard to estimate
whether it is going to be an cutting
edge project or or just no usual
database or a database table Explorer
and for tetanus table explorers I would
use probably JSF but table no no no
tables are the most challenging thing so
I'm something without any table who
would use JSF and something with crazy
tables I will probably look at the
tables from the various component
providers first okay so this question is
depending what you are whether you're
encrypt or decrypt on the provider and
if you look at Mahara for instance you
will find a lots of internal
implementations whether this state
saving is encrypted or even compressed
or not this is specific implementation
and the next one I use custom
composition components in facelet so
what he does it Bartek seems to using
modules and what you have and he would
like to share the entities between the
key components and to share entities the
ferret fairly simple you you could like
I think this is the problem some of
these comments to all wars yes so on
what you can do you can just put the
entity straight in our chart if you put
the entities in a jar
they and and you create a maiden project
what you can then do the war can can can
relate to this to this chart and there
could be some problems because in the
war could probably ignore the entities
but dude you can you can do you can
specify in the war
persistence XML and point to the char if
you point to the jar the entities will
be found so again you can create a jar
with just entities no persistence XML
then you put persistent 6ml in a war and
within the persistence XML in a war you
can point to the char where the entities
actually are defined
I hope the question is clear answered so
the last look at Twitter there is okay
there are no further questions let's see
at the stream nothing else so I would
say thank you for watching and for me it
was great because I saved right now I
think three hours answered all the
questions via emails and whatever and so
we I spend one hour talking but I
actually thought we were able to do it
in 50 minutes but I decided to do it and
every first month of the year and you
see here the next is going to be at the
major 5th at 6:00 p.m. so you can you
can define your your questions and or
send me the questions back via Twitter
post a comment to my blog or whatever
hit me on conferences or something and I
will try to gather all the questions and
post him one week before I was a little
bit too early today but one one one week
before one week before and then you can
just put your questions on the comments
and it will answer everything
in at once and you have interest you can
also visit the ax
this is do it three times a year and
Berkshire with mini gap what so you see
it behind me and I hope as a we had lots
of time fun with the attendees and I
hope it was productive so we spent five
days discussing from beginning of Java
to html5 whatever possible in one week
with you event with microbrewery and
yeah bro so um this event will be
repeated the next time is Wednesday in
July and everyone is invited so so if
you if you would have some questions
just come take a beer and ask the
question ok thank you for watching and
see you and may the 5th end at Saturday
I will give a keynote virtual keynote on
a conference called deaf crowd is in 13
and what I will do during the keynote I
will actually explain how to how to
tackle Java 7 how to not only learn Java
7 how to be productive and maintainable
with Java 7 and out plan also 2x2 to
explain the mystical entity control
boundary pattern so thank you for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
