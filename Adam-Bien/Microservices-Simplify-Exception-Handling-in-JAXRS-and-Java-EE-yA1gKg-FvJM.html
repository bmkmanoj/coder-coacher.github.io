like to show you an alternative way to
handle or to yet handle exceptions in
jax-rs so during the effective Java
online course what I mentioned in the
course was exception may pass with
jax-rs as well as exceptional status
codes and if you know that the only end
point is rest tracks or jax-rs you could
even do better than this or simpler than
this and to demonstrate how to do I
would like to create a simple Java
project and start with as always with
maven I'll call that X for exceptions so
it's just plain maven project and then
go with exceptions resource in this
package and the exceptions resource is
exposed with the path X and now let's be
a little bit more realistic so I
directly do able to create a boundary
let's say arrow service error of a set
and this would be usually an EJB to make
it a little bit more complicated and an
error service and an error service which
is usually adjust our plain Java class
and this one throws throw exception
throws new a local League state
exception so and this is a like
placeholder for all runtime exceptions
placeholder for all runtime so so it
throws the electricty exception and the
error Fassett injects
the arrow service and the so there's a
throw exception it's the same method and
it just invokes service dot throw
exception so it's like usually the first
set will invoke several pull Joe's but
in this case it just involves one so and
the resource has a method with returns a
message and this ellipsis listens to get
and returns 42 and here we inject the
air of a set fansite and here I would
like just to cause the exception to
happen so we just invoked the methods
wrong okay
good enough now let's run it just go
with the payara
so here is it and I would resources and
X and you see the ugly exception so this
is like Allegra state's exception
placeholder which causes the five
hundred and this is even worse it was
wrapped to an EJB exception and this one
was wrapped into a servant exception so
what we could do in this place as the
described in the effective Java EE
course we can just we could implement
exception mapper and unwrap TGB
exception and so forth but let's assume
the rest endpoint is the only visible
interface to the outside world what we
could do we could implement our own
exception and this exception we could
call let's say as something functional
like inconsistent consists and store
exception or optimistic whatever so it
does not really matter and now let's do
something strange so I will like to
extend
from web application exception which is
part of jax-rs and then just would like
to implement a constructor and to show
you the real power I would like to
choose an constructor with two override
and constructor with the message and the
status like this so you can pass a
methods message and status so now we
just omit the status and just set
something here so let's say status dot
in progress there was let's say I don't
know that the request it doesn't really
matter so I will just have to implement
this so we will hard code the status and
expect a message and now what we can
also do I could say okay you are an
application exception and this
application exception has to roll back a
transaction or not it doesn't really
matter but the nice story is if I I use
the application exception it just will
throw the exception as is without any
wrapping so this is defined here so nice
so let's go to our service pack and
instead of throwing this out loud to
throw our inconsistence
store exception and then just retry and
you can see bed requests so what we have
we have fully control over the status
codes without any wrapping without any
any additional additional work in the
resources or even the services no no
ceremony is just now playing java code
and the only difference is our business
exception inherits from web application
exception which is a little bit dirty
but but absolutely ok because usually we
would be dependent on Jason and the rest
a little bit anyway and the cool story
is we could even say this is actually we
have full control over the exception and
link it is actually absolutely ok
and if I would just repeat that you will
see is absolutely okay so there is
actually no no arrow going on so it's
just empty requests
so I'm thank you for watching and see
you in upcoming conferences workshops so
yeah hex Munich Airport or the online
course effective Java or micro services
against you even projects or enjoy java
and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
