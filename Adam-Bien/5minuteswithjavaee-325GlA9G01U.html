show you how to develop small Java 6
application with NetBeans I would just
launched it freshly installed NetBeans
it is the Java Edition it comes with
packaged at a glassfish three one two
and the Derby database the download size
is about 160 mx4 mec I will create just
a Java 6 project it's a web project it's
a web application and I will call that
hello beans and I would like to create
in 6 ml and we don't need any frameworks
because we have Java 6 already and for
the start it should be more than enough
so what NetBeans created is a small JSP
page and I will just to test that and
what I just did I run the project and
what it means it compares everything it
starts determined and GlassFish and
deploys the application opens the
browser window and I expect the hello
world hello world formed in the browser
so glass who started and the application
is deployed so let's create a JSF page I
will call that index finish
so and just see whether it works as you
see hello from facelets it works so I
could introduce an eg be right now but
usually you will start with a backing
beam and the backing pin I will call it
index just like teachers F page and the
backing beam there is a there's a model
annotation and with modelers it's just
request coped named beam string get
message so I know what I can do right
now I will just replace this hello for
mace from facelets with index and
message and we just write if you see
NetBeans p+ GlassFish to rock so it
seems to work and now I would like to
introduce an AGP as well and this eg B
would be I would call that my bean why
not
and this is a stateless session bean and
this guy turns something say
so and forgot the semicolon so then I
can just inject the beam with @inject
and use it let's try that
so as you see it works
what NetBeans provides is a nice support
with it recognized CDI injection point
so if you click on that see it's okay
this guy's isn't GB this injection point
so there is nothing unusual
it's just business as usual is NetBeans
worth GlassFish so we have GlassFish
installed here as you can see the hello
beans application so enjoy hacking and
see you and one of my workshops or
conferences so thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
