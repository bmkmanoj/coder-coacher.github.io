like to share with you a little project
I push to get up recently called loader
it was actually an old project which i
wrote for gas fish were a what it did i
just implemented the command line
interface on top of the existing code
base so on what it actually is some
little utility which helps you to deploy
a list and undeploy java applications to
a local or remote a glassfish or pyara
actually tested with the recent pyara
server and to demonstrate how how how it
works are just cloned the github
repository might get a repository code
loader and it comes with a simple
application called coffee beans which i
developed as you can see already two
years ago so um I have a payara launched
here and if i refresh you see nothing is
here so what I could do I can a concise
just I have I'm in the repository here i
can say java minus jar target and the
target is the loader utility and i can
sell minus L for list applications and
the the IP address and/or the Ori of the
running glassfish server and this is 48
48 or pi airport or bass fish no
deployed applications so i will try to
deploy one so instead of l i will use d
and then i can point to test deployment
and coffee beans and what you will see
is i have an application deployed and
this is the audio of the application and
if we switch here hopefully after
refresh you will find the coffee beans
so deployment worked and now we can list
again or we can under ploy and we can
just use this command right away java
manage our target loader char- undeploy
HTTP
hdb localhost 48 48 and the name is
coffee beans you could also use coffee
beans war but coffee beans is sufficient
and as you can see refresh and deployed
so um why what is actually the main idea
behind this and the main idea is you
don't need a local glassfish
installation it communicates over rest
protocols the load that'll jar itself
contains there are no external
dependencies and what i usually do I've
rep loader with NASA on scripts to
automate the whole process so first the
maven build kicks in and then i use
loader to deploy the application in a
more more i would say a realistic way
without using embedded embedded
containers or whatever so i just use you
know the standalone problem not
productive the tester of installation so
thank you for watching and see you in
Munich at in hacks or if you cannot come
just check out the recent java effective
online course it is actually very
popular and I get attendees from all
over the world so thank you and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
