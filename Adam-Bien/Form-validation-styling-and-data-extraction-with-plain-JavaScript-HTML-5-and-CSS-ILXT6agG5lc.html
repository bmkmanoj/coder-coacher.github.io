would like to start with the form
element two input fields and then a
button we don't need the action so I
forgot about that
but we have this input type input type
text which is a default and this has to
be required and the name is going to be
first name and then I would like to have
an label and the label will enclose the
first input field and this is going to
be the first name so it's just a label
for that so and then another label and
this would be the H and H should be the
number so change that to number and it
doesn't have to be required but the name
has to be H so we have the number the
text and the button and we have to
submit here so in the style what I would
like to do is to tell the label your
display is flex and where the width
should be 100 and the Flex direction
let's say column so looks a little bit
nicer so if the first name and the H
what we can also do we can style with
pseudo-classes the input so I can say
the input valid asked a background to
pixel solid light green and input
invalid just a green it's easier to see
and the background rather than a border
so and then in vet it
we have the border to pixel solid red or
light coral and just change this back to
light green
yeah it's nicer so this is now inverted
because it's required and this is
absolutely vetted so I can add something
and this is now valid because this has
some value
so now what I like to do is actually to
get the values in JavaScript so on
submission so how to do this and by the
way if I will try to submit the value
without putting the value it's
impossible please fill in this field
something because it's not valid so in
JavaScript I would like to create a
class form view and in the constructor
of this class I would like to get the
reference to the form we have only one
form so this is okay in our case and I
can say this form on submit this on
submit so I will register I submit
listener my own method so in this method
on submit gets the event submit this is
the event and our on put the event here
and what I also have to do is to
instantiate the class okay so if I click
it so let's do something here and - I
see briefly that something happens here
but the problem is the page gets
reloaded because the form gets submitted
so if I do it again
so how to prevent the default well
there's a method a dot pre-event
default and now we should remain on the
page so if i say here DF h - 12:12
submit we see this so what I would like
to do is to get actually the actual
value
how to do this so I can say Const and
what I would like to do is the target is
actually deformed so and now so let's
retry this so first name and the age is
12 submit and we see the form and the
form has an input and then the DD button
but what it also will have is the other
elements named as we named the input
type so it should there should be an
element called first name and H so what
we can do we can actually access this
and let's try that so I can say Const
and then what I would like to do is to
have the h and the first name I think
and let's say I would like to have both
so let's see what happens H and first
name and just writers and so we have to
we get the reference to the element but
I don't like to have the reference I
would like to have the value so it's
also possible then I can say just give
me please devalue and give me please
devalue so just we try this again and
now I have 12 and asdf and by the way
what you can also do on validation error
or I can have my custom validation I
could set the value to something more
meaningful like Duke and the H dot value
should be lets say the Duke is fairly
young 20 so let's try this
so something and 2 and then if I submit
it there is Duke and 20 so thank you for
watching see you at Eric's Munich
Airport conferences or a hex tile or
even the podcast here hex dot F M so
thank you and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
