would like to write a simple unit test
in chat with JavaScript for you it could
be for instance useful to test NASA on
scripts or whatever you have to write in
JavaScript so I was to start with a very
little JavaScript project called ants
for answers don't need any framework so
we just check out everything in this
create the project basically is a single
file and of course there is one method
called answer and returns 42 so it's
complicated business logic I would like
to unit test this so how to do this
first of all I will have to decide in
JavaScript land for our test runner so I
think the easiest possible is mocha so I
will use mocha and NetBeans could also
set up it for you but I prefer to use
the command lines of your seat as
actually no magic npm install chai which
is is a set of simple asserts very
similar to Java JUnit s asserts and what
I also would like to create is a folder
the test folder with the name test and
then I have to do a few things
first you have to point NetBeans of your
test folder so it's test it's the first
one then I have to set up the test
runner and testing provide is going to
be mocha so I just use the freshly
installed ma Khurana and this basically
is and unfortunately what I will have to
do is to export exports let's say main
equals
answer ANSWER Answer
so what this is we will need it later it
exposes this method to the unit tester
is necessary for for the maca build in
karma
another test one you will need it so
then we need just a test file and in the
J's test file we need first to refer to
our testing module so we have to say
import the module is require and we have
to go down to source and then use this
and I would say this is our function
under test so it's the main so it
actually is the main is this one and
then what we also need of course we
would like to have our chai it's just a
module and the assert library from chai
and then I could say describe answers
and say the function here it should be
42 divided 1 and now we can write our
test which is assert not equal
for to do answer so uh looks nice
hopefully it works so let's status so I
would just test it as I don't see is
okay
and so test pass answer should be 42 so
you get full integration so what you
could of course to we can say I would
like to have another test is called a
function wrong cancer which return seven
and function and we will have to expose
us as well
wrong wrong answer and then go to the
test and then here I can just specify
another assert must not be and let's say
if you will run this you will hopefully
see eight a
you
a red part to see so failed a surgeon
expected 42 to equal 7
so um thank you for watching and have
fun with testing so actually what you
use here we use note to drive the test
but it's nice nicely integrated with
with NetBeans and you could perfectly
use NASA on scripts for automation so
can unit test executable NASA on scripts
and because NASA is just another ECMO 5
implementation thank you for watching
and see you see you soon at a hex Munich
