I would like to show you how to write
Java objects to XML and read them back
from XML with nothing but JDK and to
show you this I would like to start with
a simple POJO and I will like to call
the poacher Duke and just in our package
and the Duke would like I would like to
give him a preferred language so usually
it is a constant with Java but let's
assume there are multiple languages
which Duke's likes and and we also need
an age of the Duke and a constructor
because we are going to use Jack's B we
need a default constructor and from
convenience I will use a custom
constructor and of course to string just
two to see later what happened so I
would like to use jax beach of
architecture for xml binding go for this
purpose i have to put two the first
annotated class with exam a root element
what it means is going to be the root of
the document and xml access or type and
the access or type I would like to use
field and what field means for laziness
I don't need any getters and setters the
fields will are going to be used via
reflection by the jacks be runtime now
to show you how it whether it works or
not I would like to create a simple unit
test so to create a test and I'm going
to yes perfect it's not integration test
just a simple test and I will call the
tests realization so and first I will
have to create the jags be context new
instance and do closed class and I could
actually move it to in it so it can
happen once
and before so this can happen once and
we have to throw some exceptions and I
would like to remember the context as a
field so and so we have to pass the DD
poacher here but then what I can just
use I can say this context create a
marsh allah the marsh channel and the
marsh Allah is able to marshal the
object so Duke and of course the dude
the preferred language is of course Java
and Java is very very young so 2 years
to a half years actually and I would
like to to store this in a file jube dot
XML so if you run the test
we should find a file do XML and I will
just you see language Java h2 seems to
work but now read it back so it is as
simple as writing so this is very
symmetric API so we can say this context
unmarshal now sorry create an mashallah
and
so this is the on mashallah and then say
on marshal unmarshal of course and the
file is the same so we could also
extract it do kicks ml and we write it
here on marsh salt so and now it should
be sufficient so just to show you that
it actually what do it comes back here
is the Duke so we provided to string
which would be immediately visible so I
would like to run it and the test is of
course green because I know asserts and
what you can see is we have the Duke
language Java h2 so it was unmarshal so
I'm very useful
Jack's B so I use it a lot to store
configuration files or to maintain
configuration files without any parsing
is also very convenient and yeah thank
you for watching enjoy java and see you
at the X in Munich Airport okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
