show you why EG bees do simplify java 6
development i would start with a simple
job at six application with the name
great simplification and the application
i would like to use CDI so i need pin 6
ml and i would like to start with an e
gb and the gb is just an ordinary class
called boundary and this class resides
in the package called simplification and
this is an stateless egb what we also
need is an entity JP entity and entity
and this entity is an entity so it needs
an annotation with the name entity and I
would also need a persistence.xml I will
just create ad and of course at least
one attribute and this is an ID
generated value so it will be auto
increment by the application server and
the boundaries able now to persist our
entity entitymanager i would like to
inject the entity manager here and would
create a method safe for this purpose
and then we just march use the method to
court and they call merge which either
save or updates the entity to save merge
and so what I also would like to do is
to create a CD I managed bean as a
presenter so I will implement the model
so what model is a stereotype which is
named and request coped at the same time
I would also like to create a method
called safe here and this method returns
an object it will be bound to our
button GF button return and i would like
to inject our boundary inject and of
course should the return boundary safe
so and of course what we do do not have
is a simple GSF page so we need it as
well and i would like to introduce a
very circle form and a button with the
label safe and the action this is our
safe method in the presenter sighs index
safe that's the action perfect so it
could work so we just start the
application and what what happens right
now the application is compiled and
deploy to glassfish and after that it's
open in a browser so i will just save
the application so nothing happened but
what we could try to do is to find the
entity in the table you see an entity
seems to work your data and we have a
single entry so let's try it again save
and you see we have two entries so it
seems to work so let's try to simplify
the application a bit so what happened
if we just try to get rid of the
stateless it should be it should still
work because then the boundary becomes
just an ordinary CDI managed bean so
let's try that safe and what you see is
transaction required exception was
thrown because the entity manager cannot
be executed without transactions or
certain methods of the entity manager
cannot be executed in without an
transaction so we could of course use
the entitymanager factory and
and control transactions manually but
the main question is why with a single
annotation at stateless and the problem
is solved so it works so enjoy a gps
with java 6 and see you an upcoming
conferences workshops or projects ok
enjoy hacking thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
