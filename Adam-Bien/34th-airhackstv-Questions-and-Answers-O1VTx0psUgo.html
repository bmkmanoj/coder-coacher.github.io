welcome to the first edition in 2017 of
a hex TV and it was a great 2016 year
lots of interesting projects it was a
short year so and I think 2017 is going
to be even better so let's start with
the content so the year ended for me at
the munich airport a hex it was well
attended and what i did in microservices
i covered the monitoring a lot so it is
actually a good choice that i will split
this in the in the upcoming a hex
admitting airport so I introduced
another course about monitoring and just
trouble shooting performance also for
for micro services and will focus less
on monitoring in the actual microservice
workshops so there will be in spring
just three days I will skip the first
time the bootstrap one effective I
probably will redo the whole week in
december again but there is no time
earlier so it's like april ready
critical there's in lots of nice
conferences around the corner there's a
detox info share whatever so i have to
really bit cautious with my time and
when i'm really looking forward to march
to adi javascript HTML five workshops
for java developers i will use java to
explain javascript okay so this was that
and we got 20 questions or topics and
this is the summary on my block and the
there's a another summary this is the
actual questions from from from github
so okay what's interesting the micro
profile io became a javascript a java
and javascript an eclipse project so if
you search for microbe profile eclipse
there is in eclipse project and it was
late in november so the whole micro
profile movement is eclipse projects
which is a very good thing and if you
look there were a list of committers so
Davis Kevin SATA form from IBM David
Blevins from
on Tommy I think the ND is also from
Tommy can Finnegan John M end and John
Clingan I believe as this both are from
redhead and can Finnegan I guess as well
John Clingan and is from redhead Mycroft
Steve marriage is from pyara mark
littell is the CTO actually I think CTO
from from rather than and Robinson and
both of them they are IBM so a Martin is
Jack and I will commit probably
something but I'm not in the in the list
yet yeah and there are some individuals
as well so it's interesting sure so what
was lacking key Oracle but Oracle
promised daddy at the conference keynote
at Java wonder they will also
participate ok this is a nice news also
something happens in the java ee
movement so there's a little bit of
movement there and really curious
whether they made to the java one event
so this was the very first topic and
micro profile news and i forgot to
mention a topic from the last event it
was from the last TX so I I i published
a project called status test and i got
the the best comment ever it's like I
can't seem to find use case where I
could find a good be needing this this
do you character or elaborating on this
next X TV and Daniel asked me okay
what's the deal with that is over what
status test is so status test is a
minimalistic war it's actually exposed
as a doc image and what you can do with
that is you are sending in the header
and and and status and you get back an
HTTP response with the desired state oh
so what I use this for is to test my
HTTP JavaScript clients whether they
behave properly so if you use xhr this
xml httprequest i wanted to test you
know all occurrences of that so I
it is quickly to the dock a container
and tested it from via the browser is
almost like a system test from the
browser and and I was able to know
provoke the arrow five hundreds and
whatever so this is what I use for and
because was useful to me I just publish
this to to to github so i hope i hope is
clear right now so we covered this so
the next one there is from from someone
who i guess he confused me because i saw
you out loud you java list java example
from from from github I i don't think i
have such an example about about a
playlist and audio audio playlist and
and Rick a wrote me an email it was I
think late november or early december
and ask me a question and I say okay I
will answer this in the next hexic what
next ax is like I have to wait a month
year I have really no time to provide a
technical support via email but I think
what r EK would like to have this is
like filter so you only would like or
she or he only would like to see mp4 jpg
PNG s and gifts in the end fi dialogue
and what i did in the past i use the
filefilter so if you use swing you can
use five filter and you can swing his
compatible java fixed so could create a
swing panel with filtering and we did
its to identify excel files back then
and we actually water i read the ex
advice and if i was able to do to read
the file it was shown in the file
chooser if not it was just not visible
also there was the right ending so it's
a sophisticated filter and you can see
there's this very similar functionality
so you can port that to java vix or just
use the file dialog from from swing and
and you are basically set so on this
question i hope is covered so let's see
what happens here no questions here no
questions here chat quite
okay so 29 days ago I'm working with
spring boot maven hibernate for rest
services and he asked are there any
resources how to dance with rest service
for production so um I'm not sure what
production actually means because
whatever we do it goes to production I
hope even if you have you know your
hobby projects in one day it has to go
to production I guess what production
can mean is like robustness performance
scalability or security so security
depends you know what you would like to
do whether you need single sign-on
whatever but the java ee basic security
covers it pretty well and he asked me
about the tutorials so I think I mean
how it's effective Java EE hopefully yes
my effective Java EE course covers
actually rest services I hope well
enough and java ee micro-services
micro-services covers jax-rs as well the
question is what you would like to this
is not just about jax-rs is just about
it's about micro service in Java EE and
and and where is it here and jax-rs so
the question is what you would like to
see and what I don't cover at all is
spring boot and the reason for this is
because all my projects are Java is six
and seven projects there is actually I
got one request last year about spring
boot and I said okay I have no practical
experience with sprig boot and then yeah
and someone else was taken so i just
rejected the offer because only a
theoretical knowledge with spring boot
and not up any any any sophisticated i
would say project experience just play
with that a bit a bit yeah so this is
what i suggest to you and if you would
like to know more about the concepts
there are great books for
asked I had Stefan I hope till cough
total cough rest so this is these are
German books put a hope there are
english translation as well hopefully
and just search for Stefan till cough I
hope he also does something him yeah it
should be there are lots of articles so
this is like to understand the jax-rs
concepts better so for me how I see the
jax-rs movement is the following so
first no one cares on my clans about
jax-rs rest or whatever so what we would
like to have is to build applications
quickly and maintainable so when the
application is maintainable in my eyes
it is maintainable in this case if you
know the business logic well if you
understand the domain concepts and you
and you forget the app for two years and
after two years you you you return to
the projects and you still remember the
concepts you should be very quickly be
able to maintain the app introducing
features of fixed parks when it is
possible it is only possible in case the
domain concepts or business logic
immediately becomes visible to you so
the more it is obfuscated with strange
patterns the less maintainable your
application becomes so regardless
whether you are using spring boot java
you whatever so what what what you
should get at the end of the day so if
you know the domain the domain experts
domain concepts and you look at the ADIZ
you should immediately be able to
identify you know what's going on there
so this is my the only quality for which
I which I'm interested in implementing
jax-rs or business services ok so and I
forgot the first very first topic which
is also interesting not also interesting
is very interesting so what's going on
here nothing and this is actually not
even connected so here
nothing here no questions which way you
prefer to work with angular 2 and jax-rs
so angular 2 doesn't matter is reacting
Latour amber or nothing and jax-rs so
one single project or two separate
project so first very quickly what are
the benefits if you have one signal
project what it means in the war there
is a JavaScript HTML CSS and the back
end everything so the main benefit is
there is no issues with course because
the the angular files are loaded from
the same resource as the back end so you
you you you can work with relative or
ease and everything will work out of the
box if you have two projects there's
actually Tory's so you will have to set
up course and what you also have to do
is you will have to you will have to
tell the second project were the first
project lives so or where the rest
services are residing so far so good so
um still I think the majority of my
projects were two separate projects why
does my observation is the following you
I tend to change a lot and jax-rs
changes a lot in the first few weeks and
then is more stable so we did several
sba projects with react and angular 2
this year with java beckoned and at the
first few weeks we iterated like crazy
in the back end and then the back into a
stable and we iterated all the time on
the front end you know because we change
the UI there are different requirements
CSS and so forth and therefore it is
nice in my eyes to have a dick couple
you I from the back end because you can
go sure that if you deploy a redeploy
you I you won't mess up your business
logic yeah I hope it's clear so I tend
to have two separate projects
particularly if you have two two
different teams for instance then it's
obvious usual you will have you know
front end team and back-end team ok so
we covered the Java Vic stuff spring
boot cupboard and what I encourage the
last time is that every one of you will
write an email to java 7 expert group
and say please duplicate soap
and in a good very good answer or answer
or response to this is it says from my
point of view she or he actually ng
could be she and from my point of view
removing the sub related specs from a
Java EE would be a pity because of these
following reasons company and partner
partner companies soapy still have
reused so of course I mean many
technologies are used for b2b business
to business communication so my first
thing is ok what is what is on the other
side of the business if it is you know
it probably will only work well if both
both businesses are using Java or both
businesses are using the net if you mix
and match technologies that we get a lot
of problems with that magnetic this to
an alternative style would be a major
fraud with questionable gain I don't
think you have to migrate so if it works
with soap I will keep soap what I'm what
I'm what I'm what I'm talking about is
that this the soap should not be
maintained anymore and should be
optional so what optional means is that
the new Java 8 or Java 9 application
service wouldn't would not have soap as
a default but you could still you know
drop a exes jar or whatever and you will
get you know an optional soap support um
so again I will never a migrated from
soap to rest why not without any reasons
because soap is procedural and rest is
more or less object oriented so there is
no clear path you know how to migrate
soap to rest and furthermore all
visitors I saw were terrible it's like
remote procedure calls you know hidden
behind visible and the rest is more
domain concepts driven at least the last
year what I saw in project so it is to
to migrate soap to rest you will have to
understand the domain concepts first and
then and then write a decent rest api ok
soap is still better choice than rest in
certain situations i'm not sure about
this so i'm a tell you a story what I'm
doing in project right now I'm creating
a testing concept for a really
sophisticated Java app and it uses
Jack's arrest API which we are not
interested in behind the jax-rs business
API we have functions which have to be
tested so what I implement it is is
remote procedures remote procedure call
library which uses jax-rs to invoke
functions so what I actually model dist
functions so are functions as a resource
so in this particular case I using
remote procedure call to call whatever I
like the back end is a very generic
interface and it still is jax-rs behind
it even it is restful because my domain
concept is a method an ugly business so
but I will never use soap for this for
instance yeah so rapid client
development even for complex application
by generating Java code from provided
vessel and this is what I don't believe
in this a quick anecdote someone at the
meeting it was last year ask me you know
what show us quickly no heck farce and
who maven project with SOPA de know me
and no I prefer no code over slides so
try to do this until I found the right
you know vistal to Vista to Java maven
plugin it took me probably one hour and
it downloaded half of the internet so
I'm i was i was really ashamed like a
sorry for this and because i didn't
actually my last saw project was
probably i don't know five six seven
years ago so I with rest i would i would
tell you regardless what it is and egg
actually i will try to do it so on in a
screencast just you know invoke whatever
third-party library just to see how easy
it is and and what you can do very
easily with jax-rs you will need one
liner for a call and this basically is
so i'm not sure about this so and of
course there are lots of jess ours and
and and you know ESP switch I don't care
about because what it means um I don't
care about I care about everything but
for instance II and
if there is an ESB Enterprise Service
bus in a company I always ask you know
developers architects are it takes a
little bit harder to ask but developers
are you happy with the decision how
productive are you and what we are the
benefits of DSPs and an adjacent all
listening for the answers and they were
not always positive put it in this way
and I encourage you to do the same so
just you know if someone would like to
sell you a nigga speeches ask you know
how much time we will save was ESB and
and and what is actually the whole
purpose of GPS be this is unruly nice
exercise ok so now someone asked me
happy new year about the answer about
angular how is it the correct way to do
SEO with angular knowing that Google web
color doesn't execute JavaScript yeah a
hot think I forgot that there was uh oh
it's there are libraries actually
pre-render GS this is what I searched
for there's a pre-render jest and what
the what the libraries do they prove
render the angular on the server side
and output in HTML so too so the SEO is
better I hope question is answered i
will put to the chat and Monsieur these
holes should be happy it is painful but
this is this is the disadvantage having
a n'est pas but it's getting better and
better ok so this is an interesting one
so I was asked about a topic which I
ignored so far and this is oreck if
there was an i oh nice an article or
active oracle finally target javon on a
payer six years of the blocking Sun and
they all read the article and it is
somehow I don't know that there is
nothing wrong the assumptions actually
wrong just like for instance tell your
story as it was in
2010 and first of all I don't think I
changed a lot so the java SE was never
free for us to run on special purpose
hardware so if you had a kayak software
or something like this you always had to
pain to pay money for java SE and this
was for at some times and nothing
changed oracle the change was only after
sun was bought by oracle in some of my
clients the first thing what happened
was they get requests from oracle
whether they have licenses so oracle is
more aggressive about getting money for
the licenses but son was a little bit
more lazy and Oracle's more eager but it
doesn't but in the first place you you
would have you know you first you you
you you would have to read the license
and then you know pay some money so this
was the correct way to do so this is
actually nothing new so and this is not
like after what was it six years so it
was actually from the beginning this was
what I don't get it why now so this
really happened in two thousand nine or
2010 and then the other thing is the the
unlock commercial features think i mean
what i did i actually asked oracle about
this at the java on conference and where
is it this was this and if you go to
unlock commercial features a damn bean I
was very curious to know what doesn't
mean and two years ago what I would have
wrote this thirst ask just after javaone
say okay hey article can I use this for
development and I say yes and production
no you have to pay the prices and the
pricing was on the web let's see whether
it's still there yeah it's still there
so the link didn't if you changed so it
was on my blog for three years and and
you know in the article that they found
it now I mean the question is no what's
yeah
and but the added value of the unlock
commercial features huge so what you can
do you can in production you can monitor
without any now slow down your
application with Java Mission Control
and by the way many of my clients don't
know it and they have the license so I
encourage them you know to turn it on
and then again monitoring for free which
is really decent monitoring and if you
don't have to do the license and your
application is critical you have to
consider whether it is worth to pay the
license to have this monitoring in the
first place so on so um and if you read
the article everything is somehow true
but a little bit exaggerated is like
everyone no one downloads and no the
Java Sea advanced for whatever
boundaries and and and Java is sweet or
whatever it just doesn't happen so
usually do what did they use Java Sea
the dénouement one would I would I see
what my clients are doing or to use
OpenJDK and the problem is solved so
this a little bit exaggerated and in my
eyes as is a very good thing that the
Oracle actually you would like to have
our money for certain features why not I
mean I mean or Oracle is another an open
source company and there is not like you
know some public domain you know company
that they actually have to earn money
because it is they are listed on stock
market and the whole purpose of a
company listed on stock market east they
have to earn money as much as possible
in to satisfy the owners so this is the
whole deal of stock traded at least my
understanding so I'm and from for my
point of view it is okay and and and
what I expected India India 2017 more
and more articles like this because
right now is very fashionable to bash
Java why this as you remember in the
year two thousand six java was supposed
to die because Ruby on Rails and now we
have ten years later or 11 years later
and history repeats in software
engineering every 10 years so i would
say what we will hear a lot is like an
OGS kills Java on the server and
whatever we will see this year ago or
Swift or whatever so I will expect more
article like this so everything is
somehow right
widely exaggerated and if your java is e
runs on a server I don't think you need
a special purpose license yeah and if
you are using openjdk what i'm using
there is you are out of out to dinner
anyway okay so this was my opinion and
yeah and my opinion to oracle is like
oracle is a huge company and they you
know they have lawyers they are
marketing people and every department
has to earn some money and and some
things are looking strange from the
outset but i mean most of the engineers
are very reasonable and they think
differently so this is what always
happens in large companies not only
oracle we and one time we should write a
book about large companies you won't
believe actually how fun it can be so
I'm that's about this and also
interesting story i was oracle i think
in 2009 they asked me to became an ace
director let's see ace director i forgot
what a sexually means at mbean and i
said there should be somewhere there
should be a list of the of the ace
directors from oracle so I cannot find
myself so it was not because I never
talked about this and and say yes why
not the get better access to engineers
and last year they say okay but you are
not promoting Oracle products a lot
would you like to be in 222 to change
the status to alumni and I'd say
actually I'd always did what I always
did I just speak about Java never body
products and then they they canceled my
house called my my participation in as
an ace director which which is
absolutely ok because I was supposed to
know to submit some blocks and whatever
which I just missed but if you think
about this what I think would happen was
the Oracle try not to do to get the
group smaller face directors because
they usually cost money so I never got
any money from Oracle I think the
aight taxi a once Jeff one for me but
never the travel or whatever I didn't I
wanted to be independent but if you
think about it don't even look at the
numbers how much get money I cost them
to just cancel my how it's called
participation as an ace director and and
this was not very wise move because I
could became angry which I not but I
could and this would cause a lot of harm
so I a citizen large companies and and
they not always move in and how it's
called companies move in strange ways
right so okay questions here anonymous
asked me hi Adam how to manage api's
URLs properly so API manager and so far
I didn't use any API manager and
diversions be careful with Russians i
only have versions in the early in case
i can fully control the back end in
front end if i cannot control the front
end there are no versions in the Ori and
don't use version managers what I use a
lot is a test a lot so I'm Brad system
tests and I run all system tests in all
versions against the newest API it's
what I do and by the way sometimes the
the the messages are censored I think if
you post to often this can happen so we
have to wait a second and then okay hey
Victor see taxes hello from Kosovo hello
by the way the bread taka usually
listens to the show and what bread did
he he he attended the last let's see
what I will find it oh this is brett
occur so i didn't make it to munich for
any X this year so we tried to make some
glue wine it's a glowing wine and they
created an origin Utah gluing gwine
glowing wine in Utah I'm really curious
how it how it taste it
okay so we have that we covered this and
we have to go to back to the guests
let's see who are we this is covered
working with CDI no gb scandal i have my
own CMT transaction container managed
transactions kind of so there is a
transactional in transaction scope to
annotations so if you search for CDI
transactional actually it would be a
nice blog article so you can have CMT
without the gps and and you have a
transaction scope can hold classes or
instances within within that transaction
something like a threadlocal with
transactions so i'm currently reading a
book about performance a great book
which is the acceptable or normal
through put in an application when they
should we start to worry about
performance so arm don't worry a lot at
the beginning just perform stress tests
every night and you see how well or how
bad your application performs take the
numbers go to the client and ask whether
they are numbers are good enough so this
is what i'm doing and acceptable means
for instance if you have transactions
they should be a shot only possible so
should execute in seconds never minutes
this is what i can tell you and i would
say 10 seconds is already wait long and
if you are building web apps it should
be a milliseconds so if you're building
an e-commerce app it is not even
acceptable to have you no response in
200 milliseconds so it's really
depending what you are doing what you
should performance is not that critical
then robustness is more critical even
because if your application performs
slow and you get lots of requests they
will stick somewhere in the queues and
if the application server is not
configured to handle the load what he
usually can get or what you
get is you get problems with with memory
because each threat you know consume
some memory and yeah the application
will not behave correctly so I also read
the article here about data transfer
objects' and low coupling and the
article states the following so if you
have microservices you should share
nothing so if you don't share nothing
you cannot share the details if you
don't share the videos you have
duplicate details so and this is very
true but in Java 7 I use a JSON object
in JSON array as adto and if I need
domain objects what I do is not very
clean but very surprisingly well is I
implement do I have here or editor very
good so um let's see whether i found
find java very good so if i do this
class def so i would create a
constructor with a JSON object and just
do something like with a second so like
this name equals input get string
something like name and default now I
think there's default value so and of
course I will have to field and then i
create Jason object to Jason
with a return Jason create object bilder
I think something like add name this
name built so I forgot the imports it
should look like this and this works
surprisingly well in recent projects and
so take a but there's a lot of work but
I don't have any details on any mapping
so um this could be an entity bean and
it bean and jpa entity and this will
civilize the entity into json object and
this would be civilized the entity and
this was a very lean approach
particularly fav list of objects I also
will have to write a blog post about
this I guess because I get the question
a lot Brett tracker says the growing
wine was very good so okay the next time
in a hex TV or in the air hacks you
should do some create some work flow
flow glowing wine in a ver crevasse ok
so are an ax alumna alumni Daniel femara
asked me what is the best way to inject
properties and what I did in my block I
wrote something like this which injects
an instance of properties from a
headlands which was dynamically
configured and this is this is a i would
say sophisticated way to inject
properties what I usually do in a
projects for instance if I have to deal
with Daka first we can inject like
string name this and then somewhere else
I have class for instance configurator
and this class has a single methods like
public string expose injection point and
IP like get I think declare get member
and good member then I get the name of
the member something like this string
string fieldname something like this and
then again in Dhaka I do return system
dot I think like get and field name or
else something like this this is a
pseudo code in Java but I so or else not
configured for instance so this all I do
and in non docket projects i use
system.getproperty this is done so this
is the easiest possible way and i don't
think you know it's a huge deal to
implement these two lines of code over
and over again I would not create in our
HR and in charge so this is what I do
always and there was no complaints and
it was completely obviously developers
why we do this and and how we do this
perfect so
get member name exactly Victor asked me
do you use pyar and production a lot and
do you have use many performance flexor
tweaks for your microservices not a lot
i actually know as well my block and
everything works with a default there's
no tweaks at all and even in verse i use
pyara in production with full monitoring
on and there's almost no overhead okay
and what is your position to using
google jisun or other Jesus realises
actually in my project right now I used
cryo and why this because the input and
and and return values are not see Eliza
Belize way you don't need to write the
dev class example you show it what do
you think this is a different different
requirement because this class which
I've wrote we use that as a back-end for
a react j/s project so I'm g'zone won't
help me a lot yeah someone asked me Adam
you probably work with react what do you
think about the functional programming
hype that Jesus hipsters want to
popularize I would say I react is react
functional a lot it is but I mean it is
natural way so you you are in know
you're doing TD functional way and and I
mean this is like almost like streams in
javas is not not not a big difference
and the hipsters are not using react the
hipsters are using something else called
el so the end programmers say okay react
this crap everything has to be
functional stateless and type safe and
this is the this is what not hipsters
what do you know this is what the GS
functional gurus are using
okay cool so let's do the next thing
because I'm just afraid to do we don't
spend the whole night with Java 7 so
guests again here covered car vet I hope
covered exactly so this actually dude up
against someone sent me a tweet a tiny
things that doesn't deserve a space on
your block I would like to see something
that can compete with spring boot clout
I don't know how to interpret this but I
get the question little bit later is no
what is it ken Java compete with spring
boot or cloud and you will see it in a
second because there's another project
with that another questions about Java
EE vs there's a spring cloud I will I
will handle it once so what's going on
here someone asked me I used
implementation with the injectable
configuration adverb totally cool but
how to update this in a running server
in a running server in a running server
what you can do you can expose the
system get property as a as
implementation of a functional interface
inject the interface and then you will
have you know on each call it will ask
the system get property but the system
get properties one change so i think is
impossible in java to change now as
possible system properties you can
change environment entries is harder to
change okay so arm happy new year yeah
exactly exactly happy new 2017
completely forgot about this it is
possible to put html5 application after
the war has been compiled officially no
unofficially yes because all
applications have a support so called
exploded format so you can change
whatever like in this format and it will
work it doesn't make any sense in muscle
my projects because we use docker and
this is really terrible idea to change
anything inside a docker container
because compelling a war with html5
takes a lot of time I mean in my case it
took one to two seconds with doc I just
go to my youtube channel you will see
you know how quick it is so it is never
a problem particularly it is just html5
applications there is nothing to do it
takes what it takes to zip you know one
make off folder so so in my case with
maven it takes a few seconds always and
what it takes two seconds is a maven
build with Doc a full build go to go to
go to let's see Adam being YouTube and
this is my channel for instance is happy
new year so I created a I created
microservices a lot and and and there
was one screencasts about thin Wars the
impact of performance on the war sighs
what I did I create it or is it just an
older one
this is the one javed thin wars and the
docker image size and what i did i just
created with maven and docker and a
small image and larger image and
compared the performance so this is
actually what you interest this is a
half year ago so look at this I will
post it to the chat so we just pick the
Ori and put it to the chat yeah and wrap
happy says put data and database or in
datagrid this is what i did with
headlands it uses in finish panel or
hazel classes exactly the project from a
github so um yeah okay so we covered
this so author has proposed that apache
software foundation's take over a
NetBeans project with some oracle
engineers will the community still as
reactive as now i hope a little bit more
so they are really crazy netbeans
contributors and you shouldn't
underestimate the NetBeans community
there's actually a huge ecosystems of
plugins writers and through NetBeans
hackers some people are promising about
this but it's not the case for everyone
especially since oracle no longer makes
java priority so with the Oracle Java
and priority I think it is not entirely
the case my impression is more like
Oracle focuses on clouds right now and
they hope you know the whole world will
know leave amazon microsoft asia and
google and and go to oracle and so they
will earn money let's see what happens
but what what I don't think they they
they will drop Java because everything
they have is runs in Java also the coal
Oracle Java crowd is on Java but it is
not as priority as at the sometimes this
is true and and this is a little bit
pity because in my eyes Java is my eyes
of course is very mature platform it is
perfectly suited suitable for micros
service or whatever and if you start
with JavaScript everything repeats again
so it's another bad thing but a little
bit boring in order to do whatever we we
achieved with Java to drop everything
and start over with completely new
language and do redo everything again
until the company loses interest and we
in 20 years we do exactly the same again
with different language there is
actually no additional benefits you only
have you know more things to do should
we hope to hope for the future of
NetBeans yes I guess it has a future
with a very bright or not I don't know
but it has a future and Oracle also uses
NetBeans for the Oracle jet which is by
the way interesting it's like Oracle
html5 framework and the NetBeans is the
official ID and they show NetBeans on
all oracle event so i think this is
still interesting to oracle but you know
what i already told you oreck is a huge
company and who knows you know whether
all departments have you know are on
track or whether one department you know
has done huge image for the clouds image
as you huge budget for the cloud and the
other dependents a tiny budget for for
for netbeans and they have to fight with
each other I don't know what's going on
so I'm I think the future is still
bright and if not we have alternatives I
mean IntelliJ is great and Eclipse
becomes also more and more interesting
and in one day properly Oracle will
recognize that you know having just you
know public clouds is not the right
business and then they will move back
and just you know it's like every
everything you know moves back and forth
a little bit so very interesting
question let's see what happens in the
chat I think which is somehow good
because we almost a one hour left we
always one hour discussing so but this
is a very great question and it goes
like this so there is lots of bulkhead
pattern discussion so which I also
implement it
porcupine on my github account porcupine
and the idea of protecting business
services from blocking app server
introducing additional thread pulls for
GDP high HTTP and jdbc yeah now there is
no threat pool for jdbc there's none
Fred port for HTTP and jdbc is just pull
another thread pool so in reactive style
web programming in many blog posts the
author's mentioned the jdbc drivers are
always looking and isn't and always
blocking and they are not scalable with
threat handling and therefore not
blocking database any girl are always
better yes how this is non blocking
database cause the bucket pattern
related can you also provide an example
with no secure database so right now I
use elastic search which with HTTP rest
interface and it worked very well so
example is like calling crest interface
so there's nothing else to do so it main
examples like calling a github rest api
is the same as would you call elastic
search database so I'm so the authors
are always true but if you use in some
of my project we are able to handle with
for application service the whole Europe
several thousands requests per second
and in one projects if you go here
attack there was an interview with a
company so one year ago RPC and they
were handled 25,000 remote procedure
calls per second with stock pyara ah no
tricks java ee lots lots of tests lots
of tuning but no I mean no reactive
programming nothing and and and there's
actually machines talking to them in
real time so i actually i cannot again
i'ma just a consultant i spend my time
in project like this and not a twitter
and facebook so if i would reach the
scale of facebook properly it is a bad
idea to run facebook on an application
server but none of my clients is
facebook so whatever i do my projects
the application servers
were always better than expected so I
can't remember a case were the problem
was jdbc driver or GMS or whatever the
problem were always misunderstood
transactions locking synchronized blocks
or whatever it was actually developer
mistakes but I can't remember that the
application server in any case was too
slow and by the way if you know such a
case just drop me a mail I will or a
twit I will really interests it when you
found because I'd never saw it so
everyone talks about you know bed
scalability of replication service but
it's somehow not measurable so what you
can what it would you get out of the box
are several thousand transactions per
second let's say we check saw resin a
JDBC driver and and of course and then
if you have a lot of processing cpu
whatever then of course you get slow and
slower but this is as it should be I
guess okay i will drop it to chat as
well okay now we have it here so
reactive style i think is interesting
for particular use cases and and no i
think none of my client such has some
problems but I could imagine if you are
no you have several hundred thousands
concurrent requests then you have to
implement it differently okay so and
Daniel again ask me so this is like a
team created DUI and the question is
know how to communicate with the back
end how to achieve that and what I do
usually we do the another other way
around we created back end first and
with a mock rest interfaces and by the
way this is well hopefully well
described in a conference talk
called mobile first something like this
building mobile first services with the
killer micro service platform this is
what I tried to explain in this talk
this is just a half an hour so just
pacing the chant so and what I did in
the talk i just created a fake a fake
jacks or a service we just expose a JSON
file and then you do it right it in the
front end this is what we usually always
do and there is actually no framework
necessary in the front end because
angularjs has the HTTP in which is
injected and in react I always use this
XML HTTP request which is also in my
screencast and youtube so go to Java
with angular or Java EE with react and
you will see this ok two days ago
Monsieur Goralski so no questions here
um othman ask me i'm in an example for
no SQL DB with JP an entity manager and
this is an easy so if you go to morphia
this is 14 it is not exactly jpa but
almost like JP it looks like jpa where
are the examples it looks like
just look at the examples here driver
they have even asynchronous API but
there should be so I put it the chat
homework assignment list search for the
example it use it really looks like like
Java jpa then eclipselink I think what I
have Cassandra and MongoDB so it is
already four years old they have support
for mongodb Cassandra and stuff so
already done in chat and lately of
course haibane 80 GM so they map to
infinity span Cassandra and MongoDB I
think so there's multiple databases
involved and the last one I actually
forgot this was the there is also one
which the google app engine is using ok
so i hope you have enough examples right
now ok so i was interesting article
there is and develop a block spring
cloud for micro services compared to
Cuba natives so they compared spring
cloud to Cuba natives and and they say
okay this is like that and the
comparison is here and it says ok ah
this is spring cloud this is Cuban it is
and where is java and i never start
project like this I have to admit so for
instance so if you start with spring
boot you can pick a profile and you can
you can choose pick and choose whatever
like here and I started this year or I
started several projects with startups
actually and after 10 seconds you know
we forgot the application server so just
fully focus on Java and if there was
some bulkhead you know problematic then
we brought two classes and we get our
back bulkhead if we need a circuit
breaker we introduce an interceptor one
class and we had the Interceptor but I
never mentioned that this is a bulkhead
interceptor whatever so what I never did
in a real-world projects so you had like
this like this like oh you will need
load balancing you know what we should
use we could of course these engineers
in a chai proxy by the way if you would
like to see it go to github.com and
search for i think is called dhokla no I
think this Docklands project and you
will find here ingenix and H a proxy
engine proxy and engine equipped load
balancing in whatever you would desire
because I get a lot of question i
implement this but I never mentioned
this at the beginning of the project
because no one is interested about this
at the beginning of the project really
except of course you know you are a
consultant and you would like you know
to where is it to impress your clients
then you can I ask you know what you
using for load balancing API gateway or
API goat is also nice thing so I'm only
one case we used API gateways because we
had to to be able to swap commercial
services in the real time and this was
API gateway was the nice thing usually
we don't use API gateways because we
don't have you know hundreds of services
as I stated in the article so if you
stay to the article so we have see in
order to build a scalable resilient
microservices systems it could grow to
tens or hundreds of services what it
basically means is if you can't wait law
it means you have a one team one service
this is what you usually do so we will
have ten of teams or hundreds of teams
so it's assumed one teen
300 people 100 there were 300 people in
the project is I mean I not in projects
like that so I have to to say we have
the most 10 micro services I would say
there's like ten wars and this is a huge
project already so it's not like we
build hundreds of microservices just
because we can we could of course but
why there should be a reason why you
introduce a new micro service and the
only best practice I know microservices
don't distribute if you can ship a
monolith just do it you mean and if it's
if you if there are benefits to
introduce microservices then they are
benefit so you split your model if to
micro services and and you are fine so
this is my personal take on that so I'm
if you would assume that you have to
have for hundreds of micro services then
of course you will have to manage them
somehow you need additional software the
question is why you have hundreds of
micro services and there's a funny story
I was a Java user group and someone
asked me know how I start my micro
services manager how I start I mean I
use JavaScript and they're starting and
you are set so I script we have a
hundreds of microservices okay really is
a how big is a team yeah five people say
okay and why you built this micro
services and doesn't answer he he like
it was like a deadlock said oh I
actually don't know I am I thought I was
supposed to know to create a lots of
microservices just to create micro
services so I think the year or 2070
would be like back to pragmatic
applications so instead of deploying
hundreds of micro services you will have
just a couple of microservices exactly
what happened with maven if you remember
at the beginning of maven projects there
are project lies hundreds of movie
modules because we can and now the
reasonable project for instance in lots
of my project which has just one module
/ war and nothing else so um this is
always back to pragmatism okay so so
what my take on this is
in in for instance this is complete
different philosophy but this is the
only difference if you have spring blood
springwood spring blood spring boot what
you have the total flexibility what you
can choose you can compose your app if
you use a java application server you
get everything at once so now the
question is no what is the what is the
pros and cons so in the spring boot in
theory you can just pick and choose what
you like the problem is you have to pick
and choose in the Java EE case you get
everything at once and dnd and the
disadvantage of this of course is
potentially can be slow which is not the
case if you have docker so just go to my
youtube channel you will see most of the
deployments built image build creations
takes milliseconds so it's not matter at
all whether the application server is
100 Meg's to 20 megs or 30 max does met
at all what matters is the war size and
spring boot tends to use no larger wars
and or were larger jars fed wars on fed
jars which I don't like a lot I would I
really see the advantage of having a
thin Wars and and this is the MDD main
difference between both and of course
also i have to admit in my project i've
really find that the app projects
perform stress tests first so it's like
a new huge undertaking that they test
distressed as if we then we identify
bugs and the box can be fixed by
bulkhead circuit breaker whatever and at
the Java user group hamburg in december
they told me ok but we use will really
like to introduce histories because the
client gets a nice dashboard and with
java ee just get the numbers and they
don't look that nice and it would nice
to have dashboards and we can charge the
clans a little bit more and and and and
and i said okay but do you really what
happens with the dashboards and diagrams
I look at them are they somehow you know
incorporated to the stress tests or what
happens with the information and there
was action answer no the client just
like the dashboards okay actually a min
task force right now it started in
November and it goes to the next year
there are lots of dashboard dashboards
with elk whateva is a huge distributed
system and they have so many dashboards
and no one knows what's going on so it's
like you know information overflow lots
of fine-grained information and no one
knows which use cases are actually
successful so compare it to to compare
spring cloud with javi as you mentioned
several times what I do is I create from
time to time my own Hardware my own
Javier mine own service so I just pick
and choose parts which makes lots of fun
and I create my own hardware and my of
everything blocks my blocks and stuff
runs on the hardware and this is more or
less the spring put approach where you
pick and choose stuff would you like so
I do it in Malaysia and I really enjoy
it but I never would you know propose to
my clients to create a hardware just
buying stuff from Amazon and sticking
together why because then you are a
unique snowflake so no one else will
have your configuration so on this is
fine for me because my purpose of the
whole thing is to learn new stuff but if
I would advise my clients know in eighty
percent of all cases I will advise you
to buy stock had via and not build you
own but still I build my own because I
enjoy it and because I would say we are
all java developers and we are
implemented java room for years I
getting less and less interested in
fiddling with infrastructure I would
rather die on pyara guys or redhead guys
to give me the application server and I
would like to focus just on the domain
and not fiddle with the infrastructure
and whatever you say this not all my
clients have these problems like for
instance district hystrix turbine or
ribbon or whatever it is central part of
application server I have really find
that someone actually looks at the
numbers they were always there and no
one is interested because no one cares
about us so if we get to know whether
they're ignorant Netflix hystrix or
ignore the application server this
numbers get still ignored so I would say
yes in theory everything is nice in
practice in my projects it does not
matter a lot and by the way prometheus
is nice you will hear
about this in subsequent episodes on
even on get up soon okay so um could you
compare Java environm to it or how can
fit to this or solve such problems if
you look at my youtube channel you will
see there's lots of the problems in java
ee are solved with one class of view
lines of code because everything is
incorporated in the application server
since 10 years okay i got a nice email
two days ago it's like someone would
like to use TCP UDP connection from
seven client and they would like to use
the concurrency utilities for java and
the question is can they use resource
adapter or is would it be allowed to use
and singleton egb and first static
threads in EG p is prohibited just in EG
bees is not plated prohibited in CDI
which is ridiculous because egb and CDI
run in the same process so whatever
can't you know screw up your process it
could also you know it could do the same
harm seat from CDI servlets or EG bees
so you have to know what you are doing
so using for instance what you could do
in an ejb you can inject for instance
look at my porcupine first so if you
like github project porcupine park you
pine it's already using production in
several projects yes bring blood this
was this was not on purpose this was
like so what it does it gets injectable
execute or service so with that you get
executed injectable execute or service
which can start not start threads it
will reuse manage threat form
application server and then if you pass
the threats to D to your to your socket
you get the whatever you you you need
and but it shouldn't be like this that
your HTTP called blocks and wait until
you get you know the connection back so
you should couple four inches a cymol
convene which manages threats and the
threats
or managers servers orchids and the
server socket use UDP tcp/ip or whatever
the messages could be translated to for
instance web sockets and pushed
asynchronously 2-d 2-d 2-d front end so
what you should not do is that you
should call from a client the back end
and the back end will block and wait
what for you for your socket to receive
anything so what it means you should
know what you are doing you should
perform a stress tests and you should
look at the stress at this the threats
from Java Mission Control or form from
Jay visualvm at least and see how many
threads are actually started and whether
your approach is robust enough okay
almost done i hope so i've been working
with spring boot and it's incredible
useful yes it is we covered it right now
you should try java ee or go to just use
from docklands a for instance pyara pink
or white flag pink and then just compare
this I offer this technology to clans
with small Newton is very reliable by
the way i offered java ee to a start-up
one-man show and i will the interviews
in the makings i will our publish it in
on my blog soon i got also several
requests from dif startups we just would
like to be effective or productive and i
still think that java is boring but has
unbeatable productivity the entry point
is better option than verte press or PHP
this is a hard one because i don't think
you know spring boot can even compete
with wordpress so that process is really
great and PHP is different stories or
what I up surface at my Eric's at Munich
all they are always pH more and more
actually PHP developers and it tell me
Java is great this is the feedback if
after the course always say is
incredible how good Java actually is for
me it is really funny because if you if
you read blogs a PHP is lightweight in
Java is heavy weight whatever but if
they see what actually Java pragmatic
Java actually means they
delighted what are your thoughts about
this product what I already saw this
size spring boot is very cool if you
have specific needs and Java is good
enough for eighty percent of cases so
and if I don't have to feel those
dependencies I don't do this so this is
the only thing so and I don't think you
have to deal with spring boot with XML
at all you can you can do it with
annotations sure if you if you're happy
with spring boo just use it just try
java ee go to Docklands and start one of
my images and just compare both and
provide feedback will be routine either
the next you know XD v who could even
interview or whatever about this could
be interesting feedback by the way
forgot one point something funny
happened last year feedback from the
Java user groups so I'm talking from
time to time of Java user groups and
what what usually happen to know I
propose my talk and people come and
usually denote they will talk about Java
in micro servers or whatever but there
was and Java user group hamburg in
December there was like a blind date
never no one knows that I will come the
the room was packed and then I hacked
something which AVI and I asked what
they are using there are lots of spring
boot guys in the audience and as they
saw what I did they say we actually will
have to try jovi again so they were
everyone was happy with spring boot no
one said oh no it's crap or it's too
slow whatever but they admitted okay the
dependency graph is huge and the
deployment times that always as fast as
javi but what I underestimated actually
spring boot is very popular right now
and it was clear in the blind date
because there are lots of people using
spring wooden nonetheless they stay
until the end of the show and they were
impressed how productive Java can be and
some of them say we really have to retry
Java because they didn't you that it
looks like it like it looks like now
also interesting at the last acts in
Munich there were participants who try
to omit EG bees and jazz you see di
because they believed ahead of the
several times that EG bees are starting
threats in the background which is not
true at all so this is like you know
there are some no mysterious information
in the internet about EG bees java ee
and whatever so I'm be careful and there
is no secret source in Java neither in
spring boot or spring or drop wizard or
whatever and all the service I
technologies are similar what can change
is a thing in spring boot five sorry
spring five will introduce this reactive
programming where there will be no
non-blocking i/o with custom jdbc
drivers so this would be something new
but right now spring boot and and java
architectures are somehow similar ok i
will look at the chat no questions in
the chat no questions in the twitter so
i would say for the first show of 2017
it was it was a very long one one of the
longest thank you for the questions and
see you in February of course in march
in javascript and meaning a bot and in
april in the new courses microservices
and of course performance monitoring and
troubleshooting and or at conferences
are lots of conferences conferences are
coming and what I also we do just watch
my youtube channel i will have some
ideas for new screencasts so thank you
for watching and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
