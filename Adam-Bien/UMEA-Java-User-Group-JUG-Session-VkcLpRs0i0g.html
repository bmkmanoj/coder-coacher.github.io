first Java user group session and
welcome for Munich so um this session is
I guess in mu mu or umi I still don't
know what is exactly spelled or
pronounced and so we have minus minus
four degrees in in Munich right now so
I'm really curious how cold is in on
your side and yeah welcome and start
with the content so what we will do
today is the following so um you already
asked some questions and I thought I
would just answer the questions and feel
free to ask whatever you like using the
chat so you will see the chat on the on
the home page and if we cover all your
questions if you answer all the
questions we are basically done and we
can go home so so let's start let's
start with the content so yeah Java user
group and it's going to be a java java
conversation a 2016 starter so about me
I'm a fool Ian Sir John a developer I'm
spending all my time in Java EE projects
from time to time I would say two weeks
a year or three weeks a year I am
delivering workshops mostly at Munich
Airport and they were already at Indies
from Sweden and also from Omo in Munich
and now the funny story is they found I
would say back then it was before
Christmas in Munich were about 5 degrees
plus 5 to 10 degrees plus siliceous and
they found it extremely cold so I was
really fascinated by that because they
were they had really thick jackets and
and gloves and we had attendees from
Costa Rica and Utah and they found it
actually warm so what's funny is like
you you are not custom to to to really
low temperatures it seems like okay so
arm
right a block from time to time not to
forget things or if I find something out
so I just put it on my block so these
are this is the only to divert shops if
you like to to stay in touch what I
usually do I announce such events like
for instance this one using the mailing
list a hex news is about 600 subscribers
right now and there's a bunch of
on-demand workshops one of them is
effective Java EE I also have one Java
testing and Java bootstrap and there is
more in the pipeline okay ext foul the
first Monday of the month it is exactly
the same infrastructure like this so
what I do I gather the whole month
questions on my github gist so you can
ask whatever you like it should be Java
in Java related and I try to answer
everything in about one hour okay and if
you like come to Munich so this is we
had already a lot of energies from omou
and Sweden and all over the place so the
next workshops are in January
micro-services and continues Java 7
testing so and this was the very last
slide and now I switch to chat so minus
15 degrees so a little bit colder than
Munich but still manageable so I was in
Bavarian forest here in Germany so
there's a lot of a large minus 20 minus
25 so we are on the same on the same
climate almost so ok if you like ask the
very first question so use the chat ask
the questions if not I will go to to the
Google Chrome and there is one of the
questions and a start was the first one
what do you think a typical web
application should look like how should
it be built so I think the trend go is
going clearly to single page
applications so it's not a website
anymore it is going to to be an
application so it will behave like let's
say swing in the old days but but it's
written with JavaScript html5 this is
what I see more and more weather
everything is going to be like this
let's see but this is war
what is expected right now on the other
hand what I also see the trench to
native applications so on what I would
say so html5 was very interesting on
native devices but right now the trend
is going to native apps or written in I
would say how it's called Swift or
objective-c on iOS or not the Android
Java flavor on on Android devices but
the question is clearly about how it
should look like from Java perspective
and this question is not going ask a lot
because what usually happens I would say
the vast majority of all my Java EE
applications come with rest interface so
this is how we expose the business logic
and if you have the arrestee interface
then it's very easy to build an html5
app what is it usually so in Java world
I would say 80% is angular react is
gaining traction and there is some you
know functional JavaScript flavors one
would say angular 1 is still gaining
momentum and angular 2 is on horizon but
I don't think it is can be used
productively right now or it could be
used productively but the tooling and
everything is not as easy as expected I
would say right now but it will change
quickly so usually how a typical
application should look like so you have
one part which is angular it's
completely independent from the back end
and the back end is usually Java
applications exposed with jax-rs
end points and these jacksters endpoints
are in charge of exposing the business
logic via rest what's more important how
jax-rs should look like so how rest
should look like and it is it is long a
story but my my personal I don't know
quality metric is if a business person
would be forced to look at the rest
Auri it should know what's going on
there
so the Ori the rest interfaces should be
recognizable and self descriptive so
this is how it should look like okay I
think this question is answered and okay
so this is the first level what's
stunning or interesting is I supported
some startups in the last two years and
they used Java because of productivity
and the funny story is all of these
startups used JSF and primefaces in
particular because of productivity and
what I told you right now with the
angular what I see angular mostly an
enterprise project so it's really crazy
world they're like the huge companies
using angular just look at the interview
for instance Commerce Bank whatever I
wrote this they just started with
angular right away and they were really
happy with it and also the typical
startup is also using angular JSF which
is start up on the enterprise project
are using angular so on and why they are
using JSF and all really happy with Jess
F because in start-up if you are the
boss you can decide how the design looks
like so you can just pick the for
instance primefaces components and if
you happy with it you are basically done
but it enterprise
the design is or the functional
requirements are not coming from from
one person they are coming from
different department and therefore it is
lot harder to implement all requirements
of the world with component frameworks
like JSF so my observation is startups
tend to choose GSF because they are
really fast and enterprises are are
choosing html5 because they have no idea
what is coming
so the requirements are not known yet so
they should be as flexible as possible
so I will go briefly to the 2d chat and
see whether you happy with the answer
so there is no news what it means you
are probably happy by the way if you
don't have the access to the chat you
can also use Twitter and send me a
question or use the hashtag for instance
a hex or or use a hex because it is I'm
searching for this right now
yeah any questions no questions so and
and it by if you by accident tuned in
from somewhere else just ask also
questions you don't have you know to add
to attend the Omiya jack
so when you think rest which level of
rest is appropriate when is hard to us
something to strive for how to implement
it so how to us hearty OS this is hyper
engine as something hypermedia as the
engine of application state
I always forget it and this is the
description so what I would say
something like this is nice so get
account I would say even not account but
accounts is a plural and if you do this
it is self descriptive everyone knows
what's going on and the response is like
this and this also serves the scripting
so you have to person with throat fancy
clothes and I would say I would strive
to something like this but I wouldn't
exaggerate so um I mean if you the
question is now when it is good enough
so this is the basic question and in our
case we were happy in case the UI team
could call us without asking too many
questions so then you know you are
basically done but you know just using
how-tos in and aiming for be a perfect
at us is like you know aiming for have
perfectly normalized database which can
be a goal in a university but I don't
think it is is a goal in a real world
project a noodle war project no one
should call you know no one should
strive for
database normalization or or rest huh
tus how it's actually pronounced hottie
OS quality rather than saying okay I'm
exposing a self descripting rest or e y
self descriptive because I'm lazy I
don't like to write a lot and I don't
need generators I've right just have
descriptive rest and hope no one will
ask any questions about you know how to
use the rest endpoint and in my eyes if
you look let's say PayPal rest RP there
are there are some good references if
you go to PayPal this is for instance
one of the references if you see a curl
for instance I would like to use I would
like to request a payments payment with
Barrett token and whatever and what I
get back is the payment with all
transactions so um if let's go back what
we also see look our payment so payments
payment payment ID so no surprises so I
think if you know what payment is you
would be able you know to to use the
PayPal REST API the same is true for
github the rest are P so um let's see
not authorization issues you know get
issues get user issues get organizations
org ID issues so there are no surprises
so if someone knows github and looks at
the ori then it then it's clear you know
what to expect and i would say something
like the paypal api or github api would
be good enough or something like Epcot
net REST API so nice
so let's say we have lookup user were
story here users use ID or I would like
to block user so let's go here so post
users user ID block no surprises
so I would say I would strive for
something like this regardless how
complete it is in you know from the from
the perspective of hot us so many
questions so are you still happy yet
there's always some lake I don't know
why but there is some like you know
because probably because of speed of
light so um so eight nine five nine one
anonymous are you happy in MooMoo or who
me yes no and anyone else so we have
already one two three four five six
attendees which is nice okay which
patterns do you recommend hexaco
hexagonal architecture layers so um I
would say so I spent most of them or all
of my time in enterprise Java EE
projects right now and what I would I
recommend is simple architectures and I
will try to draw my architecture or my
architecture and actually actually
Architecture from Ivor Jacobsen called
ECB and it always looks like this and I
actually draw it over and over again but
get still questions regarding - this was
seems to be an interesting topic
so my first principle is I organized the
code using domain responsibilities never
technical responsibilities you might say
ok it's obvious but what it actually
means in my in
in my cases I don't use names like
exceptions beans D TOS hours no one
cares about this rather than we start
with package and this package has
business meaning like for instance
university or students but not you know
interfaces so and all package have
factional names and what the names come
from there are actually the essential
entities or the decor concept of your
project and there are a couple of such
of such folders if I had layering like
presentation
in business this would be GSF and inside
business I would have the components
like University students and courses
something like this ok so again so what
we do you start with let's say Sweden
dot dark dot application name
application name dot and then I would
say presentation and business
presentations JSF and it's optional so
if you don't have and we don't have Ches
F we don't have this layer and then we
also don't have the business layer so we
opt so we just remove the business
altogether so this business layer is
only if we have presentation and then I
start with packages which are actual
components with business names so what
we said is students so and now this is
what I borrowed from Iver Jacobson what
I really like is the entity control
boundary pattern and the boundary is the
first layer then we have the middle
layer which is optional and we have the
entity layer which is also optional but
usually it is dark because the entities
are you know the lifeblood these are the
domain objects which are usually also
persistent so the boundary are eg B's
because of transactions controls are
pojos and entities are JP objects or
produce and the name of the packages is
boundary control entity this is what we
do in projects and I interview already
several projects on my block and they
tend to be really
happy with this choice so you can I
think last week I interviewed someone
who started with Java and uses boundary
control and dependency okay since we're
using there are no questions left is
perfectly simple so and with that with
that it it's actually set you know this
is our architecture so if there is
something to be reused let's say we have
a package with common functionality
let's say here I don't know what it
could do homework let's say homework is
not a external service but it can be
reused between different components so
um this is just a component without a
boundary just with the control and with
the entity and can be chat between the
other components now as you probably
know the TM or just okay now how many
developers are building the components I
would say a pizza team so 2 to 5
developers is enough everything what is
great is built by extremely small teams
so if you'd have this all the components
are in a war
and this war is small enough so there
are no external dependencies in Java EE
world I try to you know avoid any
dependencies or has to be small if there
were small diploma this faster so we
have to work and there is another war
and this war has to communicate with the
other war and if we do this what we get
is communication between wars and now
you can call communication between wars
micro-services and therefore all my
projects are right now micro service
projects because what we do if the
application is large enough we have a
view Wars with a view teams and they
have to communicate with each other so
right now we not only covered ECB but we
also are micro service compliant which
which what means actually we are
compatible with any conference right now
ok I hope it is clear I will briefly
look at a chat where is my chat here oh
very good question so um do you think is
ok to have a separate rest a period for
the user interface besides the one for
integration we never did this but you
have if you could explain me why it is
better it's ok if there is no
explanation you know there is just
because you would like to be flexible or
whatever then I will reject the idea but
if you say ok now the user interface has
a completely different set of
requirements than the internal interim
micro service rest api then it's just
fine I actually never did it so our our
external REST API was always the same
and very popular question is do you have
any preferences on REST API versioning
yes I have so when to use the versioning
in in the Ori and when to use someone
said hello master Adam beam so I'm the
master branch there could be a clone of
me he's like make a branch so um so um
what is the pros and cons of de
versioning so why PayPal is versioning
the early because PayPal is powerful
enough so what I can afford is to
provide multiple versions at the same
time and to you the users will migrate
to the newest version this is not always
true in the enterprise so if I in my
project would introduce who would like
to introduce you know versions in the
Ori and will just upgrade the URI no one
would care this is the problem so I
would have you know to find the
department and say hey you use please my
recent version and they say yeah but the
old is working and we are not interested
in we have no resources to upgrade so I
would say if you can control the client
and the backend then use the version in
the URI if you cannot if you don't know
the client and you are not not as
powerful as PayPal Amazon whatever I
don't think it is a good idea to version
the D D D D or E or use the the the Ori
for versioning rather than being always
backward compatible in one point of time
a second now it's a really big change
and we just change everything so like
you know we try to be backwards
compatible as long as possible in one
point of time you said now we introduced
breaking changes so what it actually
mean you will never be able to remove
anything so this is the problem okay you
could use also make media type this is
true but I don't even know what what I
would do not using version all together
and we backward compatible so what it
would mean I would have to use system
tests and just check out automatically
all known version of the system test and
all versions of the system test will
test
the most recent service Ori okay the
user interfaces requirements in the air
okay I see you so what do you what do
you mean is okay the for the user
interfaces you will need a how to call
it a rest so I would say you are just
designing completely differently you
know to just a driver for you I could be
you know DD screen or already another
screen D D view and not the business
then I see then you will have a valuable
I would say higher level rest api and
another one for Snape a you I highly
optimized for the I so I see the point
so yes so but I would consider the UI
REST API as throwaway API so say okay
which it would change whenever the user
interface changes and the other API will
be like the canonical API okay other
questions no questions so um the next
question is what I think about domain
driven design strategic and tactical
patents
so actually strategic and tactical it's
the question what do you mean by that
but domain driven design have strong
opinions it works
for more complex applications so if you
application is just Kratt create route
read user update and delete and you know
you just manipulating the data setting
in a database and then domain driven
design will lead to anemic entities but
if your application is more
sophisticated when it is the case it is
the case when you for instance have to
usually it is a graph of objects which
represent something like we had the
problem several problems in transport or
problems there was complex algorithms
for in transport management systems
where we have to schedule transports and
optimize them
or in IOT World War there were
connections between devices with
different capabilities then
domain-driven design was perfect and
what it actually meant the entities the
JPA objects had behavior and were
persistent the controls were dumped they
were just you know we only implement it
or not even existing so it mainly
boundaries with with with queries
they're like the repository pattern then
we then we had domain objects with
behavior and controls were basically not
not existent and the yeah this was the
domain driven design in Java I call that
the gateway pattern so if you have my
book you can lend it for free from
Amazon and search for Gateway you will
find how it works so what do you usually
will do you will have a stateful session
bean or session scoped CDI bean and
extended entity manager and then you
basically I can go with domain driven
design so domain driven design is
usually stateful because if you were
stateless you will have to reload all
the objects at each request which can
can lead to slow or some performance
overhead okay now we covered this just
go back to the chat no questions in the
chat so what it basically means is that
we will be done in a few minutes because
we will cover all the questions if you
don't have any additional questions we
are done a definition so micro service
versus right-size services is
transactions over several services
always a bit idea it is always a bad
idea because it's not even possible to
properly properly implement that now the
explanation oh now it's a nice question
have you experienced with scenarios
where JDBC is preferable to JPA yes
if you are thinking about reports so
what you usually do with reports you
would use tools like
jasperreports or eclipse pert and in
this particular under this particular
case it is really hard to implement that
with JP objects JDBC is just preferable
also if you are not interested in the
entities rather than in the whole table
so what it means you are interested in
let's say exports imports on data
transformations and I actually even
implemented something like this it's
based on JDBC and somehow popular and
this thing is called an intruder so and
what an hydrator does it just reads
something from a JDBC datasource and you
can apply lambda Java 8 functions to it
for data transformations and it stores
in JDBC back or writes a JSON file or
whatever like and it's used in
commercial projects actually a lot and
so you can see it just reads from
database and and-and-and-and-and right
CSV is the whole configuration and this
is JDBC without even Java so this is
Java 8 project everything and there's
one particle adapter for something like
JPA so you can read from JDBC or read
from CSV and and right JP objects but is
not the general case so this is I think
a good example where JDBC is better
suited than JPA because if I would use
GPA for this I would have to generate
GPA entities for all possible tables and
with that I can just say go to table
make from you know column named student
or first name or let's say make from our
student table and column H an integer
you know and I don't know compute the
days and and put it to a CSV
and using this I don't have to implement
any coding for this it's almost like
scripting and it actually uses scripting
behind the scenes as well you can use
NASA warrant for him to implement the
business logic but with JPA it wouldn't
be as easy I would have to recompile the
whole projects on any change so I'm
having said this so what you probably
see is that GPAs are GPA is more about
it's more about type safety and JDBC is
more about flexibility also if you know
what they are doing I would say in a
classical enterprise projects most of
the use cases are implementing
implemented with GPA and for for really
performance critical stuff we still use
JDBC or if you if you are using if you
don't have Java 7 yet you have to use
Java 6 so you will have to use JDBC to
access for instance stored procedures or
all functions perfect so we covered one
more question
and now micro-services right-sized
services is transaction over several
services always a pet idea so micro
services the term micro I would say is
as stupid as the no in no sequel
databases because no one knows what
micro actually means and you know just
think about this you know distributing
so putting one method one Java method as
a micro service and encoded remotely as
you probably remember the old j2e days
we were already there so the very first
container managed not yeah container
managed persistence entity beans were
all remote so every getter and setter
were was remote so we could call you
know the old entity beans micro services
because you had to call several getters
and setters remotely you know to even
update and one row in a database and of
course it never worked
so the subsequent versions were always
local so there was no such so the right
and so our remote service
has always to be coarse-grained because
of latency and and and remoting okay
micro-services right so services in
transactions is a bad idea
yes it it always is so first how micro
services are deployed so we have one War
and another war and what I forgot to
mention big dentists this wars are
deployed on an application server there
is no share deployments let's say payara
and white fly and we have of course
Liberty profile from IBM a great one
profile from IBM and WebLogic server
also nice the newest one from from
Oracle so and the thing is each
application server runs on the own JVM
JVM JVM and JVM and in my case actually
and in most of my project is running on
toca so the point is each war runs in
own container they can say it's crazy
lots of hot overhead actually on my
application civil right now or mark my
hardware server right now is a new one I
just introduced a new one I have right
now about six different containers and
in total they use a gig of ram and and
it works very performant and very well
the point being is because we have
multiple processors and why we have
multiple processors because we need the
maximal the maximum independence
isolation and isolation this is the
whole point of micro services I can ship
you know here version 1 1 and here
version 2 and they are independent
of independent of each other the problem
is what if we create here another
microservice which has to call all the
others micro-services and you can
probably see this if you would I would
attempt to stand transaction here it
would mean two-phase commit and XA and
two-phase commit annex a I would say is
a really bad idea to use it and it works
it rarely works because they are usually
multiple vendors involved and and what
you would do you would probably try to
use a no two-phase commit over jax-rs
and so over ASCII and this may of course
work but usually it doesn't why not
because if you have two-phase commit you
all have to deal deal with X I exception
and the exception comes with a lots of
problems and for instance what I like
the most or is the finest one heuristic
mix two transaction branch has been
holistically committed and rolled back
so what it basically means this was
rolled back and this was committed and
you will have to resolve the errors
which is hard to resolve but usually the
errors are ignored so on what you should
do instead instead of relying on
synchronous chaining of interactions
here you should think about
fire-and-forget so what it will mean you
would say okay hey student or non
student let's say Amazon I would like to
buy this book and Amazon says okay got
it but wait until I check you know the
availability and then it writes again to
the user hey it is available would you
like would you like to still have it and
say yes I will and will just order the
book here so okay the book is all that
but can be you know that I don't know
the DHL or whatever the email system is
overloaded but it will come to you
tomorrow is it okay to say yes okay
then I will charge you and we try to use
this system so it's like a ping-pong and
this works were the world so what it
basically means you will have to
refactor existing applications to
achieve that okay and right sighs so
this is why I don't actually get the
micro service ID a lot because this we
did four years we didn't use daca we
used virtualization for this but my idea
was always to create you know small
teams or delivering building small Wars
and they communicate with each other so
at the beginning we use CORBA and remote
my remote method invocations we actually
never use soap and now we can use rest I
hope you are happy and yes you are happy
because you even unser asked another
great question how do you test the
contract between micro services so this
is actually stuff from the last two
weeks of workshops so they try to
generate in our code generate API and
don't believe in God code generation a
lot in in micro-services because if we
generate the code the questions asked
always you know who is in charge of the
code and what happens if the generated
code changes so what I think should
happen instead is the following so we
have one micro service I would say well
it's micro service is a war which this
is the order system and I would like to
use this micro service and I am the
shipping system shipment this is one
team and this is another team ok so what
I would do or what we did is the
following we created a system test here
with jax-rs to all client and the system
test tests
d order system but the system tests is
implemented from perspective of the
users so why we did this because it's
the easiest possible thing to do if you
have the system tests here you what they
also wrote is the client classes Depot
Jo's which can be reused so from the
system tests we get the controls so
there is not a lots of waste involved ok
and now comes the trick so this war
there's a CCI pipeline it's built here
completely and tested with own system
tests but what we also have is like you
know independent independent Jenkins and
thus independent Jenkins runs the system
tests here so what it means this
pipeline tests everything from the
perspective of this project and then
another shared pipeline is running with
all different system tests from
different teams and before we release
this service this project manager of
this service can look at the pipeline
and see hey this works this works but
this is broken and the question is
should we still release or not and now
there's now the I would say it becomes
obvious that a change of this service
breaks another service so this is what
we do in projects and this works well
well enough because of the quality of
this system test is low then you know
then this project doesn't care then
everything is green and this project
will break which which is a pity but
then they should increase in the quality
of the system tests here ok we covered
this and now look at the next question
oh when JSF is useful still use who is
absolutely useful the question is how to
use JSF and what we do is the following
primefaces org I think so let's say ok
go to primefaces go to the showcase
nobody sees a lots of components and we
have first data and data grid and data
is the most problematic stuff data list
and whatever and the deal is the
following
we used successfully JSF in projects
were extremely productive with it what I
did was the following we went to the
users and told them look at the showcase
you get you can choose whatever you like
but you get it as this we can probably
probably you know change the font and
the color but nothing else there is no
behavior change possible so it's not was
not completely true but we say it was
impossible so then they use adjust you
know picked from the showcase the
components it's ok would like this
component of this component this
component but I never got the idea that
I don't know within the list we they
wouldn't it would like to have you know
a table for four and A three four five
so I'm with that GSF is ultra productive
what should you never do is to attempt
you know to to to extend the already
existing components because what you are
doing then effectively is you are
forking the framework and and and this
is almost criminal because if primefaces
releases a newer version you will have
to update your fork which actually never
happens and then you will stick with the
old primefaces version properly we know
with security issues or whatever so
JSF is extremely is extremely productive
as I would say it has a bright future if
you are using it properly and properly
means if you are using the components as
they are if you have additional
requirements I would rather contribute
the code to primefaces
or ask them to fix or did what we did in
previous projects we we hired the
primefaces guys who Zoe bought support
and they and they extended the
apprentices framework for us and it
worked great so it's not okay any
questions so I think I answered all your
questions from the website
any other questions are waiting a bit if
not we are basically set
no questions
if you have any questions left hood you
can always do you can go to the guests
from a github account and this is the
23rd a hex Quay it is the first February
so it is in about two weeks
and you can ask and whatever you like
and I will answer them and at the first
February 6 p.m. the first Monday of the
month is there a way to quickly get a
Java EE projects up a running
I mean how it looks like you go here and
say
then I say new Java class as II
need for speed and I hope my servers are
not running let's look at the server ok
looks good run will ask me which server
to choose I would just choose PI era for
now and deploy it with a little bit of
luck it should works out of the box so
this is what you have to do to have a
service Java EE micro service if you
look at this you only need one single
dependency nothing else and you are
basically set so resources or was it
hello need for speed so period so this
is whatever you need if you would like
to extend that you can say ok I get a
class called order manager and it just
and gets the status not available that
this would be the boundary I will put it
to you boundary and this is going to be
a stateless egb and then the hello
resource is going to be here and it
would look like this at inject order
manager and here
and build it clean and build it and
what's semicolon okay almost JavaScript
optional semicolon so and run it payara
now remember that
you have the order manager of course
completely wrong what I did I will have
to say not manager rather than status
Need for Speed not available so okay and
this was on maven application from
scratch with called application server I
would say I cannot imagine it can be
more productive effective or I mean
there's not even anything to remember
the only thing you have to remember is
you only need to one single dependency
we'll just provide a Java API 7 all so
the question is you know do you need
something else so what what do you need
instead of this or when it can be more
productive so let's see what the chat
says great questions on another MOS
eight nine five nine one you know you
need more so this is one where I show
you the the essential Java er artifact
which we use in all projects is the and
there's also an example so if you go
here and search for you get the BC
archetype which comes with everything
everything
which shows you know the system tests
and and a nice busy structure with a
registrations and the resources like an
example for sample projects so um
the spring boots something like a
profile and in Java 7
there is no profiles you just use
everything to Java API and this is tiny
it's just a set of interfaces and there
is there are no additional dependencies
in the in the war because whatever you
need is already on the server
what about registries for micro services
there are several attempts I there is
one interesting one I think it was
called Snoopy Snoopy github
I think it was from afar no snoop EE
github this might be better so this is
one which I know it exists and didn't
use it in projects but it has already 45
styles stars it could be interesting
what we used as a service registry is
just plain old Jay cash and for instance
something like Headlands so what
Headlands is it uses hazel caste behind
the scenes and exposes hazel cars forest
and what you can do is a key value in
memory grid you can store your
references to to store to rest services
we implemented a something like a
cluster with that in in the past but
usually you only need to know micro
service registries if you are lots of
micro services and I would say with this
approach what I explained you so far
what usually happens a small team two to
five developers produces one war let's
say you have a larger projects 15
developers which is actually a really
big so you get three Wars which
communicate with each other I don't
think we need a registry in this case
you would need two registry if you would
have to have you know 50 mic micro
services but in this particular case it
would mean in my Java EE world you would
have to coordinate 150 to 250 developers
which is which which cannot be any
productive okay
so any questions left
no questions if there are no questions
then we are basically set we are done I
would say thank you for watching and see
you and in one of upcoming conferences
so I'm on my block or Oh what I forgot
to tell you there's also a bunch of
online courses called the X I also
there's a bootstrap effective Java and
Java 7 testing so if you are if you
cannot come to Munich it's available
online this could might be interesting
for you and come to Munich or Co and the
first February next Monday and there are
no questions left of course not Java is
very simple very pragmatic so if you
just look at the code there can be no
questions right so I'm thank you for
watching and see you soon and enjoy the
cold winter in Sweden so thank you and
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
