talk about models and MVC so in the
recent example so what I did I created a
controller the controller had no idea
about the business logic it was just it
forwarded the or opacity control to the
GSP and the JSP fetched the hello model
and the hello model is like the data
transport that the glue between the view
and the business logic and the business
logic was the call to the greeting
service EJB so what we could do is we
can just change it a little bit so I
could remove that and inject it to the
controller so I go to the controller go
here and say yeah I would like to use
this and what I also would like to do is
to remove the annotation here so it
would be just plain pocho it would be
not managed by CDI or MVC at all so it's
just plain old Java class and then would
like to use the message string message
would like to use a to use it in a
constructor and expose it via a getter
and of course could be final this is
what that means complains here so we
have a simple a simple model which which
is exposed to the to the view and the
hello controller now it can and can
interact with the business logic message
message and just to recap this is just a
plain egb with a notation so this is
this one message and what we could do is
we could inject a helper class a nice
one and the helper class Innes models
models and what you can do you can pass
whatever that I like between the
controller and the view so in our case
we
we'll just use the models helper and and
store in the models the the model
modesty model new Hello model with the
payload message now the question is what
is the key and the key I would like to
use this as a key sir don't have to
change the template so I will use this
as a key so what happens now
so now the MVC works a little bit
differently the controller talks to the
business logic it fetches at index was
the business logic creates a POJO
and this poor Joe could be whatever
class you like it only has to have some
get us this could be for instance even a
JSON object it doesn't have to be
managed or it shouldn't be even managed
and now it makes it accessible with
hello JSP so let's try this out so I
will just run the server run the
application and hope that it will work
and yeah this is the preview of MVC
Model View controller which will come
with Java EE 8 so I will just go here
and say views and hello as you can see
we get exactly the same the same result
as the last time with a slightly
different interaction between Model View
and controller so thank you for watching
and I really like embassy this will
really nice API which comes with Java EE
8 and see you at upcoming conferences
Java on in autumn workshops Munich
Airport called a hex and yeah enjoy Java
so we are already 20 years of Java's oh
so enjoy the next 20 years thank you and
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
