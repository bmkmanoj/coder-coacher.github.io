and there's already a couple of
questions I think we have over 20 20
questions now some some drama and some
eager attendees from all over the world
so even from Mexico and Ecuador so as
you can see we have Spain my oka Mexico
and of course Ecuador and Paraguay and
they enjoy the arcade music which was
composed by me as you can see I'm very
talented music maker so um let's start
with the USD show java 8 news and
guardians and stuff so the first thing
is I yesterday announced a new workshop
and this about react GS so nothing with
Java more with JavaScript and with web
pack and angular and angular sorry with
gulp and stuff like this and I was asked
about a lot so there is going to be in
October earlier there is no time but it
might be fun so if you like attend that
then the regular workshops are already
well attended so everything will take
place so they are already sufficient
registrations to everything to bootstrap
effective architectures and even the vet
shops in July testing and micro services
there are already sufficient
registration so if you like to attend
just register and then start with the
Java 8 News so I got a lots of questions
and actually interview requests which I
will also perform what's the deal with
the Guardians and with Java EE and what
you should know I think at the beginning
of this year i created a slack working
group and invited a couple of people
meanwhile we are about 140 people from
all over the world and there is a ramen
also participates in the in the group
and then the eraser got the idea to
create another group called Java
guardians which is not really another
group is rather than
the same group with different target and
it is called Java guardians and what the
razor does is it tracks the progress of
Java e8 it makes more transparent and
what I attempt to do or would I this is
140 other people's people is to to push
java ee eight forward and create a
website is going to be java ee i oh
there's not online line and now with
lots of resources and community around
java ee so this is what happens behind
the scenes are no conspiracy i hope
everything is productive and there is a
nice leg channel so if you really would
like to contribute something to java 8
and you have constructive ideas pink me
via chat and lift the email i will
invite you there are actually two two
requirements the first one you have to
be nice I have a little bit sense of
humor and the next one and you should be
constructive you know and not right you
know long politics political emails with
some I don't know conspiracy theories or
whatever okay so now we covered this I
think this was all made of stuff and no
there is something as I actually wanted
there is a java ee guardians charter if
you search for this you will find the
the the article yeah but even even
better what you have to do after right
after this the show is to listen to a
podcast is a V Jack podcast virtual Jack
and it is really interesting podcast
with not life it is where was it past
sessions it was a session was razor and
with james gosling actually it was the
last one so you have to search for this
and there is in the show notes they
there is a link
to the to the Charter and where you can
sign up and to support the the the Java
EE Guardians so this is actually the
virtual jack podcast so we have to
actually search for the podcast past
sessions upcoming podcast exactly and
this is going to be this one the episode
11 show notes and there's the guardians
of the galaxy this is not the eraser is
not involved in this movie rather than
tries to God java 8 so there is the
charter of Google Docs and what you can
do you can sign up or you can read it
this is actually the whole story and
they tracking the progress or or or not
progress or the laziness of Java EE so
I'm interesting stuff so if you like to
to to to improve the world get involved
okay so um now you have to homework
right to listen to podcast is with Razor
Ramon and james gosling is a really nice
one and then go to the show notes and to
reach the Guardian stuff and wait for
two pages the one is going to be java ee
guardians and the next one java ee i oh
so everyone is working on them right now
so okay this was the UM a little bit of
drama so lots of good lots of questions
in internet awards what's up with that
so another interesting thing what
happened meanwhile there was a nice page
called java.net and java.net is no more
available so the domain is still
available but it is rerouted to to java
community at Oracle which is not a bad
thing because this page looks a little
bit more than the old one a little bit
sad because the old one was a piece of
history but this is what happens now
even all there was Java soft if we go to
Java soft you go to straight Oracle so
this was the very beginnings of Java so
Java Java dot net is gone what what
should be gone but it isn't is can I
actually can
I was like java.net 20 and it was
supposed to be closed at 20 april the
28th in or 2017 I thought 2016 and and
then you will have to migrate the stuff
away so um what's interesting as oracle
bought son they they there was a message
on there can i we will close it and this
will actually mistake so then oracle
apologize no no we won't close it now so
now they close at eight years later
which i think is okay what I suppose
behind all of this you know this
distance the website is old the java.net
it was even older so no one works on
this on any more and because probably of
maintenance or security issues they try
to close it down and aggregate
everything to the java community at
oracle so this is actually what i
suppose what what happens behind the
scenes okay let's go to the 2d where is
my where is the chat here is it scotland
war so crazy so uh the link is censored
interesting so there's so we have that
okay and we just have to rearrange the
no it looks good just this this is what
I don't need ok so we covered this and
then interesting question what happened
with all the Java is peg because there
were or java.net site and now they are
gone and Antonio goncalves wrote an
email and ask about this and how you can
track this so what i like what i
prepared of beginning of the year I
think list of all java 8 specs with with
mailing lists and so if you go to the
mailing list for instance here this is
the Java emailing list and go to the
users and browse archive you will find
the recent message and this is actuary
this one
java java migration java regarding
jordan it shut down and the answer at my
may fifth which is somehow recent is
very pragmatic sino Billy Shannon is
really a pragmatic guy so he wrote just
okay what what Antonio asked which is
reasonable say okay wouldn't be better
to have all these pegs in markdown or
ask your doc format so the community
could easier contribute and what bill
bill answered is okay so converting the
specs is a lot of effort because they're
using free make right now and they
speckly it's really like the framemaker
tool and inertia is hard to overcome so
this is true so what I think all the
expert group members at Oracle right now
is working on something else like I
don't know probably cloud or micro
service related and they are not and
they are not there's no dedicated time
you know to build tools to migrate the
content somewhere else and yeah what
could probably happen I don't know
probably there is some kind of converter
which would convert framemaker 22 marked
out on something like this but let's see
what happens and lots of contents
already on github so it might be
actually a good thing that Gerald
Annette was shut down and if we get
everything on github then everything
would be fine so we covered this look at
these packs so um this you can you can
track the progress just watching the
mailing lists so this was the java.net
v3 because v2 was can I so can I is will
go away in 2017 and this was the email
this was some marketing stuff and this I
we covered the the podcast so you have
to search for the VJ podcasts and this
is episode 11 with the link to the
Charter ok we have that ah so I close
the chrome and now the first question is
Jess f so it was um it was an
interesting one and the question is
there is a jsf project was to K this is
this one with 2k concurrent users and
can we use jsf to in non blocking mode
and there are several questions should
we use GSR concurrency utilities 236 to
solve a problem or we should use no GS
and angular so first on 2,000 concurrent
users not a lot so um some of my clients
are using jsf with far more so a recent
project you use to a half thousand
concurrent users without any problems
actually two I half thousand durable
sessions so not durable in all sessions
which were open for the whole day and it
works so the question is not how many
users we get rather than you know what
their users are doing if all the users
work on the application right crazy
they've read and reserved like a chat
application so you get 2,000 concurrent
requests this might be a problem but
2,000 concurrent users still you know
the only problem you probably can get is
the heap size because one user session
can take some amount of memory in my
current GF project is around 10 mb so I
measured this so with with two thousand
users it might be a problem with with
the heap but you can do something about
this was the heap you can store you know
the the session state on the client so
there would be a not a lot heap involved
you can compress this session state then
you will consume will need more CPU but
less memory so what I what I'm going
with this it's really hard to predict
how the jsf will will behave and this
non blocking mode what I would like to
draw something so first how jsf operates
this is actually what i would like to
show you and what GSF actually is so we
have the browser with the DOM and on the
server we have something like the Dom
but this is not a dom tree it is the
component tree and each component suits
in memory and waits to be rendered and
what just f framework tasks it
tiffs or it compares both threes and
tries to replicate the changes this is
actually what all about jazz Evers so
actually very similar to react or
angular 2 with the shadow Dom a little
bit except as the shadow DOM is not in
the browser rather than other server so
and so what what happens behind the
scenes is the following the D on each
request it really depends on the
framework what will happen is the d3 the
the tree is going to be parsed by the
JSF runtime and each component component
renders itself and creates a basically a
huge string which is sent to the browser
if you are using Ajax you can you could
you could partially update the notes and
each update is sent is cute and then
sent to the server and the server does
something with it so this is how GSF
operates so the question is niÃ±o and I
all could be interesting if we would use
blocking requests and we would like to
park threats this is where we're niÃ±o
might be interesting so like you know we
are just blocking the server here and
like long polling not the server their
client and we don't like to consume the
threat so then niÃ±o could be
interesting but this is not how a jsf to
my knowledge operates so this really
depends on the GSF providers probably
there is one which uses niall with
threat parking but usually I don't think
it's the case usually what happens on
each requests the whole three is
rendered as quickly as possible and sent
back send back to the client so the only
question you should ask yourself as you
know how quickly it happens so how
quickly the whole rendering process
happens on the server and how much CPU
it consumes because CPU might be at a
problem so if you get 2,000 concurrent
requests to one to one server what can
happen that that you get multiple
parallel request of course and the CPU
gets overloaded yeah this is this is
what you should should you know
you should track what the users are
actually doing and and and then see
whether it can be fast enough so if you
are using angular so the next so what
was so no question here go back to uh 2d
would like to rearrange it again so this
is how it should be okay so uh so it is
blocking mode and he could use
concurrency utilities to decouple the
GSF rendering with low processes in the
background so exactly so what you could
do is ok this GSF should render and if
there is something like fire and forget
you can absolutely use for instance
completa belief uture and concurrency
utilities so look for instance that
project porcupine so if you go to github
and the project is called porcupine so
you could do something like injecting
and execute or service and and and and
perform a synchronous asynchronous
processing so you can then decouple the
front end from the back end but yeah
that's what he could do and we actually
did it so you could use nodejs in the
front end and angular 2 so what you
could of course do you could use angular
2 or react in the front end and in the
back end you can just go with Jax res so
there will be no problem at all with
just jax-rs it would do a scale like
crazy so if you care about the
performance so performance is GS f 2 is
the slowest part for sure jax-rs or EG
bees are orders of magnitude faster than
GSF so you can replace GSF entirely with
angularjs and and use introduce a nice
business api and call from angularjs or
react with something because we act is
just the view angularjs is more than a
view to cover to communicate with the
back end and this was the last
alternative exactly so angular to
JavaScript from whitefly it would be one
war this is the demand usual
architecture I am doing
and the rest api in another war and why
two wars because usually the life cycles
from the front end or front end war is
different from the back end war
therefore to two wars jax-ur is neither
work on a non-blocking mozo jax-rs can
work in non blocking mode absolutely so
you can do this with jax-rs and what
happens behind the scenes is you won't
block the http threats rather than
rather than go to rather than you will
pass the request to your own thread pool
so your application server will always
remain responsive if you're interested
in this look at the Java EE
microservices course so I'm talking
about this and there is here
paralyzation with collar Bell so this is
actually this what what you would like
to have so if you don't like to watch
the core course look at suspended
annotation and i think is called
asynchronous request suspended and
asynchronous request I hope now
everything is clear so yeah lots of
people in the chat it's nice no
questions from from Twitter as usual but
the chat is lazy which is unusual so on
here also no questions here so we have
some okay so next one different payment
methods how to inject the right
implementation based on payment type at
runtime so depending on payment time he
would like to inject the different
payments and it is absolutely possible
so what do you have to do is you will
have to inject an instance of payment so
instance of payment and the instance of
payment it would look like instance of
payment
and pay men's and inject and payments
dot select and you can pass an instance
of a qualifier and the name could be the
name of the it could be the name of the
of the type so you can pass the type
here and if the qualifier you need a
qualifier instance matches the types so
if this is the enum you will get your
instances in you will get your subtype
and what you can do we can just try to
find it still is still online I think I
even implemented this in the book Java
patterns and the source code was I think
plugin
plugins and let's see source main
resources exactly see Eliza see a
serialization type and you can see we
have the type here and this is a
notation literal civilization that's
exactly what I talked about and there is
a sterilization qualifier and
deserializer which just is going to be
injected and ended type is going to be
implemented so look at this example it
is exactly what you're asking is it
needed I mean not always what you can of
course do it really depends what you
would like to achieve so usually this is
only worth in case you have somehow
plugin mechanism and you have no lots of
payment types if you have just you know
two or three payment types I would just
you know gets the type just inject
whatever the three types years try right
away and within simple if-else statement
or switch statement you know choose the
right one it is far easier to understand
than any magic with instances here so
and then after two minutes the next
question is after successful payment the
product has to be shipped but the
restriction can be shipped only after
two minutes have passed since threats
are forbidden how to execute the
shipping after the restriction ends so
what you can perfectly do is using
one-shot timer so at schedule annotation
so on egb which sets a method which sets
the timer to two minutes and after two
minutes and after two minutes something
happens so there is a one-shot timer
which is very possible it's also as an
example from the book so just do that
and so I'm yeah the content type what
you can do you can set the content type
in the header or what you can always do
you can set the content type in a filter
servlet a servlet filter now you should
be able to manipulate these surveillance
filter what you'll have to do is to cast
the request to httpservletrequest then
you can do this or you can specify the
content type right right away in the
indie header with request headers and
specify the content type or even better
produces so you can specify the content
type with producers perfect so I got
some questions Twitter perfect Alexander
asks me what my opinion about Varden
compared to Jess F so Varden is very
similar of know very similar is somehow
similar to jsf the only difference in
volume versus GSF is Valon you are using
Java which is they then transformed in
components and in jsf you are using HTML
which is parsed into components so the
difference is the input and the Varden
uses a binary protocol to replicate to
replicate the state between the client
and the server so Varden is a perfect
thing for for dashboards for instance so
this is what violin is a way to go so
both our server centric frameworks so
from the IT tech sure they are similar
so jess f comes with data binding
inviting comes with data binding as well
and someone is from florida so nice
global our audience someone asking is
that hot in germany today i would say
not that hot 25 degrees or something ok
for me it is hot but it's not really hot
ok now the best one I was wondering what
to do when encounter methods that you
would need to use again and again
yeah for instance i am a bond credit
card number phone number and and calm
dog linux put them into the youtube
package package and the question is is
the right approach to do and he already
noticed that i don't like the youtube
packages so what you can do so okay so
what you would usually have is the
followings I need my following we have a
package and the name of the package is
here no customer and here is the address
and another package is our components is
called I don't know what we have orders
and everything resides in the
application called ax if we don't have
GSF we don't have the business layer so
everything he is in route so we have
here boundary control entity and again
boundary control entity and so forth of
course control is optional an entity
cellars optional and even boundaries
optional but then you need control if
you have your ease herbal stuff so what
we could do here this was actually the
answer you could introduce a component
called the gum called how to call it
Eban legs banking and this component is
actually on the same level so this
forgot about this is banking it doesn't
have to be so it has just the sea and
all other components can just take the
eben converter from here so this is the
first answer so you can absolutely do
this so you can put you can put a
reusable stuff in a component and this
component can be accessible to all other
components okay so um but sometimes you
say okay it's not worth to introduce a
component so to be completely fine to
put some reusable or usable classes in
the root of the application which
basically means there's a shared classes
which are accessible to all other
components okay
so as know about you know creating a
package util is extremely dangerous
because if you name something you tell
you will find everything in there
because everyone which would just put in
to youtube or common even even even
worse or I don't know infrastructure
framework or whatever okay perfect what
is your opinion about BPM and or a
workflow engine in a project so you know
when you need it this will be my answer
so usually if you know if you're just
building your apps and you are happy
there is no no point to introduce BPM
but if you have you know long-running
transactions or transaction which start
you know next week at 8am and they have
to be several rolls so there is one role
and the role does something and then
another all it takes over then this is a
perfect case for BPM and actually one
project is this ancient one a thing
rules I don't know 15 years ago or
something we actually had to approve
orders so like there were others coming
from the outside and this orders had to
be approved but if the approve didn't
the approval didn't happen in two days
or something the order was out automatic
cancelled this was perfect case for BPM
so this works but what I see instead is
you know perfectly working projects or
applications and someone comes inside we
need BPM and then everything was going
to be simpler and it will save money
this is what I don't believe so this is
my opinion about ppm okay what's there
Jay was forged is a nice one what is my
opinion about jeebus for jboss Forge is
it's a nice little project builder where
you can just bootstrap your project just
do it so you can just you know if you if
you if you're starting with something
you can just with tribbles fortune or
create a maven project with jpa whatever
and you are not really depending on it
you can just in any point of time you
can get rid of jboss fortune then go
forward without Jay was forged
why would you choose pyara micro White
Rose warm also another question from
Victor I never used them actually what I
plan to do I will try to compare or I
will compare white vest warm to a white
fly fool Empire micro dipiero fool I
have to admit in all my projects we use
always the fool why there was no memory
difference the memory footprint
difference and you know in all my
projects we need security jax-rs
transactions and and mostly even jpa so
going with micro or swarm and setting up
everything for me for my projects didn't
make any sense and if you consider with
Daka so I recorded some YouTube sessions
about this dhaka is perfect for full
stack application servers because there
is deployment process you can clearly
separate the the application that the
image from the application server from
the actual war image ok someone asked me
in microservices environment as shown in
my microservice course is it ok to use
our castration parameters JSON object
what does mean of course once they
arrive to Egypt if I said they are
converted to real dimension us are they
some drawbacks in using JSON object
absolutely i mean i use json objects all
the time or all the time fifty-fifty
sometimes I use Jack's p objects
sometimes JSON objects but I use JSON
object more and more this is what I
wanted to say and orchestration
parameters that what I don't get so
input and output JSON object jsonp are
fine so this is what is perfectly ok to
use ok so now this someone builds on to
someone who really builds a business
controller with view scope and inject
identity manager and and DM ID says
entitymanager is not serializable should
ignore the warnings years it should
because it should work so entitymanager
should be realizable you get the same
problem with stateful for instance and
the second question is I'm also
injecting JP entities which works
initially
find with this one and this would be a
little bit more cautious with that
because if you are injecting entity the
entity is managed by CDI and then also
managed by the entity manager and if you
injecting the entity it means there
could be only one per scoop so if you
are searching for entities in the
database and you get multiple instances
it might be a little bit problematic
because you know to having only one to
have only all new you can only ject one
entity but you can retrieve several
entities from the entity manager so
there is like you know different
paradigms for for CDI and for the entity
manager so what happens here this is
actually fine strategies or the input is
merge and this is attached you should
always use the result of the virtual
method because if you don't use the
result of the merge method this is just
detach entity you will always have to
reach result in of the merged method
okay I hope it was clear so is something
here no how you implement multi-tenancy
in java ee so i try to avoid it because
if you implement a multi-tenant system
what it means is more complex than a
single tenant one so what might be a
good idea to provide 11 microservice
pertinent if you don't have you know
millions of tenants so this will be my
first idea and multi-tenancy what it
basically means there are different
levels like different views so you will
have to get idea no properly load
different CSS stylesheets inverse case
then different components I don't even
know whether the view should be a
multi-tenant in the database is the
simples because eclipselink and
hibernate already support multi-tenancy
the only problem of what the
multi-tenancy is with the multi-tenancy
is that it is not supported by the JP
standard yet
you will have to enhance your were
statements if you would like to be a no
JP a compliant or Java compliant so this
is what multi-tenancy means to me what
you can even do you can have multiple
entity manages one entity manager /
tenant and very similar to this question
here with the payment type you can
inject different entity managers
depending on the tenant ID or whatever
so this is also achieve able so you can
do this absolutely so the question is a
no warrior building if you're building a
cloud were the tenant is the usual case
you will have to be you know you have a
completely different strategy then you
have to note to clients and you have one
app then i will probably build you know
fork the app and build two different
apps one per client so it really depends
what would you would like to do okay so
uh yeah this is endless toppings us I
hope the questions actually handset so
on java 6 GS f presentation and it
should be for business logic both
modules are packed in an ear so better
would be a war of course and then it
uses thread-local storage to pass along
tenant information like username or
whatever is it possible to a similar
approach in java ee i call that context
holder so if you go here to the hg and
search for context holder there is a
prototype of this old one very old one
and what I did then I implemented
probably a threadlocal and transaction
synchronization registry so what you can
do I think I implemented this year you
can inject in transaction with
synchronization the registry on what did
transactions in colonization right you
see an ancient ancient sample from 2009
and the transaction synchronization
registry is bound to the current
transaction so you can put in so you can
just pass in whatever information you
like to the transaction synchronization
registry and as long it is the same
transaction it will it will it will just
work so what you can also do you can use
the transactional scope this is
basically the same so you can put all
the information in a class annotated
with transactional scope or even request
cope this is what you can do is this is
how to pass the information in in Java
EE threadlocal would also work but there
are a simpler simple approaches than
threadlocal again transaction scope
request scope and transaction
synchronization registry and you can
just pass the information ok Canada
crazy as really true zone no one from
from South Pole so far but really crazy
so thank you for watching so we the next
question is how to migrate away from
from richfaces so why this I think the
link is broken so I tried it earlier but
it didn't work so I try this and the
problem is this richfaces is end of life
and and the question isn't know how to
migrate away from richfaces and so and
he asked you know how to move into
primefaces or where and i would say from
retraces to primefaces it i mean it will
work of course but there's a lot to do
and all the components are not
compatible it is really
were in some older project were stuck
with older richfaces version and they
were riaf right to to migrate to the
newer one you know and and and this is
like a cross migration so it really
depends on the on the size of the
project you can of course migrate to
angularjs it's a problem with that if
you would like to have nice migration
you would like to have something like
nice rest api which you probably don't
have so you will have to introduce a
nice rest api first and then create the
angularjs app so what you should
evaluate to know what you should look at
tables and the more sophisticated
components from primefaces look at nigga
richfaces components okay is there a
path 12 a path from richfaces to
primefaces and and then just with
prototype proof of concept try to
migrate one table for instance and see
what happens and at the same time
probably you have already a boundary
control entity architecture in this
particular case you only will have to
know think about the business logic and
create a nice rest api which calls the
existing boundaries the jeebies and then
you're also set and so my application is
new to production and expect lots of
changing system in the future so then if
it's new usually means this is small and
the question is now should we go to
angular 2 not angular 1 because angular
1 is like almost a legacy so angular 2
or primefaces this is what I would I
will just create two small poo of
concepts and and then decide you know
which route to go okay so what's there
Dave devi devi Dave from Victoria so
first question to Victoria is now hot in
Canada I suppose so or not and now I try
to answer the question can we college a
beast from a swan could this be used to
make a sort Java EE ripple of course and
I do it actually a lot I don't know
another example of this book is is
called fluid logic also from to
thousands and I did exactly this in this
example so by the way the example is
free you can absolutely download this so
there is no we have one year time then
can I will shut down so and this is I
think the calculator this happens here
i'm using here the script engine nasa
one this an ejb and what i'm doing here
manipulating an api what you would you
also could do you could manipulate you
could manipulate an e gb and a ripple is
exactly what I did what I mean what we
created for instance a validation for JP
entities with nice one worked perfectly
and in the project headlands from github
you can also look at this headlands what
we'd what I created like entry processor
which can be written in JavaScript so
you have full access to whatever like to
the cash using mass one and another
project if you're interesting headlands
would be n hood rate and in this project
we can use not so on functions to
transform data so it is not a rapper but
like a ripple so the answer is
absolutely you can do this okay perfect
so how you structure application white
use classes ECB entity controlled
boundary and if you not aware what ECB
is this is like my way to structure in
java application so if you go to adam
bean and BCE you will find some youtube
videos and the boundary control entities
or take a look at that so search for
this so another homework assignment in
your example site going to structure
application like yeah this post's entity
posts exactly business posts and it
posts how would a class-based entity
which is a base class of all entities
fit in ECB so first i would question we
need base entity but if you really need
this i will i will put it into right
into the business package and there are
lots of bass entities so base entities
are actually a really suspicious name
you should name it I don't know version
able entity and there is a lots of stuff
which is going to be versioned then I
will create a component called versions
and put the entity into the entity in
two versions on the same level as posts
dot entity this is what I would do but
first I will question the need for a
base entity if you really need it then
first idea again at the business level
and if you get lots of classes bases
wrong name you should find a better name
like you know a version able entity or
optimistic entity or whatever and then
put on the same level as the posts okay
next one someone is using white flag
pink and the pink war is deployed into a
docker container everything works fine
and the question is how to redeploy
without restarting the container and
this is what I actually don't do what I
if I'm working with Daka I always use my
local server for development and then a
script which or either local script
which creates my local docker image it
takes milliseconds or is what would
always have in continuous integration
environment a a pipeline and deedee and
the docker images created in the
pipeline
us there's actually no need to run local
doctor with hot deployment we I never
did it but if you would really like to
do this there is of course a possibility
first you can set up as a ssh server and
push it via ssh if you if you if you
replace the war it is going to be
redeployed you can even mount a folder
on the host machine and and and do and
then compile it to this folder is also
going to be to be hot deployed but I I
would do this so I never did it I always
I always use a local server and the
docker images for the test for the test
and for the integration stage okay let's
see what happens here nothing here
nothing here how to handle distributed
systems in micro services by the way I
really don't like the microservices
trend right now but it is exactly what
happens in the service-oriented
architectures I get project assignment
like crazy about micro services and what
we do right now we try to deliver as
simple and beautiful java application as
possible with no skinny Wars nice
communication and they are at the end
microservices but no one cares about the
term in the project but this is a nice
marketing term so if you ask me about
microservices i would think okay you
would like to build reasonable apps this
is for me micro services so service
discovery so Snoopy is really nice
framework from Eva Grimstad first I
always get the question about service
discovery and we not never discover
anything in enterprise because if you
use something like a docker it comes
with with the user-defined network
already and this is absolutely
sufficient in most project so I actually
also explained this in the Java in
microservices course what I did there is
i just linked to microservices together
and if you do this one micro service was
the name a knex s the micro service with
the name be and by day just by the name
of the container be and what doctor will
do it will automate
we know resolve the be with the IP
address and this is dynamic it can
happen at the runtime and this is more
than enough for foremost enterprise apps
distributed transaction services the
answer is there are no distributed
transaction microservices what you will
have to do is to change the business
logic this is this is not a set answer I
think it solves a lot of problems so for
instance what you will have to do you
will have to introduce compensative
transactions which are not just undos it
is a reaction to a failure like let's
say amazon would try no to ship ship
something but it's not available they
will get an email like dear customer you
would like still to to have it we are
not able to ship and you can just say
yes or no this would be the compensative
transaction and in amazon would just you
know cancel the order exactly and okay
and by the way and the architecture day
at the at the munich airport we always
spend i think at least one hour
discussing exactly this with different
examples because as a most asked
question logging what do you centralized
logging infrastructure like for instance
logstash might be interesting and
debugging is actually non-issue you can
remotely debug and darker content is
given the part is exposed and the whole
project will always work you can you can
have multiple debug sessions and then
you will you will see an order flow from
one project to another this is very
similar to debugging you know GSF and
the back end and with drum from tours
okay this is eight hours ago so a recent
one and someone powley powerless tries
to run the payara micro and by the way
if you have questions to pyara guys and
gals i will show you something the
problem was the payara they spend my
whole not this is my client actually but
all the others are spending my time line
you see what happens
are they committed and they working on
the payara like day and night and they
just cranking the code like crazy so uh
this was of course just a joke so
created a branch by out of 5 an hour ago
so they know they never sleep to just
cranking code what do you have to do you
have to go here and we ask the question
in the issues and the community will
help you because i don't use pyara micro
a lot in all my project I use the PI or
a fool or white flag fool but not never
the payara micro but you says no logins
modules configured for 45 around what I
suppose is that the payara micro doesn't
come with know the full security stack
from the pie or a fool but this is where
my knowledge ends so I will investigate
a bit what would I will do I will record
our screencasts comparing the memory
footprint of power micro do pyar a fool
this would really interests me okay so
sorry it's not really answered but i'm
i'm pretty sure that pyara engineers
will help you so this is actually
interesting also and this is like risk
assessment and with hazard there is a
hazard here and there are certain steps
step Hut has 0 type and has a type at
hazard and there is a multiple one to
end relations and the ND question is i
would like to access the DB as view
times as possible and how to do this the
first question is caching you could cash
but this would be like caching the whole
tree i mean if you have enough memory
you can try this so do everything eager
preload this and if everything is as
memory it doesn't change frequently
deepti performance would be perfect so
we actually did it what we did it in
some projects is the following we load
it whatever was necessary to for one
roll of one person into memory and then
use jpa lambdas for the queries and of
course because we didn't use the
database anymore the performance was
extremely good of course if database
changes you won't recognize the changes
this is actually but this is the
issue of caching so otherwise what you
could do of course you can go directly
to database and just try to find you
know the what was it the hazards here
directly and what you can help you if
you're using business keys and not
technical keys and the business key
reveals you know d something about the
relation you can you can perform some
trickery to find the hazard directly but
I don't I don't know enough about the
risk assessment domain to judge that but
do if you are using instead you know
integer risk assessment ID something
like I don't know customer underscore
whatevers or business key then it it
might be easier to locate the hazard
without traversing all the stuff here so
you could try to cash the whole tree and
measure the demand more food prendelo we
do try to know stupidly make everything
eager proof of concept would take and no
view hours everything is in memory and
then provide a heap dump and measure you
know what is the impact on memory it
could be actually not that high because
the opti objects are surprisingly small
and then measure the performance
comparing it to queries so this would I
would do and this actually fund to
experimenting with such projects yeah
completed memory might be actually a
very good idea if your graph doesn't
change frequently if it does change
frequently you will have to refresh the
whole graph and you will end up having
lots of secret agents refreshing and
enjoyed the whole graph here you could
also have a hybrid like you know we look
at infinite spin or hazel cast could
also help you so then we are actually
done with all the questions so there are
no questions in the chat no questions in
the wiki which is nice I gotta think one
remaining question in the block
something with Java if FX and controller
so let's take a look and the control
area I think this
this one so I delivered actually a deep
dive session for Silicon Valley Java
Vic's user group remotely so I was it
was at 2am so it was fun and hear
someone asked me a question regarding
bastard structuring is a modular event
handling for those apps that require
complex menubar toolbar structures so
what I do in the aft afterburner case I
set up something like application
controller which which handles the D
high-level events and the panel
controllers handle the panel events and
I think even i was about to my great
delight fish example to this it's
probably even migrated so take a look at
the light view or light fish example
from a github i think it already worked
like this because it has a menu bar and
go to light fish where is the first year
and the light fish comes with light view
and the light view has probably such a
controller so take a brief look at that
and there should be the app and the
presenter but this is the top level so
we have to dash porch and I think the
dashboard presenter is the top level
presenter which I would have to look at
this but the idea would be you have a
top-level present our controller which
controls the app leg clothes for
instance right you will ask all other
controllers hey should I close it or
please save your state i'm about to
close and this goes to the app
controller ok now we are really done
even a bonus question was answered so
thank you for watching and thank you
chip for for saying that it was a nice
session i really enjoyed there are lots
of people from all over the place I
betcha fetching I used not batch
fetching I used how it's called batch
insert or batch create this is what I do
it
never use betch fetching actually so is
it an I would have to look at this I use
the creation implementations like batch
inserts I think so the word the all the
inserts are our batched and batch
fetching I'd never used that could be
could be an option so thank you and see
you next month so keep asking and here
enjoy the weather from all over the
world and it was always fun and yeah and
hello from Greece Florida I forgot
Greece and Milan so it's really really
nice so you all are great see you next
month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
