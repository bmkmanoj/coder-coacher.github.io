to show you a little application I've
wrote to manage the attendees for for
the AIX workshop so we just like to
lunch it and this yeah a little crowd
application which talks directly to
embed a derby DB so it's actually a fat
client so there's no server side
communication everything resides on a
client and yeah let's try that so I
would like to register the Java Duke
from Java soft Thomas Java soft for
let's say but bootstrap and effective
workshops as you see yeah now Duke is
registered for both but not for UI and
Java and yeah as you also see um
immediately its start in an embedded
Derby database so I had actually no time
to build it so I try to spend as little
title as only possible but arms I wanted
to use the F XML syndulla but you can
see there are multiple use so there is
this view and several tabs so of what I
didn't want it to do is to just use a
huge FX ml file with everything in there
so the idea was to partition the
application to four into logical parts
so I have firstly the overall view you
see here this is actually the main part
so I have the attendee input state upper
part I have T de which is basically just
a table and I have the workshops which
are actually D T dates for Dax vac shops
and what you also see each of these
panels is organized in a package and the
idea is that the contents of of each
package are identical and there is a
little bit a little bit convention of a
configuration in place so as you can see
I have always represent a viewer CSS
file and F XML file so the idea would be
that you will just create a travel a new
view so
with a plugin for instance or a script
or whatever and it will create for you
an empty view presenter and eix xml so
let's start with the main methods source
java fixes actually no main method so
just we have to extend from application
but as you can see i just create I just
instantiated with new a hex view and
this is T yeah hex view if you go to a
hex view you will see that it actually
extends from a fix ml view and is empty
so ry that it is it works because F XML
view actually implements the convention
over configuration so in constructor of
this view of this class F XML and CSS
are already loaded so what we already
have we have the graph of object
constructed and we can actually use that
so um you see this in for instance here
if you get view so here it returns the
actual identity parent created from F
XML and here then the view appears on
the screen and with the view also Dax
presenter is loaded why that because the
air hex presenter is reference in F XML
this is the other another part of the
convention of a configuration so um give
you loads of XML FX M L contains UI
elements you all elements I created by
by a fix ml order and our handcrafted DX
presenter is instantiated on demand we
can also inject UI elements into the hex
presenter and you see here we have one
ankle pain as input the other one is
overview and we go to the to the ethics
ml you will see that the name of the
ankle pain is input from the other one
is overview now as you can also see the
overview is just empty here and the
reason for that is because I would like
to create dynamic content here within
the ankle pain so how I did that if we
go to the M to the ankle pain overview
you are overview you see the damages you
say get children at virtuals view get
you
so what's workshops you get view again
workshops view get view so it's just on
TV workshops view which is another view
here and the effects review contains d
tabs so are what happened then this this
another F XML file was created and
injected to D to the ankle pain and
again the presenter is created which
contains the whole presentation logic
and is able to interact with the I
components there's always the same story
our view is created view loads F XML and
CSS in the ethics and metal references
to a presenter and in the presenter just
manually crafted class so there is
actually no requirements if you like
that to be initialized so Java fix could
use em you can you can implement
initialize abou otherwise otherwise you
could entirely skip that as well
what's also interesting here you see
this at inject register registration
service
so in presenter all presenters to
support at inject dependency injection
and this is actually the Java six
dependency injection GSR 3:30 and where
it is implemented it is also implemented
in the F XML view and what Java fix
provides to you it's a callback so what
I did is that if I pass to affix ml
loader callback and the callback is an
injection provider which creates the
presenter for me and return it to Java
fix runtime so I implemented the whole
dependency injection from scratch so
that's just 120 lines of code why I did
it because I started actually with
Google juice the only problem with
Google juices it is hard to to use a
convention of a configuration with
Google juice so I had two built-in
modules and and and make Google juice
conventional what was actually a little
bit of work so instead of that I just
said okay and everything which is
injected to the presenters
is actually a singleton because we are
under your eyes so there is no need for
scoping for no no need for for
aspect-oriented programming just
straight injection so I'm in plan
I'm just listening for ethics ml and I
initialize all members and it actually
works well but at any point of time I
could just replace the injection
provider with Google juice again and
both classes were extracted from a hex
control and now they are a part of a
framework framework a small framework
called
After Burner FX and it is a opechee
framework on github and what's also
interesting I created another very very
basic project project called follow me
and in the following we project it is
actually one view with one presenter
where it can just easily clone the
project and and perform the maven build
and it would just should open the review
and so you have time to experiment with
that and of course there is also a home
page afterburner and I will put the
video on this on this page so if you
like I could record part two of the
screencasts about building and
integrating back-end services so thank
you for watching and see you on one of
the upcoming conferences workshops
trainings or even a hex in Munich so
thank you very much and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
