axe we have tons of questions and for
unknown reasons I forgot some questions
last time so we try to fix this and the
word to interesting questions and ya
know start with questions so the first
question is I or question is a statement
so I got I got an email from ghulam and
he and this was a reaction to the recent
heck news round miller road &amp;amp; Gulen said
stop talk about javi and this is
actually a nice email and he he wanted
to show me that or show with explaining
it spring is actually better and this is
actually the contents of the email and
what is the sex spike sex bag is a very
small project i wrote to validate some
ideas from java 8 security spec and the
idea was to do to write to do a app and
see how it actually feels like so and
and and he said he knows I'm struggling
with Java which is actually not true and
really like javi and whatever i do right
now is java ee based and and and he
wanted to compare java with spring and
say okay 2008 spring is nice but actuary
spring is older than dead than that so i
would say the DD popularity and spring
increased in 2005 no 2008 2008 we
already had i think almost java 6 we had
java e5 so what I what I actually did
with job I five I used term Java a lot
so for me it was you know the great
revolution and before that i just used
j2ee because it was requested but it was
not that hard because we didn't try to
exaggerate and we used extrait and says
okay spring is easier than eg ABCD I I
would say he's almost identical but yeah
and it's not easier could be more
powerful but not easier and then but the
conclusion is in 2015 as spring spring
is the most widely used framework for
mission-critical applications which is
not my perceptions of spring is still
popular but Java he gets more and more
popular and so probably following my
blog you would see the lots of startups
deciding to use Java EE because it's
very powerful the powerful very usable
and convenient to use and and he asked
me why i'm using java because it stand
out and this is one of the reason not
because a standard i don't have you know
because most of the companies already
have java ee service running so then i
just use the service don't have to
discuss know which framework to use and
so and says ok IBM retina pesci or you
screen but also javi so I'm and say
please stop about Java EE I cannot stop
to talk about javi because if I would
stop I couldn't talk about my project at
all because 92 I would say right now one
hundred percent of my project I Java
related so if I stopped to talk about my
projects or put java ee i will stop to
talk at all so on so this is actually
interesting email and at least please
find out gaps about java this is what i
really try to do so i asked got all
conferences workshops projects no
worries java ee lacking and and I think
what what from my perspective monitoring
and security could be improved and this
is what i try to participate and
security is already there but for me it
is hard to use java 7 right now which
should be proved in java 8 so on but
this email was actually nice but it was
a interesting angle so for me is like
you know java is the most popular
framework and from angle from from from
the email writers java is like you know
or spring is the most popular framework
so it's really you know through the eyes
of beholder Rosalie depends who you ask
ok this was the first to cutting one
some I got some questions on Twitter ray
and the next question is or two
questions I forgot for unknown reasons
to to talk about the questions lat
last time so I would try to fix this
right now so and when the question is
there is a MVC framework with Java EE
what do you see in the future of GS
after your think Jetts ever become
obsoleted by this MVC framework i would
say what could happen that Jesse GF
becomes our an implementation of this
framework and not obsoleted I mean they
are always room for component-based
frameworks if you like the components so
if you cannot live lose the components
forget about this so am i would say this
is our community be to the question
number three but I don't know why I
forgot I so to show you what embassy
actually is I wrote a very simple
project to show you how it will feel
like and it is actually execute about it
not only this i created a github project
so you can immediately try that it is
github in my account and this is the
project called Java EE MVC sample so
this is the project so you can check it
out and what I did I just clone that and
i will show you what actually what it is
and what it does so I try to be a little
bit more realistic so usually i created
a boundary Adam clock very simple which
creates just the current date so the
current time is an stateless ejb and
there's in the business in the in the
business layer and in the presentation
layer i started with jax or s
configurations of this MVC framework
will run on top of of jax-rs so I'm i
start with jax-rs and instead of using
resources i used views because it's just
right now it's all about presentation
what i also created is a very simple
model object model is like dto more or
less and this model as you can see it is
not managed so there is no I could put
model or request scope or whatever but I
wanted to show you the other way to do
this so it's just a hold of T of the now
string and the whole piece see the whole
MVC part is this class which comes a
time controller which comes with power
time and this is the the jax-rs path and
the controller comes actually from the
framework java java aches MVC controller
and i injected 22 pieces models which is
quite interesting looks like a hashmap
so i can put whatever alike to the model
so in this time I ki just stored here an
unrelated class no unmanaged class
called time and I fetched the current
time from the ejb and stored in the
class and then I'm pointing to time GSP
which is just ordinary javaserver page
and here I'm just extracting the payload
and the time comes from here and then
now is the assessor accessor method get
now is the time so this is where it
comes from and if I will run it so need
specific glassfish build and I run time
dependency as you can see it works
pretty well so I really like the
framework a lot but I don't think it
will replace or jess 'if project jsf
projects it could be probably very nice
to pre-populate skeleton for for angular
app this could be perfect but i don't
think it will eliminate or you know jsf
applications or whatever so it's just
complete different requirements here and
what's also interesting or interesting
necessary because we don't have java e8
yet i had to include this oz oz arc
project and what other art is is the
reference implementation of the MVC
framework and with the ozark comes the
api and the api is java x mb c api 10
which is very very thin and by the way
what's also nice the host spank comes
with about 30 pages so you can really
know in half an hour so really nice pack
and i'm looking really looking forward
to to java 8 and yet for the projects
because there's always some need you
know to create some templates which are
more and less static or or pre generate
for instance a JavaScript application
and I think it's not necessary to
construct everything in the browser
because it will slow down you know the
construction process so I think we
covered this first question so you get
you have now a you know basic understand
men would MVC actually is if of course
you can swap you know DD template
framework you are not limited jazz piece
but i consider jess is actually jazz
piece actually nice and yeah this is
what i wanted to show was the embassy so
let's look whether we have any questions
from from twitter or chat so there is a
some old friends in the chat but they
are usually very quiet I just watching
what I'm doing and I have no one
questions if on Twitter from boomer
Horta and he asked session scope create
more than instances why I implemented
serializable I don't believe that you
got two instances of sessions course
what I think you are you are measuring
the instances in the default constructor
so what I think is what you did you have
a something like atomic integer neon
increasing this in an default
constructor and what you should do I
would say try the same in post construct
and just count the number of instances
if session scope is normal scope so you
should get exactly one instance per
session what could also be for unknown
reason to get multiple sessions to
school because of a reason of the
problem but I guess is a constructor so
just leave me a note here in the next to
our whether you counter the instance in
the constructor or in post construct if
in the constructor I explain you why
this is a problem and it should never do
any initialization in construct and CDI
and ejbs okay perfect first question
covered Oh already two questions covered
and the next one do you use just f of
the presentation layer for your projects
or use something else so the recent
projects were all JavaScript and fifty
percent of this was angular and with CSS
and HTML 5 and this is because it was
hooted better for the task
India in other projects and we use GSF
so now now it's just a no and co
accident or an accident that I'm just
using just JavaScript on the on the
client-side GSF is still used a lot and
in my perception is it is used right now
more successfully than ever before
because people understand or developers
understand jsf better than before and
before it was like no magic bullet for
everything silver bullet for everything
and right now jsf is used as I would say
technology to solve a problem and
surprisingly just watch the interviews
on my block so what would really struck
me more than I would say more than half
of all startups are using JSF because
they are very productive with it and to
summarize my point of view of GSF GSF
it's perfectly formed based applications
it's not very suitable for single page
applications usually and what GSF
excellently solves is data binding with
the server so you comes for free and jsf
is perfect if you like the components
which comes with primefaces if you have
to extend this components forgot about
forget about GSF and the another
possibility to use JSF is just to rely
on on on the standard out-of-the-box
components or no skinning nothing and
just go with html5 markup without any
components or do it also work well so on
and of course GSF need some memory and
cpu power on the server because the
server side component model but the same
is true for all other models so ticket
or whatever you are doing on the server
if even MVC will consume some some cpu
on the server so on I'm I would say I'm
pretty neutral neutral about GSF and my
personal point of view for you know
admin UI or whatever you have to quickly
build hsf is just very productive ok now
this is the sorry for that two questions
from the last time so I will just look
briefly on the Twitter so no question
nope
question no question in the chat which
surprising but it's very good so it
could be a fast one trust the X so I'm
so I wrote a book is the green one here
and and and someone someone the Sufi act
told me i'm going to discussion about
cap in reward patterns when you say
don't dispute advice can be innocent as
general best practice yes this is what i
really mean does that include cases
where single JVM app is replicated on
the notes in a cluster yes i would i
would question the clustering for
instance is clustering really needed so
on what happens if there is no
clustering so of course if the know if
the app will crash it is gone and the
question is know how quickly you can
start it again so it really depends on
the infrastructure so if you add four in
stock and some kind of process which
monitors the app it would be very easy
to reset the application in second so in
other word is the best practice not to
run the cluster at all yes if you don't
have twenty-four seven requirements and
because you know you cannot replicate
the HTTP session reliably usually what
it means because of cap either you can
you will have to lock the cluster and
wait until everything everything
replicates over all nodes or you can
replicate asynchronously but if you
replicate asynchronously it cannot be
consistent so of course you could use
something like an in-memory grid and
just replicated two nodes and not to all
but i have to say most of the classes
are is a two node or four nodes it is
very unusual to have java cluster with
500 nodes or something like this so um
so I'm what I mean is at least pick
those put presentation and the business
logic in one JVM there is no no need to
do to distribute this if the
presentation is the server side
component and server-side framework like
MVC GSF stuff like this and yeah this is
this is the first one and cluster it's
only needed if you if you if you would
like to have no 24 7 and if support
everyone OneNote dice that the other one
will pick up the
the traffic and what I usually also do
is try to rely on or try to introduce
something like sticky sessions because
otherwise you get a problem with the
sessions and yeah this is this is one
also released me from its not from Sofia
is from mike w yep so my advice is don't
distributor that don't distribute unless
you really have to and you really have
to is usually a requirement like you
know you have some external service you
have to talk to or you have two
different teams with different life
cycles so I'm but usually pick
everywhere ever everything in one war
put the war on one server the 71 JVM and
the JVM on 10 s period okay perfect so
on the next question is oh let's briefly
look at Twitter how interesting so um
there is there is default constructor
and access the beam by named and
produces method what it could be it
could be that there is no session so it
creates know for instance could be that
you are injecting the session scope into
a no stateless session bean or request
cop session bean but still no in both
cases even should work the question is
whether you are how you are excellent
from the outside is this jax-rs or is a
jsf and you really have this session
established so on what you could do you
could for instance how it's called
session binding listen HTTP session by
name is nur and then see whether you
actually have HTTP sessions and name
does a little bit strange why you need
named oh because name is a stereotype so
something is strange was d named unless
you would you are accessing this session
scope directly from jsf this would be
their own explanations where I need
named but then the question is why you
need to produce is then so something
looks strange I just f you see how
interactive this is perfect yeah but
then usually you you wouldn't need to
produce us
and yeah and then and see how many
sessions do you have so this could be
also interesting otherwise it could be
it is a back so obviously session scope
is a normal scope you only have to have
one instance per session Nevermore very
good thank you and so obviously it's not
so difficult to send out image from Java
if I I javamail exactly this what I'm
also doing and and now he asked me best
practice to receive handle corresponding
emails and this is a little bit harder
so I think what what do feel good like
to have is something like a threat in a
mail app where there is an request and
response and the stick together so if a
threat of messages how to implement this
and this is harder so there is a javadoc
mail API and you will have to search for
this and I think this is this is this
the right one and if you look at this
there is a search capabilities so you
could use su subject to to to to you
know to glue the request and response
together and what if you have a map I
think there is an IMAP ID which
identifies the corresponding image but
then you will have to use the comm some
part which is obviously proprietary and
there is somewhere something an imap
idea i think so if you use this you
could you could write you know a service
which searches for for the first email
and searches then for all for the whole
threat and you could implement something
like this how reliable it is I have no
idea but you could use search
capabilities and like with loose tea
with research reports or javax mail
search or use the IMF capabilities I
never did this i just sent image and I
think that don't even received emails
and from Java just send the image but
what's interesting there was back then
James Apache this is I use of my server
in
1999 so this was an unmade server called
James an old one and and look at this so
I was able to receive emails with James
and probably James has something like
this because there was support for
mallets and wisdom a lets you were able
to do more and I wrote some you know I
spam filters back then but you could
actually search whether there are some
capabilities you know to find
corresponding image okay so next
question so how would you inject
properties using CGI that can check at
runtime so I did it several times I'm
even in a wrote an article about this it
the article should be configuration Adam
been and Java magazine with the e at the
end magazine this is like this and look
at this article is a free one it's a
very old one but i think the contents
should be still up to date so it was it
was based on java 6 so it takes too long
oh just three years old already so each
one this is a free subscription you only
have enough to subscribe to the magazine
liquid receive all the articles so just
take strong and look at the article and
the answer right now is what you what
you don't see here you don't see how it
is inject it and I eject this usually
using something like
let's say instance of something let
inject string configuration
configuration gasps so if you call your
gat you will get the recent recent
instance of the string this is it worked
for me and yet worked always for me
actually so um yeah this was the
solution and if not works for you the
question is which servers server are you
using and if it doesn't work then and
this request scope is a little bit
strange i never used to request cope for
this I just said producers qualifier
could be and then on the other other
other side I just injected the string or
into whatever interrupted with an
instance so this was my solution to the
problem someone asked is java ee more
secure and faster than microsoft asp.net
MVC completely wrong question it cannot
answer the question why java ee could be
as fast or faster or slower than MVC
because Java is just a speck it could be
implemented extremely fast or an
extremely fast way or extremely slow and
in no bad way so the question would be
more like is Tommy or is pyara or is
glassfish or is the web celebrity
profile faster or better than asp.net
MVC and it's hard to say but what I can
say is that microsoft recently in the
recent years improved a lot so they they
invest a lot to open sources are really
interesting company and there is no
reason why you should use asp.net if you
like the net so i spent you know all my
developer life in java java this is why
the java ee but right now the net could
be as interesting as if java he actually
is but i would say both are very similar
so if you just take you know the
reasonable application servers and
compare them to asp.net
very very similar the question is out my
feeling is that service like for
instance white fly with the popular GSF
stack like for instance primefaces are
probably more popular than asp.net and
then probably have less box than this
but this is just rough estimation tutors
actually I have no idea and the next
question is Java more secure and faster
than spring framework so secure spring
had no security flaws and java ee
different servers have also security
problems not like everything something
is perfect faster is also know how to
say because the spring framework has to
be run on something and i would say just
if you would run boy let's say you have
a modern application server like pyara
told me or white fights a wife line why
try eight and you're building a java app
on white lie 88 or you would you would
have a wife like eight with spring on
top then I think spring would be a
little bit slower than Java EE because
of course spring is of another framework
on top of Java EE framework so you get
to frame was running on one server and
but I'm not sure whether they're
actually measurable so Java 8 is you
know so great with the performance that
usually all unnecessary unnecessary
calls or interactions are really hard to
measure so um more interesting would be
you know spring on jetty comparing on on
white fly and i would say they would be
very similar I think there's no reason
why spring core java you should be
faster or slower whatever what I'm more
interesting in Ystad in the programming
model or or usability productivity and
this were there are different opinions
out there but from the runtime
perspective I think spring and Java you
have very similar footprint and and and
and are very similar when spring runs on
jet your tomcat and you comparing you
know this was right whitefly what I
don't get still some projects have white
fly and pits put spring on top this is
what I don't get at all but
this is completely different
conversation okay question I might is it
is it a good idea to move the business
logic from Java code to start procedures
on the B level and the answer is of
course it really depends so if you if
your team comprises highly-skilled
sequel experts SQL expert out not
hesitate it just put whatever is
possible on the database level then of
course the database cannot be easily
swapped with this other database but
because it's thought procedures tend to
be a little bit database dependent but
on the other on the other hand you paid
for the features actually of the
database and he owned another
observations databases tend to outlive
the applications so um so um usually a
database lives longer than your app it
could change of course right now because
we have you know the no sequel movement
or whatever but for ages it was true
that the database lives actually longer
than the lending than the application so
i would say if you team comprises secret
experts and not java experts putting
everything on a database is perfect what
you shouldn't do you shouldn't split the
business logic so parts of the business
logic is on the under surface layer in
java and the other part in the database
without any hard rule so there should be
a rule or something you can describe or
define to decide where to put the
business logic and if you know this rule
nothing i would say star whatever is
necessary to database and what we also
did sometimes there you have to know to
handle a large amount of data then is
even better than the data should live in
the database so you write some code in a
database and process the data directly
without you know pooling dalida base the
data from the database transforming the
data in Java and storing it back in the
database
so I am beginner Java a beginner asked
me we need to be binax ml where the pin
6 image should be and when I inject is
executed so very very very good question
actually and because we have the MVC
project we can look briefly at this so
just go to the file perspective so if
you have beginner download netbeans and
start with netbeans because you have no
time for installing plugins obviously
the stuff like this so I'm the running
joke so as you see the pin 6 ml should
be in source main web app web in and
what I always do I say been discovery
mode all and the default would be
annotated so what it means all annotated
classes are injectable and this is the
location the next question is when ed
inject is executed and what we can say
in general it is executed before usage
so if someone invokes the method now
right now and the object is not
initialized so what are we going to rely
on that in the method post construct
whatever is needed is injected so it
could be lasered can be eager this
depends on the on the settings from the
application server but what I can say in
post construct all at inject is already
performed in in constructor is not the
case but in post construct it should be
and so this is how it's called Hollywood
principle don't call how was it don't
call us don't call us we'll call you so
what it means if it's time to execute
the business logic the application
server will initialize all the
dependencies and some of the
dependencies if you have Frances ejbs
and min pool size of one are already
pre-initialized at the startup time of
the application server which is quite
nice because you see the arrows at
deployment I'm very nice I will just
briefly on the questions so I have two
more Queens so I think he created one
bin for each jsf
h very strange indeed so okay break on
post construct and when they called
produced methods second time the list is
not so really strange problems you have
Bruno I can help you at what I can say
it looks like a back some configuration
back it should work and I think we
create one bin for each JSF page so what
it actually means is something wrong
with the session so for unknown reasons
the session is that propagated so
between the pages okay very good no
other questions so it looks like all of
you are happy no question the chat
really no questions nice crowd or you
know Java is so simple and obvious that
there are no questions left yeah
question number ten porcupine exposes
jam mix is porcupine exposed by Jovah so
what porcupine is is another project I I
used in some commercial projects and and
and and where is it here and what it is
it just makes on-the-fly creation of
thread pulls and configuration extremely
easy and it creates managed threat
threats so it exposes you of course
demanded threats are exposed as usual /
igenix but porcupine does not expose
anything to glass fishwife reverses
there are no dependencies to glass fish
or or or or or white flour or any
application server implementation and
all the monitoring statistics are
exposed via jax-rs could be and there is
a porcupine spy and what happens behind
the scenes porcupine is able to inject
you it into the header all these
statistics to all that you get you know
in debugging face all the runtime
statistic in each response on the client
in a header this is what porcupine is
doing but there is no dependency to jam
mix or a a mix from from glass fish and
what what porcupine actually behind the
scenes is
is there as executors from from from
java 6 and it configures thread pulls
behind the scenes so this is what
happens and yeah so very good question
so what happened to a mix support for
glass which I've been trying to get
broken glass of 40 so I I'm what i
remember in 30 and 40 there was a button
in ji mix like boot a mix if you push
the button it just booted and for my
opinion just worked so i'm i had no time
to do to do to look at this but it
always worked for me and it don't think
that I'm there to there are many many
changes to the classic 40 what you
should try it just try pyara this is
really very eager community is
incredible actually pyara pyara so this
is the company and there is a github
pyara at guitar pi r this is so what it
basically is is a glassfish clone but
they are data communities incredibly
eager so if you look at this all the
commits are performed by the payara guys
and and if you if you should find a
problem just search fighter back and
usually get at least response and what
they provide the chromite commercial
support for for glass fish with even I
don't know one hour and waited for hours
reaction time so you have any problems
you know right to dis account and yeah
it's a very last question j2ee web app
uses web services layer with HIV 3 and
JP a 20 and and everyone extended
extends the basic GB which is unusual I
usually don't do this so I never extend
from our and can't remember whether I
introduced once a a an abstract egb i
can remember this
and I and the question is I think so how
to dispatch different persistence unit
two different EG bees and i think we
covered it the last time in the ax TV so
what you can do you can produce entity
managers so you can just expose them as
whatever like and then inject them so
you would have you know one produces
method like I'm always we have here
pseudocode so let's do this so we could
do something like public entity manager
expose and depending on injection point
and was injection point you have all the
meter data you need to know tube in
class data enclosing class and would
happen it then you can produce the
entity manager and now within the method
you could decide depending on what I
don't know bin name current principal
name you could inject the principal and
designed you know depending on the user
from which country the users or whatever
principle you could decide which
entitymanager to return so this is what
I would do and you can also configure
partially the entity managers but in
Java context there's nothing left for to
configure you only need the data source
so if all entity managers need to
accommodate a source you could configure
everything on the fly ok so I would just
look briefly so there's nothing to
propagate I would say there's more and
the Bruno oughta say to do i need to
propagate the session for each page
navigation actually not this is what
this the browser should do should send
you a cookie jsessionid it should just
work why does not work I really don't
know it's hard to say there are also no
questions left in the inner chat so I'm
jela think what happened is interesting
so yet the next time the next week we
have the unusual workshop so does just
a hex and vinegar pot is just building
Java hips from stretch persistent
dissipated programming in microservices
so this is a there are lots of attendees
already here Dino almost 20 and we had
to close their or commit to our room
this week and now this too we have like
and now I think five developers so we
have about three to five seats left here
so very very small group so if you like
to get intense training with me see you
next week and this one what will happen
will be together from scratch java api
application but i would rather let you
build the app and i will just try to
help you and fix the errors so i would
try to to limit my my my developing
amount to a minimum and this one is
about no sequel and persistence and the
distribution and aldi and the principles
behind and of course microservices about
how to make one single applications how
to split it apart in the multiple ones
and also in microservices i will explain
in depth of course porcupine and all
these related stuff so the last look add
the twitters no question no question no
question in the chat so thank you for
watching and see you in june the first
monday of the month and thank you for
your questions into actions and yes you
had in projects conferences some and and
of course a Hexham in the airport so the
