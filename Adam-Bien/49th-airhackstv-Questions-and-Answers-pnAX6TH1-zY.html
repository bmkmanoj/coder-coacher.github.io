to the 49th edition of Eric's TV so
let's start with the content
so first the workshop the web break up
was split into two parts
so the first one cover covers all the
essentials all the essentials essential
web stuff like JavaScript CSS
serviceworkers and web api's and the
second one explains how to build real
world applications without any
third-party dependencies and around the
corner this is the Java age workshop
covering clouds and and Kafka and
whatever is not included in Java so
interesting interesting but not in Java
and I also announced the winter
workshops so there would be
architectures micro-services and
performance okay so this then there is i
also published a episode of XFM podcast
with Johan Foss and we discuss a lot
JavaFX
and porting java fix to to arm and and
iOS and Android and gluon framework and
beginnings of Java and breakdown Linux
Java so um it was a just a freestyle
conversation with your hand falls by the
way a very spontaneous idea what I could
easily do I will probably do it I could
actually publish the audio of this ear
hacks TV as a podcast episode as well so
you could listen to it if you like
so in addition of course to to to the
live stream here if you like the idea
just pink me but I will properly do it
so there's not a huge effort for me so
we covered this so let's start with the
questions so there are some leftovers
from the 48th edition so let's start
with that so we covered this and let's
go start with that so a lot Llyod here
ask
me it was two weeks ago do you know any
Java if framework that ad client service
provided support for some as SSO
profiles so service provider yes and a
key cloak is the is the classic one key
cloak from redhead this is an open
source and it provides some will some
will a poor support and as you can see
here assemble to oh and you can have it
as a Java library or a tight integration
with the application server so this was
an easy one a service provider
I mean identity provider or service
providers I don't know what you mean by
service provider so it it comes with
with how to call it like an adapter for
your realm of application service so it
tightly integrates if you would use for
instance the dear old sanitation it
would pick up the identity from from
from the central store and it also comes
with an API which is even accessible via
JavaScript and yeah this is exactly what
it does then the next one
someone from Hamburg asked me they have
FX Java data binding at the use Java fix
and they would like to portage to web in
near future and now the question how to
approach that and what they would like
to use WebSockets two-way data-binding
and the question is is it doable so how
to deal with that and this is an example
of the Jason so in JavaScript you don't
have you know to to to serialize or DC
lies anything it just comes like it is
it looks like this and you get a nice
JavaScript object back but what what
Frizzle would like to do is you would
like to automatically bind the data here
to you I the question is what you
do so um I would actually start with web
standards of course because it is a
larger project and if you would use a
framework you are depending on the
framework you will have to understand
the framework and so forth and and data
binding I would start if you really if
the standards are not enough standards I
would mean just plain yes 2015 with
string templates for instance and if
this is not enough I would take a look
at lit HTML and actually recorded a
YouTube video about lit HTML it's a nice
little library and it comes with kind of
kind of data bindings or what you could
do is you you you would like to use web
sockets so in JavaScript you could just
say you know con socket equals new web
socket and you can connect it as a web
socket and then there is own message
there is own message Handler and what
you could do you could just get the full
object back from the server apply it
pass it to the to delete HTML and call I
think the the function is called Rande
and what lit HTML will do it would just
read render parts of the template which
really changed it would never rerender
the static parts will only render the
parts which really changed so what's the
difference between with HTML and
something like virtual Dom in and
angular or react so the main differences
there is no virtual Dom it is just it
just keeps track of the bindings so also
templates results this is the name
actually expressions it keeps track of
the expressions and re-renders only D
changed expressions so there is no
memory overhead and this is fast and
what I like the most is there are no
external dependencies and the full
library is very tiny so you can even
understand the source code easily so if
someone for instance if Google would
lose interest on lit HTML li t HTML then
you could use hype HTML which is on all
the library is very similar to it or
even write your own bindings so this
would be my suggestion and greetings
back to beautiful Hamburg so we did it
and now let's start with 49 questions so
the first one SF coy I really enjoy
watching these but but as they generally
start this dxdv
between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. for me so
another huge problem you know you have
to wake up early know and just joking
the problem is on he asked me know what
happens to 48th a hex Q&amp;amp;A so you should
not rely on the availability on of the
hex TV on YouTube because it takes time
for me to to to cut and record it why it
usually takes in a one hour to to
convert it and usually you know a one
hour to edit it and half an hour to
upload it so I need there are three
hours of time I try to do it right after
the show it is not always possible the
last times I have to fly to my clients
so if I there's lots of lot of work to
do I will just ignore the converting
because I know the live streaming is the
main thing but yeah so this is what I
can just tell I cannot promise you that
I will always you know on time upload it
to YouTube and by the way I uploaded the
48th edition today morning I never was
so late as this time but yeah what we
can do right ok sorry for that but yeah
and I think the idea may work for you
because if I would publish the audio
this is lot less work for me so I can
republish the audio as a podcast in
addition to the live stream into
addition to to YouTube so this could
solve the problem as well so the next
one they are using a web start for our
flagship product which is a bit
dangerous because sea States Java 11
will duplicate web start so do you have
any recommendations for easy deployment
of swing app to multiple end users in
the absence of web start so what I did I
would say ten to five years ago so it
really hard to tell right now is a long
time ago we just packaged everything as
a zip
and provided as a download to the
clients and this worked surprisingly
well for in multiple countries so we
just package the yacht re the Java
Runtime environment we deleted whatever
we didn't need it and then package the
the app with the swing app so the Java
JRE with the swing app and and shipped
it to the client
what you could also do we could use
docker for instance and dock it doesn't
work wouldn't work because as a and and
then and client but if it would be a a
server part you could use of course
doctor to distribute the stuff in this
part wouldn't work because it's Java fix
UI it says doc is not that suitable for
that and and there was I think it was
called Java fix deploy or Java deployer
but you only can do also use use Java 9
chick so and create a module and and and
ship the modules so this what we can do
to ship everything so on top of that
what I did even long time long the time
before I used open jnlp project so we
use the project and it is an ancient
project so it should be a no 2003 around
2003 and this opengl p project is a
freestyle implementation or freestyle a
clean room implementation of web start
and we used the source code back then
and and and and and and use it as a base
for our deployment strategies you could
use something like this as well and and
of course
so web start is going to be duplicated
but it will not disappear immediately so
okay so and the next one what is your
opinion on oracle dropping such big
aspects of java ecosystems in relatively
short period of time i wouldn't see it
is relatively short period of time
I mean Oracle bots on nine years ago and
Java fix if you look you know at the
announcements from Oracle there will be
no there were no Java fix news for
multiple years so there were some in our
cosmetic changes but not
not a big deal so there was not a huge
announcement about Java fix and I have
to say for me it was clear that it will
be is going to be duplicated in one
point of time why this because because
we have chick saw and the module support
and the fact is that the community is
more interested in html5 and web than in
Java Tex
I like Java because I like Java but
everyone talks about web and therefore
Oracle says okay before we invest you
know too much money in Java fix we just
you know drop less support and and let
the community step in and it's what
focus on clouds and all the web stuff so
this is what what would Oracle does and
for me it was clear that it will happen
and there was also uh I think it was it
was Java one when were Oracle announced
Java fix on or not announced they
demonstrated Java fix could run on iOS
on iPads I think it was the first Java
one in not in the Moscone Center it was
the first Oracle Java on with the second
one and then it didn't came out and then
we asked you know why didn't came out
and it say okay because there was no
enough community interests so we didn't
know follow that route so if you're
really excited about Java Vic's you
shouldn't know write emails and do
something with Java fix to show Oracle
we are really interested in the
technology so this is how it is will
Java remain a stable platform as it was
in the past I think so
the it will change a little bit because
we get more Java releases then in the
past so it the pace is going to be
faster and the LTS support will also
change I don't think there is a LTS
support for Java 9 yet I think so yeah
and for me is as well so I like Java in
Java EE because there were no breaking
changes this is also the the big point
for me why I'm using Java EE because I
know new her know breaking changes ok
let's take a look what happens here
nothing happens in the chat and Twitter
is also silent Oh what I forgot to
mention is there was I was also
interviewed or here no interviewed
participate in a post podcast Oracle
Oracle developer podcast 351 it was
published 18 days ago and it was about
software complexity so if you like take
a take a take a look at that ok so we
have it and by the way just take a look
you know the recent tweets were all
about you know where is the 48th edition
of of a hex TV ok now M Hulu Lani asked
me they use or ask the state they use
JSF to use angular front end and jax-rs
back end and they moved from JSF to
angular and the problem they have is
that they lots of sessions created and
and they use this session listen I think
HTTP session listener to track that and
the question is what they can do about
that so it's a strange if if sessions
are started is properly at you have a
session cookie or URL rewriting which is
the problem and how to tackle that you
already could use you could write a
servlet filter which just returns empty
session for instance or if there is a
session it throws and runtime exception
but you already track that so this is
not a huge problem I mean if if if
client attempts to start a session and
your servlet somewhere does something
like you know session or request get
session and true you would get a new
session this is how it operates to my
knowledge there is no way in standard
Java EE to disable sessions cuz they
will be started
you can disable in some application
service URL rewriting and what we can do
you can delete cookies what you could
also use you could use HTTP request
wrapper and return null session you
could write a HTTP servlet filter in
java 8 or servlet filter in Java EE 7 or
6 prior to this and and check whether
there is a new session and throw in an
error or exception and or or immediately
invalidate the session if you don't like
exceptions so you can get this session
like request get session with false do
not create one but get already existing
one if the session is not null just
invalidate the session this should work
so I think the last one would be the the
the most robust just try to find this
session if there is a session in the
validating session the method is called
invalidate okay now screencast about
Java testing I'm not sure whether what
screencast what you what you really look
at or the Java testing workshops so
there is also Java EE testing I hope
come yes and in this workshop there's
there's the in this online workshop it
just the whole workshop is all about
testing and I don't know whether you
look at dad you watch this workshop or
one of my YouTube workshops to the the
answer will differ and so so I am really
glad you like that and you asked me what
about jax-rs which jadibooti JSON web
token how to test that so what you could
do for instance if you don't like you
noticed to create a JWT job first if you
if you would like to create your WT
token what you can do it there are
enough Java libraries which create jobs
talk tokens on the client-side then you
can use framework like jmh Java
benchmark harness which was always also
used in the in the workshop and to
create a JSON web tokens and send them
over the wire so this would work what I
can also do you could for instance
create another directories resource
which ignores the GWT tokens shipped the
resource was a war and then just pick
from the other Wars just the justa
business logic and exposed that so this
would this is what I did actually in the
workshop not with Ajax or as resource
rather than with a servlet of course you
will have to use different paths other
way you will get a collision so um so
the question is and you know you don't
even like to do the distress test rather
them system tests and in the system test
you can just create T JSON web token on
the client-side so there should be not
not a big deal so just try to find if
you go to JSON web token IO you should
find Java libraries somewhere so donate
donate donate and somewhere Java so
there's a there are Java libraries Java
GWT 301 you under as multiple one so
just pick one which you like and you
could create the JSON web tokens on the
client-side I hope it answers your
question okay and then of course you
would create in JSON web token in the
before method and in the test method you
will just test and so we had the
question already with the service
provider and then the last one
surprisingly it's about query caching
Java EE and query caching any question
is you know how to is it possible to use
query caching with JPA and and they use
eh cache which is external tools to JPA
and it's the other way is the way to
cache queries that's in je je je p
application so if you take a look at
eclipse link it comes with query result
cache out of the box so and what you can
do you can say I would like to have you
know result cache of the value of 500
entries you can do the same with
hibernate so if you go to hibernate so
there is just
there's a similar mechanics behind be
behind the scenes so this is the old one
the old cash you could use in finis
Bandra or you should even use infinite
spend for now and and the problem with
that is so long time ago we used the
commercial topling distribution with
query caching and the question is now
what happens if the database changes and
you are searching with with the Curie
parameters and you would actually expect
to have you know the DD changed results
from the database as well but what
happens here what the tools are doing
like the name query plus the parameters
make up the key and the key is going to
be to be stored in a something like in a
map and the value is take query result
so if the database changes you won't
recognize that and back then you know
there were different approaches the
toppling tried to search the database
first and then the cache but if you do
something like this it cannot be faster
so be aware of that that it could be
some consistencies issues so for it only
it works but if someone modifies the
database what you should do invalidate
the cache but it is not a part of this
is not a part of the Java specification
it is a part but it comes with eclipse
link and hibernate and so you can just
use it without modifying your source
code but you are going to depending
dependent on the functionality what you
also get from Java EE now it's a
standard if there is a cashable
annotations and the cashable annotations
something different so the whole entity
is going to be cached with the values
but the keys so fine by ID will hit the
entities and complex queries will always
go to database fetch the primary keys
and then you get the entities from the
cache it's like a hybrid solution so the
query cache you will have to use you
will have to use built-in or you can use
built-in JPA implementation so what what
you can of course also do use infinite
span or hey
Karsen do it by yourself you can say
okay I'm not cashing on the JPA level
I would like to cash you know on the
boundary level would also work so let's
take a look on please refresh the
questions page okay forty-ninth please
report 30 minutes ago
so how to tell please take a look at the
Java approach i want to achieve the
following authentication mechanism is
not called when accessing resources of
resource I try to use web indicated
security console but that but it's
ignored and security mechanism is
invoked forever requests to resources ah
what you would like to have is you would
like to have only to protect certain
resources and if you use the Soteria
authentication mechanism it is always
called in the HTTP authentication
mechanism there is a request and I think
you will have to match it by yourself I
don't think it is possible to use both
at the same time so I would need some
time to research I cannot tell it right
away but I know what you mean is you
would like to protect just resources in
web.xml and only for this resources you
would like to use that area for instance
what I would do is to just create an
issue in that area github account and
the Arion teams I hope it will
immediately respond to you it's nice guy
so I will do this and for now at no time
to research this sorry for that but I
know what I mean is interesting question
a very good one how you could do that so
a hack which will work in the HTTP
authentication mechanism you get the
access to the request and with the
request you have the Ori so you can then
check the Ori and do this by ourselves
and if statements so this I think will
work but it would be not a clean
solution if you would like to use
web.xml
but having I think the problem is no I
didn't use our web pics ml for a long
time already so the question is is
adverse to use WebEx ml for that so I
would have to think about this what
would be what is actually the edit
value' to have a WebEx ml if you already
have Soteria so this is actually the the
overarching question so doesn't make
sense to use WEP excel web.xml security
settings if we have Java 8 security
Soteria so this is actually interesting
question to answer
ok so thank you know interactive
questions it was one of the fastest s--
hex TV thank you for watching see you at
upcoming conferences workshops in Munich
and probably even at an upcoming
podcasts it hacks FM so thank you for
watching
