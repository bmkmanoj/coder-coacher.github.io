to show you how to test how to write
mocks without interfaces is actually a
very basic task but I get the question a
lot so let's start with basic very
simple maiden project I would call that
mark without interfaces actually mocking
without interfaces walking without
interfaces and we need a class i would
call that hardwired hardwired business
logic in the package come a bean and i
would like to write a test for that so
nothing should be generated here by the
way you could also choose to use testing
g i will just go with straight j unit
and so what we see here there is a JUnit
library and we just use a newer diary so
so we have the out hardwired business
logic class with a method let's say get
greeting return hey look and for some
reason i would like to change the
behavior so how to do that we need a
dependency 22 makita and i would use 19
version with scope test
so it just added it to the project and
now I'm able to mock out the class so
how to do that oh just used unit test 38
so how to do that it's very simple
mocking without interfaces and I use a
method called na test and import static
arc mojito mojito so all you need all
the static methods is actually
interesting and now i can say mock
hardwiring at business logic of class so
i walk out the class and then say when
mock get greeting then return java rocks
and I would use the Java rocks expected
so and then I can just test the class as
dad let's wait a minute mock get
greeting i will actually call the mock
right now and this is the actual actual
is is expected and i will have to import
some impressed matches and this is Ark
Ark impressed coral matches and
everything and I said that I need to
send it as well and I will have to
import that with import static arc j
unit assert everything so and just
forgot the test so let's try that
and it works so we can just execute it
with one nice view but it seems to work
so all tests are passed so um what you
see I just was able to mock out the
behavior of already existing
functionality in the method get greeting
so I mark out the implementation I just
recorded another implementation so
another behavior so what I did is when
some someone invokes get greeting I
would like to return java rocks and no
and not hi Duke then I actually invoke
them knock out methods and test the
behavior so you don't need any
interfaces for mocking and this is
probably not properly one of the most
popular misconceptions about interfaces
in Java okay thank you very much and see
you on upcoming conferences workshops or
even projects and enjoy hecking with
java by
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
