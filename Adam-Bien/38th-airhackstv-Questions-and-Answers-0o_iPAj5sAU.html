edition of a hex TV some questions here
so let's start with the show so first
some some fraction bar around and what's
interesting here that the June and the
bootstrap and effective in June is just
overloaded with attendees so it actually
got the second largest room at the
airport minik and there is not that much
interest in testing quality which is
interesting usually the Java EE 7
testing quality course was crazy popular
and now I introduce Jenkins to Oh Who
and and pipeline as code and now you
know no one is interested in in Jenkins
2o builds and but what's interesting
there are lots of interest in Java 7
bootstrap and effective Java 87 and if
you have time participate in web
standards workshop this particular
interesting so this is like the Java
istic way to implement html5 application
so we just go with standards and
implement Java a java javascript
application without any external
libraries ok this so um I delivered some
keynotes at the Oracle code conference
and I spent some time or a few hours at
London Berlin in Prak and there is still
the de Brussels Oracle code keynote and
my impression of the event is is a
really nice event it is like small Java
one so it has a feeling of the small
Java one and no similar pages and
similar filling and I even watched how
it works so I delivered the dhih dhih
dhih keynotes first and after after me
there was an Oracle keynote which I also
watched in Prak and it was actually very
technical and very interesting this is
like they show how to use a Pieri
it is like a micro service API
management tool or or or yeah API
management API management tool and they
showed actually in the technical
keynotes how to use Oracle flour the
words apiary which was
interesting as a well-delivered and the
funny story is I was asked by Oracle to
deliver keynotes and say okay I could do
this but I am and don't like to talk
about the same stuff over and over again
and I am NOT very good with slides and I
say okay the deal is I will deliver the
keynote without any slides an Oracle
said okay just do it and so my plan was
to deliver a single app so starting in
London and then through the all the
keynotes and evolve the earth through
the keynote so you will see a story and
because the keynote was was recorded in
London so if you have time you can
actually watch me life or life you can
watch me in London and I actually disarm
stop stop this is actually the the an
interview with me from prag but there's
the Oracle code 2017 keynotes and this
is the first part where I hack a small
micro service from scratch and in unto
some attendees questions so this was
recorded what I didn't knew only London
is recording on the other one so what I
did instead I created a github repo so
you can watch my progress so you see
this is the ten days ago I created a
tech micro service and the clinic in
practice like a small black guy and like
a mascot and yeah this is a just saw
that at the airport and and the critic
Microsoft's implemented in Prague and
the others micro services were
implemented is rage approximable in the
ask me about load balancing or actually
implemented load balancing in hello was
implements in London so this is the
repository if you're interested just
encode is a cross of code of course
messy code without any preparation I hit
something on stage okay this is the
Oracle code so the deal is if you are
around you can meet me in Brussels still
and this is to my understanding is a
free event and I think it is a worth to
spend one day and it was extremely well
attended also interesting I asked the
question London Berlin Park and Bruce
Lewis still to ask who likes actually
maven and the London were exactly I
think three attendees out of
founded in Berlin were about half and in
Prague almost everyone liked mavens I'm
really curious what happens in Brussels
okay
so far is a good Oracle code then what I
also did there is a the document
projects from from Joker
there are view images I actually forgot
to block about that in and and promoted
a bit so I implement a glassfish five
which is the reference implementation of
Java 8 dock image so if you would like
to experiment a bit with glass 55 and
you don't like to install the glass with
locally or you like to use dock I just
do it so I think this is before one of
the keynotes I implement that so this is
glass which we five pink and GlassFish
five and actually one of the keynotes I
started with white slide and Tommy and I
guess the end and then deployed the
micro service to GlassFish b5 what also
Islam was also interesting there is also
a firehose image so more on that later
so the firehose images like gateway for
Prometheus and yeah what's the
repository from time to time proved new
images and I often forget a note to
promote it on my block so when was the
last commit I think this was the glass
55 okay what also happened so there are
two new projects so one is called
firehouse which will also cover later
and the what the firehouse is this is
like monitoring gateway which fetches
Jason and delivers Prometheus matrix so
this was this was that also related is
perceptor her percept or its performance
interceptor oh it's not available it's a
pity because it was an AI project nice
project so repositories and let's see
perv
interceptor perceptor without yes so I
want it to be to be short and the
perceptor is actually already
performance interceptor is already in
the in sauna type Center what this is
you can just drop the jar to your war
and you have to to register your
interceptor or or to declare interceptor
with interceptors and then you get
restful interface with some basic
monitoring stuff and actually stay tuned
because of some ideas how to how to make
the process of registration a little bit
more convenient if you will stick to the
BCE structure okay this were the
announcements of Persepolis interesting
fires is interesting and there is more
to come
yeah and I would say start with the
first question
let's see Chet is alive and what happens
here oh so there is some comment which I
cannot understand product productive
with Java EE docker I think this is what
I was meant okay perfect so let's start
with the very first question and the
most interesting comment most
interesting one challenging one I would
say so there is the question is what is
the this is actually the the mr. waters
brought a statement or write up about
being Java obsolete and this is and
there is a Gutner study which is
actually interesting so if you go here
and try to open that so you can download
the study but you only have to pay two
thousand three hundred dollars for for
eleven pages and what I say is that the
the study hadn't I didn't spend the
amount of money to and didn't read that
estate the market knowledge this Java
still dominates but not for long I think
eg bees are dead
they're also a threat ten years ago we
see 2008 is it should be relevant
anymore so I have not it let's see so
I'm lucky I'm just click on the easy to
be relevant anymore in 2008 so need for
eg bees and I don't know who brought
this I just will just random choice so
uh the Java is that an EJB is that this
this idea I get asked about that for at
least ten years so this is a only only
nine years and it was wrong always wrong
to to use eg bees yeah what what I
wanted to say is they work surprisingly
well do bees and Java as well and and
what the what the what the write-up
states here it's like you should look up
for lightweight other lightweight
platform or technologies and I or Java
is not an appropriate framework for
building cloud native applications so we
build some Java EE applications for the
clouds and they were running in the
clouds and we didn't miss anything and
there was no problem with actually if
you go to the my youtube channel YouTube
at ambien and go to clouds I'm actually
I'm actually pushing some Java
applications to the clouds and this is
really as fast and easy as it can be so
it's actually very convenient very fast
and what the report states here that
Java EE that the companies are searching
for lighter-weight platform so
technology first I spend all my time in
projects and so business people don't
even know what lightweight means so if I
get questions it's about use cases or so
big problem whether the problem is soft
with lightweight technology or or
heavyweight technology no one cares as
long as it's cheap and and easy to
maintain
so what what
what I think what is meant here that the
application servers are too big because
what you can what what else lightweight
can mean and this is no more true for
years so I'm I'm not sure on which
application servers they actually look
at because the today I actually
installed Skype and the download size
was 50 Meg's if you download Tommy is 55
mix so what is what what it actually
means that doesn't mean that we should
not use Skype because it's to have you
eight and we are searching for lighter
weight technologies for instance or or
what is light though is does its light
weight start with 10 Meg's 20 mega max
50 Meg's and 60 Meg's I'm actually found
this this topic fascinating and what I
did I submitted a topic at JavaOne about
this about light weight and actually
will measure all the time the whole the
talk and try to define what light weight
and heavy weight could mean because I'm
actually really completely confused
what is heavy weight and what is
lightweight and and if you are searching
for lighter weight technologies which
problem do you have
and what solution you will find and how
it is different to Java II for instance
and you see the clear shift in
applications of a market and it's not
that clear for me and yeah if you search
here for lighter you will see in light
weight now this is there are several so
preference for light weight frameworks /
Java EE so I wouldn't really curious
what it is what is a lightweight
framework it meant no GS I wouldn't
consider no J's lighter weight but no
idea okay so okay this is about this is
about light weight in Java and and yeah
I have no idea what what the report
states and thing not only I'm confused
here the other people which also don't
know what it actually means it will be
right
we should probably know gather the money
and buy the report and actually read it
what what's there okay
so I hope those are some hope this is my
opinion I'm confused there is nothing
heavyweight in my projects the only
heavy things I see is as I already said
cargo called architectures where you
find out you know 50 max of source code
to employ to expose a hello world so
this is what I see and whether you are
using heavyweight framework and or
lightweight framework you know the
problem remains the same okay cool so
specialized platforms are gaining
control yeah probably
what I also saw here in the in the
report wait a sec so it means this Java
it doesn't doesn't evolve so fast so
this is the problem and I'm I'm not sure
that's the problem so let's go back here
to the we have just to reopen this you
see we generated already two clicks for
this report so um so let's see with for
instance the standard based approach
means that they meditate okay and there
is somewhere here it is refocused to
modern architectures trends and faster
pace that it will put Java in a much
stronger base as well and it here this
is this is true but there is some words
in now say that Java is too slow or or
whatever yeah Java moves at slower
slower pace the solution from vendors
such as pivotal of course but if you
think about this this is I will always
say okay Linux is dead because there is
nothing new so I installed you know
since sent to us X so I installed my
server six six a half 6.5 and seven and
72 and I'm really I'm not satisfied
because it you know moves too slow the
problem was Java it is really old major
technology so what do you expect you
know slice the same store like like with
all the smart phones I don't expect you
know too much revolution in the next
year
except there will be completely
transparent or whatever but I mean the
fun factor is okay all all smartphones
looks roughly the same and yeah so what
it means
all smartphones are dead because they
did not develop fast or whatever
actually is also a theory that Apple is
doing because they cannot innovate very
fast with these smart phones but yeah so
um this is this is in my opinion with
with Java EE I think what you what I
think is I also say the same Java is
good enough for 80% of all use cases and
even if something more special then you
can just pick the frame per unit and
then this way to go so this is how it
always was and this is even through with
JDBC GMS or whatever so this is my
opinion to this and go back to my blog
and to the questions and I think I got
someone from France with a question hi
Adam so I said hi and it stirs here is a
question no no questions very good
this is our recurring question we're
busy I know how to deal with helpers and
and what I actually did in my blog Eric
or or I recorded actually I asked the
question again
so why the topic what our helper classes
this is actually what what I asked
myself in all my inin code reviews as
well if you see something helper so the
question is does it really help me the
day I name the class helper and what
usually happens what you can do with the
helpers usual you can reintegrate the
helpers into already existing classes so
sometimes this can be static methods
sometimes it can be just a regular
method but I don't think we need a lot
of helpers so rather than thinking you
know where to put the helpers I would
rather try to reintegrate the helper
somewhere else and before you spend too
much time thinking about where to put
melp helpers helpers in the BCE pattern
what I would do I would just introduce
an entirely new new folder in your so we
have usually boundary control and entity
and I would introduce a folder with the
name junk or or or crack or whatever it
did the name has to be really bad so not
very popular name it should sound it
should sound horrible so and you put
your helpers into this folder which will
force you to rethink you know whether
the ddd helpers are really needed and
try to do - - to extract them from from
from this from this folder and so
usually what I try to do just go and
look on my on my open-source projects
you will find that I never have helper
users or Commons and what I would do I
would rather put you know you create a
class like text logging monitoring this
could be an not classic amend packaged
text monitoring logging or whatever that
not all packages have to be you know
domain packages you can also introduce
technical components but why don't like
the helper common you tool or whatever
names because no one knows what's inside
this is ways to know of of strokes
because if you open the folder used if
you just look at the name helpers know
what what kind of helpers are there are
there's a string helper JBC connection
pools whatever okay now primefaces and
GSF and the question is modular GSF
projects and this is not about modules
or components in the front-end
I think Monsieur huh what is his name
sea bass Tom anthem sea bass dhanam sea
bust
it's called him she bursts probably
Christian or something like that but
does go with a Chris sea for Chris so um
and what Chris says is it has 300
entities and tons of dto data bins all
in one
war another question how to split it up
and this is one of the problems with GSF
what usually happens you have managed
beans like the controllers or at named
and this managed beans can can can use
boundaries from all over the place
so what happens is the presentation tier
ties boundaries more together what we
did in one project which is what is the
exception from the rule we extracted the
presentation layer into another war and
the JSF communicates it like angular by
a rest client with the rest of assets to
decouple that and of course it comes
with additional all that and but you
could at least split it so and this is
what one idea what you can do and
another idea would be you know to look
at the UI and think about ok which views
or panels do we actually have and you
need something with someone from with
business background or domain knowledge
and then then you know try to split the
app from the UI perspective this could
also work and what could happen then
that you actually get you know in
depending front-end parts which all
points do one rest service part in the
back end would be also possible so this
is my my thoughts which could work and
of course before you would do this I
would just I will just look at the at
the bloat first if you have any know
cargo cult involved you already stated
dto and if you have detail your progress
transformers and I'm pretty sure if you
have entities and this is all the
project you will have Daoist for sure
even probably your own persistence
framework and some service locators and
business delegate and custom exceptions
so I would delete all the crap first and
and then look how the code looks like
and then try to introduce micro services
or or slices or whatever whatever cool
so our questions here no questions no
questions here everyone is happy
so the next one
triose so this firehouse is the project
as a societal project is a small
it's called micro service why not
Microsoft's are popular so it's a micro
service which accesses your monitoring
interface and converts your whatever
monitoring data interpreters format so I
wanted to avoid to make you know all
your application depend or my
applications depending on the Prometheus
libraries which are by the way huge I
don't know why they are as a big pod
Arabic so and what I just do they expose
and all the Prometheus metrics but the
origin idea of firehose and the code is
I think already checked in but it
doesn't work properly but the tests are
running but does not production writing
let's put it this way
what firehouse why I build fires there's
another project called light fish what
it does is it it fetches the GlassFish
metrics and exposes them and what the
idea of fire hoses the fire hose right
now accepts NASA one mapping functions
so what I what I plan to do is to open
the ready works I can submit an function
which extracts whatever I like from the
from the from the source format and
convert that to the targets format and
what I can do then I can introduce new
metrics without redeploying fire hose
and what I could do done I could monitor
payara class which whatever just you
know by deploying some JavaScript
functions and this is the origin idea
but Monsieur valid which I think by the
way is in the chat I think this is mr.
Vallot I guess so mr. Vallot does okay
what about the performance so the
performance is not measured yet but I
think is negligible why this files talks
to your monitoring service and you will
properly it will take a few milliseconds
to fetch the resources and Prometheus
will Paul firehose I think every 10
seconds or something so I think you can
you could I think there's no problem
with performance at all and firehouse
should scale fairly well you can you can
you can start
many firehouses instances if you like so
thank you valid for for for asking so
what is the best way for storing
plantation property files to use with
just have bundles I think I would use it
in them in singleton startup singleton
concurrency management beam and in post
construct methods so if you if you do
this the post construct method is going
to be invoked at startup and the post
construct method and then you can load
your translation from whatever you like
put them into an attachment for instance
or making it even make them even
injectable and there there were actually
some projects on I try to find out
firehouse I think this one so what this
project does it makes cache entries from
J cache or from headlands actually
injectable so look at the code what it
could do the same for translations if
you like so with just simple producer
you can eject whatever you like from our
concurrent hash map and yeah so this
will speed this would be the simplest
possible way you know to to read this
what I do to to read property files by
the way property files you have doc I do
nothing I just expose a property file
and this is what you can really look up
on this is what I can show you even
again to defy house and then if you look
at this this is a property file and what
I do here I decline the property declare
the property files and file and doctor
reach that and then I make it injectable
system get emphasis very simple ways as
one line one line and to configure now
whatever like in a Java EE application
okay I hope so
this is a good one actually from Gabriel
and he says ok I've get get requests
with several query parameter I can
imagine what it is
I probably the guest get requests like
action and the query parameter know are
the parameter parameters of the action
how you consider a better way to handle
this to have big Yantra decorations of
course and how to change to post or use
a JSON object so my thinking of the
whole rest thing is what do you need
first you need the kind of business
concepts its concept so let's workshops
so we have or a hacks so we have ax as
an array and so we have just one in hex
so let's go with that otherwise we could
have a hex something episodes but we
have just a hex or skip the episodes and
if I put you know 38 I could fetch the
38 episode of this episode from a hex
get X 38 if I would like to to submit a
new episode I actually declined already
has the the name of the episode so the
way to go is to is put so I would say a
client a hex slashed 38 or 39 and put a
JSON object to this with all the
contents like the video or link to a
video whatever it would be canceled or
truly delete post would be update or I
could just submit the episode with
unknown title or unknown number which is
generated by by by the server and this
is how to how to deal with that it's not
like you try now to mimic or to model
remote procedure calls with rest is more
like you are thinking in objects and try
to modify the objects and this works
pretty well so unknown properties so the
unknown properties are not standardized
in j2ee so how to resolve a property so
so what's the deal with so if you have a
Jackson so you have and and the Jackson
does not know your properties you can
get
an error but if you use Jax B for
instant Java high-tech for XML binding
and and just use the built-in
application server capability and if the
if if the property is not known or if
you have a JSON object which is thinner
than the object you get actually not so
nothing will happen and so this is my
way to go so I just used Jack's B and
and it works if you have a lot of
problems of this so what it actually
means is you get an JSON object with
doesn't match your Java objects so the
question is how severe is the problem
and then you probably know my answers
then I would use that in my blog
something like this where I would use
standard Jason and Jason object to Jason
invoke or Jason object to Jason and then
I can just do whatever like and whether
the property is no known no one cares
because if the Jason object is wider
than this object no one cares if this is
missing I can deal with that right here
so what I could say get string name and
if this name is not mandatory I can say
comma and null or whatever default you
get so this would work and in Java age
you get Jason B and I'm not sure whether
unknown properties are standardized but
at least you get a hook to do something
about this okay there's one
so which application server you will
choose today if you need to design
average J application so um I actually
had to say all application servers are
good
so let's what is I can say oh very
interactive shell right so I'm sure
you're welcome
I hope you are happy with the answer
okay now Alexander asked me which
application server to choose so if you
if you watch my talks closely or even
Dax you will notice the sometimes they
use payara sometimes white thread
sometimes Tommy sometimes completely
different and this is really depends in
which project I'm actually time spending
right now
I have to say right now I really like
all the service and and and the reason
is all application servers have a little
bit different features for instance the
term the application server which is
really nice it's able to replace indeed
it doesn't have a CLI for first command
line interface or no the list doesn't
come with a see light out out of the box
but what it comes with is you can you
know have placeholders in the XML and
docker and the placeholders can be
replaced by environment and reason this
is perfect fit for daca cloud native and
and white fly Empire I would say they
are pretty similar so they are I would
say payara the nicer monitoring
out-of-the-box capabilities and
command-line interface and and and and
and white fly has it's also an command
line interface but these are more
generic so the all the commands are are
more direct so if you know the XML
structure you can directly refer to the
CLI both both aren't great and if you
probably know both are using weld the
payara uses the rest easy
jax-ur sof sorry Jersey paralysis Jersey
which in my eyes is from the client
perspective or a bust then then why try
with rest easy from the client
perspective if you search for how it's
called basing connection arrow with
white label finders but you need all
application servers are shortcomings but
it's a lot better than was in there are
a few years ago and if you get the D D
web logics
or the web sees they have the best
possible monitoring capabilities
actually and what also very great is
whether Liberty profile I think even is
the smallest application server right
now so um I would say just choose a node
to start with something open-source
payara white fly or tummy and and go
with that so and I like to swap between
application servers a viewers ago I was
a huge GlassFish fan because there was
nothing comparable or like that and now
we have white fan we have Tommy
so um so royal likes a hex which is good
and he is also very good question that
the question is if he had something like
a J cache and I'm promoting you know the
and promoting the thin Wars but if he
would like to use J cache let's say J
cage is not a part of Java 7 it isn't in
Java 8 could be but but in Java 7 it is
not so how to how to deal with order or
Google phone number parsing library or
for instance how to deal with encryption
libraries so and the question is know
how to do that and the question is also
already answered in the let's go here to
the Docklands token Prada project and if
you look for instance and pi are
configured so the PI are configured
server it inherits from the regular a
hex payara image and what is it here
there are some project specific settings
like I just set up the JVM options - max
Ram module what you could do equally
here you can put whatever you like into
the Lib folder so for me the configured
images or project specific images this
is where the platform is created so this
is what doesn't change very often and
usually this is the application server
plus no third-party libraries which not
fancy libraries or you know optional
libraries rather than mandatory library
sometimes sometimes there are some no
LDAP frameworks or whatever and because
they never change I considers part of
the platform and they are shipped with
the application server which works
perfectly well in most cases you know
some classloader problems aside prop
possible problems aside but it works
surprisingly well and and then you would
inherit from the configured and then you
war is still thin which doesn't mean you
have to put you know all the Jakarta
Commons libraries you know here is just
this is also an exception that it puts
something additional to Java
in most cases really we don't have any
external dependencies and you can watch
you know or look at the interviews on my
blog so most of the clients have Justin
though some sometimes PDF libraries
Apache PO is a good one so we have those
and a single such dependency I was still
ship with war if you have more than this
or if you will see darker deployment or
or application server deployment slow
down I will introduce this this
disinheritance cool so question here are
no questions no questions so here
question is how to deal with events see
the events which are general fide and
the answers
there's nonsense impossible to do this
what you will have to do is you will
have to introduce a qualifier which
holds the type of the event or what I
would do I would just extend event so
like the main event extends this event
or introduce another innama whatever so
I have to say I never had a problem but
what is actually the answer resolvable
tie provider something here could do
something similar with Java EE with
qualifier order created order delivered
okay interesting what I would do and I
would we name the domain event to
something more meaningful because domain
event is too generic or probably order
created on order delivered it will be
top top events or I would introduce an
enum and the enum is the is the is the
event type and the payload could be a
house called or the payload or the
created for instance the order delivered
the question is no Ardis classes or
others types so it looks only like like
event type not necessarily a payload
then I would introduce a class you know
like order event and that enum inside
order create an order delivered or if
you would like to keep that introduce a
qualifier with the
genera fight person okay also hard
questions right now so the question is
there is a jdms and the J PMS project is
Java platform wait a second
J PMS the Journal of pioneering Medical
Sciences is not jigsaw so are you
so three hours ago
Randall published open letter to JCP
planning that JP is approved so JP reso
chicks is approved but there was some
drama and the drama was that the chick
saw spec which is part of the Java
platform module system that the IBM and
the Red Hat will vote with no to the
spec and and the question was why and
many suspected yeah because IBM is OSGi
and and and the record have cables
modules and this is I think I know idea
from the outside was not entirely to I
think the reasons were because the idea
was first to introduce chick saw to
partition the the jdk itself and then it
was widened for or api exposed to the
applications and now the companies are
concerned about the compatibility with
jetty k-19 with de frameworks this is
what i understood and yeah so there is I
would say pragmatic drama right now and
yeah this is what it is and I think and
JCP is an open process things like this
can just happen and the reasons for me
were understandable so let's see how
they get resolved and I will hold the
chick saw or J PMS will eventually come
because I'm waiting for already for 10
years for jigsaw and yeah
and it something is always broken if you
migrate if you introduce something like
this but I think it is a yeah there was
another question what's my opinion about
gPMs so wait for the question so this is
a good one
I'm just starting with Javy and like to
some advice on how to approach it
effectively so how to approach Java
effectively
so what is the first step so the first
step is you go here and say okay I would
like to have to start a project and
start with the essentials archetype and
then I would start with something which
you are excited about so a pet project
so but it should be useful as well
so what I would for instance do is for
instance if you if you like introduce
create a small CMS content measurement
system or a block engine for instance or
a or whatever like so I Oh team gateway
API gateway whatever let's go with CMS
ax CMS finish and this takes
surprisingly long and the thing is what
I actually created is just that so this
is a good start and now and you get the
jax-rs configuration which introduces an
endpoint called resources and you have
the injection point all and then start
with the business logic and the business
logic is like for instance with CMS you
would say like or a hex or CMS the
component would be watch documents for
instance documents boundary documents
resource just start hacking resource so
and with path documents JSON object or
JSON array all get returned Jason create
array builder at Gartner or this Java EE
add rocks built so like this and I think
CMS is too much but what you could do is
not document rather than yeah document
pages and then create your minimal block
engine and then create a small github
projects and go for it so this is where
you do learn the most you know you know
all your they see all the significant
annotations or I will also do I would
introduce your stateless and let's say
here you have a class document store and
then or could be or could be singleton
if you have some caches and this is what
I will implement and start coding so
this is how to start and write simple
code with lots of functionality and then
see know where the development stops and
where you would like and out to where
you need some more functionality and
whatever this is what I would do and
this is what I also do if I see you know
something which is needed like prints
the fire house I just take it and learn
also new stuff so now you have you know
the for your first project now from
there I would expect a small guitar
Portugal next
I'm so if you did something we will
announce it here at the X so all the
viewers will help you with your app
hopefully I have no time so I will just
answer your questions once once a month
so let's see what happens here
no questions no questions chat is lazy
today which is good because we have lots
of questions so I got an a nice question
I think via email or it was during the
conference it's like what is the
relation between connection poles and
clustering and the answers you have a
multiple application service multi JVMs
you get the connection pool is one per
JVM usually there is no magic here so if
you have four nodes and each and the
connection pool is configured to to hold
to manage five connections you will get
20 connections in total I was a very
good question for what we need use Java
EE with payara glossary and so on if you
have Jersey Jack service implementation
actually we covered it a little bit the
last time and and someone asked me now
do we really need spring and Java EE why
not go to a straight go straight
Java and this is actually what I also do
so if you go here and look at n hydrator
I was actually hired back then to
implement je batch and I say you don't
even need Java EE so this is the whole
project here is just based in Java it
without any external dependencies
hopefully here it's where the second tip
so the whole project has dependency to
Jason or this test so this is run time
dependency Jason test test test
so it only has Jason dependency
interestingly why I need this forgot
this actually but everything else is not
needed so so this is a debate so you can
just know or even more interesting on
modern more appropriate the project nano
I created so small HTTP server which
comes with Java 8 nothing so there is
even no Jersey it's just you can write
an O in asshole
an endpoint without so if you just would
like to have a web server you can just
go with Java it without Darcy so the DD
DD answer is perfectly well valid if you
just have to implement rest endpoint
without persistence without anything go
for it
but usually what happens in the my
project is we have some more classes
involved and the first thing is it would
be nice to have dependency injection if
you have dependency injections that
you'd be nice to have some monitoring
and it would be nice to have something
else so there is no lot difference
between the let's call it how to call it
lightweightness factor between rest easy
GRC or the whole application service so
the application servers are surprisingly
small and if you don't believe me right
now I recorded you know a whole series
Mythbusters so watch them there are some
in over application service I tried to
measure us objectively as possible the
the over top application service and
yeah and it was I was even surprised how
highlight where they are so the question
is now if you go just with Jersey I
I assume my if I if you both with
startup projects I'm I would be faster
with white right Tommy and GlassFish to
set up the project and deliver the first
end point before you do do this which RC
as was my assumption so if I end up and
pasta then I will win because it's
simpler this is what I wanted to say and
but again if you just need to know to
implement us as a small hike arrest and
point then I will probably use something
acknowledged the buildin HTTP server not
even Jersey if there is and it is hard
to find you know applications which need
more than HTTP server and less than Java
so there's and the the spot between is
probably just Jersey ok and my question
is always know what problem problem are
you solving if you just introducing
Jersey and skip Tommy classify or
whatever now the question from from Alex
about what's my opinion about je PMS
this wire skepta so back to the platform
module system and I actually really
liked the idea and funny stuff first
I remember it was around 2007 so son was
still around and the clients ask me now
we would like to modularize our stuff
you know how to do this with which
framework should we introduce and I say
hey wait
chicks is around it would come we know
this will be standard and then we just
keep standard a we don't have to
evaluate not so just keep the use the
standard and now ten years later and we
are still here and I'm asking her what
was up with with chicks on so why I like
chicks Oh is because ah the DD
modularization happens already already
the compiler or there is a module path
and if the modules lacking the
application won't get compiled so I
think this is what I really like I don't
like the idea to use no class loaders
for modularization because it's too much
magic the earlier the better and my
understanding is always also that the
trick so the main goal is to modular
modularize Java itself and then of
course you can use this for applications
as well and one of the criticism from
African idml record was like that the
chicken doesn't provide versioning
schemes and yeah the problem is so DDD
reasoning I I think I attended a session
Java one last year is that it is way too
hard to this otoscope of tricks on so
I'm I like chick saw and I would like I
would really appreciate it will come out
soon so this is my personal opinion
about chick saw okay and surprising the
very last question from Simon and he
asked me he using asynchronous method
which is okay which should be aware is
the asynchronous method is is executed
by thread pools which are well hidden in
application server so you have to know
know how to configure them this is not
like the usual thread perform
application is another one and what can
happen to you that let's imagine the the
thread pool which cares about
asynchronous is configured to know to
start only two thread two threats and
what happens then of course is your
application will block or could block so
it returns job is the future and you can
ask is done as over and so forth
approach you used to also update the
current progress percent that is pulled
by Ajax res why not to use CDI events so
what you could do you can you can you
can throw CDI events or fire a CDI event
with the current progress and and use
WebSocket to distribute the information
for instance and and then if this is
done you just invoke get done and you
are done so you can you can fire events
as until you get the 100% and then
invoke get perfect so I would say see
you at upcoming workshops but the
upcoming workshops if possible you know
do not register to the bootstrap and
effective in June just attendee test
they are overloaded anyway so if you
come it will close probably in the next
few weeks both and if you can attend
this one and of course web standards so
I will this is one a really excited
about and iectures micro services but
this is December this is in winter and I
have no time in between so this year
only these phantoms will happen
perfect so how is going here nice
yeah because cheeks a magnet jdk more
lightweight good question and yes what
you will get or at least it was in
discussion was this Ã¤Ã´t this alt is
ahead of time compiler so what we could
do with chick so is like really you're a
very small binary which which will
package your application with parts of
the jdk beretta asked me other plans to
put the web standards berkshire online
Brett is a friend of the show it he was
actually and a DX in Munich Airport and
Brett akka was also a great fan of
blowing wine so he attended one of the
Christmas editions okay hex so arm just
keep it secret to all of you
so I'm 25
percent done was web standard workshop
online so so this is what I'm actually
doing in spare time so there was
absolutely no time in the last two weeks
but I have I think still 30 40 or 30
episodes to go and I'm implementing a
small web app with CSS JavaScript
standards or CSS JavaScript html5 which
plain standards and like it's very
similar to the Java EE bootstrap result
alt but it's html5 and I wanted actually
to call it web bootstrap but this would
be a very bad name because there's a CSS
framework with the same name bootstrap
so yes Bret it would be online but if
you can attend come again in December to
Munich okay so thank you very much and
see you next month and or in projects
and Java one so I submitted some talks I
think two or three if they accept it I
will come to San Francisco probably for
the whole week then and if you see me in
San Francisco we can arrange something
so I would like to say you know hello to
you and we can have chat or yeah happen
in official a hex meeting so thank you
and bye
