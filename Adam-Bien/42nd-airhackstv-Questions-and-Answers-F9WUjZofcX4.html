is T is going to be the answer to all
questions but it's not going to be the
last show and first I'm really grateful
that actually all workshops are well
booked and the web standards is also
very popular so this is really welcome
and react and angular is a little bit
bit less popular than then then then
then react which is even better and also
the December workshops are also well
booked I'm thinking about also to offer
a testing workshop but yeah I'm not sure
yet okay now start with the contents so
we have lots of questions or topics for
today and the first question arrived via
Twitter I'm not sure whether it is a
question rather than a statement and it
says observer model is ultimate if
classloader leaks addressed gracefully
on our pre deployments yeah and this is
the main problem with redeployments
because on each redeploy the war has to
be unloaded and loaded again and of
course what can happen is that because
of class load air leaks it is not fully
unloaded and then is the problem where
you get strange behavior of the
application service and I'm not counting
on it anymore and this is not only
applications of a specific we had
similar issues with ohga OSGi and all
other module system attempts so uh
the ultimate modeler would say is
running an application server in a
single process and then you can have
multiple micro services multiprocessors
why it's the ultimate model yeah because
the application servers are very
lightweight so they have minimal
footprint so it really doesn't matter
whether you start one application server
or ten okay so now it's a very first
question is from Nick Shaw and is asking
me is it plan to support fork join in e8
and and the answer is what what properly
Nick Shaw means
whether the threats are well integrated
in ie8 and I don't think so I actually
didn't have the time to look it up but I
don't know any movement in the
concurrency utilities spec I had a chat
a few years ago with the spec lead what
should be the content of eh but since
then I lost the connections connection
and but what I thought to do is actually
it's fairly easy to integrate fork/join
framework with EE with EE 7 even because
what you will have to do is you will
have to you will have to replace the
thread factory with the Eve thread
Factory and what you will gain is you
will gain that the threats used by FERC
John IDs threads from the application
server but thinking about this I think
recently recently yeah the application
server became smaller and smaller and
this is not a recent actually is nothing
new it is four years but now it becomes
I mean more and more obvious that they
are very very lean and have almost no
footprint so what happens now is we have
deployment like one to one deployment so
we have one process one application
server and one micro service or one war
so if you if you consider that then you
could actually say who cares about that
so even if the the fork/join framework
is misconfigured and it will start lots
of lots of threats it will only affect a
single micro service not multiples so
most of the restrictions programming
restrictions in Java EE were specified
because of the isolation so the idea was
that one one app should not one noisy
app should not affect the neighbor app
which is deployed on the same
application server but right now the
shed deployment model is dead for years
and so I would even say even without a
nice integration with fork/join
framework you could even use it if you
if you know what you are doing
then there's a J Pro and J Pro is an
interesting framework it allows you to
use Java X in the browser and it won the
the the Duke Awards in 2016 at JavaOne
and and what it what it what it does is
it allows you to run Java fix
applications directly in the browser
which is a huge achievement so and the
question is what is my opinion about
that
so first still a Java is paramount I
would say to JavaScript and why that
because the long the longer you wait the
longer JavaScript looks like Java so and
in typescript M it's in even even better
with with typescript you you get
features like interfaces and and this is
a very very similar to Java
of course javascript is a dynamic
language and Java is not but the recent
features like es6 and you will get
catches and try catch so it is almost
like java so it become less and less
important that java should want in a
browser because javascript is almost
like java i have no trouble in no
understanding javascript code is not
like the strange function nested
functions and modules is it looks like
you have classes extends constructors as
almost like Java is easy to learn so I
would say right now if I'm the browser I
would just use the platform so just use
the standards with no additional
frameworks no angular or react just the
browser platform and you can build a
decent apps and even better
so I implemented a framework called
afterburner effects of years ago which
is quite popular and with vanilla
JavaScript you can achieve similar
architecture without any additional
frameworks of course without dependency
injection but you actually don't need
dependency injection in the front end
after burn afterburner only only uses
dependency injection because it was
because of the fact that you could use
the
scene builder there was a scene builder
you can create UI from Leki
drag-and-drop and you could inject the
generated UI widgets into your
controllers so this was the whole deal
any JavaScript you hopefully not
creating the UI with drag and drop tools
or what you see is what you get tools
and of course I'm working on an online
course about this just what you can
achieve with plain standards and today I
recorded one video so I've already 31 31
videos within the course but it's not
done yet I assume it would be the
longest course ever I think we get about
I was like 50 topics or 50 videos ok so
a la cumbre and I think Monsieur a la
cumbre already attended the testing
workshop in in Munich and what's
funniest he suggested to offer
performance monitoring workshop and back
then and say probably is not interesting
enough but I get more and more questions
so actually this is one of the Monsieur
al-kubra was the one of the first
attendees who asked about performance
and troubleshooting and monitoring
workshop and now we have it right and
his question is do you know some way to
get code coverage from a system test of
course and I already recorded this so
what I did here I started an application
server with system test coverage and
started I think even a system test and
then I I try to find out what was
covered and what not so what I did here
I misused these system tests and the
coverage to identify that code but it
does not matter this is the same it's
the same mechanism and what I did in
this video is I I used a Java agent the
jacoco agent and a started application
server with the agents perform the
system tests kill the application server
and point in NetBeans to jacoco dot x
seck I think is the is the name of the
of the file and then I saw the code
coverage they can absolutely do this ok
covered so
see what happens in the chat nothing and
in the Twitter even worse silence very
good fast next question and the next
question should be the very first
questions we have forgot about that
the 42 we have the 40 second edition of
the show and what is the answer to all
questions and if you follow my all Dax
and my blog and some conferences I mean
the answer in software development my
answer to all the questions is usually
or a high level answer to all questions
is use the platform or follow the
standards so what I mean specifically by
that is I started development with basic
on setting spectrums it was fun then I
started two of us Carly Norris okay two
of us Carl is nice but I don't think it
would win and then I started C++
seon's with C++ because I thought okay
now C and C++ is just very popular and
C++ is the future because of object
orientation then was Java on the
horizons okay Java is a bigger deal so I
switch to Java and Java become became
more and more popular and since then I
just tried to focus on on on standards
which usually means popular frameworks
frameworks with big community behinds
and multiple vendors behind so why that
because I was honored I my customers
were burned multiple times by vendor
migration from from from one platform to
another and of course because one vendor
you know died there was no more
supported and we have to migrate the
code because one framework was no more
supported but if you have a standard
which is implemented by multiple by
multiple vendors then you know the
changes that you will have to migrate
something are negligible and this is why
a stick with Java EE for years and I
clients which I suggested ten years ago
to use Java EE they are still grateful
to say look we don't have to migrate
anything it still works what they of
course have to do is you know to remove
crazy layers and indirection but you
or any about this and the same is true
what I do a lot right now is I'm using
just the web platform so I'm using just
the standard implemented in browsers
without any additional frameworks was
the same idea behind it's just I'm too
lazy to migrate you know from angular 2
to 3 to 4 to 5 or from angular to react
back and forth I would like to learn
something once and use it or learn a
deeper and then use it probably and now
we have the chance to do the same with
JavaScript CSS grindage CSS we try css3
and html5 so the and there are multiple
such small things like I started Java
there was DD applications with sometimes
even build with make and then and was on
the horizon so it gained more and more
popular popularity because it was a
patchy project so I switch everything to
ant
and then if you will you will even find
an old post like I preferred and over
mavin mavin was hyped but it was not
that adopted by the community so but
then maven one-and-done I swap to maven
but the question is should I use Gradle
it's a little bit nicer but I still
think that maven is more popular
therefore I stick with Nathan so and and
I'm a consultant I have to work with
multiple clients so um this is for me
mission impossible you know to learn
let's say Gradle may even make and and
all the building frameworks just for fun
I would rather focus on the standard and
then and learn once and apply everywhere
so this is the actually the answer to
all questions so if you would like a
note to stop watching the show you can
do this but now you have now the the the
answer to everything and now start with
with the more specific questions so
Wesley asked me what do you think about
moving Java to an open source foundation
and it was caused a discussion by a
threat from Messiah Delabar see here's
it ok from from David and what he said
is they are thinking about moving java
ee to open
source or even opened and right now
because right now it is behind JCP and
there are some issues was TCK and what
was also became evident last JavaOne to
me as if I spec if I spec is no more
developed there was actually no formal
way to take over the spec which which is
annoying and this is what really bugs me
that should be a protest so if a spec is
like let's say this pack like this pack
lead changed switch switch companies or
have no no no interest to further
develop the spec there should be a
voting process you know to vote for
another speculate and this is I think
the most important thing and of course
if everything is open source is even
better and I mean this this is even even
better right now because it will
encourage to build an even more stable
or even more popular standards is what I
talked about before and so I think it's
great and it's a great move from Oracle
and I see it as a positive positive way
because Oracle change a little bit
become in today to the positive in the
positive direction
they started the how it's called Java
code conference which was free for
developers developer oriented conference
I think Oracle recognized that without
developers there will be never
successful so they can do you know just
doing business without community into
world work and and I think therefore it
is very popular is not like a node they
try to kill Java II just to to do
removing resources from that I think
they they they see the value in that and
yeah I would be more concerned let's say
at j2ee one for time frame because then
there was another huge revolution it
towards Java 5 where everything was
completely factored but right now is not
like Java 8 is complete with right of
Java 7 I think like right now a
community can really
Conte can really contribute features to
Java age without a larger Forge back
then it would I think it wouldn't be it
would not be possible so I'm very
positive on this let's see what is what
gets announced at JavaOne so on my two
talks are announced or announced they
were already accepted a Java one so I
will talk a Java one twice a book the
flight and this year I will spend I
think four days at JavaOne so exactly
full Java one I will be in San Francisco
not like one day last year so um
if you see me just now say hello and
have a chat so I will really appreciate
that
ok nice so this is interesting so this
is out of the question is about how to
discovery features of Jax's resources
and this is actually this would I always
not reject but I see is a defect in in
code reviews who are developers without
any reason list all the resources in get
classes in a subclass of the resource
application act ask why you are doing
this and there's actually no answer so
it's like without any reasons all the
all the resources are listed so if you
deploying the the resources to
applications that are within the war the
application server will identify all the
resources and will find them and so and
the question is what he asked now he
would like to have the same the same
behavior in undertow rest is the
undertow in jax-rs alone and I get that
but what he is actually doing in one
point of time so which only thing is
lacking the cd-i here and then he will
reap lament the whole applications of
all right because I mean scanning this
is what the applications have already
does and what I will do at least take a
look at whitefly swarm for instance so
there's undertow is already integrated
and and rest easy see Jax this is
actually strange because jax-rs and the
rest is the same so rest easy implement
jax-rs i think what he means is rest
the undertow and probably CDI and so
what what what what I am DVR will need
us he will need a hook to to find all
the resources and this there will be an
undertow specific hook of course because
yeah it cannot be we see the I to be a
different story we see di you could
implement see the extension which
registers whatever like but without CDI
in jax-rs there is no scanning support
for resources yeah okay something happen
in the chat right miss empty okay so I
would say why not using you know
application servers there are small
enough I don't think you will gain
anything just using undertow you will
properly know your your you you will
consume I don't know 10 mix of RAM less
than with application servers and the
startup will be even slow I guess okay
now Mauricio wrote a nice email and my
answer was I don't answer emails anymore
please ask here and his answer and he's
he's a PHP deaf for almost five years
what's interesting there are lots of PHP
developers at Eric said they learn Java
EE at the workshops and then I asked now
what is your actually your impression
right now so you have PHP X and PHP
experience and now you learn Java EE and
Java what is your impression and then
never heard something negative to say
okay it is easier it is nicer and is
well structured and is very productive
which really surprised me I thought they
would say ok this is not as lightweight
productive or whatever so seems like PHP
developers really like Java and he
considers to change to server-side Java
and and and he asked me some some
questions so do you think it's feasible
for someone to change carriers from
front end to service a Java I mean from
I think there are still lots to do in
front end but I don't think PHP is front
end so I mean switching from you know
JavaScript and html5 and CSS to
server-side Java I don't think it is a
great idea because both are very popular
so you could you can easily make some
money with JavaScript and CSS you don't
have to switch to a server side Java and
but I think you know if you know PHP I
say I would say it is easy to learn Java
as well so just you know switching from
PHP 2 to Java I think is a good idea and
then if you are a front-end developer I
would just don't leave it completely so
just I would just you know review the
JavaScript and CSS 3 and html5 stories
very very appealing so how is the job
market I think still great so go to
stack overflow I do I always you know
see millions of ads like the Java
developers are there's lack of Java
developers and for Java mainly from the
longer term so longer term who knows
what happens but as I said JavaScript
and typescript are very similar to Java
if you learn learn Java you will also
know c-sharp and still that the longer
we wait the longer JavaScript will look
like Java so I think there is nothing
lost and my impression is that Ruby on
rise did they're losing traction a lot
and what I also saw already there are
some node.js project amber migrating
back to Java so which is also
interesting trend and I think Java could
become interesting again or interesting
again it was never boring but the thing
you could take off again because now you
know Oracle's a little bit more open we
get Java 9 and something happens right
now so why not what are the steps I
could take to train it and get
experience in Java of course if you like
you can watch my videos and or come to
Munich would be the best but if you have
our way so this is the Munich very
come to i/o this is online variant and
just attend the first one the bootstrap
or the affective so it really depends
what we are interesting in so do this or
this and then if you like it go for it
and but I would say in in your case I
would just you know save money and try
to first implement something with Java
so create a pet project from scratch and
see how it goes and then if you have
questions then attend the workshops this
would be my way fragment from frequent
are updates in the Java API and
innovation frequency I mean Java 8 in
Java 9 is not that frequent I will see I
would say every three years something
happens but I mean I I learn every day
something new is not like it becomes
boring probably the perception from the
outside is like nothing happens but the
ecosystem is huge are changes to a pea
carefully planet very very carefully
planned and and many even say Java is
too you know too slow and we have a
formal process called JCP you can even
watch let a second it should be open JDK
open JDK not java.net java.net
doesn't exist anymore but it should be
redirected and not even even works and
somewhere there are the Japs there's the
process let's say JDK gdk9 so and this
is all the planning is open-source and
you see the all the features they are
very carefully planned so I think it it
cannot get any better so of I mean it's
really carefully planned and voted by
the community when innovations come out
how do people and companies approach
adopting them I think is getting faster
and faster so Java 8 was very fast
adopted and the same was true for Java 7
and I think there's no problem with Java
8 why not because with technology
technologies like daca is very easy to
use the recent Java version
yeah
not only this I mean for developers is
easy to keep up I would say it's a
problem list you will have to migrate
the app every three months and this is
crazy and and and this is why people are
moving away from angular for instance
because they don't like the migrations
anymore and then no similar company as
several companies who stick with angular
1 2 + 1 3 and there is no no easy
migration past 2 1 5 and if you have no
imagination pass 2 1 5 is really hard to
migrate to 2 3 &amp;amp; 4
and they're moving away completely from
ingre ok questions no question here what
happens here listening to a hex while
running no image just sound pavel said
in twitter this is something very new so
a hex TV what pavel tidal would would
need us like augmented reality you know
goggles or augmented reality yeah
goggles and what you and and then he
could look at at already questions and
the action while running so and sorry
but your screen is cropped i I don't
think so
so my screen is perfect so I mean all my
screens are perfect ok now that their
admin asked last time a question and I
think I misunderstood him so
interceptors intercept beam and the
intercept beam is stateless
this is not possible for a reason so
interceptors itself cannot be cannot be
eg B's and this is what it didn't meant
if you remove this at stateless what
happens then the interceptor becomes
runs in the context of this EJB of this
intercepted eg B and you can think about
this it's it is an eg B because it the
dependency injection workers as in eg B
you get you get executed in the same
transaction
Tech's from the same threat in the same
security context so there is actually
should be no difference for you whether
you are in the end deceptor or in the
AGB so you cannot write this at
stateless on the intercept or but it
shouldn't matter it should work without
those at stateless and it will behave
like a stateless UB and if you apply
this apply this interceptor on a single
day GB it will apply as a singleton it
should be interceptor and therefore I
think is also not possible to specify at
stateless interceptor because what
happens if you would let's say intercept
with the status interceptor stateful GB
then the Interceptor would have
different life cycle than the
Interceptor d GB which will be a mess
okay clarified another the questions
Wesley Egbert asked me CDI events and eg
B is a way to make the event a sink I
think yes in Java 8 there is a way using
asynchronous that observer method will
work yeah it works you get sometimes
warnings but it works or I will have to
call a asynchronous method from the
observer method so this is even better
idea so what you could do you you know
the the observer as a just as a listener
and inside the method in Java 7 what you
can do right now is of course you can
use the managed executor service and do
whatever like in an asynchronous way and
if you call an asynchronous method you
cannot do this with this so there's an
old post let's see what I will find it
this that hopefully a jiffy
this was the source coach what was um
what I explained here why this doesn't
work transaction so yeah this is the
post and what I showed here there is a
stateless and there's transaction
attribute not supported and if I say
this expects exception this expects
exception so the transaction this this
expects exception so what it means
because I'm using this there is no proxy
in between the no one will start
transactions for you so also in your
case if you will put here at a
synchronous on the method this would be
not an asynchronous call you will have
to move the method out to to another
control or use injected managed executor
service of course okay cool is there any
way to make post or put request with an
empty body yes it works but I think what
do you mean is you get a you get an
error from the jacksters to all client
so from the client is hard but from I
think there is a way but the the
application server will work with empty
body but I mean this would be a little
bit crazy because post and put says you
creating or updating a resource and in
the body is the updated resource but if
you have posin put without the resource
I mean what's the point yeah but I I
remember once I had the problem I wanted
to invoke from jax-rs client the opposed
method and I think I used Jersey and I
got an error this is what what do you
mean but what you can also do you can
create the request with a builder and I
think then you should be able to create
with a builder a post request without
the body I had no time to try it out or
I was too lazy to try it out but just
don't you know how it is called client
the target dodge requests use the
Builder with invoke and I think with
that it should be possible so our state
Fallujah boostedgt but are useful only
for some tricky corners like in so let's
see what this is by Jeff so so the
Gately pattern as I didn't like to
download the PDF now because we are
streaming online but my gateway pattern
what I would I would I what I meant by
that is I created a perfect anti Fassett
let's say and now I remember and I'm
being perfect
untie face it perfect
as you can see eight years old post
crazy right so and this is gateway so it
is stateful and the transaction is not
supported so what I did here I injected
an extended entity manager and this is
this is the and this is the killer
feature of the Gateway pattern extended
entity manager means the anti-de manager
lives as long as the order gateway lives
and there's nothing is clear and it is
just active the whole time if I would
associate the order gateway with HTTP
session we get one-to-one relation
between the order gateway and the HTTP
session right weakened instance
one-to-one so or what means I could pass
the load here load as an entity to the
JSF or any other web framework and this
framework could manipulate the load
between between the requests or between
the views and what happens then is at
the end I would just say safe here and
the safe is empty
well the safe only does it starts and
commits at begins and commits and
transaction and now all dirty entity
pne's entities within the entity manager
gets
flashed to a database so the we are
misusing the entity manager as change
detector so this is the whole deal with
gateway pattern when we need this if you
get crazy complicated you know
convoluted object graph and this is like
an expert system worthy in in my case
there were engineers it was truly eight
years ago you know they they were able
to modify the whole object graph which
was visible in a UI and we it was it
would be a very expensive not expensive
from from the performance point of view
but it would be very complicated to
detect changes of the graph on and and
with the entity manager we only waited
until the engineer says safe and all the
changes of the of the network were very
efficiently written to a database okay
okay fry felt Roy says I seen your
project that you are not always using
barcodes with rest I guess what he means
is in my open-source project I'm not
always using bracket with rest but
because I think commercial projects I
mostly use bulkheads particular if we
have to to micro services but even in my
block system so here there is a bulkhead
between the block and this monitoring
system there actually to micro services
and if this even becomes too slow you
will see there will be no statistic like
a minus sign this means the debark has
opened so I would say I try to always
use bar codes whereas reasonable and
reasonable means I'm not trusting the
back-end system which is also a good
idea another system and if the back-end
system becomes too slow I'm I'm just not
not not invoking that it this is
this is the point of course if the
backend system is an order system I
cannot just say you know forget the
order just proceed then I will block so
when should I use it
I mean in microservices think about this
first
and then don't use it if if don't use it
if you have reasons for that it's
exactly the same if you in a house a
circuit breaker is like you know it's a
silk bag Esther it's the name of the
power so it's the question what I should
use it as always except you know you buy
a new electric car and you and and you
circuit breaker is too is too weak then
you will have to bridge the circuit
breaker and until you charge the car so
this is this is similar analogy so at
least so what you can always do you can
if you have to specify time outs reach
and connect time outs and if the timeout
kiks kiks in the question is what you do
with that and what i or so in in in in
my opinion is to properly mean is the
following so I always try to apply time
timeouts but but Buckhead is even more
what Barket will do is after three times
it will open forever until some someone
closes the circuit and someone could be
an algorithm or an administrator person
so in my projects I really rely on
persons because what I don't believe is
too much magic were the secret breaker
opens and then you know closes in of the
amount of time because what I think it
would be better is if the circuit opens
then it becomes visible in a dashboard
and the admin they know or somewhere
responsible for the app just ceased it
is one application became too slow and
then closes the circuit I think there is
better than some automatic closure of
the circuit because if one application
is too slow the chances are hide and in
enterprise environment it is you know
most of the time to slow it's not like
it is too slow just you know once in a
month
okay we'll see I replace it should be in
the future I think you could replace
each piece right now the problem is if
you replace your B's with CDI you will
have to apply more annotation so
therefore I because I like clean code eg
bees produce kinder coat and therefore
there is no reason to - to remove eg
bees in future what can happen that we
get profiles without a GPS why this
because many developers don't like eg
bees because of the name eg B and they
have no idea how I write wait and fast
they are and so therefore I always use
eg be if they will die I will write a
script and replace it stateless with a
set of CDI and rotations which which
will replace the functionality of eg
bees and there's not a big deal which we
job a7 application server full profits
would you recommend for production PI RS
great Tommy's great and white fairy is
great I using all of the application
service right now I think why try and
payara
are the most used in my projects and
Tommy is also used because some of my
clients have Tomcat and they migrated to
Tommy so I would say pick one and go for
it so if you have a red head shop use
white fly if you application if you used
glass fuse payara and you have and if
you know Tomcat use Tommy could you
please record a workshop how to create a
cluster of paya GlassFish with cash
coordination enabled no because it would
take a long time and right now I have to
record 25 episodes of or at least 25
episodes of my web standards online
workshop so therefore I'm little bit
lazy with with that and this would be
really hard to show I would say so I
mean I would have to create two docker
containers and see how it replicates and
this cache coordination is eclipse link
feature so you could I would test it
outside the application server first and
then use it with the class efficient
okay let's see what happens here a hex
is rockin thank you
no questions here in the chat Twitter
this time is more active than the chat I
guess you know as the some effect so
three questions and in the past shows I
mentioned that a JSF doesn't fit for
pixel-perfect applications what I meant
by that is I already implied that you
are using components like primefaces
and why implying this because as one of
the killer features of JSF that you can
use ready-to-use components and and then
it is not for pixel-perfect applications
if you're not using components you can
do whatever like so it doesn't apply the
arguments and you can use pass through
elemental attributes so it will just
work and and you can of course also use
J's library well you should be more
careful
of course the architecture will be not
like FET client where the JavaScript
client just talks via rest with the
backend is much more like the JSF
provides data binding for the forms and
it it renders the ready to use HTML with
JavaScript so don't you think that
adding a front-end frameworks such as
react or angular makes the release cycle
deliver pipe ends much more complex
compared to JSF absolutely I mean if you
if you singular there was no you would
now we have two angular CLI before this
and you developers who struggled one
week until angular was run on a Windows
machine react with web pack is easier to
use right now or easy to setup right now
but what I did this year several times i
implemented UI without any framework and
then there is no build process so if you
just follow standards there is no build
what build process in J's means you need
transpilers because of typescript two
es6 transporation but if you just use
standards there will be no transpired us
and es6 this is the JavaScript like Java
is already supported in most of the
browsers without any translation of
course if you have to address all the
then you will have to use the
transpilers but there you will only need
a subset of them and this would be not
as problematic as as using angular
because angular also precomposed the
templates and can do a lot of stuff yeah
absolutely no J's Grandin Bower and what
I just use a simple NPM script you know
to package that so there was not issue
how do you deal with the build of such
front-end application a single water
separator after the back end of fondant
so I built like and one of the project
was like an admin panel with several
satellites and at this particular case
everything was packaged in a war because
I delivered as a product almost product
to my clients and they just did they
just put it to the applications of a
network out of the box so this was this
was specific cases was like a monitoring
additional monitoring system and the
front end was built with html5 or or or
yeah html5 standard so html5 I don't
like TD the name is actually wrong so
html5 plus you know the usual suspects
he has three JavaScript and so forth so
in commercial projects we always have
had two so we had one war for the
backend and one zip for the front-end
why zip it was nginx or Apache why that
because from the experience I can tell
you that usually in enterprise projects
the UI changes in a faster pace and the
backend in one point of time the backend
is stable and you get still changes in
the UI and this is really nice to be
able to you know to to to deliver a new
version of the UI without affecting the
EDD back-end okay you suggested that
each obese is not a part of Java
yeah I said she suggested to use jeebies
what what al meant this is what I didn't
got he has just Java SE 7 projects or
not ee is SE and he would like to use
jax-ur as 2o client so how to deal with
that so why I suggested the jeebies
because how each of these behaviors
they there's an instance for each threat
and there's impossible they have two
threats which are exiting the same
instance if you if for instance in
jax-rs if you will start in the inner
threat always a new jax-rs client then
you are safe so problem is it is slow I
mean it is me it means or it is fast but
this you can measure note the difference
so if you catch the client or cache even
the target it is faster than without so
if you have many short-lived connections
you can affect you but if you are
starting multiple connections a longer
lift it shouldn't affect the performance
so what you can do you could create in
our class where in constructor of the
class you are creating in jax-rs client
ND and the end the target and then and
in the web target and there you have our
one method like perform and this method
is executed by the managed execute or
service and if you drop and if we create
the instance for each threat it will
behave like an eg be so hoops and oops
law nice name
this is nicer name I think that the
hooks in duple has has def yeah I think
he he won the award of the best name
ever I think so far zom and he asked me
he would like to he's developing a
monolithic application and he would like
to break our d functionalities into
micro services step-by-step so the first
question is I would ask you why so I am
not happy with that and why I would like
to do this it should be clear answer if
there's no answer keep the monolith
going so and now he asked me let's say
we have to je applications depend on the
same java application server this would
I would never do so if you already
decided to use micro services then you
should have two wars on two application
servers so what's the point of two micro
services in one application server if
you have two wars in one application
server you lose all the benefits they
are harder to monitor harder to scale
you know if one face you will have to
or if one crease the server in this
service not available for the other one
and if you if you redeploy the first
service you can in the whole application
server can become inconsistent it is
harder to monitor the traffic you cannot
associate as much memories that are just
you know drawbacks so regarding rest and
b2b communication what is the best
opponent opportunity to restrict calls
from outside the application context to
the monolith monolith calls a service so
I would I usually what I think what you
will have to do in micro service is to
have a token and there is a JWT token
and and assign the token to the service
and the other can decode the token so if
you have one one if you are in one
application server you can pass by
reference the token so if you have
multiple micro services you will need a
authentication service and what I
suggest to use is key cloak or one is
key cloak and the other one was open
a.m. so we are this is actually in every
show I mentioned both key cloak is
whitefly one of the JBoss projects yeah
key cloak key cloak and the other one is
open a from sort rock exactly so
okay now dem pile ask me and I was just
to reload not that there is another
question no it's the last one five hours
ago
do you think and herbs and enterprise
resource planning should be developed or
customized from existing ones like oh oh
do for example so it depends on your
domain expertise so if you are the
absolute expert in herb and you have
some productive platform like Java I
think if you really know if you if you
know fill the business cases if you if
you are the ARP expert I think you could
develop it from scratch not as a product
or or no rather than a specific solution
to your client but if you are not so
sure about you know the business logic
and you have not a great you know great
knowledge and great experience with the
domain of herb
I would rather customize one or use one
so oh do looks promising another one
which was extremely popular or Sugar CRM
CRM Sugar CRM and the Sugar CRM is was
was extremely was extremely popular a
few years ago so this also would what
you could do I think it's implemented
was PHP okay in case of choosing
development what I actually should
choose monolithic or micro services so I
always would start with monolith
actually last week I was in on my client
mission and they had micro services and
and what we did is we we just merged
them together and I say okay because
there was no reason for to fullfil for
the micro services and and what we do to
be mush them together say okay now you
know observe the code and if you have
really get a reason like you you are
able to extract parts of business logic
which is isolated then do this and
extract you know on and micro service
with lots of benefits but just creating
micro service with
the reason is it can only fail okay
something happens here so four are no
reasons it loads but I don't think and
it's see anything so there are no
questions here and there are actually no
questions in the in the Twitter I would
say we covered a lot of ground there's
almost one hour so it always takes an
hour in regard is how many questions we
have and thank you for watching I think
the next one is after Java one so I
would try to record us a short show as
always about Java one what happens there
and so I will cover a little bit Java
one and yeah see you inverse case at
Munich Airport
I think the October October workshops
are around the corner web standards most
important one react and if you need you
know would like to see a little bit of
over engineering please attend the
angular workshop so always the was
really funny and there are some
attendees which attend who attend all
the three workshops who attend all the
three workshops in the past and if I
after know showing them web standards
react and angular they couldn't believe
you know how complicated angular
actually looks like it is and yeah so
it's funny reaction okay so thank you
for watching and see you in October bye
oh there's one question besides key
clock and open em you should mention
censored as well I think what is
censored
okay token authentication probably I
thought about this but there's also
setup crazy so if I will have a now
setup
hello world setup I will I would record
a screencast so I think Manuel put here
a link so which was which got censored
but yeah okay thank you for watching and
bye
