a hex and shortly before the show I
thought 24th edition of a hex is
something special and 24th edition and
we have one additional month so what it
means we're doing this for two years
I thought this is something like a
one-year but already for two years for
it reason I wanted to drink some coffee
but I had no time to do it drinking milk
and this from the Mac and what it is is
this happy birthday Java it was five
years of Java I got the market Sun
Microsystems Germany back then and the
finest story was during the event it was
a huge event with party there was one
attendee who who said that he has
already 7 years Java experience during
the event and yeah during 5 5 years of
Java birthday event so this was a short
story so now to breaking news so what
you see here this is nothing because
this has to be uploaded so it will start
right after the show but this is coming
soon so um this is ready to go so I
wanted to to record a concise Java
micro-services workshop what happened
instead it is the longest or I don't
know whether it is the longest lecture
but it has the most episodes twice as
much as the other seventy two episodes
starts with Java 8 and ends with taka so
arm I actually had to to remove some
stuff from there so it could be even a
second part so um if I managed to create
the titles and upload this it should be
online this or next week but this is
just for you for the for the for the hex
watches keep it secret so far so um this
was that then the next question is I get
a question actually I got it
asked this today three times the TV
workshops
whether they are open sits for April yes
they are what strangers we are far more
at Indies in in the July and summer than
April they have to work on my marketing
skills and this is a nice group I think
we have around 10 people a day which is
the smallest crowd so far which is nice
so you can ask me even more questions
but at one point of time we will book a
room and then the seats will be
extremely limited because right now we
can still scale still the largest room
at the airport but if we committed to
small room then it TV seats are going to
be extremely limited so this is the
story about April April a hex as always
you can ask me questions on Twitter or
the IR Caesar can use the Vimeo RSC or
at freenode with hashtag ax and let's
see so there is use of jacinth all
threats started correctly so perfect so
no questions here no questions here and
there is one nice user who said
something so this chat is already busy
busier than Twitter of course so so we
have this now news from Java community
let's start with some drama
so first Reiser Amon one of the I would
say the absolute gurus of Java EE left
Oracle he was a Java evangelist and I
have to say he's a really straight one
so it's really really honest guy and he
truly believes in Java EE and he left
Oracle and why read his block so this is
I think he posted this and March 4th for
this really hot news and now he is
freelance as my understanding so I get
lots of questions to know do you know
any Java EE developers now I know one
reason so if you need support in your
Java EE projects ask him I think he
could have some time but he's now
extremely busy in pushing Java e8
forward so I don't even know whether
whether here's something or not but yeah
read the story interesting one
on that note another
interesting blog post is from from John
Klingon he is he was the I think product
manager of GlassFish and now he's
working for red head is also p.m. I
think even for for white flag Wi-Fi
swarm I don't know it for sure but I
know he works for for red head and and
someone wrote a blog post I get also
several links to Java is dead stop using
it and post removed them and and he
brought some interesting from his point
of view he brought the story and I got
lots of tweets about Java is dying Java
is dead and I usually ignored them
completely
why because I started in Java with 1995
and and I think the first time what I
heard Java is going to be dying dying is
doing the party because everyone said
Java is too slow and then si rules and
so next time which was Java really
supposed to die was because of Ruby on
Rails
I am I or Java I remember it exactly in
2006 and there was huge drama because
son back then supported rails even in
NetBeans and everywhere and whoever one
was there was a some you know some
excitement in the air
and and now I hear the game what's
truest after Java Java one the ORAC is
really quiet regarding to 202 Java 8
which is remarkable and and from my
point of view the go to the first topic
so it's Java dying the question is or
typo here will correct you tomorrow
so um what what would I ask myself what
should happen or what what what could
kill javi and if you looked right now at
the specs it seems to me like the huge
amount of of work is usually done by the
community if you look at the CDI there
is no the red hats and the Apaches are
working like crazy this is one of the
busiest
Pech Eclipse link or a sorry ecliptic
JPA it was red hat and and Eclipse
Lingus Oracle or eclipse ting guys and
and hibernate guys and if you look at
Java 8 security for instance there's re
on teams from Z he's like is work like
crazy and I don't know how how he can
achieve this but he cranks prototypes
and does lots of the work so the
question is what could kill Java II and
it is hard to imagine because if JCP
becomes unresponsive what what you could
do you could take over the the jsr
according to the JCP so it's the formal
process so um what could happen so what
should happen first so I think Oracle
Oracle IBM Red Hat should stop working
on Java then the community should to
just would would have to ignore it
completely and then it would in one
point of time it would die but it is a
lots of investment and they are actually
more and more projects in Java EE it
means the whole industry will have to
ignore it as well so this should happen
and even if let's say Java EE aid would
come two years later than supposed I
have to say I'm using just a subset of
Java 7 improperly Java 6 and I am
probably happy and the huge boost was
Java 8 I'm looking to Java 9 so for me
it wouldn't even die if you come two
years later but I know you know there's
less excitement that everyone is
exciting about new features but from the
enterprise perspective I don't know what
could kill Java so um but still we are
really interesting and having of course
Java 8 and I'm exciting about management
monitoring and this features so we
should push it forward but I think we as
community we should just push Java EE 8
forward regardless what Oracle IBM on
whatever company is doing because yeah
because it's our job to do this and just
writing post that Java is dying and we
should stop using it
yeah of course we could write a post but
instead of writing a post I would rather
issue some tea
in Java 8 and try to improve the world
because yeah just writing something that
is dying is a stupid right so if it's
that why write about it so um so this is
what I don't like the whole drama
so speaking of community news and
tickets so I actually created a lots of
tickets and I would like to present you
in the hope you will upload these
because I would really like to have them
in Java 8 and if there is nothing
happens what I would like to do is to
try to contribute some code involve
community you so if you like to
contribute just ping me and if nothing
happens what we can do we can take over
the spec or whatever but I would really
like to have the functionality and the
first one is there isn't transactional
annotation and we had some chat with
Linda de Michael and she was absolutely
right so my first idea was to have the
transaction attributes called
transaction attribute I think from EJB
extent with time out and she was
absolutely right she said ok but you
know this is an old old notation do we
introduce something new you have X
transactional we could extend that so
and this is actually a good point so
what I did I raised the issue for it for
the spec at 25th of February and I would
really like to have the transactional
annotation to be extended with with time
out and there are already some some some
comments so read them and if you like
votes for it this would be really nice
write a post about this and escalate the
issue this would be really nice so this
is what I would like to have then what
you will get we could specify per method
the transaction timeout right now is not
possible with with standard features and
you assumably know me I really like
standard features I don't like to bother
with vendor specific stuff ok then the
next one is from from Jax res and what I
would like to have is programmatic
resource discovery so something like
metadata API in jax-rs that I go to the
JAXA
service and say hey give me all
resources right now we would have to use
CDI and extensions and whatever but the
the container already knows what is
deployed so it should be really easy why
I would like to do this because then
it's fairly easy to implement in a
registry or plugin mechanism I don't
need it in all my projects but sometimes
really really handy to have it and
Jersey has it already a thing is called
model maker or something so it's already
available Jersey and model maker what
was it model something so um in Jersey
so this was the eg be spec this was my
first issue it is resolved because we
move it to the to the other one the next
one I really would like to to have
upvoted and it is max pool size so I
would like to extend the EJB with
standard max pool size annotation why
that because it has really convenient
way to implement throttling because the
semantics as follows
there can be never more than one thread
per egb so if we restrict the amount of
instances so we can you restrict also
the amount of parallel threads and this
is really convenient pet boundary so it
really fits my boundary control entity
model and yeah this is this what would I
propose and or optionally what we could
do in CDI we could introduce in CDI
pooled annotation and then we could kill
eg B's basically because if it's put and
monitored we don't need each abyss
anymore so one of so either we extend
each abyss or which extent CDI but but
but pooling is not only good for
performance and there's another
interesting part there there were some
some performance to who's another drama
in the internet I I published the course
effective Java EE and what I did then I
compared the performance just as
introduction of GM h Java how it's
called performance harness and micro
benchmark harness and so I
I showed how to use it and for this
purpose I see d-ind GB performance and
what what happened they turn out that eg
bees are faster than CDI and someone in
the Internet
actually interviewed not someone this
was I think father blog let's see this
was not this one there also an interview
with where is it this is the interview
and the the Pavel exactly and he brought
a and and benchmark are really nice one
and this and github open-source and
compared Ichi B's we see there in spring
and and what happened was that it should
be one one D performance benchmark why
I'm laughing because because I know some
projects who who with huge effort they
get rid of each abyss because of
performance and they created their own
framework who chose a lot slower than
jeebies this is somehow funny for me
okay was he this was I think exactly
this was the course effective Java EE
but somewhere here somewhere here is he
is his benchmark is this one no so read
the interview RIA mazing one is to
interview about running Java on on
mainframes and then about the
performance ok so we covered that so the
next is what I would like to have is
inject arrest is another issue I would
like to have standardized connection
timeout and andreat timeout so right now
it is it's it's not standardized so you
will have to use the jersey or arrest
easy properties but I need this all that
all the time because if two wars have to
communicate with each other I use jax-rs
and I have to specify it over and over
again what I usually use I usually
strings but this isn't really messy and
I think connection timeout it was really
easy or how it's called low-hanging
fruit to standardize this so please vote
for this so I would expect after the
show around 100 votes here okay so and
the last one and the others are older
it's what I would like to have is an and
possibility to pass to the jax-rs client
and executive service and what we could
do then is you could for instance past
and managed executive service from
application server or even porcupine and
what do you get then is yeah you get
many threats used by a jax-rs client and
you could restrict the amount of
parallel behavior using standard
facility like diminished executive
service okay
there's all another great news I was at
Jay focus and at Jay focus I meant I met
Greg luck from Jay cash and we have a
conversation and what happens now is
there will be a integration between Jay
cash and Java 8 and so they will working
on this and we are also working on a
prototype I will post a blog post about
this so there are several people already
working and also Arian contributed and
Johann Foss and we have some ideas so
there would be a Jay cash integrated in
Java 8 ok so and what also happened in
Jay focus and deliver the talk I think
Java istic way of coding and what I
showed is nothing new to you is just you
know how to implement Java EE apps and I
also played a little bit with docker and
showed why docker fits perfectly with
Java so if you are interested check out
the their worse where is it the talk
here the Java stick way of coding from
Jay focus fun enough I got the strangest
screenshot ever here with Google I don't
know why but all others are reasonable
but this one is strange ok so if you're
interesting in java hacking and docker
look at the j focus talk and also funny
story to lose the last talk and i
actually officially had 45 minutes but
and after my talk there was a party
because j focus I think was 10 years old
and the attendees have so many questions
that my talk was half hour long and then
actually supposed and we have great
chats chat afterwards so thank you if
you attend the Jay focus thank you for
the questions and it was really fun to
talk with you and you know who cares
about parties if you can have Javy okay
so I think enough Java 8 News so there
are some some some issues in MVC but now
issues community has some ideas what to
extend this MVC but there is a movement
but from Oracle seems like Oracle switch
the priorities and let's see what
happens and thankfully we have JCP so
and JCP is supposed to be transparent so
let's see how it works out so it was the
longest introduction to a hex but we are
already in the new section I would just
check out the the chat so I rethink
everything fine no questions in the
Twitter's no questions in the chat as
trimming is working perfect so now let's
start with the very first question and
the and the very very first question is
going to be got it so we covered this
dying part and I got another one and it
fits also nice is cross component
business transaction and BCE so I would
like to to answer it first and the
following so worse so as I understood
the questions the following as I
probably know what I did do I often
reduce the idea from IVA Jacobsen
boundary control entity and you have one
component and this component does
something hopefully business-related and
this component does something else and
the question is ok
it is fine if a one transaction remains
in the component but what happens if the
transaction spans multiple components so
how to implement this should we move
everything to one component and the
answer is simple it was never meant that
way so how it was meant is the following
so what he can absolutely do you can
have here one component let's say with
boundary and control and here you can
have other components they can have
boundary control entity or they just
could have just controls and entities so
it really depends whether they are
internal or external components and then
what you can absolutely do this boundary
could talk to this one this could talk
to this one or I mean to this one could
talk to this one and what shouldn't do
you shouldn't talk to do or to another
boundary but it could but it's not that
nice so to answer the question if you
have parallel components they can
absolutely communicate with each other
and because the components are always
local there's no remote communication
between them you can use injection
boundary control entity and boundary
controller entity and they can freely
communicate with each other without any
problems so what it actually means this
quantico this and this could call even
this so you can have one transaction
starting here and spanning this
components and if they will all talk to
the same database you get absolute
transactional behavior if they talk to
multiple databases then you will get XA
and other problems but from the
transactional perspective will still
work so I hope the first question is
answered so I'm nice no questions in a
chat no questions in in Twitter so next
one now quick web jars so your opinion
about web jars and web jars is actually
nice I don't know what they know it is a
project from it is like it is a bin to
end
and what it is you can you can access
via may even major a JavaScript project
there bandulus maven and of course we
can deploy it to to to worse and and
delivers from worse and my opinion about
this so I'm mixed feelings of course so
if you if you using just F on whatever
you could or MVC you can absolutely you
could absolutely serve it from your war
but if you what we sometimes do we point
to see the ends and so what it means the
these scripts do not even exist in our
war then of course we don't need it so
um so what it means it is really nice
idea for for I would say enterprise
projects where you don't need to see the
end so you can just put the jars and and
load them this is not a lots of risk
involved because in verse case you can
still build your own jar with the
JavaScript contents and this is somehow
compatible with JSF I think components
you you are always able to load
resources from jerison JSF and this fits
that perfectly so um I like the idea but
there's not a general best practice
where you should use web chars for
everything but it's a really interesting
idea and look at this so um if you need
and you can say use JVM based build
tools maven cradle you done all your
client-side dependencies so so somehow
backwards right so we have JavaScript
and now we get maven again to to fetch
JavaScript but maven is actually great
dependency residency resolution
mechanism so you can just leverage that
okay perfect
so this world I don't know simple code
and your opinion about versioning in
rest based on content negotiation so and
this is also nice idea so what you can
absolutely do you can you can add the
version number to the mimetype or to
produce this for instance and then you
can have multiple methods with different
different producers and the framework
will pick the right version for you so
um this is nice from respect
but in my eyes is really ugly from Java
perspective because what you would
properly would like to have is to
isolation between classes from version
two three and classes from version three
so and what I saw already in production
which was really ugly
they used version names as package names
and this is this is a head on earth
because you get classes with the same
names in different packages with
different names and if you develop the
application you will always have closely
watched the DD package structure not to
confuse classes so um so from restful
perspective nice idea from Java
perspective not that good I would say
except you know you have you don't have
to to switch between classes or you have
different mechanism wire you can
switching using for instance command
path and qualifies or whatever two
different sets of chars for instance
okay let's see no questions so what's
wrong with you two years with of a hex
and I not a single question
so ask at least how is the weather in
Munich or something like this so next
one I mentioned in the year 2010 so it's
crazy six years ago now what I wrote is
it's actually related to my 2d 2d 2d
task and that I'm using the max pool
size for throttling and there is a there
is a back in glasses payara which
prohibits that and the question is what
about what cal idea would like to have
this is exactly building of some
mutation number of concurrent requests
is five it is exactly what we had in our
projects so how to deal with that and
for this reason look at I just go to the
right github repository and look at
porcupine and what porcupine is you can
specify threats at runtime so where is
the configuration there's not the
configuration this is the monitoring
like yeah you can say max pool size five
and if you are using this with for
instance ax or Esther we never
more than five power requests regardless
whether you're using a GBC di or
whatever in the background so and this
porcupine is used as a bulkheads pattern
but it's also perfectly capable of
throttling so look at this and this is
framework but I think there's 10k or
something is really 16 case and this is
like two classes and a view on rotations
so there's not a big deal you can also
just copy the code so it's not even
worth of including the framework here
okay so I hope question answered product
yeah it would be great if fire would fix
the idea of course so um this is also a
recurring question mcphobe
its plugin mechanism so uh do you think
is it feasible using JT to implement a
runtime plugin mechanism system so what
it means is something I call deployment
and I would say I think it is a terrible
idea in general I don't even don't even
think is it's a good idea to do it
outside Java EE just with plain Java why
because it is really hard in Java
to UM unload classes so I mean there is
no no efficient way of doing this you
can just get rid of all references and
hope that the class load is going to be
connect garbage collected with all the
classes so what I would do rather than
is implement like something like load
balancer for instance on docker to be
the best one and kill the old version
and you and start the new one I think is
called blue-green deployment so this
would be the best one and this is also a
safe one and we did it in H a systems
and highly available systems highly
critical systems and it worked perfectly
and it's all so simple and what you get
for free then is rolling update so you
can replace even Java at runtime then
exactly so I'm using instance for hooks
and go to the green book or or to the
green book examples so if you go to ken
i com
and there is the book and there should
be a plugin sample so look at the source
code so it don't have necessarily by the
book the source code plugins so a look
at the plugins example and you will get
it so this would this would be the idea
okay and OSGi yeah I would say you could
use it but all I all major application
servers use OSGi anyway so you already
have it so I'm class features which I
based and and and and and then the word
for as well so I don't think oh she I
will solve the problem instance is also
runtime injection but you cannot at
runtime in in replace classes so and I
got a Twitter question
perfect how would you name presentation
bins for views in subfolders like full
person so I need the I name the beans as
the classes so I wouldn't I would name
it person or yeah just person if you
have of course a person entity the same
then person view or present presenter
this is what I did for instance in the
afterburner so it has nothing do with
JSF but in Java fix so I would just
start but I think it is a good idea to
name it exactly the same way as the as
the XHTML what he is saying of course he
has two subfolders and of course the
person is then no more unique then I
would call it full person and bar person
for instance if if there's some our
business name okay so uh would you
rather move from GlassFish three to
payara or two i try and i and why a good
question so the answer is I would move
from glasses three always to payara
why because payara is patch GlassFish
and there is actually no migration
involved and from
I would also if you if you would ask me
the question should I move from whitefly
8 to 10 or to payara
I would answer always go to from white
try to isolate because there is nothing
to migrate so if you can stick with
payara if you not just go to white fire
it's not a big deal it will do it just
already did it so we might migrate it
some projects from from from GlassFish
to white fly it was far easier than then
originally assumed but if you if you
have the choice
stick with PI R and PI as great great
support and yeah can you point out some
good websites to learn about Bluegreen
deployment with taka I think it is
already implemented so if you just go to
docker compose and and user-defined
networks or wait until I I released a
course and there's not nothing specific
in Bluegreen deployment but I use at
runtime I just connect and disconnect
the host and if it's it's possible at
runtime so you get your blue Bluegreen
deployment and most frameworks like for
instance openshift
also do this but yeah with docker is
really not a problem just check out
user-defined networks in dhaka it's
really simple and the command should be
like I think we're a second talk Network
create a hex and then dock network
connect a hex and container name and
then all the other all the other
container instances will be able to ping
the container name and on that note just
for you it's not announced yet there's
another interesting framework in what I
created another class frame but you
cannot call it framework we needed other
name because in Java you whatever I
created for Java age is reposed as usual
e7k one class two classes because
everything is there
it's called service link and the origin
name was Automator
and you won't you won't believe me where
I got the idea for the name some
of you make out the ideas okay probably
is a little bit too drastic so I removed
renamed that afterwards to to service
link but what it actually does it works
particularly well with toca you can
inject if the legacy links they are
static or the dynamic links what I told
you about
and then what's Pincus is defined by
Daka
and really did really depends which
docking patina is used so and then web
target is injected and then you can use
your your link so this is the service
link check it out that will announce it
next week or in two weeks if I have some
time so thank you for the questions so
let's see perfect so you should be happy
Alexander should be also happy and now
move on so we have answered this one
then I hope it's not greedy if I asked
the question absolutely not ask me as
many questions you like but don't write
me emails because answering a meal email
I actually had to answer I say my
business email and it took me 25 minutes
to to know explain I think which is read
it's not possible just to deal with
amezo so we want to use a Google based
DSL in Java project so and and he asked
me okay is it
groovy parses at run time and access
defy system and there are Java
restriction is it ok or not so if you
check out an ancient project of me it
was called green fire let's see what I
find it perfect so as you probably see
it's a green fire project I hacked a
heating control and it was one of the
first I think Java 5 projects and I use
groovy for the for the orchestration so
for the algorithms exactly what you did
right now I did when was it eight years
ago and it worked perfectly so the Java
EE restrictions are our are to protect
us and
why because if you move for instance
Java e to the docker container pack
Siddhant and there's also you notice
this you can rely on the file system
because if you Merle so it could
disappear its transient or if you move
Java e to the cloud is want also work so
um but I use that so I use exactly what
you did just look at the green fire you
should still find the sources but they
are ancient so yeah 2008 so on a newer
source code this lecture was actually in
commercial project and it was called n
hydrator so what I did the n hydrator is
like transformation pipeline has nothing
to do with Java EE it's just set of Java
interfaces but the interesting part
these interfaces can be implemented with
NASA phone JavaScript and everything is
replaceable so everything is loaded at
startup and everything can be replaced
and it's actually used a lot for
transformation pipelines so take a look
at this and this is perfectly valid of
course you don't have to read the
scripts from from defy system you could
also load the scripts as class get the
resource a stream for instance okay I
hope I hope you are happy with that so
I'm or jje application was in advil
environment where multi-and broadcasts
are forbidden so I assume something in
cloud-like environment so um can you
recommend any cache implementation that
can be used in such environment I think
everything works so this infinite span
is based on J groups and in Jake groups
you can configure you know IP addresses
or broadcast or multicast the same is
true for hazel caste so you can either
configure the the IP addresses or or use
UDP or broadcast and the application
server soon should not matter because
the cache implementation is also a Java
standard anyway and by the way web
celebrity profile is really nice
application server so if you have a
double LP ya enjoy it there was an
interview with Brazil removing a blot
and there was some question from
or the interview we said okay they
remove some blood by killing dowas which
is of course possible and the this
question was answered by the by the
author it was hell eaten so he answered
a question so just read through it
how could just paste it to the chat and
so we'll paste it to here and to the
other chat and yeah this is answered and
what he said is what he used this the
entities had had domain logics of
behavior and he injected the entity
manager using thread-local and they were
able to access that and then describe
this in in the green book and it seems
like it works well in his project so
this was the answer so and and what is
what it implies is that he has a
significant amount of business logic
within the entities this is not a common
best practice we do it I don't know if
three percent of all my project so it's
not like you know everywhere we we have
fat entities usually we just have in the
boundary injected entity managers in the
anti entities are still thin and usual a
mix of DTO and entity so perfect so this
is good one what is the best approach to
generate demo scenarios so demos are the
best choice quiz the product or clients
and it seems like he needs many entities
which are mapped to tables and my
question is probably something wrong
with t design then because i mean what
you would like to achieve right if there
is a demo is from scratch then it looks
like you know prototype then I would
just start hacking and and the tables
are created for me it's not a big deal
but it looks like his demos more
specific one like domain-specific demos
like they have a framework and they
would like
to a variation of the framework per
client - to showcase a specific use case
and in this particular case probably
having typesafe entities is not a great
idea so what you should probably look
like is to redesign the tables and and
and then just think you know are we
interested in something like let's say
customer or more like paragraph or table
or whatever comes up in the demo so
sometimes this is typical mistake in
reports for instance in reports you are
not really interested in customers on
addresses or invoices you are more
interested in the data behind in the
table so I think this is not the right
abstraction if you have to regenerate
all the data layer if something minor
changes I would question do you need
typesafe entities and and at the end I
would even question does the database
have to be relational but usually a
relational database are really
convenient you get all the support so
but yeah and the Java 7 batch processing
so if you would like to have Java 7
batch processing just look at the n
hydrator actually am a kind of my hired
me to help them with java Bechet and
then we implemented the n hydrator which
is not Java EE at all it's just plain
Java 8 without any external dependencies
and it's I used actually a lot and it
could already several stars which I
would never think about it gets so
popular it's just a small utility yeah
I'm not sure whether the question is
properly answered by hope so so Victor I
know him so I don't know what I am know
him in person but from Twitter and from
from lead for the questions as a friend
of the show so I want to know in an ear
warren jar can i use a jars in the CDI
features you should be able to and I
know it is used but I know us there are
some problems the problem is I don't use
ear since Java 6 I think 2009 so 7 years
since the inception of of Java is 6
everything is war and I let's see
what was it war is the new year exactly
so I wrote it in 2009 so and I think
since then I never used ears again so I
have to say I have no idea whether it
works or not what I only know that there
is some problems between dependency
injection between war and jars or
something like this but within the jar
it should actually work
I would I would suggest the following
create a prototype this is what I always
do you know two classes see how it works
so now in 2006 in developing putlitz is
considered in or should we go JavaScript
frameworks + web services this is really
dangerous to ask such questions me
because so I have a specific relation to
portlets and and I have to say I never
saw the killer use case for portlets in
my projects why not why not the dig
portals and portlets were hugely popular
back then a few years ago or probably
even even are and the portals ever were
bought but none of the features were
used it's like everyone wanted to have
putlitz but not know no features were
used
you know inter portlet communication was
being used and in one project that just
generated the menu with huge overhead or
do you mean minimize maximize you know
the the window arrangement nothing was
used so I think I would in invest more
in JavaScript for sure and web services
means hopefully not soap rest so and I
have to admit since I don't know how
long but at least five to at least five
years I have no contact to soap so on
legacy system sometimes we generate once
you know the these tops but we do not
omit soap anymore okay
let's see no questions here also no
questions here very good next one
so um someone versus the Narada so us
I've wrote an article how to install
JDBC driver on whitefly because I had to
do it in a project and he asked me about
how to use you CP JDBC pull data source
and I never did it and I I thought about
this why I would like to do this because
JBoss pulls the connections all ready
for you so this is actually DD factory
so what would be the idea behind this
yeah I don't get it I don't get it I
have not the killer use case for this
what what what the purpose should be and
I would try that as I tried with the
with the public and replace something
but I will ask the question in ER see in
Wi-Fi er er see I never had a use case
so um and and for me right now it would
be too time intensive to try to
reproduce this because I don't have
Oracle running on my machine so I
couldn't test it even know so sorry for
this but if someone from community knows
please help the Narada J Lee ACOs ask me
let's say we have a customer rotation
monetization 10 and he would like to
change it to the runtime so how to do
this and thankfully it's really accident
there's another github project with a
thing is really one class and one on
rotation right now and this project is
very new also it it comes in within the
micro services workshop and this is
called marina so on what marina is is
the is the client from headlands and now
we know Marina headlands now you know
where I got the idea was Java one two
years ago and what Headlands is
Headlands github hadn't been so what
Headlands is is the rest from that for
GSR 107 cache I using on my server and
there's a REST API where it can push and
pull data from J cache and I use hazel
Cass for this I get nice clustering and
and marina is able to access that
remotely so and what you can do then is
the following I can say at inject cache
entry from headlands of course if it's
linked by Daka it is resolved at runtime
port 8080 cache configuration key
message and then you get dynamic
resolution of whatever you would like
from the cache and this is a remote call
and yeah this is what you could do
similarly if you would like to have more
availability there should be JC - it's a
similar one the main differences is the
following so you can inject the strings
and they're also fetched from the cache
but in this this time the crash is local
so if you're using hazel Cass the cache
is replicated so if the configuration
server goes down this would still work
and in this case if the configuration
server goes down with marina case it
won't work anymore so they are the
choices but in both cases the
implementation is trivial so you don't
have to use either of them because I
will just show you it is just very
trivial that's most of so there are just
two this is the annotation and the
configurator is the single class and it
produces it produces a string and longer
and so forth but this is the DD main
code so the main the main source code is
you know TM obtaining T the conventions
from the from the annotations and if you
would replace this with the data base or
property file so you are set so you
could do whatever like and that actually
did it I think I implemented here
somewhere
a properties fetcher or something
properties loader
somewhere there was an example and it
loaded the properties preloaded the
properties at runtime yes here if you
would read the properties here from a
database you would get exactly what you
asked for
so I hope the question is answered okay
so SOA service-oriented architecture by
the way how to kill a saw a project 8
year 8 years old
post what I did back then as I asked
questions my clients and then my project
get cancelled or I was cancelled and as
some project which was some questions
which were not very convenient and so so
if I see so SOA I always remember the
time but we have many modules counter
reagent product division and he would
like to reuse this sure he would like to
reuse the modules and the question is
how to do this because if you have a
central so a service or rest service I
would implement of course as rest then
there is a runtime penalty and and of
course but it is in micro services what
you can always do it can just duplicate
a code so as actually considered this
practice because if teams have to act
independently the code has to be
duplicated anyway so what and there's
also a pattern called bounded context so
what it means is in the micro services
architecture you would assume that a
country or region in one module is
dependent from region in another module
for instance one region one module could
be interested in the GPS GPS coordinates
or longitude and latitude and the other
other micro service could be interested
more in population and and therefore the
region in one micro service would have
population attribute and the other one
would have longitudinal attitude and
color to display it on the map so this
is the main idea
so I mean everything is local the
performance is usually surprisingly fast
but what I would do just implement you
know the house called minimal Viable
Product MVP and that's it stress test it
and and see whether the performance is
good enough or not and I'm not that
paranoid about reuse it usually rarely
happens
so um if you I would just copy the
counter region across micro-services see
whether there is some common core
behavior or common core state if it is
the question is is it worth to
extracting that's how much time you will
save and the other question is what will
happen if you get it application how
likely it is that the country will
change frequently and all will affect
all modules so this is these are the
questions to ask okay let's see so no
questions here no questions in the chat
very good
so so we are moving faster and faster
what is your opinion about streams in
versus the old connect collections and I
actually really like streams and if you
go to the end hydrator project it was
somewhere here yeah so everything here
is streams so and it works perfectly so
I have to say I really enjoyed that and
without streams the the whole project
will be pointless it would be so ugly to
implement that I think no one would use
it so um if you have the chance look at
lambda streams and the functional
features from Java with nice IDE support
NetBeans IntelliJ for instance you get
is really enjoyable really productive
but don't try to be no purely functional
because you can so adjust use streams if
appropriate and you will enjoy it is
what I can promise you why I think I
attended it was three or four years ago
so before of course Java it was released
at JavaOne talk about lambdas and this
was teased the syntax was not even set I
think they they wanted to use the
hashtag not the naughty arrow and and I
look at this intersect I will never use
it I have no idea what they are
what they're doing what they were
talking about and this really looks
strange but then Java 8
came out and I had to use it in a
project and I enjoyed from day two so on
what I can tell you just create a small
project like you know DVD or Movie
Database and try to play with it and you
would really enjoy it so and and I would
give you step further I think with with
Java 8 the others alternative jvm
languages lost they appeal a little bit
for Java it is just good enough ok so
another question question about apps our
class interfaces never adequately
answered in view of PC of course I
always say interface and abstract
classes are not needed if you see them
try to remove them if you have a
business component that have dependency
how do you handle that if you have a
business component and this is
dependency to another component just
inject the class and what is the
interface all public methods are the
interface so no kidding what would my
personal opinion mean Wireless and I'm
more and more convinced about this as
the following in Java EE interfaces are
not needed unless you get to
implementation of the interface abstract
classes should be avoided unless there
is a real need to you find something
really great too abstract and I would
always do it afterwards so first write
concrete classes look at the classes
over and over again and then then if you
learn more about business logic then
extract it to after classes and this is
the reason why I never mentioned them
because in my eyes abstract classes and
interfaces should not be used from the
beginning in Java a project you can
introduce them afterwards and an
interface I'm more explicit if I see
interfaces in Java EE I would expect a
qualifier and command pattern or sorry
strategy pattern or command but usually
strategy pattern so next question can I
inject on a GB in trajectories
interceptor and filter of course if if
so how can I achieve this so on that
note I have to show you another another
one one class framework is even pro cap
and is there
this pie and this pie part of Porcupine
just injects the monitoring data into
HTTP headers if you would like to see it
live check out the micro services
workshop but what I did here I injected
an instance of statistics and and it
works on all servers other out of the
box and you could inject if you if this
works you could inject CDI beans and eg
bees are cgi-bin so it should work in
verse case if it doesn't on your server
because because of back or I don't know
what that is even specified but it
always worked for me then you could
implement a lookup and this will work so
I'm Jenny I look up or pin locator
lookup but this works in white fine this
works in in payara because I used this
in projects ok Oh question from the chat
this is nice Oh Adam have you used GWT
in je context what do you think
don't ask me please about GWT I have to
say I really don't like it and it
reminds me on the old X table days where
you know each change in code took I
don't know 20 seconds and GWT something
like this so I would use yeah it seems
like I still I still meet developers who
are really excited about GWT but they
are in absolute minority most GWT
developers are cursing about GWT this is
what what I can tell you and just go to
to Stack Overflow and search for GWT
problem so if possible I think I would
prefer none now I would prefer rest with
JavaScript frameworks which one longer
discussion angular 2 so if the project
is older you look at angular 2 and to
the others to the other listeners right
to chat whether you love or hate
GWT I'm really reinter stood what what
is the what is your
opinion about GWT I have to say I don't
see the point right now if look at
Vardhan this is a Vardhan it uses GWT
under the hood
sorry Vardhan it uses GWT arm or quit
after under the hood but it's a nice
company with support and you don't have
to compile you know the components over
and over again so um yeah my personal
opinion or is this hard for me to
identify a killer use case for GWT this
is what I can tell you so um and in ACMA
script 2004 2015 this is Xmas crip six
is the new JavaScript the JavaScript
will look like Java anyway so I think it
will be easier and easier for Java
developers to use JavaScript if the
tooling settles a little bit right now
with Babel and everything else a little
bit crazy but it gets better so the next
question I really cannot answer gee
Buland is using payara
and he gets soap exception input so I
have to say I have no experience with
soap
I just in a recent workshop someone
asked me you know to help them with soap
and client and we spend two hours two
hours and we could more and more code
generated and at the end I think even it
worked but it was like you know hell on
earth and the whole internet was
downloaded to do to involve one method
and I cannot answer this but what I
would do is the following
go to a payara fish so if you have money
ask them they will help you so this is
the root and nice guys so by support but
if you don't have money then go to here
and ask please
ask the question again and say greetings
from a hex and an amine probably it will
could help so go here and do this and
then that you should get the least an
answer so um
ok perfect so
Stein Zach says Java 7 has a lot of
feature supporting container based
security but there isn't much if you
want to manage security directly in your
application are managing I mean HTTP
basic auth is implemented out-of-the-box
why is that yeah because you're not
specified and this is the reason why we
have let's say Java 8 and what I did is
a little bit outdated there should be a
project
oh it's security sec spike so the re on
Tim's created build a lots of prototypes
with Omni faces security and to
understand this early this year I
created a small to-do app with with the
authentication and authorization with
basic authentication and we made it work
and Ariane has a lots of I cannot find
it right now of examples and github
Arion teams so if you go
Timms I think security get up let's see
whether we will find him sorry I just
misspelled yes perfect so this is the
incredibly and there are Java 7 examples
no Java so makes I was not that it was
somewhere there are lots of examples and
he had implemented here this security
spec where he contributed but he had
lots of just peek and an authentication
examples and just follow him ping him
and probably this video the Omni face
organization how many persistence
there's only security just yeah just
watch this and in Java 8 is going to be
solved and in Java 7 it was not
addressed so this is Det truth but the
HTTP basic authentication comes out of
the box
always so managing is a different story
so managing means you would like to now
create principles and manage passwords
and for this I would look at we headed
the last time I think key cloak key
cloak and from from white fly or open am
from arts called for truck exactly so
they will manage this for you because
you know managing means you need
password expiration and min length of
passwords and password have to contain
you know strange characters so I think
we cannot cherish it shouldn't manage
this because I mean how to standardize
that right oh so architectural questions
component based UI JSF tapestry plane
how to decide which one front-end
building strategy to use in the new
project a good one this is what I can
answer right away how do you decide this
you have to show the end user the
components and the end users will have
absolutely committed the components and
there should be no project specific
extension otherwise you will effectively
for octave framework particularly what I
saw no J's if JSF prime faces were fork
because they were not happy with the
components and was happy they wanted to
change the behavior of the components
really bad idea
so this is you know take it or leave it
but not change it this would be my
approach to component based frameworks
how you structure uploaded files in your
projects
I mean this very specific question
dedicated fire management system simple
folder structure storing blob in DB no I
wouldn't store blob in DB but it will
depends which DB it is right if this is
Cassandra I will store it Oracle or
Oracle sequel databases and usually not
that good simple folder structure might
might work actually well so why not but
if there are also content management
system of
frameworks which do it right away out of
the box so it really depends on on your
requirement so what I could did once I
created a connector which accesses files
in in transactional way
so who's also specific requirement and
then I created this example afterwards
and it stores it in in in folder
structure so cache frameworks what is my
opinion about cache frameworks don't use
them until you have the urgent need to
use them and what I would do first is to
deliver or to test without caching then
mother matter measure whether the
performance is good enough if it isn't
and the you have jax-rs jax-rs
api then i would check out reverse
proxies like for instance varnish or
squid and if if this is not enough or or
you cannot use this then I would look
something like hazel castle and finish
paint for instance have you ever is no
secret the base my project yes
definitely need to use no sequel
database yeah definitely if for instance
you you look at the table and you get a
lot of key value pairs in your table
because the your entities are are
changing frequently it was we get a
related questions right now and with no
secure databases what's what's
advantages new object can have more
attributes than the older one and what
it basically means is you don't have to
alter the schemas and try enough the
main reason why we got no sequel
database in project is because the alter
table in relational database was too so
so slow then we couldn't implement
continuous deployment because the
database was too big so the main driver
was actually the performance of alter
table and look at your relational table
if you ever have to work with key value
pairs anyway I think no sequel might be
beneficial
so if I would like to to notify users
about something real time what would I
use a WebSockets of course first and all
applications have implement WebSocket so
to do my first choice we use atmosphere
in the past because application servers
were not capable of have long polling
with our efficient long polling with
jax-rs
so we use atmosphere framework for this
and atmospheres was actually based on on
grizzly and GlassFish v2 or v3
so um as I would use web I would start
with web sockets our RabbitMQ could be
interesting and and Ajax is a workaround
because if what circles are not
unsupported then I would use long
polling or comet I know you don't work I
know you don't work with spring I mean
no one asked me to work with Springs or
um I really have to say it's like yeah I
just don't use it because there is no
need so I just don't see spring in my
projects about spring versus Java stack
so what I can tell you so um they are
very similar so you can get but you
shouldn't mix them so you can just
deploy spring on jetty and did you
similar to Java so when you are starting
a new project how to design go with
plain Java stack or with spring yeah
look on your client do they have
application server already in place and
use Java if there is if your team is no
just comprising spring fanboys just use
spring so you shouldn't convince the
it's really hard to convince spring on
not now it's easier but a few years ago
it would be impossible to convince
spring guys to use Java meanwhile there
are so similar that a reasonable spring
guy will probably use Java without any
problems
so um I wouldn't force anything so um
and in my project it looks like we have
already java application service
everywhere so it would be you know
unreasonable to introduce spring which
run on application service because you
get to know two frame versus you are two
similar to each other
so a session exploration in GSF so
there's a nice way and I think
primefaces comes with expirations I
think little what as an in primefaces
expiration not session expires does how
is called inactivity inactivity and
there is a nice component idle monitor
exactly
I had it recently and this if I do not
think for five seconds which is a long
time during a live show you see what are
you doing over there
so no activity so what do you should do
the sessions should expire on the server
but you could detect it on the client
and just do something with it you're
good you get an AJAX event which can
could invalidate the session or redirect
it somewhere and there are enough
examples actually you could use filter
to redirect if the session is expired
and if you get exceptions on our session
expiration there can be also rerouted to
a login page using the web.xml diploma
descriptor okay so Oh Twitter are you
using Delta specs in Java 7 project yes
I use Tomas can stick ask me I use Delta
spike is are using Delta spike a lot for
testing first if you look at the
examples even I think this JC to and and
the other one sex pack I think I use
Delta spike for testing because it's
easier to setup than our Killian so it's
really transparent it's not as as
powerful as a client what you cannot do
is Delta spike you cannot now you have
to look check out the the how it's
called Java testing workshop so I use
Delta spike so on but I don't use Delta
spike in production because there is no
need to use it there's a similar
discussion like with
drink so yes if I will need to know the
CD urgent the urgent the the urgent need
or something is lacking I would use
absolutely data spike but right now I
see the killer feature is testing just
integration testing for specific
purposes like technical libraries just
look at my github account but not in
production oh I missed a question from
the chat James Gosling left Java company
yeah but I don't think he left Java
company so James Gosling is absolutely
working with Java right now and is and
is creating robots which looks like soft
surfboards so Android Johnson is working
with Scala right now okay so I think
yeah all questions answered I hope yes
someone suggest me marionette Jess so
thank you for watching and thank you for
asking me for two years
Java EE related questions crazy really
crazy how short two years actually are
and I'm curious how long we will talk
about Java EE related questions here and
what I can tell you we get more and more
life attendees so the last time they
were way over 100 and afterwards that of
course a few thousand views on YouTube
so this time I will submit this the show
later because I will start with
uploading the micro services workshop
and yeah thank you for watching and see
you at work shops in Munich so come to
inner April or in summer and ask me at
but then prepare questions because the
whole workshop is just based on
questions so I have a view slides and
IDE I'm just waiting for questions and
hacking with you whatever you like
so thank you for watching and see you
soon
