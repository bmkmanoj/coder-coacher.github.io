would like to show you how to access
from Java EE application servers Nando
karai's resources like for instance
Nando karai's databases and usually what
you will have to do you are you will
have to specify an Orion this time I'm
just using HTTP as a example but in the
case of JDBC 2 is going to be a JDBC URI
and what I have here there is just a non
existing house called Nana and I would
like to resolve the house depending on
stage for instance or the real-world
example would be in the test stage I
would access the test database and
integration stage the integration
database so um so now I could access
whatever like so uh Nano and what I also
did I docker eyes the app with with the
this time it will run on payara so I
will add the docker eyes to the
deployment there and it will start the
image so now let's try something so what
I would like to do is I would like to
resolve the Nano with Google so in order
to do this I will ping Google first so
obviously Google doesn't run in my in my
docker container and this is an nice IP
address I will pick that and first I
would have to build the app with - team
yeah let's start with maven first so
maven clean install package would be
sufficient and then dark-hair built -
tee-hanks
daughter iced and dutch so now i have a
an image for a java image which can be
started and now let's start it so i
would like to start it with docker run -
DD touch mode - p will expose the port
8080 and then say - ad host and i would
like to resolve the house Nano with IP
address from google and i would like to
use the name doc Erised tour Christ and
launch the container Eric Stoecker
arised
so it looks good and now I should be
able to access via curl the host and
this should be localhost 8080 and docker
eyes this name of the app resources is
the default and micro SD path let's see
micro is the path the resources
resources and da Christ is the app name
so let's try that and we received an and
an answer from Google so of course we
could launch it differently so if I
specify another IP address we could in
in integration stage you know X is
Google and in production Bing or or
whatever so um this is actually very
useful if you have to deal with you know
hosts mainframes or databases which are
not authorized in a doctor s environment
you would rather use user-defined
networks so if you're interested just
check out the micro services course and
yeah thank you for watching see you at
upcoming conferences upcoming hacks in
mini get part Java on all or other
conferences Java user group talks or
whatever so enjoy Java and pi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
