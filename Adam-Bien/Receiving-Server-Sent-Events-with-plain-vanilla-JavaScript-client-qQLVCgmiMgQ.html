would like to show you how to receive
service and events with nothing but
html5 standards using the browser api's
so we have here a the simplest possible
center of service and events and this is
in java 8 app just comprising one class
and what it does it sends every two
seconds
the the current time and so what we can
do so we need first the order of that
and this is localhost 8080 s were the
class which we five runs the server and
then comes as e is the project name then
resources because we have here the
resources or e and then what we get is
the beats or E or beats path so what I
we need to do is to curl it with minus I
and localhost:8080 then SS e-resources
and then beats so and what happens is we
get the data every two seconds and we
see the content type is text event
stream which is the mime time for T for
the SS e service and events and what I
also did I installed the course had us
so if we take a look here at the end
upon there is a course because I would
like to connect from another server to
this server to make it more realistic so
now we have the first client and here we
have an simplistic html5 app no
frameworks is just a simple html5 page
and a JavaScript class or script which
is loaded and it's not a class but now
it's going to be a class class app or
let's call it events
and I was started with the constructor
and I would like to keep it simple so I
would do everything in the constructor
and just say this events events equals
new event source and this event source
is a built in building object so what I
would like to do is just to take the URI
and this is this one and to paste it
here so then I would like to register as
register the unopen callback and we just
make it a little bit larger there's
events on open and reduced our listener
and this is the event and then I would
just like to print out the event and
then I would like to receive the key
messages and this is going to be on
message Condor lock and the message so
let's see what happens nothing because I
didn't instantiate the constructor so
let's do this new event so and of course
what's wrong here the URI
so try it again it looks better so we
have the first event which is the open
event and then we get a message event
and as you can see we have here an
attribute data which we can of course
more easily access using destructuring
so I'll just do this so I would like to
have the data here and use the data here
and now what we get we get the current
time from the Java 8 server just by
using a simplistic es6 class so thank
you for watching
if you're interested check out the web
standards ignitor online online course
or come to airport Monique CEO at
conferences workshops or even projects
so thank you for watching and bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
