welcome to the thirty fifth edition of a
hex TV we have lots of questions so
let's go let's start with the very first
question and the question is from Vasu
about entity relationships in micro
services and he says okay in a modulus
by the way in the model is for me a
monolith not nothing wrong with someone
of this so I'm actually I really like
model is that simple so yeah you have
everything in one place everything is
deployed at once it is just perfect so
but in a model is the entity Hadfield
said to refer to other entities very
annotations year relations end tables so
he means GPA and in micro services would
say service a fetches the users from
service be fetches the order some
separate databases yeah what he means is
what what happens when we have to end
though in the model is there were two
entities in 11 microservice so in one
model is only microservices we hear the
the entities apart so there's one entity
one micro service and the other one in
the other one and how they handle the
relations is in a simple quad scenario
so yeah easy answer actually two answers
you know either there is no relationship
so what you will have to change you will
have to change the business logic or you
have duplicate relationships for the
what will meanest we have users which
refers to the orders but the user with
the relation to the orders as entire in
one micro service which points to the
micro service database and in the other
micro service there is still one order
which is different to this order edit
point to the different database so you
get two databases with two orders with
duplicate data but probably with
slightly different data different
columns and this is what microservices
are doing so or causing they are causing
lots of the application a lot of
applications or they are dublicate
nothing wrong with the application the
application in micro services and the
point is what we can do if you really
no the business logic you can use it and
and as an advantage and for instance
what we sometimes do is history zation
tables can be split into different micro
services and you don't need mr. ization
anymore if you have a copy of the data
anyway so if you're interested in such
scenarios of course come to Munich I
think the next microservice workshop is
around the corner and yeah or ask
questions at the next exv so are the
next question is also good one what I'm
thinking about reactive programming
using reactive streams like Eric Chavez
spring electric arc upstream and whether
they are going to be in enterprise
applications widely adopted I don't
think so not widely adopted they are
early adopters right now and I don't
think that they are going to be widely
adopted in in enterprise applications
but somehow adopted and can we reach
currently the same goals using plain
Java you with computable futures and
executors here of course so actually I
shown this several times also in the
online java ee online microservices java
course i use complete every future to
chain different microservices together
and execute us but the uruk's java they
did they go a little bit further and
they are actually use cases so am i was
invited for a cloud native workshop or
evening at BWW and had a chat with lee
under this is a nice guy here also
talked about about his project was java
ee pyara project as well and what they
did is they they combined different rest
services to one rest service for a nice
view and they use actually reactive
programming because it was easier so
this is a unique requirement where
reactive programming fits really really
well in my projects as you probably
already know me I would try to stick
with computable future and if they are
no more reasonable which means if the
coat explodes becomes too complex then I
will of course
use erics java yeah next one let's see
what the chat does chat is quiet we have
people already from from well here's
button with Mac and someone from Mexico
and some are from Greece which is nice
question about why I'm using wrs core
response instead return a returning XML
root element or or persistence entity
and so the reason is it different is
what I could do I could return response
and pass an entity JP entity to the
response and it could be even annotated
with XML root element so it's not like
if I return response in jax-rs for a
second oh we have ID the nice denies the
story with Java is hacking code is
faster than explaining it so and you
have always used dots las camas so this
one this one and not the NEX workspace
just took the just go to regular junk
and jax-rs reeve response ok so we have
that and let's say we have a hex
resource com NX DX to resource so and we
have of course a episode so I skip the
boundary and entity as we just use that
so and the XML root element bindings
what he referred was dad XML root
element and then i would probably even
go further and say xso type field so i
don't have
to generate superfluous getters and
setters and the episode has a number or
a number is actually a string and
description so so we have a nice object
so so enough and now I could of course
say this are this is X and X and we have
let's say now response and I would skip
the list i will just go here with a
single so do it right path we have ID
and then we get something like
transparent and we had the number ok and
the response and now we can say return
response dot ok and then I can pass the
entities I can still do this can do this
so nothing wrong with that and the
number would be today we have the 35th
epic episode 35th and the script
would be some hacking with nice chat
okay built done another question why I'm
doing this this doesn't make any sense
but what I could do I could pass
additional header information and say ok
state too many questions so i could just
now add additional metadata here and of
course if I would create this is even
more important because if I create
something then our ha i would actually
I'm almost forced by the HTTP standard
to say created with the URI and built so
then I will always use respond so i
always use response in case i have to
pass additional information or change
the status and some collectors another
question is why im using j or why i
prefer no yeah Jason responds / / /
entity and the reason is in if I have to
deal with react angular or web component
projects and they this very likely that
we will need a nice format for the
client and then I just go with Jason
objects so I just expose the JSON
objects directly without even attempting
to note due to starting with entity so I
just use the JSON object and by the way
how I do this ah I wrote a blog post and
this is a sample of workshop to Jason so
this is what happens and here i can
serialize my object whenever I like and
if there's not enough I can still in the
resource realize my object to whatever
formatter format I like okay nice
so first Monsieur bar on his is in in a
Greek army in the military so I want
cruising in which category of military
he looks like a Marines or something so
and and and he reads my archive which
and he found finds the archive exciting
which has to say something about the
military know if my java archive is
exciting then the military could be a
little bit boring but let's see this did
this were tools which I used back then
actually almost 11 years ago and and
this is what I did so and I would
replace notice maybe into its maven
three it stalled hold up X docket is
that and why I will explain a little
explain a little bit later y X doclet or
code generation is suspicious apt is
annotation processing tool for
generation and don't use it anymore what
I use is a secret weapon is not one for
you know a little bit more dynamic stuff
and JavaScript nice one look at the
youtube channel you will find some
examples and so I replace j bows ID with
netbeans check but genotype d is still
great so if you like like eclipse and
you don't like a now two to play with
the plugins use tables ids is genius p 6
pi sometimes great what species spiders
it's like decorator for jdbc and you can
just log out your your your psycho
statements jmeter so i will all extent
with apache benchmark a B and J M jmh
this is Java micro benchmark harness is
a maven plugin is great i will probably
i will have to write another blog post
actually so we'll do it and and and the
gym age if you're interested look
the testing workshops i use it
extensively june is perf i know i'm not
using it a lot anymore but what i use in
status if i have to measure the
performance or to something like this i
use ju needles instead of Jake ons all I
use j visualvm and java Mission Control
JMC j edit nice edit wha I use Visual
Studio code right now and netbeans
Pichette is still interesting both are
no more dad interesting what I use is on
this crazy ten years ago I already used
cruise control I use Yankees of course
Jay depend PMD fine back check the jello
p basic QA stuff yes if i have to
measure the the quality i use so not on
our source middle jen is out star this
is like xicot star oml was a free uml
tool java 7 is so concise and so since
then we actually don't use even uml
anymore we just you know give you
classes there is nothing else you know
if you write code is faster to
understand then draw draw a diagram so
what we do we need on a whiteboard we
join all the concepts but it doesn't
have to be uml squirrel quantum DB
eclipse it be and just netbeans database
Explorer as here and I is actually
netbeans and I use some native tools on
Meg so back then I still had my thinkpad
and then it broke so I both Mac and
since then i use mac i think those two
thousand seven or eight they have some
native tools for database and jags very
fast compiler for development right now
we have SSDs and compiling is crazy fast
but I would think about this and write
another post so thank you and what
happens in yet not that much
Twitter quiet then come back here so and
now the question is simpler and the
question is how to do cross field
validation with with bean validation and
and and he asked me um wait a second
YouTube and I'm beam and videos Jason
validation exactly I don't like to click
on it because it will run and it could
break our streaming connection so we
just put it here stop so I think what I
did here I validated a from Germany
someone from Germany Germany is hello
it's nice so and what I did in the video
I created valid data for JSON object and
JSON object is an object so if you and
this a little bit more complicated
because the object is generic and so if
you look at the video the video
screencast you will immediately
recognize how to implement cross field
validation for entities but it is
actually easy i could take but this
actually i could hack this the next as a
youtube screen cuz i think it will take
three minutes or something like this so
let's do this next week but for now you
will have to annotate a class an entity
and the validator will get the whole
entity and we'll get the whole state
what i usually do i implement a method
valid inside the entity like this should
be valid or validate and the bean
validation tool calls the method and it
only knows the methods this will be
actually a good case for interfaces so
it calls the method checks whether it is
true or false and then the report an
error or not so this is
how it works pretty simple actually such
a such a screencast is lacking so i will
write a screencast right to record our
screencast is faster than post so we'll
do this a very good one Monsieur how t
and otha 13 days years certain days ago
asked me what is my opinion about GPL
and lgpl licenses so arm the thing is
the i think it's called we need the GPL
with class pass is a exception and what
it means is that we can load the library
and our code doesn't have to be GPL and
my understanding is this is true for
most of the library's yeah this is if
you don't modify the libraries
everything is fine if you modify the
libraries i am anna standing is you will
have to submit the commodification to
hibernate so my OSS license preferences
i started recently and project called
tracy has something to do with opener i
think i will push the code probably
tomorrow and i thought about what
license choose usually choose apache
because it sounds great and I think this
MIT is more liberal so at this time I
started with MIT so I'm from my
understanding about the licenses if you
don't care about licensing you should
still choose you are licensed to protect
yourself why I actually forgot so there
is a really important that you have to
have a license in a in an open source
project and otherwise something bad can
happen to you and in my java eat
projects we don't have the issue because
I can you know I try to delete every
single external dependency and if you
don't have any dependencies you don't
any problems with licenses but what I
saw in code reviews which is really
really dangerous developers sometimes
copy and pasted open source code into
their project and this is really
problematic because then you violate you
know all the licensing so that you
should never do this but if you
including libraries of course
they have to have you know the GPL the
right license this would be GPL with
class pass extension so mr. Garcia asked
me whether I tried peg for Jay and no i
haven't I look at that and it looks
interesting what I used a lot is key
cloak a cloak and what we get in in Java
e is the soft area or I java so this is
the security spec which is usable right
now so and and this s similar features a
similar features this is just the
reference implementation it comes with
Java 8 so I take a look at this but
actually the specs for jay i looked at
the j2ee actually there's no j2ee java
ee has to be there's even Java extension
look at previous is well-documented
looks interesting right now I use a key
cloak and the I played with cytherea and
yeah but thank you for the reference I
don't have any project experience with
that okay but looks actually if you go
here for instance it it's really well
documented so look at this so this is a
tough right so this is comment from my
block and the question is so we have to
credit services stateless session bean
each has an entity manager injected
ejected ejection actually it's a cool
term we can something inject inch
injecting on any gin and ejecting so the
producers could be ejectors actually
enjoy and so we have injected EG bees so
the first service has also a second
service injected with
ejb so we have one service and another
service injects to the first one and if
we have a method in the first service
which uses the entity manager and caused
the methanol second service which in
turn others at the dementia do the two
entitymanager shares the same
dbconnection and the question is of
course it depends if the EG beads are
just annotated was at stateless it will
work it will share the same connection
so why because was at stateless so what
we will see so let's assume we had here
this would be an e gb which is not a bad
idea so what it actually means that we
get transaction attribute which is
required and required means if there is
no sons action a new transaction is
going to be started but if there is
already one it is going to be reused so
and having that means pretty cool so the
transaction of whatever I call here I
could invoke here whatever like so I
would just pick another class and cold a
hex hour and this is a gb and with send
signals i think so and this the UF 2gb
so the first we could inject now the
other one a hex hour and if i would do
this tower dot send signals what happens
then the transaction transaction is
going to be started here but reused in
this method and if i would inject the
entity manager here ND dat de manager
here the entity manager will participate
in the same transaction so not only the
connection is going to be shed but also
if I would find an entity here so
entitymanager find and call find here as
well I would get the same entity back
but if i put here the transaction
attribute transaction activity requires
new
then I will get what what's wrong forgot
the input then I will get multiple
multiple transactions multiple
connections and multiple copies of the
entity perfect so let's see what happens
here peru and kosovo crazy and italy
ustream Chet appears as censored uh-huh
I think if you write too much then it
sends out I guess yes you won't have to
decompose the data so in my opinion you
can be only successful in micro services
if you really know the business logic
way tech not well technology is not the
issue business logic is the issue
Victor asked me if I use JSON object
Jason away our pochard and then the
Jason will be set in their response
bilder entity or you will die Houston
poacher in the responsible entity if you
go to my blog I hope I forgot actually
yes you see here what I did here jason
rae I iterated over the list of
workshops and created here a JSON array
from virtue up to Jason from this method
if it fits well I do this otherwise you
know i can just protest ed jason in
whatever fashion I like so I answered I
have a question about how to properly
organized the code in a micro service
project first decoder organization what
I usually do is the BBC artifact and
what I I always start with the simple
project here but there's another project
called Java ebc archetypes is the
essential and this is more a sample
project so if I start that and say
structure it will create a larger
project with system test integration
tests and whatever but what you will
find here I hope a nice structure and
this is the BCC structure and ideas
top-level packages are always have
always business meanings or like
registrations in workshops or tracing
and we have done the structure boundary
control entity so we've always the same
you will also find us on screen cast on
my youtube channel about this so this is
the internal organization so means we
have one war which comprises top-level
packages with business names and they
are cohesive me means they are the
content of the packages belongs together
and every package I call it component
comprises sub packages boundary control
entity and the meaning is boundary API
to the outside world control optional
but use your reusable stuff this are
stateless intervista SAR pojos which has
to be actually pojos but they are
actually CDI beans and these are
entities which are optional ok this is
the code structure one repo per service
yes it sounds reasonable I mean it
really depends on life cycle if you if
you are requirement this you know that
the the services have to go to
production is different version this one
github repo for service one module per
service or several this is what I don't
need I don't know what you need by
module I would say there are multiple
packages travel packages or components
bc components inside a war and how big
is a war a small pizza team creates a
war so this is now you have the
granularity package structure already
discussed I think in my eyes I provided
so much content about this it should be
crystal clear what to do and most of the
contest entry so if you go to my youtube
channel or search for BCE blog post you
will find the structure if not think me
and I will record a screencast ok and by
the way of course there is course
effective java ee where I build an app
with the structure and this is already
microservice but even more there is this
java ee microservices workshop we're
also using a structure and on-the-fly
create microservices on the fly from
scratch and and and wire them together
so they talked to each other ok I hope
so I don't like to see myself so next
one or next one ok some ask me i'm not
java api for Jason binding comes in Java
8 looks looks really promising and I
don't using yet in project if it will
come out I would think about I would try
it first and and get a feeling which
what in van what the advantages are but
it looks really promising thank you to
dig from Hamburg okay cool and Victor
used awesome i approach which is really
good because i used this approach for I
would say 11 half years and I was at the
beginning that not very sure but it
works better than expected okay so okay
not the next one what is your perception
on the adoption of using Gretel in the
industry today do you see it placing
replacing maven in the long run it
depends where I think for Android
development Gretel shines for java
development maven is very good so I'm
actually in the last New Year's are
never so Gretel in Java EE projects
always made them NP and developers were
very very happy with it and Gretel is
perfect to Gretel is more like
programming tool and and maiden relies
heavily on conventions and if you can
lift with the conventions maven is
unbeatable if you cannot live with the
conventions just don't use maven it
won't work for you and now the question
is java enterprise applications of the
needs to come with resources like sequel
squids customizing or whatever and also
you know there's customizing scripts to
website admin so what I'm doing with
this and what I do with that is recently
the following there's the scripts are
not in the war actually a to answer so
the first one the recent one is
Docklands so most of my project are we
are using doctor right now and what we
use then for instance pyara configured
this is a docker file which configures
the application server so the script is
executed if the image is created and
then we have one application server
which is
to the project configured and then the
the war the war is deployed to this
image but this has to build only ones to
just you know a place holder so you can
create a gem excuse whatever data
sources so this is what we really use in
real life so arm but where was it okay
sometimes this is more for internal
projects but in products were we just
you know it's not like we built over and
over again the same project and push in
production and continuous delivery mode
but if we have to install something on
the customer side then we ship the
scripts with the war and a start-up
singleton instance whatever needed so it
creates table indices or whatever so
this was my approach is over 12 so in
projects I used oka or before docket
there were scripts and I and I think I
show description Sean already several
times let's see CD I think here create
x-ray domain this is my own script and
this clip was executed on Jenkins and
Jenkins created the GlassFish version
here this is what what what what
happened there and and this was before
dr. as you can see it still refers to
glassfish 3 which is museum technology I
think it's already 10 years also
something so as a long time ago I use
this approach with Jenkins and right now
the scripts are part of the doc image ok
answer
all the good one a small company they
are afraid of oracle jdk licensing
issues and yeah it really depends what
we are doing so and to my knowledge or
it will never change the licensing so i
do it always the case that if you are
running jdk on not general purpose
machines you will actually have to pay
money son and oracle is it just looks
orcas more host conscious about the
licensing and they take advantage of
this but if you are not sure whether
your plants runs on general purpose
hardware or not you can still use
openjdk in fact adjusted because it's
easy to install on my server everything
runs now on openjdk i always use the
Oracle jdk and actually sun jdk an orca
jdk and for one year it runs on openjdk
no issues so far and and this licensing
is more like if the project is critical
you would probably like to buy the d
license anyway to get you know support
of support better j &amp;amp; Co java mission
controller support for in production but
but but if not I'd yeah then then
openjdk just writes i think is fine and
openjdk is openjdk so it's like open
source you can just use it then i got an
email from friends from panama and they
had created a so we have to translate
first like see here no sequel layer for
java so on it will vice so are we just
if someone create something in tunisia
should be promoted so check that out so
could be useful to you and yeah
now to the next one next one was a
twitch and so it is impossible to answer
this via twitch and the question is what
is my view of model-driven architecture
and microservice so arm my view is of
somehow java ee bias or i can just pick
from java so and in the java ee world
what i thought is though the last year's
our wars are tiny and actually perform
more and more interviews on my block and
ask the client know how big are the wars
and they are really if the project is
reasonable the wars are really small and
what I mean small is that here the
business logic there are just in a few
hundred classes probably and they
contain mainly business logic so what it
means is the model driven architecture
can actually only work if you if you are
able to express your business logic your
algorithm in UML or whatever model you
have state machine or whatever and then
generate the Java code and the
definition in the uml model has to be
faster than the then actually the
creation of code and now with java 6 and
7 we have one-to-one relation between
the platform independent model this is
in model-driven architecture the right
name for this soap in platform
independent model so there would be one
box into ml and the PSM platform
specific model for it for java ee would
be in java 6 of the one box so we have
one-to-one relation between a box in UML
and a box in Java which is box is a Java
class so what you will the additional
value would be that we generate
sometimes you know one of you
annotations and I don't think it works
out and in fact it was I was I used a
lot MDA and X doclet and tools like that
he saw 10 years ago this was this what I
what I mentioned was extracted but
and why because back then with no all
the JDK versions there were no
annotations no enums reflection was slow
so the whole j2ee was based on code
generation and xml so there was one box
in UML let's say an entity this was the
DD DD diverse one let's say a persistent
entity so what's the X doclet or MDA
would do and let's say entity with five
fields it will generate a local
interface a local home interface in the
local interface do will be get on set of
all the fields whole interface would
comprise finders and creates methods for
all the fields then the then the entity
bean implementation it will be all
gathered settles it should be load EG
beast or passivate activates and it
should be create then a value object
because entity beans were not
transferable between layers so very
object and the creation of value object
would be also create and what do you
also could create is a session sassette
because these sessions that said wrapped
the entity bean so there's another three
interface in the xml file and a service
locator could be could be used you know
to mimic this and sometimes you could
create a business interface and the
business interface would decouple the
clients from the ugly j2ee 13 technology
ok so i'm back then you could express a
lot with one box in UML right now it
doesn't matter because whatever I told
you right now it doesn't matter it
disappeared there's not no more part for
other thing 13 years of java ok
something happened here the chat was
nervous so what are the benefits making
rest endpoints you should be instead of
CDI beans Victor asks monitoring so if
you look youtube channel so if you add
stateless is immediately visible for
instance pyara i see these soulless
methods average methods and also
performance so but this i think i
mentioned several times there's a nice
guy called sam or lease so github
and he created a benchmark he actually
watched a course testing java testing as
I didn't mentioned so far java ee test
tink i think i forgot my own course so
Java EE testing where is it here java ee
java ee testing yeah and in this course
and in this course i am at the end there
was something with CDI i tested the
performance stress stress stress test
with jmeter with apache bench and jh
exactly and what I did I I compared the
performance of ejbs with CDI beans and
EG bees were faster and Monsieur Somali
saw saw that so ok nice then you created
and github project with formal results
so the ibiza fasta EG beasts provide you
with monitoring the transactional
behavior yet we talked about before it's
also included so what is basically means
you write letter code and it should be
sub part of the application server
anyways just use them okay thank you for
the question from the chat and my links
appear standards okay sorry for that
okay done then Bruno borkus Monsieur
bogus they should be visible in the
Twitter somewhere yeah Bruno old friend
works at Oracle right now and from
Brazil and he tweeted like there is a
bare-metal services for Python and I
asked him what about Java and indeed
they hired a metal services in Oracle
cloud and everything is on github
actually
what I did I didn't manage to actually
look at it more closely but I was
curious and I just build that and
everything built and it was surprisingly
fast so I'm the Oracle bi metal services
I just cloned them and build them and
everything works out of the box which is
surprising you know I already thought I
have to know to provide some
configuration whatever but not it was
really nice and it looked like the
Oracle beer services like basic java
services where you can use in the
project so it's interesting there's the
new about this yes sdk and it points to
this is javadoc but there is yeah this
is more formal but this is a bi-metal
services exactly so and this is
networking load balancing compute
servers database service blog volume and
sdk and other tools and there is a java
sdk which is really nice so i will
actually play with it good price ok so
oracle twosomes does some interesting
stuff and no one knows about this ok
then the last one the last one were ok
java news and so oracle woke up so no
the java vacations are over there are
the oldest techniques are cranking specs
like crazy this is my this is what I see
as I'm try to contribute a bit the two
percent no to the mailing list of jax-rs
regarding you know frightful integration
Java integration and they searching
jax-rs they discussing Eric's reactive
programming right now with jax-rs and
integration with Java nine so if you are
interested in this just participate in
jax-rs mailing list then the adjacent
binding spec is ready to review the
also going going strong so actually all
these pegs woke up and I will practice a
bit a little bit more yeah and this is I
like this actually why because from now
to Java one there's a limited amount of
time like a half a half a year so no we
have to be more productive so if the
there is too much time you get you know
tons of emails and nothing is done but
right now it looks like people are
productive and yeah so far everything
looks nice I think we are done which is
amazing because we had 16 questions and
some hacking yeah we are done so i will
just go to the chats if you have some
questions in the chat no questions the
chat no questions in d in the twitter so
then i have to say thank you for
watching see you and the ax I oh come or
just what was it this is d workshops and
the first time about performance
troubleshooting what I will try to do is
to explain you know the inner workings
of application servers and server side
java backpressure thread pull
configuration out to monitor this
there's a get a lots of questions about
that and of course i'm already looking
to this is around the corner is the
javascript javascript workshops so thank
