would like to implement a java ee
service and access that from react.js
app so let's start with a service so
let's create a number Factory and I will
use maven for this as simple as possible
way to create an Java app and I will
call it numbers ste number service and
the number service will have installed a
course filter and the course filter is
only important in case you would like to
access from from a different server our
back-end service which is usually the
case it's nothing to with Java rather
than with web security in the browser so
we just replace the group ID okay now
it's installed and then I would just add
a resource and call it numbers resource
and this is the numbers resource and the
numbers resource will have path numbers
and I will return a JSON array which
will contain strings with numbers of
course
so now let's quickly create the numbers
generate we can generate the number with
current Millis then I would like convert
the number to a string and then say I
would like just to have let's say ten
numbers so done and this is just a
number stream and it actually doesn't
have to be a string but doesn't matter
in our case and then what I would like
to do is J's to create a and every
builder this is the array and the array
is going to be returned and what we have
to do is to convert that so number
string for each array H so it looks nice
so let's build it and then run it on a
server so we just run it and ask me
which server I would use the pi r1 okay
numbers resources numbers and we have
the numbers so it looks good we have to
remember the OD so what happened before
I just create an empty react project and
I would like to open that and so and
this comprises the package.json which
basically contains the the react
dependencies so there are some runtime
dependencies a create react demand every
router so react route is actually not
necessary in this example and then some
plugins in order to be able to eat to
use es6 or egg mask of 2015 okay so the
index.html is very simple so it just
comprises a div ID which is going to be
replace by there by the react app and a
reference to target or char and what is
jar of course a JavaScript archive so
this jar ends up being everything
bundled into one file and there is a web
pack configuration and
does it just searches for from the entry
point which happens to be the index GS
from there and searches for dependencies
and and then puts everything into one
place so we have to index yes so and
what this index GS does it renders so it
goes to my document so this our
index.html and searches for element by
ID app which is of course the diff here
and renders the template here
what's template template is imported
from from dot slash template so go to
template template is just a basic basic
basic react component called template
and it renders to 44 42 so if we run it
we should see duke 42 so it's localhost
what was the port duke 42 okay and if it
changes of course it will be 41 okay now
what I would like to do is to introduce
a react component called
numbers and this is going to be a
component so I would have to import
react from from react exports default
class the class is called numbers and it
extends react component and will have to
implement at least one method random and
this method would return return a diff
and say component Duke so ok and if we
just import this component here numbers
from numbers from numbers which is
directly usable so we add here and we
say ok I would like to render numbers
here so component you works and but we
would like to access the server and in
reactors no dependency injection so I
would just use the hardest possible way
to do this export default client and
this client is just plain Java class or
no nothing to do with react forgot the
class and it has one method called
numbers and this method returns a
promise and promise is something like a
future so similar to future with and
future in Java and it expects a a
function with resolve and reject we
actually only need to the resolve
because we are not interested right now
in error and link so and here what we
can do within the function here and the
anonymous function I would like to use
the request and this is going to beat
the new XML HTTP request so this is a
the lowest possible level you can get in
JavaScript request dot open and I would
like to use the get request
and this is the Orion so we created us
and then say request on the ready state
change and what I can do I can register
another function here and what this
function does it says request dot how
it's called response text and this is D
let grow and what we like to have is the
objectified Russian and we used a
built-in parse method for this and this
is wrong so now we have the object and
then I will call resolve and pass the
objectified version so nice and this
could work and what it can do then say
request dot sent without parameters so
looks good hopefully it will work so now
the client is implemented we can use the
client and they are there is no magic so
no dependency in the injection nothing
so what I will do I will just remember
or just pass the client ID props to be
super and say this client equals new
client and the hence is react I will
declare a state and the state is an
object with array of numbers so this is
the empty and empty object and then what
we can do we can say this client called
numbers and basically what I forgot is
to import the client
so this client numbers so this is the
method and what I get back now is the
promise so I can say then this dot this
it's a result let's call it result this
set state and I will overwrite the
current result and the current result is
going to be numbers R so this is what
what I would like to do here so the kind
is created the state the initial state
is created and in the constructor the
asynchronously declined is called
and so we are in the numbers and what I
would like to do is to output here the
numbers so how to do this so what we can
do right now we can say we can we could
say here are the following let's make a
section from this we can say right now
section and within this I will just in
line transform the state into a div ID
if
and this is the number number and there
should be like that so and what I forgot
is that
so and what you can see we created a
simple as possible react app and what it
does it it has a section and whenever
the state of the numbers component
changes it gets rear-ended on the on the
client so there's all the numbers so of
course what we can do I don't know we
could we could of course beautify that
and use in d responsive B I'm not sure
where the blink is working and now it's
this bolt which is beautiful so I'll
thank you for watching and see an
upcoming courses also the react course
at Munich Airport conferences workshops
projects and enjoy Java and JavaScript
so thank you for watching and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
