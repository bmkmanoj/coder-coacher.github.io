would like to play a little bit with and
hit writer so I'm so minimalistic ETL
tool and what I did I just converted the
Wikipedia Java version history into
simple CSV file and will try to read it
with an iterator so this is just a very
simple Java project is not Java is just
Java SE maven project and what I will
have to do is to add the dependency to n
hydrator and the group ID is come in hex
as always all my leisure semi leisure
projects and the artifact IDE is going
to be an hydrator and the let's CD
version should be zero zero six this is
what's available and the scope it
doesn't matter in our case but it is
actually runtime in our case it could be
also test so now we installed an
hydrator and the CSV file is in the root
JDK dates is the name of the CSV file
and just comprises the name version and
year and this is JDK name to the K
version and year and now try to read it
so for this purpose I would create a
journey test with the name read JDK
versions tests in the package come a hex
and hit rate so let's try this and let's
read from CSV see commas and tests
and source is the source let's say input
equals new CSV files and what I have to
pass is the file name and the file name
is going to be dot I think it was JDK
dates dot CSV the second parameter is
the delimiter so it is semicolon then I
need the UTF the car set so utf-8 and
now it asks me whether we have a head or
not this is the last file contains
headers yes it contains the first line
is the header so true and what I also
would like to do is the output and see
this is the sink
I'd say output and we have a virtual
virtual sinc source and what it
basically means is it is a in-memory
sink so it will retain the data so the
idea is reading CSV converting key to
our to our travel Java types and and and
pushing it to the virtual sinc source
and then what we won't have to do is new
engine and now we can say from input to
output so far so good
built and what I get back is the pump
and what I will try to do is to just
read it so what I get back is the memory
which contains some information so what
happened and let me check or just try it
a search false of course it memory
eris occurred so should be no arrows and
now let's try this test so looks good so
what you can also do we could say to new
locks Inc so I would like to use both
now a try this and what we should see is
a little bit more output a little bit
more output where is my output so as you
can see it reads so what happens is you
see we have one column here with the
value 2004 so this is what what we did
we're at the the CSV file into a virtual
sinc source and with the sync source we
can of course ask the sync source let's
do it so we just used the a type so what
I could do here as well I can now say
get number of rows get rows for instance
and and I would get D rows as Java
objects and let's see whether rows get
index 0 whether there is such a row
first of course assert false rows is
empty and then you have the first row
from the first row I would like to have
the column value and the column name is
let's see the column name is let's see
the year so I will just get the year and
what I will get back is of course an
object it could be anything here and of
course I will just to this it's a year
this last year so let's see the output
the year is here so this was the first
one was the actual header let's see the
second one the year is 1996 so um any
later is a really nice tool to reach any
tabular data and and convert it to
whatever data like and in the subsequent
episode if you like I will show you how
to filter the data changed types and and
some not advanced put some more useful
stuff so thank you for watching and see
you in upcoming conferences or even a
hex at Munich Airport and of course
javi projects there are more and more
Java 7 projects out there so chances are
pretty high that we'll see you one day
meet you one day in projects ok bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
