would like to deploy a full stack Java 7
application actually payara full with
centralized 7 zone optimizations here
and jdk one-eighth full to open shift
and scale it a bit and make it
accessible from outside so I will use my
own docker file from the document
project and I would like to use the
payara pink and this pair a pink is a
placeholder for any project you like you
only will have to replace the pink war
with your with your war so I would like
to to login to open shift origin and as
a developer so go with that then I would
like to start a project so let's call
that in hacks so project created and
then with let's start with an image
which is a docker image and the name of
the image is a hex slash payara pink and
this comes from public docker hub you
could use a private docker registry as
well so let's do this it lost the image
and then I would like to create
deployment so now behind the scenes it
creates the deployment and installs the
full image and deploys the application
so we have here the the application
running is one pot means one's instance
and we could take a look what happens
here view lock as what we can see is the
applications already deployed so it took
I don't know half a minute to deploy the
full image and then the application as
well now it is not available yet so I
will have to add her out what route is
is a is a public public visible URI and
I will call de route air hex route the
host name should be auto-generated the
path is going to be root which is
sub-optimal in our case because it will
go to the root of the application server
so we will see the payara
welcome screen but as with slash pink so
I will have to come anyway Lian at pink
you will see the pink app but I think
for demonstration purposes is better and
what I will have to do is to choose the
port 8080 otherwise we will only see the
admin console so we would have a lot
balanced admin console so let's create
it out so
it's created right now so this is the
publicly available Ori so let's check
that so seems to work and then switch to
pink and this is the pink application
server yeah the pink app so and it
should also work so now what you can
also do now I can switch to the overview
and we have the pots so I can start for
instance the next application server and
it could take a while so a few minutes
is not because we have Java 7 and this
is lot quicker than usual micro-service
so and now we have two services so they
are already running and they are both
available from this array so now we have
our load balance application which
pattern which shows the two application
service and we have also the two pots
and we could see that in the yeah this
is two application servers both are
running this is two parts aspire a pink
one and the payara pink two one is
available for 12 minutes and the other
one for 30 minutes so um thank you for
watching and see you at upcoming
conferences a hex TV calm or i/o or even
project so thank you and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
