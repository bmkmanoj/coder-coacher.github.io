would like to play a little bit with
NASA on and to start playing what I
would have to do to set up NASA on
properly and you can do this with in the
HTML GS tab in NetBeans and what I'm
going to do to set the scripting option
which makes it a really really
interesting so it is nice one then it's
set to the scripting mode which is very
nice so then I will create a JavaScript
library project and call it of course
now so on and you know I don't like any
frameworks so nothing is going to be
built but the funny story is what I get
here is a main.js file which can be used
for implementing JavaScript so let's try
something simple function hello of
course and we can use print we are not
in the browser there is no console and
say hey and I will invoke the function
and try to run it and as you can see a
not that bad so it seems to work and
yeah what you can of course also do I
can set a variable name equals Duke and
the string and I could do and say
yeah hey and what NASA is able to do is
to replace the variable in the spring so
we'll run it and it's not due to rather
than name again hey Duke seems to work
so but it's getting even better
so our NASA on comes with some pre-built
variables like for instance and so what
I could do
it's I could say it is actually NF so
and say and if I run mint
my and environment entries is anything
now I can say for each e in elfs this is
a nice nice phone extension and I would
like to print it out and the donor e and
let's see whether it works so as you can
see are all my environment entries so
this is pretty useful for automation for
instance and what's also very useful is
this year x'q so what exit toss it
execute the script so I can say show me
the contents of the folder and the
results you will find in out so I can
say for result equals out and then print
result so run it and you see my folders
so on and of course nasan comes with
java 8 so what we can also do we can say
VAR date equals new Java util date and
say print date
and here's my date so you can seamlessly
integrate Java code to NASA on and of
course you could integrate NASA on to
java code but then I will have to start
with a Java project and the best of all
is I can debug the whole thing so I can
go here and say debug and it will stop
here so I have the complete scope so as
see you know the all the variables here
or also the global scope and it can step
by step the execution so it should see
the result here see the results all the
folders and this is actually a big thing
because prior to an asinine automated
lots of my server stuff with bash but
now I can actually debug the whole stuff
so I can use JavaScript and Java to
automation which is a really big thing
to me and what's also possible this is
still a thing you can implement
interfaces with last one and this works
like this var run equals new runnable
new java.lang runnable but I will have
to implement it using a function and to
do this I will use the to implement the
function run and is going to be print
execute me yes and now I can say we're
on the run and run it execute me so what
this is I was able to execute to
implement dear honorable this is also
unique year and last on syntax with with
JavaScript function execute me so nice
stuff
Nasim comes with a Java 8 and together
with NetBeans it's really great support
to build automation script or to
implement JavaScript actually a view of
my projects like for those SPG were
implemented this way so look for SPG at
github so thank you for watching and see
you on upcoming conferences workshop or
even a hectic minik airport we are one
day html5 and I think about thinking
about one day JavaScript for Java
developer so thank you and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
