would like to show you how to
conveniently configure the white flight
application server on how to least
prevent some errors and what I open here
this is an editor I opened a standalone
full configuration this is what my wife
and is running right now white fight and
one and all the subsystems can be
directly configured in this file on the
left side there is a J console opened
and one I would like to open the JBoss
module what I would like to connect with
the jabu jabus module process which
happens to be the wiser application
server so let's go with that and by the
way there's nothing special with Jenkins
or you could use any Jo mix browser you
like and there's a JBoss a s folder and
if we look briefly here you will find
all the subsystems each should be 3 EEE
this is the managers thread factories
with Java currencies but let's go to the
stick with the eg b3 so if I go to the
eg b3 and choose the attributes you we
see here lock systems exceptions which
is a attribute here and if we scroll
down there is a lock system exceptions
which happens to be an element in the
configuration so and if I change it to
false it immediately changes the state
to false so it seems likes on it seems
like the whitefly actually listens to
changes in Jennings and immediately
pushes the changes to the configuration
file and even more interesting there is
an in VM remote interface invocation
pass by value yes by value true and this
is lacking there is no such setting here
if I change it to false it immediately
appeared here so what it means is this
the default setting was true so it was
not stored in the configuration but if I
change it to false it appeared in the
configuration so the GMX attributes are
actually more complete than the
convenient white flag configuration here
so if you perform the changes you should
restart the application server
or reload all the subsystems which can
be also done with the oyster Gemma
console but I think the safer way is
just to restart the whitefly and this
changes our persistence or the next
style start this XML configuration are
going to be loaded and these changes are
going to be reflected in the gem --ax
again so thank you for watching and see
you at Eric's Munich or online so bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
