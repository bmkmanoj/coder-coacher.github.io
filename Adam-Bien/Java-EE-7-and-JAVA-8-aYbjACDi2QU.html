what I planned for today is to show a
little bit more code so as I remember
the last time there was lots of esoteric
discussion about components boundaries
and whatever the only problem I have is
this so I broke my bones in my underarm
so I cannot type very fast but I think
because we have Java it should work
anyway so if you have to type a lot in
Java it projects you're not going to be
successful anyway so I would probably be
a little bit slower than usual so your
job is to ask questions and what I
prepared for today is so we we have here
a Twitter so you can use this hashtag
deaf crowd deaf crowd PL and I also
activated a chat here from from Ustream
so you can use whatever you like and I
think there's a little bit of lag like
five seconds
so ask questions as many questions only
possible be easy to measly I don't have
to type a lot and so now I think we set
up everything so I would like to start
with the introduction so I thought a
little bit about Java 7 and particularly
in with Java 8 so I think the Java 8 is
will have the highest impact on the
architecture of applications and this is
what I would like to show you a little
bit today so hopefully it's more
interesting than the last time so Who am
I I am just developer I started in 1995
since 1997 I'm a freelancer I never work
for a company so I always was a
freelancer consultant programmer or
whatever sometimes I wrote books or
articles but usually I spend lots of
time of coding and hacking and because I
get lots of requests about about the
workshops I try to optimize my time and
organize a view times a year virtual pad
Munich Airport so the virtual
be calm and usually they are actually a
few developers from from Poland they
were from tines composing I don't know
whether from straight team but from from
all over the place so you are welcome
yes and some resources I write a blog
this is my the DVD workshops and in hex
news is like Mitra news I write once a
month
a newsletter and about meter stuff like
my talks or some news but not I would
say more pointers to resources or events
not technical news so yeah this book is
still current so probably I will write
the second editions and one point of
time but not now no time and this is
also seems to be popular yeah and we can
stay in touch with a hex TV this is a
probably also the most interesting thing
for you because one one time a month is
the first Monday of the month at 6 p.m.
I'm just answering questions life so you
can ask me questions using edit or
Twitter very similar to now it's the
same setup and I try to answer all the
questions and the deal is I don't answer
email questions anymore or Twitter
questions that try to gather them and
answer them once a month so to huge
time-saver this is the workshops slides
don't braked why this bones break but
not slides so this is the last slide and
now I would like to switch to NetBeans
and attempt to code a little bit for you
hopefully you would work it is not
better
it was then even yesterday so let's find
the idea here and now we'll just to
check whether you have any any questions
so no questions so far
ok I see myself this is a quite of
recursive recursive experience so I
could even reach with this until Twitter
and Ustream and everything breaks ok so
now as always I would like to create a
Java EE project and what I usually
usually do is I use maven most commonly
asked questions why not use great
and my answers for Java 7 project and
doesn't matter may Venus to us as far as
Gradle twice as fast as Gradle and and I
don't need the power of Gradle in my
Java 8 projects but if the projects are
more evolved more complicated I would
prefer Gradle over
maven so to to to to say it clearly
maven with convention of a configuration
is perfect setup for Java and gretel is
better if you don't cannot live with the
conventions anymore and you have to
implement your own stuff so and I
thought about which application to
implement today and I thought about
today to do and remind us what I wrote
recently a small to remind us app so I
thought it would be better today about
weather service or broken broken bones
or something like this so let's say I
could create an application called
weather and it's going to be a maven
application so it will take a second it
would pull everything down so what I'm
using here I'm using NetBeans daily
build so if you will see some exceptions
or pop-ups
it's just usual if you're using most
daily builds why I'm using daily builds
because it comes with better JavaScript
support and html5 supports and
JavaScript and html5 support I use a lot
right now in my projects today I would
like to use white flight I think last
year I used GlassFish or nothing I can't
remember whether I hit something or not
so I would just use white fly and what
happens right now I just created a very
simple Java 7 applications this is the
whole maven so I'm using Java 8 and one
API dependency Java API 7 oh so this is
the deal here I think pretty clear so I
show it several hundred times already so
I always use this out here archetype and
so now I think we could start with
jax-rs and then if you like I can create
some Java server pages Java server but
JavaServer faces application and/or view
and I would like to introduce to
configure jax-ur as first jax-rs config
this is config
raishin is the class i usually name it
and a hex is just my personal stuff so
Jack says yeah X and let's say the
application name is whether whether
finish and I get a simple class and it
went up to take a notation application
path the content of the application pass
doesn't matter but what it defines us is
the OD and this extends application so
it looks like this so what we gained now
jax-rs is set up for each axis is like a
rest endpoint in Java EE so then I would
like to create let's I just thinking
about whether you should be very clean
in architecture or just show you take
the code but let's create a class and in
the package weather let's say weather is
the application a name then I would use
a business as a layer and then we'll
introduce the component name and
forecast is the right name and then I
would use K boundary and forecast
something like this and forecasts
resource and this could be forecasts in
case we have multiple forecasts so just
a simple class and now I can use a path
and say for castes done I just will look
briefly whether you have any questions
here no question Oh someone says is
always someone who uses NetBeans and
this is yeah probably because all others
are watching right Bartek so I'm only
who using NetBeans IDE because all
others are watching it they just shut
down NetBeans so-so forecasts weather
forecasts resource and just create a
very first stuff with Java EE 7 object
oh not object actually array Jason
there's no typing I hate haters actually
but what we can do right so my advice to
you is no sports you know if you do some
sports you break your bones and then
your productivity will suffer so no
sports just hiking and everything is ok
so get and I would coach say return
Jason
create array builder and of course
clouds is always interesting because
clouds without clouds there is nothing
right and a little bit of Sun of course
and built so and just a quick test so I
will just run the application and try to
deploy it so as I said today would use
white line we could use payara or
GlassFish short or Tommy for the Java EE
6 stuff it should just work so just
opened the this is forbidden because
nothing there are resources I think
forecasts who are always tough and this
actually good news what it actually
means the browser requests text HTML and
we don't have it so we would like to use
JSON and what I will use I will use in
terminal instead of this I will just use
the same three weather seconds I have to
paste it paste as you can see clouds and
Sun it works
so I'm probably interesting there's no
you know hit not generated code or
whatever you can go here and and I can
show you the target weather at war and
this is basically just two classes which
is important to me because you know
small Wars means fast deployments and
see whether we have any questions so no
no questions in the chat everyone seems
to be happy ok
so now this is not very realistic
because what you usually will do you
will separate the rest part and the
application part if you put too much
stuff there it is really hard to test so
um what I would do I would just create
tea weather forecasts for Casta weather
forecaster is actually a nice name
why alright see weather forecaster and
this is going to be an EJB why because I
don't like to care about transactions
and usually EGCG be stateless introduce
better performance at least at white
light so wrong button save it and I
could just return something and let's
say it doesn't matter whether it is a
ray or not I just would like to show you
know to put all the parts together
return storms so now we have it and then
we can inject us here music it inject
weather forecast
WUF what a nice and we can say top you
have dot all and and let's keep sound it
doesn't matter
as you can see storms and Sun this
actually quite realistic java
application just two classes and we
could inject 2d weather forecasts
entitymanager or whatever you like so um
so what you learned a little bit Java
Java is seven because this JSON array
and the JSON API is part of Java 7 so
see whether you have any questions
sun/clouds whether Oracle of course and
I was and at a conference in in New York
it was community is East it was a part
of Java one and at this conference was a
nice a nice ad it was a huge ad and the
content was behind every clouds there is
a Sun of course Microsystems back then
right so this was nice times so thank
you oh man
what's so to be careful with you know so
this is actually a very simple thing and
now let's go a little bit crazy so what
you can do with Java so we could say
this is void and void get is crazy right
so but what what what we can do in Java
7 we can say you would like to get a
suspended asyncresponse we sponsor
and what we can do we can rewrite it a
bit so instead of doing this I can just
get here the result and do something
like this
so this is new in Java 7 and what it
actually means is we are passing to the
asynchronous response this the result
but yeah but what we actually gain here
so in this particular case we gain
nothing right it looks a little bit more
complicated doesn't make any sense but
in a second at will so what actually
happens the method will immediately
complete and but we can we can we can
have an handle to their response and
asynchronously what what means here is
infamously it means without blocking a
service right push the the message back
to the back to the to the browser and
this is let's see whether it actually
works so I just save that it is getting
ready ployed as you can see is actually
no difference it should work as before a
little bit French so let's see whether
they have any questions no questions no
question in chat and no questions in all
the hash tags ok so what we could also
do we could say we just have methods
JSON object and this is for JSON array
sorry Jason array forecast and I will
just move this here and just say without
return
so as you can see it would work right
the same so if I put the forecast here
it would work now if you think about
this this creates a JSON array and this
accepts an object so actually we could
say consumer of object and consumer is
an functional interface in Java 8 let's
say yeah why not
consumer equals response oh this is the
exception I told you the window I told
you see so what I actually did is I
created a method handle we assume from
response consumes objects and of course
what forecasts does it produces objects
so on the other hand I could say this
forecast I think it is a supplier yes
objection I always confuse it with for
Joseon Java but this time it worked
supplier so and this is just a Java 8
functional interface you can see
function interface except this function
on interface doesn't matter it's just if
you if you annotate an interface with
functional interface and you have
multiple abstract methods to get an
compile error is very similar to
override so now what we can get with
Java Java 8 is something called complete
tableau future and now I can say supply
async supplier then accept consumer
done let's see was it actually works
still works he saw I was just too fast
it was not deployed yet but it works
with the new contents let's say oh the
change yes
storms one final reasons my oh it is
slow because of the streaming stuff this
is actually the reason so what he
created now we combined the consumer
with the supplier and this could be any
class from the backend class and we put
them together using computer feature
which comes with Java 8 the only problem
is let's see whether they are just too
fast a little bit so everything crystal
fear right no questions no questions
okay so the only problem is if you look
at the method it is executed in
fork/join pool so this pipeline is
asynchronous
but executed in fork/join pool of the
application know of T of Java C so we
can start no too many threats at a time
and too many threats can can lead to out
of memory errors because each each
threat allocates a certain amount of
memory and this is not very interest or
not not very robust thing to do so
instead of this we introduce another
feature is called here you can inject it
with resources and managed executor
service it is part of the concurrency
utilities of of Java of Java EE 7 and
this is like executor service from from
jdk 1/6 in factories is just executive
service from jdk 1/6 so if you look at
the imports is there something yeah
Java util concurrent executor service so
this is actually ordinary executor
service
because it is ordinary executive service
I can pass it to the method supply async
so what happens right now is the
pipeline is a synchro is executed
asynchronously
but with threats of the application
server so if this will block for an
unknown amount of time it will be fully
asynchronously
in managed by these by the pipeline and
this amount of sweats and and and and in
queue depth and the fourth can be
configured at the application server
level so this is standardized so all the
application servers can have have a
configuration facility for this pipeline
so now we are pretty fast so I'm just
looking whether we get any questions so
everything crystal clear def crowd so
you should at least say yes it's too
trivial go faster the URLs faster will
be hard or slower or whatever so deaf
crowd any questions everything crystal
clear so I will save time and we will
not wait for your your answers instead I
will show you another trick what you can
get with Java e7 so what I could do for
instance logging so it can very easily
create a logging package forecast let's
say not forecasts but why not logging
boundary just to give you some ideas
what we can do and we log producer and
the logger producer is going to produce
consumer of strings because the loca is
a consumer of strings so and I can use
the producers annotation about this one
and what also interesting expose I would
like to use only I have to introduce
pins XML
because I in default in Java 7 the
dependency injection only works in
annotated classes and so I would like to
change the default to all and now the
dependency should dependency injection
should work everywhere so this is
actually the idea so this is not
annotated so I would like to activate it
everywhere and what I like to do is to
have the injection point by the way this
example comes from this pack actually so
in this from the city I spec
Java is 6 so I actually just borrowed
from the spec get member get declaring
class and get name so now we have the
name of the class class name and what we
can do right now we can configure the
logger with that return yoga and so I
get logger with the class name and now
we can expose for instance yeah this is
what doesn't work here info and we
exposed a method info as a consumer of
strings so having said that so I will
just save everything I could go to the
weather forecaster and inject consumer
of strings
and I will call this look and say clock
dot accept seems to work so oh it still
works this is a remarkable view server
lock but there is copy that info is not
exposed let's say just go sure I will
just recompile everything and rebuild so
this is clean deploy in maven sorry
clean maven clean install and now I will
redeploy the application again looks
good
but this was the log actually seems to
work I think it even just was confused
by de formatted output it seemed Kamiya
has where the business forecast bandura
weather forecaster this is the threat
manage the executor threat is also
interesting so it means this was
executed in our threat pool and the the
output is seems to work okay I'm sure
you have to have questions so far so
good
everything clear so actually I'm
breaking up a bit from time to time
sorry for this but what will happen I
would just after the show I will
republish this on youtube so but I asked
my compatible future gave us comparing
to just a single response so the main
differences just was a single response
there's actually no threading so this
resume we just push directly to the
browser with compatible future
this is executed in in a dedicated
threat the question is why I would like
to do this and the answer is because
with managed executive service I can say
I would like for this service to the
decade no more than eight sweats and
then if and the impact is going to or
what I gain with this is you can
increase the robustness because it will
be harder to hack the server because if
you only have no.5 threats the server is
going to be overloaded and that note
probably to show it is a little bit
better what you can do is I will just
use my own libraries in some project is
called porcupine yeah sure in a second
dependency so this is maven central so
you can use exactly the same dependency
yes this is cop ID is my group ID
0:04 and then I should be able to say at
inject at dedicated and managed execute
to service just plain executive service
so what's this porcupine library does
you can look at my github account and
just show you get up my github account
and porcupine
so I implemented some examples and
porcupine and this is the library with
some examples you can look at this after
it's also recorded already some some
some videos so what happens with this so
I can injecting my I will inject my
executor service here and we'll just run
it again
and the tonalist
stands alone but what I can should be
able to do most wait a second
say - eh Oh
- I hope so
spy I would have to be deployed so can
build so what is porcupine does it is a
configurable thread pool and the spy
what it does it produces additional HTTP
output so debug output and I wanted to
present tomato juice to make it more
clear
still the same output oh it worked but
it was hidden so as you can see what we
get additional HTTP header Porcupine
statistics mes you see pipeline name mes
it just comes from from this this is the
definite name here rejection execution
and the name so what it means in the
case of rejection this class is going to
be notified it's only one threat active
one task completed there were no no
exceptions full size is 8 the current
threat deposit is 2 and there was to
choose the largest maximum full size was
16 there was no rejected tasks so it
means the server was never overloaded
and remaining queue capacity is 100 so
what it means in the case of overload DQ
DQ get less and less capacity until the
rejection execution executors handler
kicks in and yeah
when capacity was 100 so it means in in
in in no case the server was overloaded
so this is what we do in more serious
projects because if you don't have this
it is very easy to overload the server
so you will have to know or the least
one service you only have a global
threat pool and you will have to
configure the thread pool as high as the
STS the demand of a service with this
you can create very easily as fretful
per service just using a different name
here and all the thread pool is going to
configure it on the fly
so I hope you are not lost no questions
so now is everything extremely clear I
think yes
so now I'm show you a little bit of my
own library called porcupine and this is
also based on Java 7 concurrency
utilities so this library also uses
manage threats from the application
server so what are we here of course to
produce a creates consume of strings
this is a built-in Java interface and we
use this and you have to say except so
would it be very possible you could
create your own you know we have too
many locks Rock interface and say this
is a functional interface and this has
to be an interface of course and then
say lock string and as you can see we
get an error interface abstract methods
cannot give body so now we have an
functional interface string message so
and this could of course exposed lock
interface and weather forecaster could
have just the lock interface with lock
this would be exactly the same
so this could exactly the same code so
anyone sees you get if you click here I
get routed here to the producers so this
is the pair okay I get two questions I
guess now someone said me I use HTTP
dot-org a nice color alternative I
actually like curl but I will try this
and never heard about HTTP I never heard
about this but do you look at this
source thank you
and Bartek is happy very good any other
questions and if you have any other
questions like I don't know javi related
feel free to asks is our time we can do
whatever you like
I'm really glad about every questions I
don't have to type a lot so um what we
also get for free of course is oh then
didi the other most asked question is
about configuration that will just
quickly Hecate because very similar to
to Java to logging so I just
configurator actually configurator
boundary and the class name is
configurator
finish and what I can do very easily I
can just omit in configurations drink
configure this can be staged up
depending depending on server playing
environment depending whatever like the
same idea injection point and what I
usually do so I can say IP Dutch get get
member catch declaring class get name so
this is the fully qualified class name
as we had at the logger class and on the
same note we can say IP dot get good
name
this is the fifth name and having both
we have unique identifier of the field
field name I will just return so did it
multiple times but this is one of the
most popular questions I'll show you
again how to configure Java applications
and yeah with full lines of code class
dot just will used an arrow instead of
dot dot name and imagine this is going
to be fetched from a database so I just
would skip this but this could be this
could come or should come from database
this doesn't make sense of course but
watch this
what I can do right now I can now say in
the weather forecast ax let's inject
string let's say password and seems to
work storms plus
password so now I think I have to clean
everything so if you do too much you
have to clean and install the whole app
if the war is small still no problem
looks better storms as you can see call
me X weather business-focused boundary
weather forecast and password fully
qualified name it could be lookup from
property file or whatever and if you
really have to configure Java
applications now you have you know the
three lines of code with the
configuration ok I will just look
whether you have questions I suppose no
questions no questions no questions and
then something which is better maven or
Gretel Victor Sita quartz asked me this
and at the beginning I said actually
does not matter and actually for this is
let's I think projects I even have an
example for the workshops in unique so I
created a project with both and I think
Java
I'm just forgot about it actually as
examples yeah maven versus Gradle even
versus Gradle so this project has both
Gradle and mavin so I will open both so
as you can see this is the very simple
Gradle script so it's provided compiled
Java extrav a seven zero one eight one
eight
Arcanum warning so it is a little bit
more it's a little bit beautified
because there's maven vs. cradle so I
just have a variable name here which is
used here and the prom file would be
this so it's actually no difference and
what I have to say in my Java projects
that maybe the problem is never more
complex than this what I get a lot
a lot depends on the project's some
testing dependencies not runtime
dependencies but more test dependencies
so it would be basically no difference
in my case so now let's try to build it
with Gradle Gradle so it is built in two
seconds Raven clean install
it has built in 0.7 hundred milliseconds
so I mean we can do it again kredel
maybe
so now you have both in my eyes and
doesn't matter and because it doesn't
matter I use maven because there are
more books and Lori's meiosis of more
resources about maven but if the project
is not a java re' project then i would
rather suggest Gradle because there are
not so many conventions as we have in
Java so it probably easier to use Gretel
over no forcing forcing maven to do what
you would like to have so now we have
live example maven versus Gradle so um
let's see any other questions
how to increase container manage
transactions timeout English by our
default is two minutes I think five
minutes I would say what you can do you
can inject user transaction and set
transaction timeout and the transactions
as a remember could be set globally the
in container there is a transaction
service I cannot launch it right now
because I'm using white fly so this is
book thank you for the question so could
you please show us how to send a
location HTTP header to decline the with
suspended risk the rest calls so good
one so what the problem is we are using
here the consumer sorry the supplier
just surprise a JSON array but what I
will do right now is to do the following
I will just say public response with
location header just
and then we can say return return
response created and I will see where
the test works so I could so I could
news
but forget location header really does
not make any sense but I will just
created for you info get can't absolute
path builder dot path stormy ID dot
built
and what we get back is the or info
misty only say only don't don't
built and here's entity I can pass you
forecast and as with a little bit of
luck the shot worker right books
probably this is null this could be a
back from shadows so now run it but this
will be the way so you're just putting
what I know you can just send response
or even exception back so the resume has
two flavors object this could be a
response you can put you know your
headers entities whatever and exception
so throwable is also accepted some tests
and and so I just checked with the
problem with the path builder this could
be the problem
I never tried to test with and the
string is going to be a job
something like this so we get
vocationally Joe so the problem was the
null HTTP requests what you could do you
can put the context here and then we
could wrap this of course with own
supplier so we'll just keep this because
of typing but I see obviously see it
works now we have location header hey
Joe
and I think this was exactly the
question I think Sebastian should be
very lucky
so there is no cloud
no there is no cloud there's just some
okay I think we cover all questions
right so how much time do we have I
think we are done is it true deaf crowd
how much time do they have
I would like if you have no time I will
just wait for questions and then answer
all your questions okay
someone asked me asp.net MVC versus Java
GSF I think a more fair example would be
as p.net MVC versus Java 8 and vicinity
they were similar GSF is a component
framework and i support net MVC is
exactly not a component framework but um
this is p.net NB C is really nice and
has nothing to do with the old with the
old is pain from Microsoft and if you
are interest in this just look at Java
e8 MVC spec any other questions if no
questions what do you like to see so if
no questions I will probably Hecht
hacker are just a very simple JSF page
but I don't know whether you are
actually interested in this but what you
probably saw is with Java 8 it changes
you know the way how you can structured
Java Java 7 applications and what I
didn't show you it could be even more
interesting in case you you would have
JPA for instance because you get in
