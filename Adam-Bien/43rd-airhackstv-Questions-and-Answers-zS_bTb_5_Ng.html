to the 43rd edition of ax TV special
edition with java 1 2017 coverage and
there's lot to lots of materials so it's
really hard to tell whether we will made
it in one hour so to start with the
content so first there is the web
standards ignitor workshop is online it
is already bought by it's from several
countries and I got a good feedback
which is actually surprising because in
this Vikram I'm not using any fencing
fancy framework I'm implementing a set
of examples with nothing but vanilla
JavaScript and CSS and the idea is to
implement something which looks like
Java without any external libraries is
exactly what I do with Java so I usually
just used the Java EE application
servers or Java API without any external
libraries and the same for the web web
stuff so what this is the web stand as
the training is the URI and if you like
check it out so this is the first one
then at Java one so a Java one there is
a talk Java heavyweight versus or
lightweight so what I did a full hour so
you can check it out here let's click on
that and stop it immediately so this is
the this is the the talk and what I try
to explain is order what I did is I
actually measured the full hour the
microserver swarms and compared them
with a full application service and what
I also did this I measure the
performance with full monitoring
activated and yeah this is what I did
and why I did it because I get lots of
questions in projects and ear hacks and
know what about about more lightweight
technologies and actually was completely
confused I didn't even I didn't even
know what heavy weight and and light
weight actually means and this is how
the workshop started so this is the news
check it out it has already uploaded
there should be another talk called like
micro service-driven simplification it
was also recorded but is not uploaded
yet by Java
and what's also interesting
unfortunately was not recorded I also
delivered a session called like the Java
istic way to implement html5 apps and
what I did is actually what I also did
in the web standards training course I
implemented a full stack applications
with nothing but Stata standards
unfortunately this talk was not recorded
so okay this is a job one about about
Java one what I recorded is almost a
tradition
three minutes video and with some
impression so this is the first time the
Java one took place in Moscone West as
far as I remember it happens only once
it was in the year 2002 where Java one
had 30,000 attendees and now it is
closer to the to the Oracle OpenWorld
and I have to say I really like the
location
there was didi routes are very closed
didi didi walking so you didn't spend
another full break just to walk between
the hotels and yeah and the content was
great so I attended I don't know 12
hours a day yes just talks and and and
really liked the the content and the
problem was at actually no time you know
to drink something
so um sometimes I went out from Java one
and and grab a coffee and then proceeded
with the talks they only missed I think
two slots because of that and then
attended you know the full range of
topics surprisingly also this is for
instance the break as you can see
there's a queueing going on to the food
and what's surprising I met some a hex
attendee so many X TV attendees from all
over the world which really surprised me
and even some from us so from from from
Austin Texas and one from India so um
this really surprised me I thought you
know X is not that popular but it
actually is which which was a really
nice surprise
um was organized and
and attendee hex attendee asked me would
you like to drink something
and my answer was this is Java one and
not Oktoberfest we you are for hacking
and not not in a drinking and then I met
him in the coffee and we had a nice talk
okay
this is what the keynote Java one
keynote which was one of the best
keynote since Oracle stewart's Java the
content was nice even the sponsor or
part from Intel was was interesting and
and what was revealed in the keynote
several projects there was the event
projects and this was functions for java
servlets and EE 4j so multiple projects
were revealed and and the what's also
interesting the there was a nun
management change and I think the name
of the guy is mr. mr. garvik and and
he's now in charge of Java or Java
clouds and mr. kovitch was back then at
was in the charge of no GS and and now
is in charge of Java which is which is
really really good news right so this is
like the exposition area so you saw some
3d printers and now this is the another
keynote this was the community keynote
and there was also an Oracle code
keynote going on so we had three
keynotes but the best one was the Java
one the Oracle code keynote was also
there is the name is code there was
actually no code there there was there
was more high level so I like the Java
keynote better and the community keynote
was more fun so there was the walking
area between two conferences and now we
are done with the Java on coverage so
focus now on the content and back to the
back to the to our slides no slouch due
to the other topic so I get daily email
emails what's about the direction Munich
Airport so all the work
we'll take place there or the
well-attended and the one note the most
common question is the most popular
question is whether there are seats
available and my answer is always yes
they are but it soon they will not be
because I get many concurrent requests
about the number of seats so optimistic
lock exception may happen one point of
time and right now we have still the
largest room available but what I always
do I try to downgrade the room because
because at the same time there are other
conferences and events from Audi and BMW
and whoever are going on and what I try
to do is to offer the rooms you know
back to the to the to the management of
the of the conference venue and because
we have really good relations with them
so what I will do it soon I will just
try to get you know smaller rooms for
all the all these slots and then there
will be no seats available so this is
the whole boxed backstory backstory
backstory with D which Direction's here
now what's also interesting is eclipse
micro profile one two and I get lots of
questions about micro profile and Java
II and I ignore it for one year why
because there was no added value to
using micro profile over full Java EE
service and you know having a swarm or
just a single jar doesn't makes
absolutely no difference in my project
so what I always suggest and it always
did I never use swarm or payara micro in
production I I always use the full
server and and didn't consider even to
use the micro profile now what happened
there is a micro profile one two out and
as you can see there is some things
going on like for instance there is a
config one one configuration API which I
mean it's somehow interesting what's
even more interesting is you get health
check and has metrics API is available
and they are well documented so all
application servers will expose that and
the really interesting part is the GWT
GWT jot jot propagation to Jayson web
token propagation and actually I get on
every xdv a question
about that and this would be an integral
part of the micro profiles so I think
now it's time to look at the micro
profile because you get there now a true
benefit of using that so you don't have
to implement by yourself all application
service will implement that and having
that set what also happened is this Java
in 9 is going to be or is going to be
open source but the open source of Java
8 was announced by Oracle and and
everything is going to be open source
what it means is even the tcks
this is the test compatibility kit which
was close source right now so it will be
a very very easy to implement your own
application service if you like and even
the specs is are going to be open source
the specs a little bit more tricky
because there are many contributors and
there might be a problem with the with
licensing or copyright issues but the
intention is to open source everything
and this is going to be eclipse project
in the name is easy for J and this is
Eclipse Eclipse Enterprise for Java and
this is going to be a top-level project
so having said that I really didn't like
the name so Eclipse Enterprise for Java
I wanted myself you know what what does
it weigh Eclipse I mean Eclipse is not a
in my eyes it's not a great brand name
outside the Java community inside and
then for Java developers everyone knows
Eclipse but you know what's the deal
with Eclipse and it turned out this was
the most pragmatic solution or selection
so there were you know there were
discussions with other groups but they
were not as parametric pragmatic as
eclipse and every Eclipse project has to
have Eclipse name in it and what I
remember this actually there is an
eclipse link project this was the old
top link was migrated to eclipse is
actually persistent from GlassFish or
payara
and this is just no eclipse link and I
almost forgot about that as well as ok
eclipsing eclipsing but it's actually
Eclipse project so it take lips has to
be there so the enterprise
I mean Enterprise Java is ok and this 4
is important because without therefore
there will be some issues with Cray
Mark's so only if there is a for Java
therefore we have many friends that look
for J and SL for J therefore this 4 is
important for legal issues so the only
choice we have is to use the name and
then I'm fine with that so the naming
discussions are over so this is what
happens with eclipse of course what
would be nice or very important is so if
we knew projects we will start at
eclipse they should start with Java X
dot and not orc Eclipse otherwise we get
to know some parts with Java X dot CDI
and the other ones with Eclipse
something so it would be important to
have one consistent package naming so
this is um this will be an important end
the micro profile dot what I showed you
earlier this 1 dot 2 this is also an
eclipse project and this MVC Model View
controller project is also an eclipse
project so I think it is an owl at a lot
easier to put everything into one onto
one umbrella and and what also
interesting what happens between the
order relation between e4j and micro
profile and my suspicion is going to be
I guess the micro profit would be more
like incubator and this e4j a more
stable project but this is a really good
movement and for me I mean it is great
so what I did before is I already
recorded on video about Jason binding
and I was actually not not convinced the
way the conventions are set with Jason B
it means only public field methods
methods are going to be CL is not
private in order to have private methods
theorization you will have to configure
this properly so what I did I opened up
and pull request and suggested my
solution so it's actually are way easier
to collaborate then than before because
before you had to write in a lots of
emails and at an end-of-day you've wrote
5 mix of text and there was still still
no snow no no success inside so great
news actually so this is that and
project FN so there is an FN project at
i/o so actually i knew before the java
one that something like this will come
out
I was not very I would say I was very
neutral with that because I mean
serverless and functions are everywhere
but I played with that and I have to say
the way how it is implemented is really
interested why I like that
very simple I recorded a video actually
on YouTube about that it's still the
YouTube tab open
let's see YouTube if you have 6 mins
time or even so this is the server last
Java with function developer kit this is
the fdk function developer kit and that
why I recorded a video because the way
outs implement is really interesting so
you only have to implement a POJO
without any external dependencies and
you can deploy this POJO right away to
to the server a server which happens to
be the FN project and then call it via
rest so it is like a modern era my
remote method invocation and this is
actually could be very interested
interesting even in my projects because
I could for instance deploy a function
and to wrap a native code and the native
code would for instance be I don't know
some you know health insurance
computation or whatever this for
instance and it's some project we always
had to know some PDF converter
converters and and print jobs and this
could be actually implemented it this
way so for some specific cases really
interesting and good or like the most is
this simplicity and 0 external
dependencies so the project is called FN
projects it's fully open source and it
is on github and the great story is it
was open sourced on stage at JavaOne oh
forget to mention this at the Java 1
keynote what there was also there was an
analyst from rat rat monk I think this
is miss mr. governor
he already he already attended Java ones
earlier or community at some times at
some times it is one of the analysts
Praja with also a great talk what he
said like in the Java ecosystem more
happen in the last three weeks than the
last in no 10 years this is what he said
and yeah this somehow true so what I
really liked is the spirit you know the
fresh air is like as sometimes an Oracle
and I think is mainly caused by the by
management change which I really
appreciate so now seems like Oracle
invests in developers again which is
which is crucial so also we had some
conversations about micro profile in e4j
and I was asking now what is my opinion
do we still need a JB's in my answers if
we manage to implement you know pulling
metrics and so forth in CDI and we get
one stereotype one only annotations we
can kill eg bees immediately and then go
with CDI
but I'm absolutely not interested in
building my own stereotypes you know
just to have the same behaviors in GB so
this is the whole point so and now we
have I think more more chances to do
this in micro profile than before so
this was also an interesting and now
start with the questions so let's see so
someone I get the question a lot people
who bought my book book all the examples
were in Java I patents were the examples
are now and the question is nowhere on
my machine in the backup what I will do
I will probably create a github projects
and and and push one by one the examples
again but because I would like to clean
cleanup them a little bit and not push
everything so this is actually my to do
so how do you achieve dynamic creation
of messagelistener in Java is seven so
on you can create message listeners in
Java 7 than you can register dynamically
to a queue not problem with that so you
can just pick the queue energy snare you
as listener and with the concurrency
utilities you can even implement this in
in fairly good way and it but it is not
a message to mean it is just a class
which would implement the GMs listener
interface and yeah this is this and what
you are asking probably is or what
museum meta fee asks is and whether it
is possible to create queues on the fly
and the answer is yeah it is but not
wire JMS so you will have to use you
know the whitefly specific API here or
the artemis api here and this is what
you could do but there is no api I'm
aware
of where you can use the API to
dynamically create queues and
dynamically deploy JMS message groovy
music would actually ask asking but what
you can do it can dynamically register
as a Gemma's listener so programmer cito
asked me so I guess the question is what
is the relation between HTTP timeout and
the SSO timeout and the answer is there
is actually no relation between between
both so if you if you time out from a
single sign-on what will happen the
server will usually you redirect you to
the Tuda login service this is what will
happen and and JWT is not a solution
this is what I don't get GWT is just
like protocol protocol to carry data
between the service and to encode data
so you can add additional payload
encoded as a JWT and and sent the
message from server to server this is
what GWT is for and the SSO solution
like a clock or open a.m. they are the
solutions to implement timeout properly
so um Oh VM does I guess this is the
virtual machine VM ask me thanks a ton
for doing a hex qua a QA sorr thank
thank thank you for watching actually
and that you are accepting this because
for me is a huge time-saver I don't have
you know to open my mail client that
often with a hex so what factors do you
consider before choosing server-side
rendering frameworks or J's frameworks
like react I mean fairly is the answer
if you have to provide an API
application programming interface flow
for other clients at like rest then
something like react or angular is the
natural choice but JSF for instance is
very productive so if you don't have you
know specific requirements and you build
something for yourself there is another
big deal to you
F I mean just go with JSF and of course
the question is not server-side
rendering rather than what the framework
is service centric or client centric
this is the DD DD answer and there is
some obvious choice of course as well if
the app has to be offline capable it is
really hard to implement a JSF because
in order to interact with the server you
need an internet connection but what you
could do you could implement an
JavaScript application which is like a
Phet client completely offline capable
and only from time to time communicate
with the server and actually building
one now right now and JavaScript
application which is completely offline
capable and and this application doesn't
even need the server so this is of
course it will be never possible with
JSF or it could be possible but then it
will just load the JSF once and never
ever again so the patterns in my book
Java e patterns written for Java 7
whether they still hold true for Java 7
and Java 8 absolutely this is actually
the reason why I don't write another
edition what I could do write some more
patterns because with Java 7 in Java 8
more patterns are possible although
there are view things and properly I
could even do this just no update the
book with new patterns but the content
already available is absolutely ok I of
course will have to read the book but I
just look at the implementation recently
and this is still ok now the question is
um you have a Java image for dhaka uses
open JDK why that and why not Oracle JDK
well I started with Oracle JDK
everything was always Oracle JDK and
actually in all my commercial project it
is usually Oracle JDK I my server it was
Oracle JDK but someone asked the
question now what about open JDK then I
switch to know the server first my own
server to open JDK and instruct well and
then the docklands all the docklands
projects are now open JDK in it also
works there are no complains here and a
huge benefit of open JDK is that the
open JDK is easier to install than the
Oracle batarus no licensing terms to
accept it just installs Susie aam
install open JDK and you are set
important news from Java one and by the
way there is a blog post and I'm being
blocked from me who which summarizes all
the Java on a bad way this is fun you
should look at this this is Sebastian -
- by the way all a hex attendee and
Sebastian and and the others I
interviewed them performed an interview
20 minutes interview with all people I
could meet you know under and in at the
hole and ask them some questions but
this are the the Java news and one thing
what I forgot is is the following that
there will be no binary depend
differences between open JDK and Oracle
JDK so what it means that in one point
in time I don't know one year half a
year and it will not matter whether you
will use open JDK or Oracle JDK it is
more like you know the different
difference between white fly and JBoss
something like this and and you will get
goodbye support for the Oracle JDK and
and I guess so and not for the open JDK
but there will be binary the same and of
course this is an old news in eighteen
three this is 2018 March there will be
new JDK and the name is not Java on ten
it will be Java 18.3 and the feature
already which will come is exactly this
you will you you you are going to be
able to use all this typo here stuff
like this like new ArrayList here was
the VAR like in the old JavaScript so we
get type inference so and this is the
project am BAM okay cool where's my tab
here so let's see what happens in in the
chat
ah very good Monsieur Doubront the micro
service and cloud Riven simplification
is life so I will add it to my
conference list which is really nice
what I did in this session is I try to
show how much code you can delete if you
if you are if you are you
micro-services seriously this was
actually the idea here so if you like
check it out thank you
so what's okay no news yeah so now we
covered that web standards online
workshops here thank you
I'm really glad you like it again
because unusual way to implement html5
Epsom by the way the reason why I
recorded this web standard workshops is
because I get many requests the clients
ask me now what we should do we had an
angular old to which technology we
should migrate this year and say okay if
you just rely on web standards to be no
migrations so actually the name the
title of the virtual should be you know
migrations are over so this would be a
nice title so when you are using key
clock how do you handle additional user
properties and what is properly meant is
this that if you have JSON web token you
can encode additional properties
additional payload and you can transport
this between micro-services on between
the client and the backend and and the
question is can you do this with with
key clock the answer is yes and I think
this is called properties key clock
properties so um and the is it it's good
or bad I mean this is a nice way to
remain stateless right if you if you
encode everything in JSON web token you
don't need the session you can pass
everything back and forth and and you
are set so this is this is done I think
yeah so this is what I can tell you and
the other question is users
microservices actually also what we did
before so the question is similar so um
before Keelung injured and the typical
enterprise application so there is
authentication and authorization and
what happened before is if the
authentication also work always work
with no enterprise database like LDAP or
exam is called Active Directory
Microsoft Active Directory but sometimes
we need additional data and and for
for authorization and what we did we
implemented user service and we use the
user ID as a primary key so you are more
flexible and actually if you look at the
old ax TV what I often do is I inject
the create my own principal inject the
principal and use the username of the
locked-in user as a key and go to my own
user service and fetch my properties so
if you need in our custom properties or
a more complicated set up I would go
with my own user service so you are not
depending on on key o'clock it's always
good to minimize dependencies to
external services okay so which is the
best way to handle money currency in
bigdecimal what is the what is the
suggestion and so let's see there's a
java community process and if you go
here four three five four this is a spec
and the name is money and currency so
your task is now download the spec and
look what they did and I think the spec
lead is from from Credit Suisse so yes
so he exactly knows what what he's
talking and writing about so download
this and you will see you know what they
are doing and then if what you should do
is to use a things called attribute
convert and then you can have your own
money class so this is what what would
you should do after the axe at night so
done how how did to do test Jack Sora's
resources behind key clock as security
mechanism I think the question is rather
would you like to test key clock or
jax-rs because if you just would like to
test jax-rs you don't have to have a key
cloak installed and but let's say you
have you have to test everything at once
so I'm even at Docklands I think there's
already a key clock docker image so what
you can always do you can have your own
key clock in in a test environment
running on docker with fake accounts and
test that this will be probably the best
possible way because you can test the
hosts
so you could create a a docker file with
key clock and and use the your service
and both together and they could
communicate just for you know test you
can have a different set of micro
services for test a different for
integration and different for production
this is what usually happens having said
that you are probably talking about
system tests and for plain system tests
key clock must not be required so if it
is then go with your test installation
okay so and do not think about the money
where is the JCP so we need another jcpl
here is it there is there was these
three six three and this is units of
measurement so if you have similar
problems you know how to map I don't
know meters so take a look at that
yeah units of measurement this both
specs has nothing to do with javi but
hence there a standardized look at this
first okay cool now question here two
years deploy to the same tables each
containing a jar EG b jar with EG obese
with different versions so when one
resource and year uses an e gb nothing
else where will it take it from so if
you setup JBoss properly properly means
i remember several years ago there was a
unified class loader in jboss which is
actually not java compliant as if you're
using the old unified class loader you
will see everything and the answer is I
don't know what it will load but usually
you have two class loaders to ear class
loaders and then each year is isolated
so you should only see the Egypt HR the
EJB jar from your ear and not from the
other so so this is answered yes so and
if you use remote communication we did
it before we wanted to communicate
between ears
this is I think 10 years ago so what you
have to do is you have to set up a core
ba eyewear this is I oh I oh are this is
I think I don't even know what it means
anymore
IOR is like unique identifier and then
you could you could you could inject
this with at remote and who's the
addition to reference with the
diplomatic script oh and you can talk
between between ears what I absolutely
not recommend okay so question how much
of logging you advice for an application
and what I start if I mean the projects
are logging and configuration they are
still hot topics in projects because you
can discuss a lot without implementing
anything it's just no nice nice small
talk first so what I do is I say I do
not lock nothing so logging is forbidden
in my project so does my first vert and
what I try to achieve is I take a look
you know at the ad audience Direction
reaction and what I what usually happens
is someone is really interested in
logging
this is operations or business
department or or an a stakeholder and
they tell me then you know hard
requirements why they need locks so if
you think about this in the year 2017
this is really strange what we are doing
so we are writing in a text file first
and then you know ten seconds later we
are reading from the same text file and
hope we will find the information there
without testing then we or often we we
just ignore the locks completely then
buy expensive tools in order to process
the locks so what is a lot batteries
would be is to know to to to consider an
entry in a log file as an event and send
the event not to a log file just to
somewhere else like for instance you can
write it directly to elasticsearch so
structured logging is actually this what
I would advise you and not you know to
write log files first okay so how to
convince write either suggest F is fast
I think faster means more productive it
can be used in a typical enterprise
application so
mean how to convincing them I mean the
question is should we convinced them at
all what you should do is is just
present some facts the only problem is
with with with just FS if you would for
instance rely on primefaces components
and plan VIN primefaces wins out of
business then you have a problem so this
should be a clear strategy what to do
then but the same is true with angular
of course if you have using angular
material and there's no more support
then you have similar problems so there
should be you know I and B what happens
if you will have to maintain primefaces
by your own so I know lots of projects
we don't do not use any component
libraries then of course it will you
know you can you can be sure that the
next I would say five to ten years J's
every will be still around and what
happened is in Java eight GS F two three
are out and they have full support for
for h2 which means there have the unique
advantage that JSF knows what to load
because it knows exactly which resources
were loaded and then it can proactively
push the resources to the browser and
then is a really fast so without JSF it
is only possible with custom build
scripts and I also recorded an video
session about that
take a second this is the not play all
let's see play all please don't play so
this is HTTP to push with servlets for
all so I present you in this video how
HTTP 2 works and JSF 2 3 are already
taking advantage with that I actually
thought to record another video just
about that because yeah it is actually
fun to watch ok so next one so we are
here ok robot brain asks me and I think
Robert is also one of the exit Indies so
he uses to Jason construct a JSON object
and he is happy which is very good one
thing I don't like is following null
values in JSON object builder and he
she used decorate overground so what you
can use right now is Jason B this is
Jason binding and they have explicit
strategy how to handle null values and I
didn't looked at this article but with
Jason B what he with Jason P with the P
so the current implementation is if you
read the objects you can of course
specify a default value this is what
what works yeah and what you could do of
course is in the constructor from the
what so what he's referring is there was
my blog post for me Jason new DTO I hope
this is the right name and what I did is
I created this JSON object and of course
input gets twink if there is no name you
get you get another point exception but
you can specify a second parameter a
default name what probably will solve
your problem is to provide here not a
default name so something like a
provider methods which would be called
on-demand
this could solve the problem or you can
specify null and then in case it's not
available this this becomes null so I
think the problem is what you have is
you would like to have this with JSON
objects and not only with with primitive
values but decorator would work of
course yeah so you can have you know
your own JSON object decorator and with
your null value behavior okay
thank you so what is the best practice
to increment out the increment increment
out recommend the release version of
Java in maven projects I use Rudy's
plugin for that in Java he projects or
not is just to increment the version of
the poem version and if the poem version
if you if you create the war
maven will package the pom.xml to meter
and if classes somewhere meet and
classes I think and you can load this so
then it's already solved because you can
ask you know a Java project was your
version and the rest interface looks up
the poem parses the poem and the returns
diversion yeah this is already automated
in my case having said that it really
does not matter anymore the version of T
Java because what only matters the
version of the API of the jax-rs
so we are not versioning the war we are
versioning you know the API this is what
would met us okay
and I would use semantic versioning as
versioning scheme December dork so it's
already standardized so I would use that
okay now Monsieur jai jai jai rightists
asking speaking about friendly ORS in
Java projects he used OC pierre-yves
right and now switches to MBC and what's
about my MVC Ozark about a user friendly
Horace it's absolutely possible this MVC
is based on jax-rs and jax-rs
allows you know friendlier ease so just
go with that and JSF pages you can do
this with JSF pages as well I think it's
called it was was featured in Java is
six or Java 7
you could have get requests with custom
URI in jf pages this is what you could
do with MVC is absolutely not a problem
because it is as powerful as Jax bass
playing jax-rs now I wrote a blog post
about why it's impossible to have
optimistic - to handle optimistic LOC
exception properly
and he says but if the optimistic lock
exception is thrown at the end of
transactions this is always the case
how can handle the exception so you can
handle the exception always if you have
jacks or s you could of course handle
the exception because jax-rs
is invoked after the accept exception
yeah of the exception and after the
transaction and yet I mean what I what I
meant here in this in this post is there
is no handling strategy because
optimistic lock exception means
something become inconsistent and if
something is inconsistent it is
impossible for machine to resolve the
error this is what I actually meant and
can you catch the exception yes you can
so what you can could even do is you
could even have an requires new layer
let's say GB has requires new and
committed transaction and another egb
starts the transaction and it's not does
nothing else then then catching the
exception and and and reacting to
reacting to it okay and now what I
prefer is optimistic or pessimistic
locking of course I mean of course
pessimistic is way easier it's a problem
is you cannot use cluster because you
are locking a resource forever and if
something looks up everything extremely
unstable but it would be actually
perfect so but it doesn't work so in
distributed environments and doesn't
work on because of doesn't work we have
to use optimistic lock exceptions so if
we goofy lock optimistically what we
need a great you know idea what happens
in case an optimistic lock exception
happens and what I observe in Java EE
projects so far this optimistic lock
exception was in in vast majority of all
cases completely ignored so no one was
interested in handing the optimistic
lock exception which is extremely bad
it's like you know no one will react to
two conflicts in in get like like this
so I'm actually the same problem so what
you will have to do is you have to
actually the best possible solution list
to design your business process in this
way that optimistic clock exceptions
rarely happens
this would mean if you I mean if you if
you draw the parallel to to development
as if you if you would implement a a a
development process it would be
important that that two developers are
not working on the same modules and
therefore conflicts cannot happen so
this is what would be the best okay down
then hi Adam this is Monsieur met so and
he is writing a little pet project so
they just write what it is it would be
interesting to know then it could give
you a better examples and he's asking me
know what I can do is qualify and
producers by the way with producers I
gave you already an example this was the
authorization so you can inject your own
principle with your own data this would
be unproduced qualifier you would need
in your pet project let's say your pet
project has a payment
interface so with qualifiers you can
introduce many payment providers or
let's say we are the questions with
loggers so what you could do you could
have you know emergency logger with a
qualifier emergency and an audit logger
was the qualifier audit and the
emergency logger would would would write
to pager duty and the and the audit
logger to internal database for instance
so and he keeps created objects in
current hash method correct object pool
so concurrent hash map and object pools
are object pools are extremely
suspicious so don't do this actually
stateless eg bees are already pulled the
question is do you need a pool or a
cache so the difference is the object
pulled all the objects are just reused
because of performance issues which is
no other case and cache means the object
has data and we don't like to access the
data over and over again so therefore
you need a cache and I guess with the
concurrent hash map you probably would
like to have a cache my advice would be
you know forgot all caches measure the
performance with jmeter who is apache
jmeter for instance first and if is a
good enough then you know
about caching I hope it's clear so how
how do you handle data source
configuration in a docker environment so
I think the issue is probably so you
have different user credentials
different integration stages and then
the answer is all the application
servers do a support so-called
environment and entries replacement
variables and how it works is you have a
placeholders in your white flag
configuration so it will set up the data
source first using command-line
interface or gmx just watch videos that
show you how you could write
automatically the the the xml
configuration whitefly and then use you
know and open an editor and replace
username passwords or or or ease or
whatever varies between stages with
placeholders and then on the startup
with taka you can have with - e - e
variable you can you can specify
environment entries and they are going
to be replaced by white flight Tommy or
PI era at startup so this is what we can
do so is it possible to have requests
coped with suspended asyncresponse
and the answer is no what I mean you can
have requests coped and inject things to
a class and request scoped is that
method level so in this method you can
still access request scoped but within
the asyncresponse you cannot access the
request scope why because request scope
means requests and a response and the
suspended means this thing is as
executed incomplete new threat and this
new let's imagine I'm used to suspended
I am downloading a video a movie and
takes two hours but my request scoped is
only now for one millisecond it just
initiates the requests and comes back so
therefore you cannot have in DISA
spended a reference to the request
scoped objects yes
and some solution I mean the solution
would be the question is why you need
the reference the request coped so this
is the dhih dhih dhih the main question
I have usually you should be able to get
to know everything you need from
asyncresponse
so this is this would be this is the
answer yeah and actually this is it
identical problem to asynchronous and in
transactions so if you have a
synchronous and egb method gets invoked
asynchronous method this method is
always executed in a new transaction so
just the same problem the best way to
implement a batch job with over a
million data rows from our database so
million is not it's not a lot filters
them maps them to entities on J and D
TOS
actually I got very similar requests in
our commercial projects by the way no
not similar requested the client asked
me to implement batch drop with Java 7
batch API and I said ok maybe
interesting but what what is why we need
Java 7 for this why not plain Java C and
what I did I implemented a small project
which is surprisingly popular and let's
see whether I find it and hit rate up
and this is just oh and he trained tour
so this is the project and it is only
based on Java Java se8 no Java no
external dependencies a little bit of
nice one and what we can do this just
single dependency with some video so you
can take a look at the video and the
idea is you have a input then input is
converted automatically to ro and then
you can filter transform and then write
it or wherever you like and I think we
have JDBC pojos mapping and see as
viii and Jason but you can you can
implement by your own joke and you have
transformed you and yeah this is you can
build your own pipeline which I've ate
so take a look at this probably it is a
good enough and in my recent projects we
built a batch execution solution built I
think I spent one day or one half day to
implement that with job a7 and this is
like configurable timer service which
executors chops in via rest interface so
I would look at this first and
performance in transaction I mean with
Java 7 is really very good performance
on so why is realization works
differently of Jason objects when it is
wrapped in a POJO as compared to
adjacent objects realized directly and
the answer is because if a JSON object
is wrapped in a POJO
then a different specification kicks in
called Jack's B this is going to be
solved in Java e8 because we get Jason B
which is the replacing of Jack's B for
Jason so I'm take a look at the video
about Jason B does the solution so far
the problem is you have right now this
Jason serialization highly depends which
provider are you using so if you using
jettison you get other format then
Jackson and there was a little bit
dangerous to work with Jack's be
directly so this is the reason okay so
Jason object is standardized and
sterilization from from from from pojos
this is your object to Jason is not
standardized victor order I think this
is one of the hackers and I always get a
sausage from him he attends a hex which
is really nice and handy really the
strangest stories there's a very very
famous badger in his town and his name
is like my last name is Ben which is
very rare and yeah so I always get a
sausages from him so which is very good
why because I'm not too lightweight you
know so I still remain I would say on
the ear level ok now he asked me what's
the difference that is actually a great
question between my qualifier doing this
way and using the annotation literal
and the answer is to wait a second I
will close the tabs first so the
annotation literal here if you go to the
source code it is a little bit optimized
so equals and hashcode is really well
implemented there is some caching going
on inside and to string is implemented
so actually you should use the
annotation literal having said that I so
far I didn't use it in my project I have
to admit I like you know his solution
with implementing doing this so you have
to implement one more method but you
don't need this dependency but the
correct the correct answer is to use the
annotation literal and and you could
achieve better performance so it was not
measurable in my case okay so now
question about security in Java apps and
his question is about JPA level security
first encrypt the data in a data base
level so in one approach in one of my
project did the data base encrypts the
data but this is transparent to us so we
access the data but in database encrypts
the data so there is nothing to do for
us and he asked me now what's the if you
would like to have a data level security
what to do and the answer is what you
will have to do is you will have to use
provider specific features like a thing
is called hibernate filters and the same
implementation the same feature is an
eclipse link not in JPA and why because
Java is seven was supposed to be cloud
and multi-tenant for cloud environments
and then it was rejected but most of the
persistence providers still have the
capability to be multi tenant so um and
this is what you usually need not for
multi-tenancy rather than for multi user
so particular users only would like to
see particular rows in the table so you
will have to implement this by yourself
and if your database is an encrypted I
just wondering why you need this because
if your database is encrypted you should
not
and decrypt the entities as well so I
think use encrypted database it's a
little bit slower but it should be
transparent for your needs so yeah and
so what you will have to do you'll have
to enhance the queries so that no the
user Duke will only use the only CD rows
by user Duke a little bit more
complicated is if the user Duke Collins
to see specific columns of the row what
you will need to do then is to select a
full entity and then depending on the
user visibility trance transform
whatever you need to the JSON object and
this is actually were also dapat and
with the JSON object is great where was
it this was that with the to Jason
because with to Jason you can have
principles specific object poggio to
jason theorization cool so where this
was already covered this was covered
you see Danny law Danilo Piazza so this
is a nice name so in the web standards
ignite on and workshop he recommends
that so thank you for this I'm using
bind in JavaScript functions passed to
event handler so what means brand in
JavaScript it means what you can do is
JavaScript what you cannot do is Java I
can pick a method in JavaScript and say
hey this function this method or a do it
in this workshop in a method so inside a
class I bind it always to the instance
of this object and then that this sticks
forever with the methods regardless what
I am doing there is no way to know to
change the meaning of the disk if you
don't do this and with the bind you can
in JavaScript you know change what this
actually means and there was an old pet
and var which is the old es 5 self
equals does this so what you could do
back then is you can say before I invoke
this in a method or in a function I safe
that this in self and then and then use
that so this is no more needed if you
use bind so I think bind is cleaner
seven hours ago ago so this is the last
question so from the definition of micro
service must be independent and
autonomous autonomous so it is it that
means that must carry the data base with
him yes absolutely this would be the
best yes how we could manage such
situation only if you understand the
business logic good enough you can
handle the situation and and usually
this is not a problem at all so why in
several projects we have histories ation
tables for instance and what it means
historian table is you know for instance
our client at or insured person at that
time had different contract and now but
it needs a whole history so if you have
something like this you could actually
implement so what's about that it's
about copying data at various time
stamps so if you do this what you could
do you could introduce two microservices
one history zation service and another
you know the client service and usually
there's a better name for the easter
ization it's like you know insurance
contracts and then current and that good
insurances but if you have to micro
services and to databases then you don't
have the problem so the question is
whether I think that Java 8 can be used
in production absolutely not we only
have glass 55 having said that there is
pi RR v alpha available and when payara
fool is available then you can use java
8 in production with glasses v5 you
could of course use but you have to test
a lot or a question is you know the I
guess you are not going to in production
tomorrow then what I will do I will test
with glass would be 5 watch PI Erica is
Crowley closely then you know ask them
what they are doing and even if you
production why not you know to setup
contract with them and then you get you
know the if something goes wrong you get
great support and then you can go to
production this is what I will do
ok I think I have all the topics for
today which is amazing my secret plan
was to split the EXO to two episodes but
we are set even with Java on news let's
see what happens here no I don't know
why the chat
so client the last time but I got
question from Monsieur Tucker's also an
old ear hacker if you started to have a
lot of exception classes would you end
up with a messaging exception package no
even if I have lots of exceptions
usually the exceptions will if you have
messaging for instance then you will
have a messaging package which not about
exceptional fully rather than about you
know messenger and and message service
and then I will also put the exceptions
so I don't think there is any case where
you should create your own exception
package except you are building an
exception framework okay what's up here
so no questions here you had a questions
before and the question was the question
was something here how to build a
distributed a forge a app databases
libraries architectures and queues the
question is unusual because why would
like to be distributed so distributed
per se is not an added value it just
complicates things actually my big best
practices don't distribute so I will
always start with a monolith and try to
stick with it
I only distribute applications if there
is there is really significant added
value and significant added values you
can explain the Edit value to any Java
developer equal to developer say look I
have to implement F to distribute my app
because and if the because is clearly
explainable then goes distribution
otherwise you know there are lots of
almost failed micro service projects
because the architects decided to have
you know 10 micro services without
knowing why and this is great for
contractors to solve the problems but
this is really bad for the clients ok I
hope who you are set right now there are
no questions here no questions here chat
if the chat chat is offline or not let's
see what happens here here hacks here
hax even better hacking the here so
thank you and one question is if you can
drop me on what is the quality was the
Ustream live streaming this is good
for you because I'm thinking about now
switching the providers there will be
opportunity to do something else but if
you're happy I will stick with I would
stick with with Ustream and streaming
okay so no questions here no question in
the chat so I would say thank you for
watching and if you like Java check out
the web standards training so this is
like the Java istic way to implement
html5 apps and if you interested in
Munich so the next version workshops are
around the corner so see you at
conferences workshops know more at
JavaOne hopefully next year even my
talks gets accepted and so long check
out the online talks I will also
announce them next week and thank you
for watching thank for all the questions
and bye
