hot here so one month is over so and we
have lots of questions so let's start
with the very very first question and
this is actually the last but i forgot
to gather it and this is from robert
haschke and he asked me something
interesting with the open source swift
beat the power of java in Sector what's
your opinion so first I think Swift is
really interesting but the question is
why Java EE is interesting at all and I
would say it's not about the language at
least not in my case or it seems like oz
in case of my clients or customers it is
what i think is unbeatable in java ee is
the fact that you basically has you can
download one one API one platform and
you have whatever you need everything is
one place and then you can choose the
application server so you don't have to
think about the you know the the
individual frameworks first so you can
concentrate on the on the business logic
and regardless how how are compelling
Swift is going to be i would say what
Swift will will need is something like a
set of usable api swell bundled together
an usable way so installation should be
very easy and what we will be also nice
if you would get support from multiple
vendors at the same time then we would
compete with java ee so i would i would
hope it would be nice this with two will
get some some some popularity I am I I
really like it but I think we cannot
compare language with a platform and
therefore I don't think it would be
chubby having that said lots of new
project are starting with java and and
what we were able to do is you know to
to set up everything in half a day and
and then the with implemented some use
cases in a half a day without even
thinking about the t frameworks and d
and the possible combinations
so um and the neck question from Robert
is the first one is if you would like to
have a rest api as a front of state for
business logic and is it possible with
jax-rs and the answer is of course Chuck
Soros is just a servlet so and HTTP
session should work and therefore also
session scoped and and the question is
is it is it a good idea or not and yeah
from the if you can avoid it avoid it
right so our stateless api's are always
better but in case you need to state so
it is convenient you know to just to
rely on the state then you can
absolutely do it and let's see what they
were able to find it I think it was an
atom being one line and HTTP let's see
what I will find it and this is the only
thing I forgot to look up and I think it
was cooking manager you need a cookie
manager it's an old post a thing is this
very old 14 years old so what this is
this is a jack sir as client and what it
does is it just sends all the cookies
back and all the cookies also means this
jsessionid so it makes actually
whatever's http-based also jax-rs
stateful and actually tested with Chuck
Torrez back then since then never again
but then I tested with checks or s and
even was Hessian so with this thing was
this line of code which belongs to jdk
you can even make whatever like
http-based stateful and this is the jack
souris clan if you would like you know
to hit this from the browser from
angularjs the rest api you will also
have to send back and force the the
cookie with the contrary I think it's
jsessionid is the standard so I'm nice
nice question so then back to the
regular questions and Oh someone have
real TV this is and this is a recursion
so I see you know myself on the rule TV
is getting better and better hey Robert
hello to your TV and I think since the
last show a show we are sending in full
HD so I'm really curious about the
qualities or ping me I'm really curious
about equality and the care tested
myself so first question do you see
JavaScript frameworks in your work yet
do you see mvvm becoming popular so
still I would say eighty percent of my
work is is enterprise and also it's /
enterprise we use in a lot of project
JavaScript mostly I'm angular or just
nothing just of course something
homegrown because as enterprise but
first we should I think clarify what
mvvm is model view viewmodel it is
actually an microsoft term and it's the
same meaning as MVP Model View presenter
and this Model View presenter is like it
was actually it was retired by martin
fowler and but what the idea is you get
a view which is dumped thin and no logic
then you get a view model which is
actually a presenter or controller and
the presenter usually provides data
binding services so the view can bind to
the data of D of the controller so the
controller exposes some variables to the
view and the model is the main model so
if you if you think about angular so
let's so what I said so far is the
following we have to view and the view
binds to a presenter and our view model
we said this is this model model view
viewmodel and this exposes view specific
stuff here and this talks to a model
usually without data binding and just by
invoking the model and this is like the
translator and their why it is
interesting first the view is easier to
do to write and test so in the case of
anger is just plain HTML and in English
two-way binding and model in the case of
angular would be like
service or a singleton or factory or
different names for this any controllers
just like a translator so and should
just contain presentation logic agonal
disabling fields enabling fields but no
business logic and the question is it
popular yes in most projects angular is
used I would also say angle eyes is
model view viewmodel architecture MVP
and this is the reasons because I'm
spent all my time in Java and Java EE
projects actually Java projects and if
there's clients just plain Java and Java
developers just like like engli and
Microsoft developers would rather prefer
a knockout GS I would say is also an
mvvm framework so knock out GS is called
knockout.js should be uh-huh this is the
framework and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to the first time I will just
show notes why not right so knock out GS
and this is also did they have some
examples and this is what the usually
the Microsoft guys prefer and yeah this
is the NACO GS and the Ruby and rice
guys prefer or ember so there are no
different flavors of this but I
absolutely see this in production and
and of course the problem is it changes
all you know to month you get another
framework so so let's go back to the pay
to my page and so the point number two
let's see whether we got some questions
no questions do you wait for our
audience hopefully not i am showing no
idea how many our life but usually after
the show usual is around hundred viewers
life which is actually not that bad so
everything clear robert seems to be
satisfied everyone else as well so
second you mentioned in earlier video
ABC structure and the question says
is it this no it is actually several
questions go through this but there are
many contents which doesn't really fit
in the structure sort of cross content
because of this I have a question where
to put following concerns the research
locator for rests up resources for epic
resources so I don't use resource
locators usually for instance i show you
my project amber erupted last week on it
is stateful is like state machine which
exposes SC XML and if you go here I have
a lot of resources for instance state
machines resource is the main resource
and it exposes a sub resource state
machine resource and they on the boss
package because they belong together I
don't have nothing abstract here and I
need nothing abstract because I use the
resource context to inject the jacks or
a specific part and what I do it is not
you know not elegant but works well I
inject whatever is needed here all the
boundaries from here and the boundaries
is just there as a specific reason for
this the boundaries remain here in the
am so i injected boundaries and whatever
is needed in the main resource and a
propagating by a constructor here you
see this in the sub resource it's not
elegant of course some developers
prepare prefer to use resource locator
for this year you could do this I think
this is easier and this is proper this
is so let's say I would have recently
cater and he asked me where to put it
which is actually a very good question
right and so the resource locator so if
you if you go back to the structure and
cannot belong to the Machine state by
the way machine is there is the business
component so it cannot be in the machine
I would put it first on the on the state
full level so not machine level state
full level still do recess locator for
all components so of course you get just
a recess locator and hopefully you could
you go something else which deals with
location then you can provide something
like naming services component or
location service but not you too of
course so and if they're just one just
keep it in the stateful level and
stateful is the application name
machine is a component level you don't
have to create a component for each
class and so I don't usually have reeses
locator but they do till May service is
more interesting for instance a mail
service I think you could at least two
classes one poacher which deals with
Gmail or whatever and probably something
which exposes the maid service then you
get a component which caused mailing or
messaging or whatever they do till I
will put in a component calendar I hope
it will be more than just one class if
it's just one class I will put it in the
root and abstract entity hopefully you
don't need them so I really don't think
you get the you don't need apps identity
jax-rs config is a good one where I put
the config here you see my jax-rs
configuration by the way you can look it
up on on the github page on my github
page let's go to github com and ambien
and see whether we find the stateful
repositories and state fool and just put
it to the show notes state full so you
can look it up after the show of just
clone it is exactly what i have on my
machine and as you can see this jax-rs
configuration innocent top level because
it does not belong to any of the
components and this structure looks good
for me and works good for me and I got
lots of feedback from developers they
also like it because it's simple but
sometimes what I thought about it
several times if you get a lot of
classes which can be shared between for
instance presentation and back-end
probably is a good idea to introduce
another layer so like you know
infrastructure or whatever because what
we we are now in the fortunate case that
so following which we are in the
business layer and the business layer
comprises component so convince
component business component and what I
said right now we can share putting
everything here but what if we get for
instance GSF and also just F has some
folders and you would like to share
between both so still you can just
access it here so this would be my
preferred way but as I already thought
about this and in some projects but we
never did it it could be also
interesting to have an infrastructure
layer and put you know let's say you
have something esoteric like I don't
know some specific algorithms or
whatever so I but algorithms can be
still put in business component then you
could you could create a dedicated lay
another component layer to keep the
staff shared to off to all layers like
integration business presentation I
never did it in a project but actually
forgot in one project it was really on
the edge so we thought about creating
this I hope the answer is clear so what
it means always search always search for
for business names for domain names and
try to avoid I try to avoid meaningless
stuff like you know mini naming like you
till common platform or whatever so this
is a basic basic idea tracing with
logger exposes or for instance
interesting with log exposure would be a
component tracing a log expose and
probably and belonging interceptor so
you couldn't if you will just create a
component with the name tracing and a
boundary or control log exposer this is
I think not a sharp distinction probably
a boundary fits better and if you would
like to expose it to everyone and just
for the internal will control validation
controller like why not no out its
validation or whatever so just just take
the names okay is it okay to use D TOS
in a rest methods for request-response
payload the question is of course and
and
what is the motivation and I think the
motivation is there is the possibility
to version the interface dto
independently off from the domain
objects all say okay this will be one
reason but then i would i would like to
see it so i would say i would i will try
in order to make a code review of your
project after one year and if there is
there are no distinct version between d
tos and you domain objects I would
delete the details but if you manage to
keep several version of the D tos and
undie couple them really from the domain
objects and I would see different
structure so then there's a clearly
beneficial to have dedicated details so
I'm again details are okay if the
details are different to the entities
just having you know d Toews and hoping
that one day you could d couple i think
is not not good enough and having that
said what was also i'm also given with
java 7 is a JSON objects is Jason P is
just the whole specification is a nice D
TOS so if you expose your domain objects
with data transfer objects you could use
Jason and Jason is such a data transfer
object so you don't need to create your
own so in my projects that try to use
DDT OS whatever possible and I think
even let's say actually don't know in
the stateful example let's see to DM we
have to go here attachments resource and
what we are doing you see I'm working
with JSON object so I sending Bank JSON
objects here and the attachment manager
creates from whatever statement machine
get and realises and DC realises creates
oh this is just a copy but it creates it
creates JSON objects and the whole
communication with the outside world is
JSON object based and therefore I have
in the state full details but I didn't
create them I just used the Jason
specification so conceptually I have the
deputy coupling
so a very good question you know a nice
one I'm 28 21 years old and I'm a
30-year studying computer science and in
the morning i'm creating some java apps
and more specifically and android and he
asked me so i'm asking the java guru i'm
really i'm not a java guru I'm if I
should change to c sharp so what what's
fact C sharp is probably even not even
it is more elegant than Java i would say
elegant and analog don't like the look
and feel but there's more features in
java is more powerful the question is is
it that comparing so you in someone so i
think there was already an comment a
good one so the best programming
languages the one people will pay you
lots of money to use so this is 0 there
is something to with this so the
question is will you get in sufficient
project with c sharp or where what would
would be more interesting you know
working for C sharp ecosystem or for
java and my perception is right now that
they are two very popular languages i
will chase a javascript and html5 like
languages and then Java on JVM languages
and in my world I just use the Java
programming language everywhere and at
conferences at least you will hear a lot
about in no closures Carla groovy and
all the cool stuff and my project is are
just just Java 8 mostly so on and the
next how annotations are useful explain
view of them and annotations the same as
attributes are thing in C sharp C sharp
and why annotations are useful because
you can put additional information on
attributes parameters methods
constructors and all language language
constructs and this basically is but
usually you will find a tool
persistence mappa jax-rs restful web
services or an UI layout or whatever and
these tools are able to read the
annotations so the annotations as the
name says the additional additional
information from the bite going to do
something with it does the whole java is
based on annotations and why they are
great because there is one there's a
union between the object and the meter
data so we don't have to look in two
places whatever you need is on the class
this is what why I really like
annotations and annotations don't have
in any behavior is like a type-safe
javadoc I would say the the the type
safety is a great thing because we get
no code completion or from from
Microsoft world is called intelligence
so control space and you get the auto
completion of because the structure is
given by the annotations so look at my
screen casts in my youtube channel i use
i think annotations in all my all my all
my work is the is the thing with the ad
ok and i hope let's say whether we have
any questions all right no questions
probably too warm and nothing in the
chat so let's go ahead with the next one
so have long been a fan of jade you and
welcome jpa so using us just very easy
to persist objects almost an answer
right so the HDD to the question from
from before and there are view examples
to be found about how to pursue
third-party objects assuming said
objects provide getters and setters they
will not change and I thinking that
using a wrap around the object would be
one way to go but I would like to hear
how you approach this an example would
be great to Eddie because examples are
always better than talking so I created
one and this is called jpa or mmm so it
works created today so one entity
workshop without even Gators and setters
plan entity there is no no annotations
nothing and by the way annotation would
look like this but this is what exactly
what we don't like to have so this would
be an annotation but we
unlike the annotation here so and then
it's a maven project it comes with a
crippling dependency j unit and derby
for test andrews is just my project will
just simplifies obtaining the entity
manager is very simplistic so you can
forget it here for this example and
let's go to the test so and i can run
the test and what i do in the test i
merge the workshop so i will run the
test here and you see is green so it
works so surprisingly i was able to to
store the workshop in the entitymanager
the question is why it worked and these
the solution of the mystery is the
following so i have persistence.xml and
this persistence is even empty so there
is there are some exclude illnesses
classes through but there is no class
listed but this it points to or m dot
XML and this aura map xml describes the
meter detail of whatever object you like
so what you can do with JP from day one
you can create or mmm file and describe
all the metadata here and this meter
data will describe the entity and you
see this points to the workshop and this
is sufficient to persist persist
whatever object you like you don't even
need getters and setters I don't like
ORM XML I because because I prefer on
rotations but I get your Peugeot to
point sometimes you don't have the
source code you have to bite Conte we
like to persist objects then probably or
M XML would be the right way to go away
properly because you know maintaining
both in two places is always not as
productive as putting a notation in the
class okay i hope the question is
answered and i hope to Eddie super happy
with jpa so which CD I annotations are
available GSP I want to use conversation
scoped to design with that form I think
everything so why so let's try to create
a very simple
let's do the project from archetype come
x hey what's wrong now it took took a
second job is servant essential is a
good one and say JSP project so what you
can do in jazz piece is the following I
will just create this and then i can
create let's create the bin 6ml first so
to enable annotation everywhere all then
i would like to create a JSP file and
call that index and then I should be
able to create a Java class and this
java class I will called a shopping cart
in comm ax and the shopping cart could
be session scoped yes and named this is
important is named and I could say I'm
string get content and what do you like
to shop is let's say cooling so we would
like to have some cooling and now what
you should be able you should be able to
do the following actually I think it is
taller mmm let's do this this
index dot I have to save it first what a
shopping cart sorry shopping cart dot
content wait a second I'm confused
because it's I think shopping cart get
content ah implements your eyes ever and
then with dollar you should be you
should use the dollar I think is
something like shopping cart get content
the problem is you are not allowed in
jest piece of doing this and what I of
course completely forgot is that
shopping cart dodge get content okay and
now it should already work no so and in
GSF is this the hash in JSP is the
dollar is the only only difference and
this should also work equally well in a
scripted right now and you could use the
so and now run it and let's take the
payara the current one is a supportive
glassfish should work also on white
flour whatever you have and this is not
java 7 stuff is a pretty old actually
side i put the full environment and see
what happens so as you can see i got
something back now we were to implement
some tests you've with the state he only
see that works but what you should do as
a homework create two browser windows
and try and and and keep some states to
see whether it works conversations cove
should also work but you will have to
open and close the conversation request
scope will always work an application
scope as well so hope the question is
answered so thank you for aid indus
where would you put interceptors
cross-cutting it's actually I hope you
don't have just interceptor usually you
have interceptor is just you know the
the thin layer around the logic and the
logic is injected from somewhere else
and these two classes I will try to to
find a meaningful name and put the two
classes interceptor platforms as a
controller boundary in the meaningful
package like monitoring auditory out its
performance management or whatever
caching whatever would like to build and
and another good one is the egb and GSF
so I would say interceptor is nothing
special for me it just is used by other
components and whether I inject
something or I say you know interceptors
and let's do it by the application
server I actually don't care I'm more
interesting stuff is ejb and jsf so were
to put GSF just f components i would put
in presentation package not not in the
business package so could you please
show how to unit test bounded utilizing
other stateless and inject objects and
whether i will use arquillian i bet i
recorded such such a video already so i
would just do two searches in the
youtube channel because it's a very
common question dude it several times i
would like to skip it but as a hint you
don't use arquillian to test the
boundaries in controls whether you are
using stateless OCD I it does not
actually matter and what I would do I
will create a journey test with makita
and just knock out the controls and I
always get an oil but it's not always
possible but it actually is so what if
you're interested in testing so this is
a shameless plug workshops and I mean
yes there is in July and 23rd continues
java ee 7 testing deployment code
quality so with the whole time the whole
day i will challenge you to show me an
example where does not work sufficiently
well or productive or whatever and we
implement and and and and and test and
deploy and and measure the quality of
the applications using sonarqube sonar
source so or so na so if you entering
this come here and what I also plan to
do in one point of time and record an
online course with just testing could be
interesting for you or just just go to
my youtube channel youtube yeah and go
to youtube channel search for Adam bean
and I bet you will find a screencast if
not i will record one just for you but
now i would like to skip it because i
did already several times it's their way
to have dynamic finders in JP like razor
rails a kind of so what it could do is
you could implement an interface and
then with dynamic proxy learn from the
signature of the methods and create
sequel queries on the fly so this works
what also works in java 7 you can
register named queries on the fly but
what's what's impossible to create
queries from public methods on entities
because you would need at least an AOP
framework or something like this is not
possible with java syntax and plain java
80 would need something additional i
mean you could create a java agent or
something but this is I mean has nothing
to do with the language anymore but with
interceptors it would work interceptor
sorry interfaces it would work out of
the box just create an interceptor and
interface with dynamic proxy so what's
your reaction to the post from you can
holla about Java 7 and production so I
got lots of things about this happy 2nd
birthday java 7 how it's going input
shin and you in hella is one of the
famous spring developers and by the way
a very nice guy and no know him
personally and he is writing here that
not of not lots of commercial java 7
service support lot of commercial
applications of a support java 7 and he
is absolutely right who's also my
complaint so i gave the feedback several
times to redhead why for instance not
impossible to buy just no support why
fly you'll be great if I would just pay
you know if you like start with Wi-Fi
then go to to Retta let's say now like
pay you just so please support my wife
live version this was for instance
possible for glass fish which was great
back then because you don't need you
know you didn't had two glass fishes in
one point of time there was a commercial
one but this was almost identical to the
open source one and you could go to Sun
and say ok I start with the open source
and then you can buy support by sun and
the same two is now for pyara so you can
start with open source glassfish and go
to pyara guys and say ok I would like to
buy support and you get it but from IBM
also works but just with Webster Liberty
profile so the web so Liberty profile
from IBM has java e7 support so so you
can so you get it from IBM for web
celebrity profile and weblogic is a
little bit slow and the question is why
it is the case so um let's think about
this what could be behind right so why
the vendors are slow is the adoption and
um there could be different reasons so I
don't think the reason is they are slow
because they would like to give you know
spring more more business opportunities
I think one reason is most of the clans
don't like to move fast so this was also
the problem with Java as i remember java
SE i think one point of time oracle
promises no faster pace and the clients
or customers who are against that at
least this is what we are what i heard
or understood on java one so the next
the next thing could be DD commercial
application service is actually fairly
old and what they have a huge code base
and i think it is not that simple
you know just to implement Java 7 which
a bitch whatever for the current
weblogic or 40 for the huge website this
is I probably the reason why IBM comes
with Webster Liberty probably something
more modular I would say and and fast
because they can move faster than it was
the huge one I can imagine this is one
of the reasons I've that of course no
idea and or I collect something like
this with the GlassFish but they lost
interest for unknown reasons so what was
web lodging is i think is this harder to
implement java 7 then for instance for
Tommy or for whitefly and why writer is
not doing this I can just imagine is
what redhead strategies are properly
similar to a BMS they try to upgrade the
whole platform not only the application
server takes of course a lot of time you
know to implement the IDE support the
application server the cloud or whatever
it is then harder then create just you
know the payara for instance just just
glassfish so Hughton is effectively
right but funny enough it doesn't affect
my projects at all in all my projects
right now we are using glassfish pyara
lots of white flies or many of the
clients migrated to Wi-Fi many also
migrated to pyara and I see more and
more interest and w liberty profile this
is with which servers the project are
starting this is what I see in my case
and of course there are clients who use
weblogic or the note the big websphere
but they use it already for years i
think no one starts a fresh project with
which day was the huge application
servers like weblogic or or IBM
WebSphere usually they use weblogic or
website because they have the whole
infrastructure in place or they have
Oracle products in place or IBM products
so the the application server is just
like I would say operating system yeah
and the open-source application server
are more like I would say think
containers to learn the business logic
so they focus a little bit different so
I actually I have to say I like the post
is just there was one T conclusion as a
little bit strange where was it
I don't know there's just a few
sentences which are a bit dangerous but
funny enough what I did I I created
similar posts of years ago so if you go
to my post the end of commercial java e5
application servers in in 2007 and my
point was they were supported but the
larger the application server you know
the the the more meaningless the support
because you problems then they don't
even understood user this is this is
interesting and post similar to yours
even and this comes over and over again
so this is a post from about java 6 from
jawan in 2010 and t the response from
our tool who is actually out you know
and still only two certified pretty
niche servers no big players almost one
year after release enough set so what
are two mentions with this is okay java
6 is that because there are no service
which is right now we have I don't know
15 or something java 6 certified service
and I bet with you if java 8 come come
out I get similar comment because I get
these comments every three years so like
Java 8 is out but there is no server
which supposes oh forget it they will
die so but yeah this is how it is okay
let's see what happens here someone
found the Anton varela founder projects
which dynamic find us but what would be
interesting to look at this I will put
it to show notes and its really
interesting what the dependencies of the
projects are icy integrates with project
lombok so what it actually means you
will need a bytecode manipulation to
achieve test is my point it doesn't work
out of the box with interface it would
work after buck spots thank you very
much and it will put it to show notes
and at
right to publish the the show notes on
youtube so thank you so next one how to
set up my sequel SSL and with this
certificate there should be actually no
difference so I didn't look at this
specifically because the application
server just uses the connection the
underlying driver and the data source
just pulls the connection so usually the
application server has nothing to do
with the with the bicycle driver so I
would look up at the my sequel
documentation how to create jdbc
connection using SSL and if you don't
know this it should be fairly easy to
use data source or pull connection
whatever applications that we like but
what you will get is the ssl connection
for the resource user of course it's not
like you know each use web user will get
a dedicated my mysql connection so the
question is i have the next the question
number 12 I have a question related or
cooperation with javascript in one war i
would like to make a simple app using
anchorage s fine but a structure was not
only matched to the maven projects so i
found it i can use so first why not so i
did recently we created angular
application in war and the angular
fights were in source main web app i
cannot show you because it's commercial
project and we didn't use the maven
plugin but I think what Sebastian would
like to do is to use maven to build the
whole javascript stuff and this is what
we didn't follow it so far so we try it
with Gradle and maven and it looks nice
but i think is really in one point of
time you should use the native npm or
not support and use command line then a
shell script or batch file and what we
do done on CI continuous integration in
jenkins we run jenkins invokes the shy
script over and over again and it builds
the to war and the question is why were
then because sometimes
we use for in such GS piece for
templating or something like this so
this is why we need war otherwise we
don't need war if you just have angular
JS and one project we use jazz piece or
servlets to for instance to find out in
which stage we are and this this was the
reason why we needed war because we
manipulated the JavaScript feisty
services from angular so now on the
question number 13 how to test
microservices and and the answers
shouldn't make any difference because in
microservices you have one control
talking to another boundary probably and
what usually will do is to encapsulate
this a little bit properly you will get
a pojo which reps a jax-rs client which
talks to other server you can just muck
out the poll jaw and then you shouldn't
care about the jacks res communication
in my current projects one of my current
project arm you are more interesting on
the data which goes back and forth and
would like to and the the other system
is really hard to handle so what we will
probably do is to create something like
a proxy data recorder or an emulator of
the system just for integration test
purposes and performance this purposes
but but for a usual unit test you should
just muck out all together not the
jax-rs client but the boundary or
controls which wraps the jax-rs client
so um is it possible to build web
application embassy ozark with java 7 is
enough matured currently for arts k web
application yes the question is when it
goes to production and if you test test
a lot you could use it but if you would
like to be bulletproof v raptor i think
they this already used in production and
it was it works on java 7 and this is
already very well very well documented
so put on the show notes so if you're
interested in MVC look at v raptor you
can use in production or if you if you
have a little bit more time just just
use ozark test a bit and and give it
back to community and Ozark is better is
based on jersey so go to Jersey MVC and
you should find the MVC templates from
Jersey so and this is also used in some
project projects and you could use this
because i would say lots of ideas from
this i leveraged in the MVC specs i will
put also this in the show notes okay
hopefully the questions answered by the
way look at the question no question no
question and the chat is lazy as always
so are nothing going on in the chat so
shame on you but I think Twitter is
somehow eager zero in GPA based upon
facing some problem in merge I think the
problem is optimistic locking exceptions
because a transaction related project a
problem it can be on the optimistic
locking exception to overcome this
problem we use native create an edit
query update into without without the
concurrency problem I think and is there
is record is it recommend to do this and
I would say usually no because if you've
read your own native query you will
overwrite the data and you could get
lost updates so if you are if you know
what you are doing and say nothing can
go stale or inconsistent that you can do
this but if you are not very sure you
should rather handle these the collision
the optimistic locking exception with
merge and how you can handle this this
is exactly the same how you how you how
you handle merge conflicts in subversion
or get or mercurial you should the first
would win the last will win or you have
to merge okay what is the best practice
for large-scale financial application
for key generation and the question is
not how big the application is rather
than what I requirements if you're
creating lots of JP entities sequence is
nice and what JP is able to do is able
to check our
to know batches of keys so you will hit
the sequence on the ones are let's say
each 50 k keys which is very very fast
the problems of course if the server
dies you get holes so you get entity you
know 10k and then ID 10k and the next
entity is going to be I don't know 60 60
k and this is what many departments
don't like business department because
they would like enough to us do asshole
a history without a hole in some project
we even use you ID'd also works super
super nice the problem with view ID is
slow to generate and it is too long if
you would like to show no invoice number
as the UID it is not usable for this
purpose and how to out it in JP a
question number four look at entity
listeners so this is like aspects for
entities very easy to use so the
question number 15 could you suggest how
to organize see I approaches with
Jenkins in Dhaka have a set of java apps
and for each of them i configure Dockers
i want to use jenkins to run integration
tests and then rebuild image and rude
round container fortification so what i
did and it worked well for me I think
there are still no best practices
because it's too new but i can tell you
what i did and this is the very
beginning i would say one of years ago
which is my first idea and i just tried
that and it worked good enough so it in
my case it looks like this so there is a
dhaka and in dhaka on the docker host
everything runs so we have the
containers solar containers my blog
database and statistics and one of this
container is the is Jenkins CI and what
i installed on this docker image the
docker CLI and by the way you don't have
to use the dock asere i can do is use
plain rest and for instance nice one
because to lie
watch doc yeah it's just our website i
created communicate with Daka directly
using jason the same could be used
directly here so that the darker
actually communicates the Jenkins
communicates with a docker host and is
able to run build and whatever like
outside this container so what I did I
shipped these image first and then was
able this image was like a bootstrap and
this image is able not only to create
all the images it's also able to start
all the images in the right order so I
just misused or used Jenkins as the
automated tool and this is what I did
this was a simple as possible thing and
it even didn't have to be you know in a
container but the idea is why not why
not to treat you know Jenkins in the
same way it could just run on the under
on the host equally well in to
communicate directly with the docker the
only problem was to find out the IP
address because there is no linking it
was like you don't like to talk to dr.
with the other one you would like to try
to talk to the 2-d 2-d hose directly but
there was a solution so you can find out
what is actually the IP address of the
host so you in my cases even you know
and a dedicated IP address so it just
wrecked I hope the question is answered
Oh get something on Twitter how please
don't forget answer busy right equation
18 19 cities just yeah I will do I will
do this Oh could you provide an example
how to send text to cell phone from a
web application and funny enough I also
thought about the topic no 10 15 years
15 years 50 years ago I thought it's
like you know as a message like like
mail something but not is a service from
the provider and you will have to buy
something but there is a nice API is
called twilio this is what I prepared
this and if you go to twilio
there is a nice rest api and using this
rest api you would be able to send not
only to send SMS messages you can send
SMS or mms make a call if you go to this
you will see it is actually very simple
to send and or what you just need this
jax-rs and then you can respond sprocket
pan if you would like no spam a lots of
users but yeah this is how we look like
west we do you have to subscribe this is
a commercial service but this is one
possibility so the answer is it really
depends which provide a are you using ok
when you species and GS f word you price
your baking beans the baking pins I
place in jsf am sorry in presentation
package and they are not organized
according to the boundary control entity
pattern because usually there's not like
a silo unfortunately so I would also
like to draw this so
I said I have the business layer and the
presentation layer and the presentation
layer we all need for server-side
frameworks like for instance jsf so on
the back in bins here are talking to the
boundaries here but here we have a clear
organization using the BCE so we have
the components and hear what I try to do
we usually we have different structure
and single page app is a little probably
and package yeah a package per view if
panel or view yeah if there's a wizard
so what we have we have we have a
package of a page or something like this
but this is not the same structure so I
put the baking beans in the presentation
root folder first and then wait until we
get something visual and try to find the
names for the concepts and then we
create a name a package / concept and we
put the baking beans there but there is
usually no relation between the backing
pins in the folders in the presentation
layer with the boundaries and controls
from the from the back end from the
boundary okay cool this was and just
according to twitter we just go to the
questions 18 and 19 hopefully so we pick
everything here
so this arty to using bc ECB i can group
my business logic components yes so I'm
strongly to find the right place to put
an entity's used by more than one
components I feel you are writing
writing a virtual where would you like
put the other entities is used by both
components place order and shipment info
info in place order because order order
is theological there's just in ordering
system is the order and even if all the
components are using the entity I think
the home of the order entity is the
place orders just sounds logical to me a
common never and why why not I think it
is better to create something like this
and this could end up in endless
discussion so so we have let's say an
order and shipment or shipping and
shipping needs the order so this is I
think his problem so of course would be
nice if the component would be
independent but I actually don't care
about this but if you put this in common
package order and the package would be
common then both components point to
this which is not a bad the problem is
you put probably everything else to the
common of component as well so you will
end up having here know the it would
look like you know go to logic so it's
just everyone knows everyone and from
the outside looks nice and inside it
looks looks like hell so I think why I
prefer what is the reasoning behind so
um i would put the entity to the order
package because it easy to find so and
if two years someone will ask you know
the order entity needs additional field
where you will search for this entity
and i will start with the order not in
the common so this is actually the
reasoning behind hope it's clear okay
very good
how would you design an outbound
boundary my approach would be to create
a separate component having at least
boundary and control to control is
required to be used by other components
the boundary should not be used to
record sonic cruiser I think outbound
means if I would write to the boundary
it was communicate with other components
like integration logic so two answers to
this by the way every boundaries on
outbound because if you talk to the
database or JMS is also outbound but
what we sometimes do just to give you
another example let's say we have a
legacy system here which is hard to
communicate so the legacy database or
whatever so we have lots of nice
business components on this level this
is ordering and shipment and we like to
talk to the system so what we can do we
can create a component and this
component deep both components are
talking to this one but the under
interesting point is there is no
boundary is just control why not
boundary because no one from outside of
the layer is able to use the D
functionality so so far the convention
was components have boundary if there if
the services or API is visible from
outside the lair and they just have
control if the logic is just to share to
be shared between components so we get
here something like an integration
component or business package or
something which doesn't have to boundary
so it doesn't have to communicate with
the outside world but the account could
have several controls or even sassette
control so you can stack the controls
control can talk to other controls here
and you can use entities to talk to to
encapsulate the system this will be
something like an outbound Bendery or
integration component so we are done
with the question and the last question
from the phone twitter is it a good idea
to use GSF to develop mobile web
applications why not so if you're
building responsive pages responsive
means you have lodged
geological structure and and you are
loading different CSS stylesheets
depending on capabilities of the device
you can do it with jsf and for instance
with it's called how it's called html5
friendly markup so you can use jess f
you can take whatever HTML page you like
and transform it to a 2 hsf you should
be a little bit more careful if you're
using components like primefaces
richfaces whatever then you will have to
first to test the components whether
they fulfill the requirements so you
know if they run for instance on Apple
watch or uncommon watch or whatever and
and how it looks like so this is this I
would do but you can use jsf or whatever
this is not that bad is actually very
productive if used in in reasonable way
so I think we are done with the summer
edition so um thank you for watching and
see you at or upcoming conferences
workshops in munich july i think next
week even i think next week is the
munich airport workshop so it's already
I think over 20 attendees per day and
the next one is going to be in December
and between both I'm at javaone and Jeff
one will get a birds of feather session
hopefully in Moscone Center it was like
the very old Java one and I try not to
organize a Zambia and I will gather some
most popular questions from here or you
can also suggest questions and I will
record the session somehow and publish
after the show and properly i will be
able to stream it live so come to the to
the buff i will announce it separately
so thank you for watching and subscribe
to the hex news if you would like to to
be notified about such activities and
see you next month bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
