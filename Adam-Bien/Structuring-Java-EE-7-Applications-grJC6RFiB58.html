would like to show you how I structure
Java applications Java 6 generates seven
or even Joey five so um let's start with
a simple mailing project so I will use
an archetype and this is the comm a hex
archetypes I will use just add D uh just
go with that and I will call the project
Java EE or just structure so and it just
created a minimalistic Java 7 project I
already recorded our screencasts which
discuss the structure of that so let's
assume you will would like to create a
block and so the basic idea is there is
a boundary between the presentation and
the business logic and the boundary is
like a really hard interface and I would
like to call that let's say why not just
block and the package would be your
company name and blogging engine would
be d keep the product name or the
project name and I will start in
business and I would like to create a
component posts with the package
boundary so and you could call it block
or block engine probably better and the
block engine has a method called safe
post let's say this is a string with
message
and usually it always is in my case a
stateless session me and stateless has
been that the reason for that is because
we need transactions and I would like to
participate in monitoring and yeah this
is the easiest possible choice in Java
five six or seven it's just a used ejbs
so it's just one annotation so um now we
are in the post boundary package and I
would like to create another class I
would like to call the class let's say
post value data and I will put that in
the control package so I will talk about
the packages package name a little bit
later there's the post body data and the
post value data is just a managed bean
with simple method is valid and let's be
optimistic so I will just return always
true so and now we can just inject the
post valid data to to the block engine
and just use it here so also interesting
let's just change the view if you java
packages as reduce tree this is a nice
view so we have components here depart
you see the component posts comprises
boundary in control so and also i would
like to have the actual post and the
actual post is an entity so i put it in
the package entity and it has one
annotation called entity choices
persistence entity
and let's say one ID it actually does
not matter
oh it actually doesn't matter just just
fine for the structure so and the
boundary this is actually the point
would have a reference to the
entitymanager
p.m. and persistance context and you
could March or you can create a new post
new post here with the message of course
you would like to have the message and
then just create that one constructor
with the message and one constructor
without so so this will be a basic Java
component now why the strange name one
why posts and what happened behind the
scenes so um I just I like to use
standards why standards because with
standards you can minimize or shorten
the meetings you don't have to discuss
about the names and when I created here
I created a component with D with the
name posts and Y posts I assume that the
Dom indeed domain experts blockers in
our case the bloggers know what posts
actually mean there are always namely
components of the business
responsibilities and now within the
component I always have the same
structure and there are actually icons
this is the boundary this is the control
and this is the entity so we
here the boundary decontrol and the
entity in these layers and why I use
this naming and the patents first of all
is really convenient if you look at the
code you have they are sorted in right
away boundary control entity but the
real reason is this is a very old
standard it was it is actually older
than you are now and you can you can use
it for modeling with whatever tools you
have any UML tools I know support this
notation and even graph or a Mac or just
drawing programs applications also
support this so um and I try to
structure my Java II projects after
business responsibilities and never
after after technical responsibilities
in my opinion naming a component after
their technical contents like eg B's
managed beans or exceptions or
interfaces it's just not very
maintainable way to to to to to
structure your applications so I'm so
thank you for watching and yeah see you
in one of upcoming conferences projects
or even the axe so thank you very much
you
