like to show you how to integrate Jason
with jax-rs or it is actually integrated
in Java 7 so how to use it
I will start with very simple maven
project so I will just would like to use
my own archetype which is actually very
very simple so I will just call it Jason
and jax-rs
perfect so now it will connect with
maven central and create a project so I
would like to start with the restful
configuration first so I will call the
classlist configuration I would call the
package come in axe Jason so um the
class has to be annotated with
application path which exposes makes
visible the whole application under this
paths resources is just default extends
play occasion and yeah now it's
configured so what I would like to
introduce a class called greetings
resource this is the actual resource and
it's going to be a path and the passes
of course greetings greetings and we
will return a JSON object we could also
return a JSON object right but it's
perfectly fine to return JSON objects
and this is I get call so what I can do
in say return JSON is the entry point in
works also outside the container so I
don't have to use a container for this
object build um add let's say hello
world
and you build this build
oh it should be a string of course so it
looks nice and hopefully it works so let
started I would use in class fish and
let's try it it out
I expect 404 because there is no HTML
not JSF nothing and it will open in the
default context path and what we have to
do we have to add resources and
greetings so and it seems to work so we
got Jason output so Jason is actually
very useful in context with together
with jax-rs in Java 7 you don't have to
configure anything the poem is just
empty so there is nothing there so it's
just as the whole poem so no
dependencies no parse is nothing so I
enjoy Java 7 and see you in one of
upcoming conferences workshops or
projects of course or even a hex in
Munich or a hex online very soon so
thank you very much and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
