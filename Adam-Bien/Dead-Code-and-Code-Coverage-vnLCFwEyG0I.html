would like to show you a little tool I'm
using together with NetBeans for code
coverage so to demonstrate you this I
would like to create a project from
scratch but this time it is going to be
a more complete example called the BCE
archetype
this is entity control boundary pattern
so coverage I call the project so it
will create a Java project which with
some unit tests so that's a very basic
project I show you is just some unit
tests for instance there is a unit test
for registration boundary which happens
to be an eg P so yeah it just tests the
registration process and what I would
like to do is I would like to measure
the code coverage so how to do this I
will just introduce here a plug-in
section to the maven project and
introduce the jacoco maven plugin used i
used the most recent version because i
would like i'm using java 8 so i need
the more recent version of the charge a
cocoa maven project in java 7 and java 6
i used earlier projects so what i only
have to do now i just perform pin and
built and then something interesting
happens so now all the tests are
successful but now i get additional menu
point menu item called code coverage and
what i can do i can see the reports as
you can see some of the classes are not
tested at all like the resource checks
or as in configuration and some are
integration tested only like the logger
exposer but what's interesting here
there is one class called registration
which and registrations which test
coverage 87% percent so if we go to
their class you see it is everything is
tested except this method
and what we have what if we have this is
fully tested and the class registration
is everything is tested but not the
constructor which is actually funny so
thank you for watching and see you of
one of upcoming conferences workshops
are even here ax am a very small note on
this and not using code coverage for
numbers what I am doing with code
coverage I'm I'm seeking for no more use
code so for instance this both methods
are probably not used so I could safely
delete them if everything is tested and
they still read probably forgotten code
so code coverage is a good test to
identify that code thank you for
watching again and see one of upcoming
conferences workshops or even a hex and
once a month for the regular a hex QA I
think it and know it I think it is the
first Monday of the month at 6 p.m. CET
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
