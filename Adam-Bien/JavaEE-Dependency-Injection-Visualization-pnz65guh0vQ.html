would like to introduce a very very
useful maven plugin called visually and
to demonstrate you how it actually works
I prepared a very little project with a
boundary with injected hello control and
an event it's called CDI event then the
control has an entity manager and we
have one entity called developer with
one-to-many relation to programming
language and we have a listener on
message which observes a string so this
one this had a boundary emits a string
and the listener observes a string and
if I show for instance at the eggs in
Munich such a code I got a frequent
question well this is really hard is
this Decapolis beautiful but I know it's
really hard to do back or work who is
actually able to to to to to omit such
an event and there is really nice plugin
maven plug-in called visual EE so this
is visually e from github and to make it
work we only have to copy this piece of
code and I will go back here and
introduce it as you can see the standard
maven project is actually created by my
member our own archetype and I would use
here the plugins and put it here
and now I will only build the project so
clean build and as you can see there was
an already an input output visual EE
folder here and it created in the visual
visually folder in the root
a lots of HTML code so what I would like
to do is to view the project in a
browser as you can see lots of options
and all classes is there it is possible
one and what you see right now is the
following developer has one too many
relation to programming language and the
message listener observes us through
and this drink is as fired by the hello
boundary and the hello boundary hello
control is injected in hello boundary so
it's nice visualization with filtering
options so I could just search for
string and you will see the string with
related dependencies and yeah really
useful plug-in and yeah now you get uh
some homework if you if you think the
plugin is useful just start the
developer I think he deserved it at
Thomas and start a developer and using
in project it's really fast I actually
using my project it generates is really
quick there are lots all the
dependencies the only problem is the
browser then so if you generate too much
so you have to restrict this but it's
actually possible so thank you for
watching and see you one of upcoming
conferences workshops or even a hex at
airport Munich so thank you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
