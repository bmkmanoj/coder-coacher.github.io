so one of the reason is easy
installation and setup so basically I
only have to click the download button
and download the in my case mostly Java
Edition which comes what was everything
I really need for my daily work so
there's no plugins or configuration
required afterwards I usually use the
development build so you can see it
comes with gossage for oh and the
development builds already with
GlassFish for one which is more
interesting for my daily work so and
after clicking download I will just get
a dmg on Mac or Excel on Windows and
after double clicking it it installs the
NetBeans without asking any further
questions so just install not only
NetBeans but your application server as
well
so after installation you can easily
start the ID and yeah startup is fast
and after starting you see here that I
have set up here a projects group what
project groups is you can you can create
an arbitrary and any any set of projects
you like of work frequently on it so
junk is usually my presentations are my
presentations files is if I perspective
what it actually means is you will see
the actual contents of a project and
this is more or less a project users
some some some files are not shown and
services it comes with with pre-built
database so pretty it's a derby so I can
connect to the database right away the
sample database and just you know browse
the tables and view the data and even
modify the database it's nice database
you are built in then web services are
more or less pointers to services on the
web you can use it for for for for
examples service it usually comes with
GlassFish and so I can start the
GlassFish I can open the admin console
server log and in the update Center you
get similar support forward for other
application servers like Tommy Tomcat or
white flight is a nice white fair
plug-in and an WebLogic so maven
repositories are the same I have
local maven and maven central so I can
browse the repository is also very
useful cloud you could add a cloud
provider like Amazon Beanstalk for
instance had some builders even more
interesting for for my projects what I
usually do I point here to Jenkins and
then CD my my progress task repositories
you can setup gyro or box ela and test
driver you can start from here you have
for instance your karma test so I'm so
why why I actually am using NetBeans
because I can it can save a lot of time
for setup and configuration and even
more important and that means is
interoperable between team members
without any further configuration
because there are actually or
effectively no plugins required for Java
EE and Java SE Burke you get everything
out of the box out of the box so it is
compatible and it becomes even more
important for my workshops because you
know the attendees come from all over
the world and I cannot just expect
everyone to install you know a magnitude
of plugins before the show so they if
they if they like they can just download
NetBeans double click on it and we can
act together and application so thank
you for watching and see you and one of
upcoming conferences workshops or even
hacks
yeah hacks and on the next episode why
NetBeans works not only works
why NetBeans rocks ok thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
