edition of a hex and sorry for the delay
but this is end of year and end of year
is always crazy so i spent my time in
java 7 workshops microservices and task
forces so and last week there was a hex
a mini get wat soda regular one with
lots of us in these and the funny story
was there was an attendee from costa
rica and he said it's not that cold in
in munich actually in winter and and
there were at least from almost polar
circle from north of Sweden and they
told me is really cold because the ear
is wet is not less as a stri and in
Sweden and I actually forgot to ask the
attendees from USA how they felt in
Munich but yeah fun fun time last week
and therefore i delayed the x1 in one
week later so i would like to start with
the content and so let's start with
announcement so what's new is java
testing workshop i was asked a lot a lot
about this now it's out there they are
about forty nine modules at forty I'd
modules and the 49th is just thank you
and what's interesting what i did i
implemented a test ej bees vs. CDI and
benchmark debt with JM h and this caused
some hot drama in the internet so i was
like yeah whether i will expose this and
in fact i actually forgot to check in
this this test and i will and i will
push you to directory to the to github
properly tomorrow where is it it is in
the java testing sample project so if
you go here you will find all the
samples for the java testing online
workshop ok this was the first item from
the agenda and you will find all the
there's also new d homepage all the
workshops at the exi oh so there's this
d bootstrap java and java 7 testing ok
now enough of this and as always there
just so what I did I i wrote a digest of
of the contents and one unexpected point
a state of java java 8 I got lots of
questions was about Java 8 and what how
is job one and I tried to to compile
what would actually happen so if we go
to a search for java ee 2015 sorry
javaone javaone keynotes you will find
the key notes on the on demand exactly
and you can watch them actually you can
watch on mobile the donut up there's a
mobile player without any requirements
for having flash installed all it all
runs on chrome and there is a java
keynote full-length keynote this is what
we'll talk about here so you can watch
this I'll actually take that copy link
and post it to the chat so here you have
it and all the Java 8 relevant content
is one hour 10 one hour 19 1 hour 26 and
one hour 28 so it's around half an hour
about java 7 state of the union in java
8 and the content is presented fairly
well by an eel and i need is a vp i
actually didn't notice this year he's a
vp lat oracle i met him several times in
a glassfish context in the past java
conferences and so he presents here the
state of java 7 this is a needle so as
what you see there's the specification
request with chase ours and what the
status and as you can see this also one
hour 2817 i just watched on my iphone
and try to record the tee times and so
here you here see the d roadmap so Java
8 is expected to go ga
and servlet in 2017 so in the middle of
2017 and it was presented very
confidently bye-bye him so watch watch
by yourself the keynote you will see and
what's also interesting on stage they
were iron Robinson from from from IBM
this is mark littell from from jboss and
mike lehman and he was also an
interesting statement about java 7
adoption and how important java ee for
weblogic is and this is actually what i
also can tell you from from from my
experience the my clients are extremely
interested in Java EE so I'm for
instance weblogic got java 7
certification after javaone and and this
prevented to some migration project away
from from weblogic because yeah because
they didn't wanted to wait too long so
but now it s java 7 is solved so and
what's the status java 8 so first they
just the anneal and and and and my
Gleeman media impression java is still
relevant and irrelevant so they invest a
lot in the ecosystem so now what an ill
also said that the whole process is open
and this is what i also are can tell you
so I'm the main difference between
Oracle and salads in Oracle all j's arts
are are open openly managed so the whole
d mailing lists and the expert good
communication is open so you can just
watch the progress by yourself it's a
problem with this is there are lots of
api is to track so as you can see there
is just excerpt like for instance there
is no jpa there is no management API no
there's even management 20 rest-based
developing IDR and what I will try to do
is first to write a couple of blog post
about you know which which jrs comprise
java ee 8 and then try to probe to track
their progress and the activity so what
interests me actually like something
like top 10 which are the most
and most eager and active GS ours and
which are the laziest one and because it
is a lot work to do if you are
interested just write blog posts
whatever pika GSR drop me a tweet and I
will try to aggregate a Content somehow
and public publish this because again I
said the interest is huge and I'm it's
lots of work to track everything
hopefully we can automate it somehow
we'd also great you know to write a
scraper we just publishes the data
monthly no can see how the how the how
the goal can be achieved what I found by
myself the management API which are
really interested is not that active I'm
also involved in this one so it's also
my fault but I will try to change that
why I'm so eager right now the problem
is i was involved in java 7 and java 6
and i was actually very lazy j zp member
so hopefully i can contribute something
right now and if you like support me and
let's make the process a little bit more
transparent and what we could do what
would be great to have something like a
progress bar now what is the progress of
java 8 and what is the estimated time of
arrival this would be great community
afford and if there is a lazy and GSR
what we could do we can just take it
over so why not if you're interested in
something would be interesting for us
for management and you know before we
write a blog post a book or whatever we
could involve more in future of javi so
this is the java i ate lots of questions
about this and this is somehow hard to
say so watch the keynote is about 20
minutes you can invest or at least if
you don't have the time just look at at
this snapshot so just start with 110 and
then around half an hour and the whole
keynote is covered okay so this was the
first topic if you have questions of
course go to Twitter and used the
twitter i also have tid a hex channel
let's see what happened here nothing
so John clinger John Klingon nice from
glassfish will support me and there is
an adapt at GSR another great way to
participate so um yeah whatever so first
we have to see where we can support the
jrs and and what I would do if there is
no activity I would it would even know
volunteer to take over I jsr and and
write a very lean veraleen specification
so um this is what we can do and at the
thing I think there should be no no
questions about this in future and
jackin us aid no not glass fish anymore
here now whiteface swarm is also perfect
yeah okay this was the first topic and
let's see the next one yeah discuss
discussion of the DC realization
vulnerability in java context so on this
comes actually from one of the of the
reader and this is the explanation of
the vulnerability weblogic websphere
both jenkins and so forth so i try to
understand this and i think i got it
from the technical point of view and my
impression is this has nothing to do
with java ee so the point is this if you
have serialization there is a method
read read object and you can override a
method with there was an example i think
even was ritab ject there was somewhere
the test and with the custom ation of
the serialization you can there was
somewhere they had a source code yeah
read object so if you have a
serializable interface and you can
override a method read object and you
can do here ugly things you can do
whatever you like and what it did they
found a vulnerability in jakarta commons
collections so what it means they try to
find a sale
ization and deserialization where each
object is involved and ricotta Commons
collection is used and then they can do
whatever you like so they would
manipulate TD stream and and then could
invoke whatever like they mentioned
several times HTTP but in my eyes it is
unrelated of jacks or s it would be
unrelated if you send over Jack's arrest
for instance here lies java objects
which is optimization and not a common
way of communicating between application
server they also found you know Jo mix
invoking jboss which could be
deactivated in my eyes and some other
vulnerabilities the point being is yeah
this is the commons collections library
in java so what i can tell you is if you
just you know it using remote ejbs for
instance which rely on sale is a shin or
or rmi or a core bar which relies on
java civilization you should be safe if
the applications of a safe so if your
application does not expose any admin
ports to the internet which are using
theorization then you should be safe of
course no applications on your
application server should use
civilization a remote civilization
happily this is what I actually
propagate for years just use Jack's
Torres and Jason and should be enough
and of course if you think in my book I
described an optimization technique
where you can use standard Java
civilization or cryo serialization then
then with Java serialization you should
be careful refuses Commons collections
or a application server uses comments
collections I didn't try to hack any
application server I just believe it is
seems reasonable but again as nothing to
with Java EE is it just like I think
whatever service on the internet uses
Java serialization and commands comments
collections you could you should be able
to hack that this is my understanding if
not please correct me write a comment to
the 2d 2d screencast ok am Modi also
learn try to avoid any dependencies if
you have Java 7 so just go with the core
java api and try and actually in most of
my of my of my refactorings recent days
we just removed not only comments
collections but
commons commons lang kay mccomas
configurations como zoo toes usually
this is nice to have dependency in Java
ok so let's see yeah and and junk junk
Lincoln said something interesting if
you're using prior macro or sorry pyara
micro unwisely swarm both are
interesting how to call it a truly
microservice because you can just
package the application server with the
war there like Jenkins for instance and
deployed and you can just add whatever
like 2d to the core to deploy it it is
nice but what I prefer go the full stack
with for instance docker because it's
more convenient but if you would like to
do if you reach to the you know to do to
the optimum or best you can just go with
prior micro and swarm okay now we have I
think we covered the vulnerabilities and
again it was the title says have in
common I would say and the tell is
actually great because it says there
what all have in common see if they use
jakarta commons collections and expose
some ports which could be used to hack
the server but if you disable reports
nothing would happen if your application
does not use binary communication rather
than Jason okay now in the last one hour
I got an email and I'm and I wanted to
reject the email because yeah because I
wanted to redirect it to the next ax TV
but it would cause another traffic
though ok I will I will answer this
right away so I got this nice email is
and what I already understand this what
are making best practices when handling
a multi-module 7 plus project it
contains an ear and additional library
API batch projects the immediate
question in mind if you can read my mind
is probably you know why you have seven
modules in one year why and and then
what are making a product is an HR team
start of java sex and java 7 with
glassfish so class which is actually far
more popular than you may think so a lot
of projects coming to me to glass fish
and now they migrate to pyara for
instance
or Wi-Fi the most of the old classics
project migrated to pyara or white fly
none of the projects migrated to
weblogic because web project didn't
support a job a 7 this was the problem
as most of the HR products also started
as a small one and from time to time
develop to something much more so our DD
I think the right approach would be to
deploy another war not make an ear grow
so for starting point we had an ear with
one EG b+ war what i would say the next
step is to have one war over time of
application was expanded by different
additional modules background jobs
packages EGP is working with singles
need additional interfaces so so some
interfaces for gb's are multiplicative
over projects yes it's true the question
is why the EG piece of interfaces I i
didn't use interfaces for years for EG
bees and most of them we could move to
an api projects the question is if you
are in an ear why need the api because
you will ship everything at once so if i
ship the whole year I and it means for
me all the modules ed all the wars if
you're using maven and you are using
maven will probably have the same
version if they have the same version
you know create just on war it doesn't
make any sense to have one versions and
seven artifacts we have a very detailed
JP let's also duplicated over the
modules so in my eyes having a dedicated
JP a layer is an anti-pattern what you
should do rather is to put the jpa
entities the domain objects where they
belong to the components so is it a good
practices local no overhead as remote no
because you get this realization of
vulnerability from from before and use
only the interface on the project so the
best practice would be created and war
throw away all the api's throw away all
the interfaces and then if you would
like to be a jet try to factor out
pieces of the war to another war make
them communicate via jax-rs and jason
and then you can even call your projects
microserver
is compatible or microservices and
register talk to a conference and then
you are a hero so this will be my
approach ok now we covered the immediate
question from from the audience I just
go to the chat is to anything now chat
Twitter is always lazy the chat is ok
Twitter's lazy so there was nothing
happens here view is loading ok so next
one how to redirect calls from Java
components into pojos so funny enough i
implemented this recently and also
announced something a new project called
breaker where is it yeah and the break
is a circuit breaker implementation for
java it's a very simplistic one this is
basically an interceptor why why I did
it because I think in five parallel
projects everyone asked me about my
opinion circuit breakers is impossible
to implement them in Java EE so ok let's
look this is the D simplistic
implementation and what it does
internally it delegates to a POJO and
this is actually the the answer for the
question to the question so I would just
open that and there is the the breaker
which is the Interceptor which as you
know measures the exceptions the time
and then delegates the decisions to a
circuit breaker which is actually a POJO
so and if you go to the or it could be a
pojo so it is a pojo which post
construct but it could be just straight
pojo so this is the answer to a question
so I'm able to delegate the whole
traffic to a POJO and the Poggio decides
whether they call here what this is
called or not and this is called in
micro service area circuit breaker
pattern two classes in in Java and
several megabytes without javi it is one
of the reasons why you should to use
Java in micro service
architecture okay question answered
hopefully so chat a bit lazy hey Anna
what is um okay I get a question from
Twitter head on what are the alternative
of using Egypt be time or quartz in
clustering and environment and I don't
want to use MDB so md bees are
completely unrelated and a gb time i
just use persistent timer and in
glassfish you can set up for instance a
central table and it is cluster were
okay and by the way in chat we have
brett occur I think he was one of the
attendee from from USA so leave me a
shot no such message from Utah as a
British from Utah was Munich called a
warm so this is the first one ah the
Marco says he's only carefully attending
so nice perfect so so Twitter is
carefully attending so we covered this
asynchronous programming in java SE and
java so the first answer is don't do it
so I'm what I will suggest is goes in
this synchronous way first way is
simpler to implement then measure the
performance if it's good enough you are
done if it's not good enough or not
robust enough so you could introduce
something like a cow's monkey what is a
cow's monkey you can kill a kill off you
know parts of the app and see what
happens but if it behaves well you are
basically said if it does not be a
behave well what i would do is i would i
would introduce a sink response so an
injector s and completely future and
managed executor managed executor
service so managed executor service in
java ee is a simplistic way to get
configurable thread pulls computable
future is a nice way to implement
pipelines you can also call it the
reactive programming is actually fairly
simple to use
and and async response from jax-rs
allows you to have blocking calls with
without utilizing threats so they are
just the decals are in depending from
from the threat yeah and the question
was I will just have to go to the gist
so was a little bit more detailed so how
do you use this in your projects only on
demand so in in specific project I do
not think if it's good enough I'm set
and so a synchronous asynchronous so
this is the basic support what's the
problem was a synchronous in all the
GlassFish for instance it was not
configurable in jboss it was
configurable what wasn't confirmed
configurable the thread pool and the
configuration of the thread pool is
application server dependent but this is
a great way to have your basic
asynchronous of support it is harder to
implement bulkheads what bulkheads means
you cannot implement dedicated you
cannot add or you cannot use a dedicated
threat for a communication channel
magnetic executor service is actually
the bulkheads implementation for Java
what it means you could create multiple
managed to execute or services configure
them them independently on each of these
services could use a different setting
like max amount of threats and why you
would use it because one in stable
servers won't kill your whole
application compatible future is a way
of building pipelines and usually you
would like to use completely future
together with manage executor service if
you are interested in this I could just
record a short screencast and show you
how it works I think it would take too
long right now because we have many
other questions then a split joint I
think for joint what he meant how so if
you don't use managed to execute or
service incomplete every future
out-of-the-box computable future will
we'll use for you for join framework the
problem is this red pool is comes in
addition to the application server
thread pool so is though is exactly the
same as it would use for instance
hystrix is also additional thread pool
which has completely independent from
the application server thread pool in my
eyes you should use completed by future
and pass the manager execute or service
with a computable future then the
computer will future will use managed
threats from the application server and
plain future is actually you can be used
in conjunction with asynchronous so what
it means is if your if your method is
not void what what you could do you
could return our future and wrap it
there is a utility class called
asyncresult and there's asyncresult will
you could pass value back and why you
would like to do that what happens
behind the scenes behind the scenes the
application server will use callable and
void is actually runnable okay i hope
this is crystal clear of course more
clear would be in source code but i'm
pretty sure i implemented this already
so i think i showed us in the effective
java online course but if you're
interested just drop me a line and i
will record a screencast so let's see so
perfect a neighbor has asked me here
Adam in which case we would choose cash
in java apps I don't see a real use case
for caching this is actually perfect
perfect question actually in like in all
my task force's the first thing we did
is we deactivated the caching entirely
so no jpa cares no caching at all and it
solved most of the problems I think
before you start with caching and you
have a jack sir as endpoint look at
jacks or s and cache control and try to
make the web browser or reverse proxy
cache this is I think and if this is and
if this is not not right then then think
about a standard caching like je cache
but never introduced caching without
testing the performance so thank you for
the question and Brad Tocker says it was
warmer than expected we were pleasantly
surprised so Brett attacker says Munich
in winter was very warm attendees from
Sweden from from Polar Circle said it
was a colder than expected and at indeed
from Costa Rica said it was also warmer
than expected so and for me it was
warmer than usual so I'm interesting
okay so we had this and let's see what
do you think about people's or Oracle
Fusion doesn't matter the people i think
ESB so enterprise service buses so what
is my opinion and i think there are two
kinds of projects project which are
extremely happy with esps and what I use
for me as piece is actually the default
the whole flow and UI is implemented by
an ASB this is the vast minority of all
projects but usually what ESB solves are
usually is one can a use case for a
species compensating transactions for
four long activities so we introduce
something like ESB our way back in the
one of my projects and the problem was
if something as a new schedule as
following if an order is not confirmed
to within three days it should be
cancelled so now if we would implement
this with with Java a plane it would be
somehow we know problematic so you would
have to have a persistent timer for the
duration of three days it should be
flexible whatever so I think we would
spend I don't know one day to implement
and test EDD logic but was ESB it worked
out of the box and was very elegant and
back then we use this was jbpm from
jboss and it was very elegant solution
because we could even used tested in
unit tests but having that said the vast
majority of other projects the ESB was
like didn't solve any of the problems
problems in any and everyone was unhappy
because it was decided by ivory tower
and no one actually knew what problem to
solve with SB everyone knew oh we have
to use ESB and no one knew why and this
is called cargo cult so we use something
without knowing why so um if you if you
have some problems as I had you know
like a long long running transactions
extremely long running transactions and
and and and compensating transactions SB
could serve this but the promise of this
be where a business person can model
something it doesn't work at all so I
never saw it were working so it doesn't
mean it doesn't exist but I didn't sort
as a father so far okay could you show
an example where you execute our test
using docker I could but there is no
indifference without Dhaka so um let's
see actually with arun gupta at a
session where I did it so the on our own
YouTube channel there should be a
session were actually started on my
weblog in Dhaka it's a whole
infrastructure so let's see what I could
show you here as for instance pyara
hacks so this would be a test with
docker what it actually does i'm running
a Paillard on port 8080 and adding the
pink war here and it inherits from pyara
image which is this is the whole image
for paella and the same have other
image for white fly is very similar and
why for a hex is just deploys an
application to whitefly and if I would
start it with darker the only challenge
is to assign a port and it would be no
different and netbeans even comes with
daca support here this is i'm using a
daily builds it comes with a docket tab
so you could you could you get
integration even here but even without
the integration everything works as
expected so you could even set up the
debugging port and stuff like this so in
my eyes not a big deal at all with with
with doctors should be no different the
the only added values that you did you
document and package whatever belongs
together so i could say okay all my
images for instance i start with
essentially java image so i set up my
base operating system image with with
jdk java home and so forth and from this
image pyara image or white for image
inherits so this is my application
server infrastructure and then from this
image i have a the the actual
application file which inherits from
pyara image and is actually the reason
why why Daka or a Java is perfect for
micro services because the
infrastructure is clearly separated from
the application so the nice story is my
image which I built all the time is tiny
because everything else is already in
the infrastructure image so my bills are
incredibly fast and the bigger the war
this one the smaller to the the slower
the deployment because here because the
whole war has to be uploaded somewhere
so this is actually interesting that
with Daka Java he became extremely
interested platform for micro services
because of fast deployments because the
images are tiny and by the way if I
would use pyara micro or jboss swarm my
war becomes bigger because it includes
the application server so you should be
cautious whether you going you know with
the micro a dish
and using docker or the full stack so
this therefore I preferred the full
application server because because i
have only built the main image once in
case the application server actually
changes so this was actually mine mine
mine own server this is if you go to my
blog everyone runs on this
infrastructure because the CD workshops
is the registration for the workshops
and it runs on Tommy and so I've all
application servers running on my server
in Dhaka and for my clients we have some
a little bit more sophisticated
infrastructure so we have one lay in
between where the project can specify
own settings like connections pools and
heap size and so forth but actually
three projects right now using docker in
production with Java 8 in Java is even
now in Java is 70 ms German 7 ok hope is
answered so uh someone asked me oh this
is a long question don't do this in
Twitter in so how would you structure a
Java email project with separate from
this for three types of users admins
users producing some content and so for
us we're using one jar with shut each
obese um yeah it really depends artists
three do have the three modules have
different life cycle or not if they have
three wars with redundancy if they don't
three wars with a shared jar and ok and
an anonymous already wrote also an
interesting answer plus one for me so in
your so just repeat the third question I
heavily used rest what is the reason
behind the reason behind this integer is
required so and we have to use usually
in front and there are lots of angularjs
apps iOS and Android and a native and i
would say rest is the only reasonable
thing to use and jason is very
convenient for javascript client so it
would be and and most of the I think
java javascript is very popular so it
just reasonable to use Jason and if so
you do think
rest is suitable for integration
solutions absolutely so if you even you
know go to in the a hex last week what
we did I just show some rest interface
of paypal github overstock whatever so
whatever we look at comes with the rest
interface and the whole group is nothing
as the integration and in their recent
bank projects we also use dress for
integration in integration words hope is
still the standard so what integration
work means so it means if you have a
legacy apps which speak soap you will
have to consume soap but a thing in a
modern service you shouldn't expose soap
anymore because it's not widely used
actually I am state of soap a year goes
on a broad small post two years ago
crazy so if you if you look at this
hoped the latest maintenance releases
2011 java 7 judge acts vs was one of the
view not updated specification there are
only two related soap talks in java 1
2013 and don't even think there was
single taco in 2015 and yeah whatever i
look like is let's see the popularity of
so protocol as you can see there was
interest in 2015 in march button goes
downhill so okay and what are the
interests in india lots of interest in
Sri Lanka and Sheila I guess is because
of most of the maintenance offshore
projects okay let's see this
perfect Victor asked me which annotation
to use here which annotation Oh remote
or local nothing so there are no
annotations just put the jar bins bins
XML and use inject a GPS or not even
jeebies poachers were that inject know
annotations nothing should be needed
here a single jar with mins xml and
cameron asked me does it really matter i
mean isn't most of the soap or jason use
all done behind the scenes jax-rs yes
but what i mean is you shouldn't start
with soap because I mean if it's not
well tested and there is not lots of not
knowledge why you should know bother
with soap and why not jax-rs so this is
this is a simple question okay I think
Cameron mckinsey like soaps of the legs
look like so one of the soap pinner
fanboys just kidding so um I think we
covered this so uh Victor asked me can I
use afterburner with Gradle why not I
don't use gretel as maven because most
of my pledge projects are Java EE and
maven is even faster than Java so it
should work but I never tried it and
because there is nothing in production i
would like to invest a lot in to Gretel
but after burners just a single jar and
it just reads from from from from
classpath the f xml files so it should
use should work with Gradle for sure in
entity controlled boundary where should
we put interceptors in the same level as
the components on in Derek in the
business an entry control boundary war
we should put the util package util for
you to commons foundation base are
forbidden names in my java projects what
you should do explode util and you know
see what's there and if there's Francis
log in class and create logic login
classes create a logging package if they
are a no I don't know security classes
create a security package
so okay so let's see what is the origin
question for here exactly how Dragon has
a code for your java ee microservice app
so we have boundary control and entity
your ideas so it looks ok so first what
I would like to say most of my java
project went that way there was a small
war without any dependencies if you
follow my blog you see it this is the
same topic for years so I even had a
post like how it call it white less y
less ejb and i'm being just for fun
josephine so I'm so it's lots of do you
know how to do a very old post it should
be able to know two thousand six or
seven 2009 and and what I propagated for
years just write simple small Wars so
and if you have a simple Wars created by
small team they have to communicate with
each other so you get microservices so
to answer your question I have to just
look what is the specific question so am
a Microsoft based app contains following
classes restful resources in a boundary
rest clients as controls yes no entity
services just entities and there are no
services needed because there are just
regular controls in my eyes there should
be no difference whether I microservice
talks to a database or to another
service or to our cash or whatevers
actions and entity services are just
controls and configurations are our
optional if you think about this what
you could do is microservice you could
just hard code the whole configuration
and if the configuration changes kill
the micro service and and and and ship
the other one so you have complete
different possibilities and if
configuration is needed then you just
can inject the configuration so again
you have in boundary always two classes
one ejb which starts the transactions
and implements fassett logic and
resources which exposed
logic as jax-rs then we have just
control which is optional and in control
package we have I don't know what entity
services are it's just if you the entity
services teach entitymanager so you
don't need any other service the entity
manager is the persistent service so i'm
just i would skip this entities is an
energy package there are just domain
objects actions are controls in control
package and configurations optional okay
next one if for the next for the next a
hex please try to be short you know
there's a lot of stuff to read and so if
you shorter the question the better it
is rest services so so service with some
business logic you have login consumers
rest service angular s PA and single
page apps android apps so what would you
recommend in that case just a map with
authentication codes rest filter or oath
so what I recommend is so-called bearer
token this is what most of the api's are
doing and how to implement single sign
on for instance what a red hat key clock
so we have key cloak this is one
possibility or open a.m. this is an old
son product to sleep two possibilities
what the products are doing the products
are exposing like stop an agent where
you integrate with the application
server and the agent talks to a central
location where all the user identity
stored okay and and because it's already
implemented I wouldn't implement it by
yourself just use the existing tools the
Key Club is great and I think is even
more popular than em open am and as you
can see whatever you can think of is
already implemented and they have a nice
support for four in our password
exploration user management and a nice
nice nice admin UI okay
so I'm some someone asked me what
JavaScript framework line do you
recommend to use with java ee r st I
think client you mean you I so funny
most of these startups I interviewed and
the and I support state they laugh
javaserver faces jsf and why because
it's extremely productive depicted
components and are expecting productive
with this but most of the enterprise
projects they use angularjs no more GSF
and why angularjs I would recommend you
angularjs with this small problem that
angular 2 always probably going to be
completely incompatible and there will
be a migration path but it will usually
mean you will have to write the whole
app i think in practice so why angularjs
because similar to GSP sand GSF and
comes with nice MVC structure react jess
and ember.js I think for java developers
they look a little bit more crazy than
English yes this is what I would
recommend you so regarding my question
in Twitter about remote and local which
one should we choose in that
architecture that is my last question so
I'm neither ed remote nor at local
delete remote and local what you can do
you can just inject the poachers and all
public methods become so how it's called
like default interface so you don't none
of the interfaces or forget the
interfaces so this is the question on
anonymous so I don't know how to know
none neither at remote nor at local you
just inject classes and so to be more
clear in all my java ee projects where i
can influence them interfaces are
completely forbidden so most of the
interviews you see on my block we just
don't use interface interfaces anymore
and the developers are only allowed to
inter to introduce an interface in case
they have varying algorithms or business
logic like for instance strategy pattern
so if you have two implementations go
with on interface and but use our
qualifier with nice name to distinguish
implementation to choose okay I hope you
now you will delete now your interfaces
okay so next question or wait a second
this was nice here okay so this is a
multi-tenant enterprise application with
spatial metadata of requests head as
param indentify specific tenants so I
would call it context so context arrives
from the from the clients and it
contains the information about the
tenants or clients and we would like to
use it as distinction which one to
choose which one to use each tenant has
custom configuration the systems that
override some defaults okay sure so we
have some defaults providing that
applications of and we can override this
so if not present default perfect from
the remote interfaces the receive this
request service web services of course I
want to retrieve such identifiers and
set up context so what I would do for
instance what you can use you could use
a request scoped and store it there or
you can use session synchronization
registry now sorry transaction
synchronization registry and and look at
in the green book you can rent it for
for free lending for free at amazon or
and all the examples already checked in
in can i still so if you go here there
is java patterns and best practices and
if you look at the repository now i
actually forgot what is the name of the
pattern this is a transaction or
contexts i think just contacts write
contacts holder so look at the example
context holder and i just implemented
view examples from threadlocal and
context context synchronization registry
as well okay then you can that then you
can hold the state somewhere and then
you can implement the injections oh I
was thinking about long as of the
following strategy but I got stuck so
create conflict qualifiers that the CDI
container resolves to the
configuration producer yes create a key
configuration injection point as a
fourth so you can use CDI and inject an
instance and we could go detailed about
this but I wrote an article for java
magazine and this is a configuration
Java magazine and I'm being oh no bine
just been by the way I think the CTO
from Twitter his name is also adam bain
and I get got some some tweets about no
parties and you ask us drama and I first
about two times like what's going on and
then I just started some people to
confuse me with Adam binder on Twitter
but ok this should be the they should be
the or is it you search for Adam beam
this is an internet is slow because of
the streaming magazine Adam bin magazine
configuration if you search for this you
will find a free article you don't have
to buy it and this article is at a Java
magazine with the E and I did exactly
this so what the audio mentioned here
was implemented by me with the injection
of kinky injections point this is
exactly what I did it's in the whole
article and it was not tenant up
dependent I think stage depending but I
think cydia is the right thing to do the
question is would you really like to
inject everything or you could also do
just inject the configuration and you
know use just get us to do to extract
the information so my question is how to
create a single sign-on for all my web
systems in Java so question or the
answer to look at key cloak a prior I
think pick at link but keep pick a link
i think is duplicated a key clock would
could be the right choice and this is
what you should do otherwise you will
have to implement by yourself which is
also possible but I know single sign-on
also means no expiration tokens
rejection and so forth so I will just
look at key club or open am
and the last one is he asked me so what
are the plans for the video course and
just secret a message to you all I'm
working on microservices course actually
because as lots of interest in my
projects a thing okay if I get the same
questions over and over again propolis
is worth to code it and I will code a
micro service appt with computable
future on a synchronous process and
stuff like this and the next one I have
actually about ten ideas for such
courses so am I will probably do
something in the next few weeks yeah
this was the last question let's see
what is in the block these are the
secret io plans I think we are set we
are done let's go back here no questions
in a project would you go to pew jaw by
seven or life right opencms it is c so
also great question for Victor and what
I would say is the following I will just
I always would first try to go pure Java
8 so if we need a server then i will
look at Java 7 and then the question is
what you would like to implement if you
would like to implement you know a
content management system is probably a
bad idea but what I will do just try
just try to implement you know a
simplistic CMS in one day and see how
far you can go and if this does not work
because then you will find out you need
a true CMS then I would probably look at
life ray or whatever a Magnolia is also
interesting one there are lots of CMS
systems authentication authorization
with jax-rs with the strategy is the
best huh jax-rs provides you actually
the full power of servlet so you can do
whatever like in the wild what I see a
lot is base64 authentication is called
basic authentication in Java EE with
with ssl of course but if you have
something like key clog you could do
whatever you like ok then I will wish
you
Merry Christmas so you can see the chris
chris christmas market of munich airport
so we did the picture last week so Merry
Christmas try to delete code you know
over the over the vacations and see you
in January so i will think the date is
already set and see you in January and
see you in a hex io or munich or even
projects and remember trek java 8 and
help me to track the progress i try to
you know to report it regularly it's now
in one topic on java 8 progress on the
ax and as well writing some blog posts
what actually happens in the specs so it
would be my contribution so if you like
contribute and i will link to your
theory process also thank you for
watching and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
