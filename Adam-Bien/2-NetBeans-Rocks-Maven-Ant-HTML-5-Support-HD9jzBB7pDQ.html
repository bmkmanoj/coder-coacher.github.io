support so started with NetBeans around
the version 5
there was a great support for and
available back then and usually created
and projects with NetBeans and it was I
think job I 5 pick 10 and it worked well
whoever the unscripted but somehow
complicated so if you look at this it
came with everything it was standard ant
built but I used this approach for
smaller project for prototyping and for
most serious project I usually used my
own and builds and built its ml files
which could be easily opened with netbiz
as well so that you could either either
use the internal unbuilt or an external
one and yeah with the advent of million
three NetBeans also supported maven 2
but maybe 3 was a lot faster than mavin
mavin 2 so this is why I really like it
so um you can just create a straight a
maven project from from NetBeans or just
go here and say stand out and it will
create the standard Java is 7 maven
project with the standard archetype so
it fetches the definition from from sona
type and you can actually always see
what netting starts no magic here it
uses just command line mode to create
the archetype archetype generate and it
created one just standard Java 7
archetype a standard means a little bit
bloated this is why you can equally well
execute your own archetypes what I
actually also did so if I go here and
say project from archetype it could be
your own sauna type or your own Nexus or
artifactory so I go here and say I would
like to create my own call me a hex
archetype it's a simple one and create
this so now I have a project which is
created from an own archetype will still
work with NetBeans what I could also do
I could just create the archetype from
command line and open in NetBeans no
problem also takes a while because to
fetch over Internet the hole definitions
when this one is significantly simpler
so it's just nothing behind you know and
I can build this clean and built it just
execute the standard built and there's
actually only one build so NetBeans uses
the maven build period there is no
internal mavens built and the actual
maven build is just one built so if it
phase everything fails and so I can use
this build and or I can use an I can
even use it see behind the scenes what
happens there's an action step so I can
see a build it just invokes install and
at the clinic build can install or I
could even create my own actions called
test integration and say this is phase
safe integration test for instance so
and now I created my own action which is
which can be executed straight from the
from the from the menu if I execute this
it will perform usual integration tests
so it's some really straight integration
with maven so I'm something newer this
is not really new it is one year old one
year old is html5 support so I can
equally well create an html5 application
and what I really appreciate is the
editing support JavaScript support and
CSS with tools like less sass and grunt
support and I can run just the
application and it is well integrated as
a browser can choose the browser and I
can even debug this I can say hey I
would like to inspect you and you can
see it is a two-way if I select it here
it selects and browsers two-way
integration but this is not that
interesting for me because what what
usually happens or I can I can do the
same having the HTML file in a world
project so if I run the project right
now it will ask me to which application
server to deploy the project I can say
hey use GlassFish but it works with
Tommy so I'm using Tommy right now in
our project and white fair as well and
web logic so you just have to only have
to add this service and it will see it
deployed the application and I get the
same support for our forum for a maven
project so um enjoy NetBeans thank you
for watching and see you at the X
projects conferences Java wonder box
whatever Elam and enjoy Java</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
