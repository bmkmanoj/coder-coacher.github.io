would like to introduce to you a mixin
so what is a mixin with a mixin you can
introduce some methods to a class
without inheriting from a class so how
to do it with JavaScript so I have just
an index.html page and an empty script
so let's say I would I have a class
called widget and this class is a method
to draw return drawing and then another
class called nice widget nice widget and
this class extends the widget and I have
a method drawing nicely drawing nicely
and this method invokes the super draw
and returns just in I sleep so we are
using both we have an own method and an
inherited method so of course I will
have to use a F we would have to
instantiate a class in order to use it
nice widget and say Const result and I
would like to invoke the method as well
and this is called draw link nicely and
then output that so seems to work so
inheritance working so what I would like
to do right now I would like to use es6
modules so now activate the aunt so I
would like to use the import and for
this purpose what I would like to do is
to inject some tracing methods without
inheriting them inheriting already from
the widget and I will just inject you
know cross-cutting concerns like for in
stressing so in order to do this I
introduce a script called tracer Jia's
and let's call it tracer and this is
going to be a lambda with a parameter or
a closure with a parameter it's a super
class and this class
extends from superclass so this is the
interesting part so I mean and I'm
inheriting dynamically from the
parameter this is what what this
actually means and then I can introduce
our method let's call trace and with
message and I would like to use the
console dot let's say info and use the
backticks
so this is the year six templates and
same message message and I will have to
export that export tracer so now it
should be usable from outside so let's
include that import tracer from tracer
GS so and now I can say extends tracer
with the parameter widget so now the
tracer inherits from widget and now what
I should be able to do to introduce the
trace method here and say invoking and
it works
so with mix-ins this is how they look
like with JavaScript you can inherit
additional methods you can introduce
additional methods without inheriting
from a class so thank you for watching
see an upcoming conferences workshops a
hex Munich or web standards igniter
workshop or web key web component online
