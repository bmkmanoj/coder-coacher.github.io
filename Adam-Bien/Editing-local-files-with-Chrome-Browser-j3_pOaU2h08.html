chrome editor and it comprises two files
an HTML file and a CSS file and what I
would like to do is to edit the files
directly in browser so of course what I
can do I can just change to to the
developer tools and say okay I would
like to change the style this is the
style light blue and what I would like
to change that from light blue to let's
say light coral which is fine but if I
reload the page it just reloads the
state from the local disk because the
file is it resides on a disk and it's
just reloaded so I can change the
behavior and I can tell chrome to pick
actually the actual files and edit
indirectly so what I can do I can say I
would like to have this workspace file
to be edited so ok allow this and now I
go to the style and say hey style map
this file to a resource and it correct
to recognize the file here and now watch
this
so what I can do right now is this is my
background light blue I can change that
to something else
light CN so we have this color and then
what I can do I can also introduce a new
properties of course family and say here
for instance fantasy so and it changed
the fantasy here immediately and this
property also appeared directly in the
CSS thank you for watching and see you
in upcoming conferences a hex dot-com or
a hex I off thank you and bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
