would like to show you something
completely unusual for air hacks so I'm
no service no java ee no maven no even
question and answers um i would like to
show you instead an old java SE api
called JSI api what is jay s are P so
the jsapi is java speech API on was
forgotten one so the last release was in
2009 or was released in 2009 and there
is an implementation it's even older
called free tts and you can download the
sources and the binaries there is no
maven dependency but you can unload and
download everything as is a zip download
which I actually did so i have here the
free tts 122 which is the current one
and downloaded a zip so what I like to
do is to implement a a Christmas API and
Christmas project and this Christmas
project is plain old java project and it
will and what I will have to do first
list to add all the dependencies so I'm
this is the libraries and at jars and
folders and I just choose everything
from the lib folder in three TDs so I
did it and now we can implement with a
view lines of code I will try to
convince Java to speak so watch this
voice manager getinstance and I get the
manager back and the manager can return
on voices there are a couple of them so
I already investigated and and the most
suitable is the voice called Kevin 16
Kevin 16 and what you get back or 16 or
do you get back is the Kevin voice
and then i can say Kevin or I have to
say I have to allocate the voice first
and then deallocate it's almost like
transactions in Java and then i can say
Kevin not speak and I can pass whatever
like usually string and say merry Chris
Chris más Java hackers and now let's
test it Mary Rasmus Java hackers Joe
sounds great so I'm I left a small
homework for you I've write some assert
and see whether the sound output is
working correctly and if you already
just ping me via Twitter so I'm thank
you for watching see you at in the
internet at a hex tile or even in Munich
a textured come so enjoy Christmas and
Happy hiking by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
