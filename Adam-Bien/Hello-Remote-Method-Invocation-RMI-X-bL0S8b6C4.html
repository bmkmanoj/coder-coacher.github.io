would like to introduce you to remote
method invocation
it's actually nice way for to implement
the remote procedure call in Java so I
will start with a maven project called
error my hello not help but hello and it
will comprise in client parts of a part
part and an interface so I would like to
start with let's start with the
interface of course we need at least an
interface I'll call that hello service
and this is an interface and the
interface has to extend remote and we
can implement the business method which
will return a string and has to work
that has to throw a remote exception so
this is absolutely necessary so now we
can already implement the client the
client and the client will have to look
up the implementation and we will have
to use and neom or ease with which which
starts with a remote method invocation
localhost port number let's say five
thousand 99 and the name is hello so the
name is important we will have to
register the servant under this name and
we have to throw some exceptions isn't
really old API so there are lots of
checked exceptions to handle and I would
like to get back the hello service and
of course cast ad and I would like to
print it out service echo hey server and
just
let's call that service so the client is
ready to go so with what we need is the
server I call it hello servant mr.
server part it has to extend unicast
unicast remote object is like unicast
Remo the object is like server-side
singleton and has to implements the
interface
hello service so now we have to
implement the method and the constructor
as you can see the constructor has to
throw the remote exception and the
reason for that is the super
constructors resist as well as well so
let's implement the method return from
server input so our servant is ready to
go what we need now is the server so
it's called that application server
common practice to build your own
application server so I'm and here there
is one factory class called locate
registry and with that you can create
registry on the fly and the port numbers
F has to match 5000 99 we have to solve
some exception of course and now we can
register our servant under the hello
name and we have to construct servant
here
so our with the modern Gd case we don't
have to create the array my stops that
will be create created on the fly for
you so I will just start the server and
as you can see it blocks and then
attempt to start a client and do i'm
xperia and you can already saw it works
so the client connects to the server and
you see from server hey server what's
also interesting if we will print out
the stop
servus getname which is repeated from
the client side you will see that it's
actually not our implementation rather
than a proxy so JDK created a proxy on
the fly for us
so I'm thank you for watching enjoy
remote procedure call with remote method
invocation and see one of the upcoming
conferences workshops or even a hex and
soon and or even ex-lax I also thank you
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
