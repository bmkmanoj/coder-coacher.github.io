show you how to start with maven 3 and
java 6 just using the command line so I
just execute a plug-in called maven
archetype generate and what this plug-in
does it fetches a list of a project
templates from from maven repository
displays that and I can choose a project
from from here and what I actually know
that we need project called web app java
6 or similar and this is around 300 so
yes here here we have it web app java 6
and the ID is 35 for it usually changes
frequently so you have to remember ja by
six and search for java 6 princess grab
it and to get the ID so the most
convenient way is to use the ID right
now so this is the ID maven asked me
which version number of this plug-in to
use I use the version 15 define value
for property group idea what could it be
in my cases a beam and artifact ID is
maven test version 10 snapshot is okay
package doesn't matter and yes I would
like to create the project so what
happened right now maven created a
project a folder booster with the name
maven test so I change here so right now
what's inside is just the palm and and a
source folder so but what I can do right
now is to just to build a project from
command command line so um yeah it's
comprised the sources and builds the war
if I change to the target folder icd
your archive so the nice story is now I
can open the project with netbeans maven
test and just execute that so I go here
and say run and of course this project
is netbeans and glassfish independent so
that means has to ask me to which
I would like to deploy the project and
in our case i will just used glassfish
and now NetBeans builds the project with
maven again and deploys it to glass fish
and should open a browser window and
show hello world and the hello world is
actually deployed deployed as at GSP so
if you look inside that's the cause for
the hello world output it's the project
the maven project is just consists of
you know the head information with
dependencies to java ee web api and yeah
it's just usual suspects you have for
some compiler plugin settings and the
interesting story it is absolutely
independent of NetBeans or or glassfish
so thank you enjoy hacking java 6 with
maven 3 and see you on one of the
upcoming conferences projects or one of
my airport hacking workshops thank you
very much and enjoy developing with Java</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
