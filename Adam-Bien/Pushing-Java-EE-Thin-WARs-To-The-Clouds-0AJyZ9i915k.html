to push a java application to the cloud
so in order to do this I am using a
jelastic demo account and what I did I
already launched docker registry with
which is available under this IP address
and now let's start with developing an
an ordinary Java app even using maven so
I would just use these simple simple as
possible maven archetype is the
essentials one and let's call it elastic
so this is the elastic and the and this
is the simple maven pom and of course I
would like to create a resource at least
and call that elastic boundary elastic
resource and this and this has an Ori
and the Ori is elastic and this let's
make a little bit faster and more
adorable so and the Ori will return an
elastic cat return extremely elastic so
I would like to use docker so what I
will need a docker file new dock a file
and this image is going to be based on
full profile payara
so no micro profile no web profile just
the largest profile available copy
target last stick dot work and this is
copied into deployment dürer
so this is done and this is comes from
from the Docklands repository on github
if you are interested so we have this
and now let's build image so I will have
to switch to elastic and now first I
would like to build us so built then
forgot to copy the URI so I need the
over here so docker built - t is
detecting the story name and then let's
call that a hex elastic and stick dot
business looks good so it created the
elastic war and now now I will try to
copy and paste on a trial actually
achieve that so I will copy the attack
this is this was not clouds this is
something else is here elastic so okay
push dad and it's done so it's now the
app is already in the cloud and now I
would like to create a new environment
with the same tag so this is elastic and
now it fetches from the registry the
image and this is this one and let's
make it a little bit faster something
like this and now create the environment
now you may ask me so it creates it can
take a while these are demo account so
sometimes very fast sometimes slower how
it's possible or which internet
connection do I have and the answers are
relatively slow why it was so fast so
first if we go to the command line here
and if we if I show you the images so
you will find here the latest image and
the size is 540 mix and these you can
may think it is impossible to
create this image in such a lot of time
or upload the image to the cloud in what
was it half a second and I would like to
show you why it was so fast so if you go
here you see this is actually the the
infrastructural part and the cool story
is the 200 DD base image which is sent
to a7 was built two months ago in Java
was built eight months ago and the
GlassFish was built six days ago
hourglass which sorry payara was built
six days ago and what we built today was
4k so what actually happened we just
uploaded the 4k image so as I created
the registry I just pushed the whole
infrastructure to the registry so now
only the app has to be pushed this is
the advantage of thin Wars okay nice the
environment is already created so we can
go here and then I think it was a lastic
/resources slash and elastic slash
extreme elastic so this was pushing and
java application from scratch in six
minutes so not only pushing with
building in from scratch and yeah and
thankfully we have thin Wars otherwise I
wouldn't manage to upload 20 30 Meg's in
that site in the site in the time so
thank you for watching and see you at
micro services virtual Munich if you're
interested in cloud micro services stuff
like this and upcoming conferences
workshops projects consulting or
whatever so thank you for watching and
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
