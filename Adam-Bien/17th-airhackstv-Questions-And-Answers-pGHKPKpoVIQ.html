so great summer and now let's start with
a side topic so what I managed to do is
actually to use standard IRC and to
connect with the ustream chat it was one
of the most asked faq know whether I can
use actually there the ustream chat
which is built in into the page so I'm
you can just join the page and see the
other users and this is this describes
how to how to do this is some pretty
straightforward actually so now back to
the to the topics so what I did the
first time and actually created some
abstracts or digest from the actual
questions because it was way too long
and I would just you know switch back
and forth between the github gist and my
abstracts so let's start with the first
questions and the questions is actually
how to deal or actually the very first
one is a little bit of drama so I'm the
last a hex someone asked me what it is
possible to use jpa without any
annotations just wear em so I actually
wrote a blog post about this it was a
pretty straightforward so what I created
a class without any annotations and put
all the metadata to an XML and then if
you if you follow the the comment is
like is it reminds me of five minute hbm
files never again and also get some
tweets like a no terrible you cannot use
XML so I actually don't like XML but
this is our questions and I answer the
question that way but what you should
also know not of my blog posts are best
practices this is just no a brief how to
if you have that problem you could use
this but I actually never in projects
created jpa and notation JP entities
without annotations I always use a
notation that actually only rarely use
RM another question for what you can use
RM XML and what I did in the past of you
x so we have a basic set of entities and
what we had we had two entity managers
and one relight fully on on annotations
and the other one used in addition to
annotations the xml descriptor so we
could for instance we two entities from
one database and write to another with
this trick but this is not a best
practice just a little know-how to if
you have the problem okay this was my
first who remarked not a question and
now to the rude one the Tod Theodore has
a question and the problem is and this
is actually interesting one that the
GlassFish exposes guava older version 2
to the applications and I had the same
problem it's actually not glassfish i
think is weld which does this and this
is unusual because what glass fish
usually does and all the libraries they
are rewriting the packages of of the
third party libraries so usually there
is no conflict because what glasses
would use internally is not like google
guava rather than orchid glassfish dot
com google doc guava for instance but i
think this one is from weld and i guess
it cannot happen because probably the
license to not allow to modify the
binary files or they just forgot to do
this and the question is how to do this
and I got another answer it is actually
here from from mb DBC DK and he says
okay with the same problem and you can
fix it here and this is a setting like
CDI service enabled implicit CDI falls
so you can do this what you could also
try us glassfish is basically an osgi
container you could try to replace the
bundle and see whether it works it's a
problem with that is of course if you if
you're using this is glasses for one so
there is no paid support but if you
modify the application server what
usually happens is you won't get any
support from the vendor so be careful
what you are doing so this is a also a
quick answer Biden by and by an utter d
or at Indy to someone who participate in
the kissed and so I hope you answered as
a my answer would be if you just try to
upgrade glass
itself is a little bit tricky and see
where that works and or follow the
advice of the other I use in and then
check out DD back and dissolution list
you can set up the the the command line
interface here I didn't double-check
this because it is really hard to test
this but I hope your question is
answered so the next one is recurring
one but now yeah I'm glad to answer
which application server would you use
if you started an app from scratch and
basically right now it does not change a
lot so what we are using my current
project is lots of white fly
surprisingly lots of pyara and lots of
Tommy and what I what I'm going to
evaluate or what I'm evaluating a little
bit is the website Liberty profile is
like the lightweight IBM so lightweight
is a a really pragmatic IBM server with
java 7 support so what I would choose is
and any reasonable open-source
application server with optional
conversion support this would be my
advice still because yeah in more
critical projects probably your clients
or customers would like to buy
commercial support so it will be nice to
have a server where you can pay for the
support what I for instance like more in
pyara then in white flyers you can
download the open source version and
then pay for it if you like and in wine
flying tables is a little bit more
complicated because you can work with
white fly in your projects but the jboss
official supported version is a little
bit outdated so this is what I don't
like but this is what I really liked in
glassfish days and now it almost didn't
change so you can buy the support for
for instance from from the payara forks
and by the way there's another company
you will see an interview on my blog
soon it's called logic oi and they also
provide commercial support in the US so
I will shortly you will find the
interview on my block and they also
provide commercial support for glass
fish
so you can actually buy commercials are
prompt from from whatever you like ok so
we answered some questions and as you
can see we have here a question from you
streamer how I can't ask jpa and Egypt
be cloned your ECB reaper but i can
start the in-memory derby of the
application business unit loading
exception this is interesting one my ECB
repo so um what should work is if you go
to you I de and then search for
archetype you will find the BC archetype
if you check this out you will find
persistence tests and they should work
out of the box if they don't is
something strange with your machine I
don't know virus scanner which slowdowns
everything or something strange try this
and you will find the answer inside this
archetype is like a sample application
with lots of how to's a little bit best
practices but the application is a
little bit over engine yet because I had
oh and I got lots of those question and
I answered the questions with source
code so it's a little bit avenging it
but look at the code it should worked
out of the box so thank you for
infractions from the chat for a long
long time which is nice usually a chat
was very lazy Twitter was a little bit
more active well nothing happens here
now so but Chet is nice okay so this was
with the question about application
service the next one is also interesting
about Caleb are scaling up a war so come
back to my block so we covered this we
covered the application server and now
how to scale an application server and
with all the side effects so should we
think about not to set up class which
class drink what would be the pros and
cons for a cluster independent nodes so
what do you get from clustering is what
I what is
killer feature of clustering I would say
is not necessarily a session replication
or a stateful session build application
and I would say is the aim how it's
going to federate monitoring so you have
one view to the to the whole cluster and
cluster deployment so you can deploy an
application at once to all nodes and
sometimes what you get is a growing
updates so you can push the application
and it was supported suppose the open
sort of plug-in for glass fish like you
could open towards the airport by French
Forks I actually forgot the company name
but you could in running server deploy a
new versions of your applications so
this would be the process of clusterings
and conscious I had several times the
problem that we what is clustering
clusterings like you have multiple
application service but they behave like
one so there is your application is like
distributed to a note but it behaves as
if they were only one application and we
had the requirement to to deploy us i
would say variants of the same war to
multiple nodes and then this were
cluster won't help you it is actually it
makes the whole thing verse also the
holes whole questions of of scaling what
is what usually happens in typical
enterprise projects is the database is
overloaded and application server has
nothing to do and i would check first
whether adding more servers to the
application will improve your
scalability and because usually if you
add more you know parallelism to the
middleware and your database would will
slow down the whole system anyway so on
but at the recent heck someone explain
me and they did lots of xml processing
and this was actually worth of
clustering or scaling up and yeah now
the question is if you don't have class
drink
how to scale up or how to deal with this
usually you could use eh cash or hazel
cast to distribute to distribute the IP
addresses and names of your s4 resources
use a hazel cast or a HKS basically as a
registry and then you can build very
easily share nothing architecture we
actually did it several times in my
projects it is a list far less
complicated as you may think actually if
your couriers we also we also discuss
this in the effective and architecture
day in Munich so how to build a simple
but distributed and persistent request
counter in j2m with solid performance
let's say some data loss is acceptable
um you know where the answers look at
how it's called sequences in jp-a this
is actually very robust way for counting
stuff this is like you know counter you
get the key which is which is counted
and what what how jpa operates us it
checks out a I number from a table once
and tries to increase that thousand
times in memory for instance so what you
could do is if you have four nodes you
can check it out four times and then you
will get a different numbers from
different on different nodes and the
same some data loss would be acceptable
otherwise what you will have to do
another option would be that one one
node acts as a master and just counts
and all other nodes are like like slaves
and they just wait until the mustard
mustard eyes and they will vote another
master and some of the logic is already
built in in frameworks like hazel class
for instance and application service had
always proprietary proprietary means to
do this like for instance I think jboss
it was called H a singleton so it was
like singled no Joe's pinned to one note
and by the way be a
ss weblogic server they had actually i
think it was called pinned objects it's
like objects which will pinned to a
certain note so and the question is no
how accurate the counter has to be and
yeah this was and and I think she had
nothing architectual you could do it can
dedicate you know one note to counting
and and and and take in the know just
concert who've been not a problem if it
dies another code another note would
wake up and just count so this would be
acceptable so another question is I hope
it is answered so I'm we just oh we have
one question a Twitter and I got an hint
from from Eric and he says Webster
Liberty profit from IBM with the heap
smaller than two geeks is free if it's a
larger than two geeks you will have to
pay for it and now the question to mark
no mark I think he works for for IBM you
the question is is it the same piece of
code so can i download a no wlp and use
it for free and and then just pay for it
or will i have to redownload something
else as always you know a little bit
painful if you have multiple versions of
commercial and open source software so
let's see how to automate the Wi-Fi
communication relations like data source
and Q's why deploying application
production so um actually this is a nice
one so what you can do you can generate
the XML which is a little bit ugly and
or ugly know what you can always do use
the jboss dash CLI the jar is actually
remote rest interface so they're
different options if you're using for
instance Dhaka what you could do you can
just in if you build the image just
start jboss you know Phi optic CLI and
then shut it down and then you have your
video image or what I sometimes do I
just modify the I think how is called
jabo 6ml the XML configuration file and
put it to Dhaka this is actually what I
do
or we do in productions so um with
something like whiteford it actually
does not matter what you are doing
because all the changes are encapsulated
in in in the image anyway okay perfect
so now the questions about apache Kafka
was a what Apache Kafka is like highly
scalable file-based MQM messaging system
it is would be perfectly suitable to
communicate between Wars years or
whatever and the question are the better
options for a stream centering or
central pipeline architecture actually
you can use hazel cast again for
something similar because it is a
actually hashmap with events or cues
events is very similar to GMS so i would
say what to choose it depends how many
nodes are running so if you have
multiple nodes up you could Russ use
something in memory if if not then you
have to use something persistent like
Kafka so the question is does it have to
be like you know persistence messages so
then I wouldn't use something in memory
you have to commit the data to disk and
before I would evaluate Kafka I would
rather look at GMS it comes with the
application service already built in so
why not to use JMS and most of the
application server for instance the
hundreds queue in the whitefly is great
the glass solution primitives is also
not that bad and forgot for what the the
Apache one is from Tommy they are also
actually what is called nuts is it Sony
computing similar and apache so actually
all GMS providers are great and you get
the d persistence for free so i would
evaluate the GMS first then if you don't
like GMS look at something like Jake
cash and particularly H cash for
instance or hazel cast still not happy
to look at
but Kafka's specific requirements if you
have to write a huge amount of data
which has to be persistent this would be
a DD question actually so let's see what
happened in there in the chat or Twitter
nothing here okay the next one what is
my preferred database this is actually a
nice one for testing i like Derby
because it comes with jdk and it's a
pretty pretty pretty mighty actually so
at this and robust we actually use it
also in production in interview systems
with several gigs of hip drugs of heap
of table space fix really great
hypersonic rh2 are faster but the sequel
support is not as great as in Derby this
would be the pure Java databases which
are always preferred because it's very
easy to install of course Oracle is
everywhere so Oracle's like you know
because I standard oracle database what
Oracle also has is interesting I think
is called kv store it's like Berkeley DB
with yes it's interesting one and you
can pay for it or not it really depends
which versions are you using so we just
put it to a chat so this is interesting
one and from no sequel I this is really
hard to say because they're different
even different kinds of databases but my
Cassandra 44 column based or
document-oriented storage elasticsearch
if you need full text full text search
for instance also nice and the house
called the graph database neo4j is also
interesting too interested one if you if
you're more interested in d in graphs so
this what i used but preferred what I
did for instance in in my block I
removed the database entirely and
replace the database with in
memory cache je cache actually look at
the project headlands and it was the
hazel cast and Java it'll ask streams
and lambdas for the query so there is no
database at all so um yeah and I think
postgres is getting Momentum's I will
prefer Paul squares over my sequel so
this would be actually my my preference
to two databases yeah usually I don't
have too much preference because I have
to use what the clients have and on my
servic I try to avoid databases because
of the backup problems so i will have to
know me attend it somehow so if possible
I try to keep the data memory which does
not matter like these statistics or my
blocks for instance so if you if you if
you are careful watch the statistics
from time to time you know they're
counting from 0 1 and this is usually
when I hypergate upgrade hazel cast or
reboot the server or something like this
now if I think in autumn or winter if
there is a bit a little bit more quiet I
will persist the statistic data
somewhere to a flat file whatever but
right now everything this is memory okay
so back to the questions so this is the
answer to the question we already have
it and now we are in number 7 threading
in Java EE and what about a cow so there
is so and the question is in general it
is well known to avoid it if you can so
and if you need threading you know what
what sources to reach this Java
concurrence in practice actually great
read from from from brand gets its use
in java 6 but there is no a lot of
difference in Java 8 except it's a
little bit leaner and what is my opinion
but akka and I
I don't know whether these threading is
dead heart so I think writing is very
hard if you would try to implement in
Ostend alone java applications like
swing or java fix with lots of threats
and everything hits one singleton or
something like this this could be hard
on the application server if you're a
little bit careful and you're not using
static and and and Singleton's and
instead you re rely on EG bees or
request coped what actually happens so
the whole state is created for one
requests and then disappears after
commit so then it's a pretty easy so um
if you just try not to use threats in
java ee just rely on the application so
it becomes extremely easy so instead of
starting the threat you could for
instance use at a synchronous in Java
basics in Java 7 you can even try to use
or try again how it's called the Java
concurrency utilities and what I also
did I implemented a little framework
porcupine which makes this more easy I
think threading is not that hard which
is a little bit hardest if you do
something in in a synchronous way how to
notify the user because usually the
application server does something else
at that time so um what I consistently
saw in many task forces and projects i
reviewed was if you developers started
to use threats there was actually no
reason no no reason there are just a few
reasons for this and and they use
threats and then actually forgot about
this and they have some Singleton's in
other places and everything became
inconsistent of the gutter deadlock and
if we remove the whole threading
altogether and relied on application
server everything worked better than
expected so what is my opinion about a
chi 0 0 chi 0 and someone else on ask
about vertex both are great and i do to
tell you a story i think it was i drew
wasn't many years ago ago and it was a
JAX conference in frankfurt and not
it was in Frankfurt not in mines so it I
think it was at least six six years ago
and this was a very early days of Scala
and actually even martino deskey joined
the show and explains a scholar for the
very first time and I listen to this
track is really great if java ee we if
we get in no problems with scalability
or messaging or threats with java i will
immediately switch to scala because then
i get you know the native support of all
the messaging all the stuff and we were
actually a long chat with martin a Trank
foot back 10 and funny enough no one was
interested in functional programming
back then this was like no like strange
okay like an alien show with functional
programming they remember Martin had
also no yellow shirt with big and this
was somehow associated with the hot spot
call compiler because or or of generics
because Martino deskey was also one of
the creators of T of the I think he
contributed to the JVM or something like
this and the same feeling I was account
so I would use acha if I would have the
problem so the problem with me as I
spent my time in usual enterprise
projects they are interesting but they
are not chat applications they are not
ustream there are no Twitter there is no
periscope and and there is no facebook
so on if I would create twitter from
scratch I will probably use something
like a cow's Carla or whatever actually
a twitter is based on scanner in my
projects i would say it looks like you
always use java is seven right now and
sometimes java 6 and if you would look
at the code for my commercial
applications you will find only you know
99 percent pojos and are viewed java ee
annotations and this basically is so as
simple as possible so my opinion of acha
is great but i don't have the problems
now if i would have the problems i would
consider a car vertex and before I would
consider both I will just look at GMS
with java 8 and see whether something
like Hornet or just you know JMS
providers would solve my problem or
hazel cast
so if you are looking for our vacations
no vacations opportunity to take
something and go with acha but in using
inner projects it could be a mess
because if you start with acha another
develop will ask and why not you know
vertex and the other will say okay if
you have already vertex why not skull at
all and dope java and the other one was
all I closure would be great so I'm if I
stick with the standard like Java and
Java EE I can reduce the amount of of
meetings and just concentrate or focus
on the domain or business logic and not
talk about fancy frameworks but yeah
still a guy is great and what occur is a
like actor model is like you know object
instances are exchanging messages and it
is similar to GMs object is I think it's
called inbox it's like a queue which
accuse up the messages and receivers in
a single sided way with a nice arrow
recovery and with built-in switch case
statement is called pattern matching so
um yeah this is mmm I like the concepts
I'm still waiting for the problem in my
projects not not you know Twitter's of
Facebook's or Netflix but in my projects
okay so a second here so nothing no
updates and we have something here Oh
another I just missed the question is
enough for a virtual private server with
one gigabyte RAM one cpu and thirty
gases to use pires application server of
GSF each beam JP a one gig of ram it
could be the question is I have no idea
how much my sequel will take but the the
out-of-the-box configuration from pyara
was 512 ram and i think in the reason
they increase it to one gigabyte
REM and I will check out on my server
but I'm pretty sure all my processes are
running like my block and everything way
under one geek i associated ddd
application service properly for geeks
just because i have plenty of ram but
everything should run nicely with i
think two gigs would be not be nicer but
was one gig in should one i have no idea
about my sequel server but pyara should
work nicely with one gigabyte of ram and
it's always the question though how many
how many how many entities are you going
to cash I using the cash at all so but
if you are in a reasonable architecture
it should be more than enough and of
course if you have GF probably if you do
not think a session can consume up to
five make per user you can reduce this
if you play a little bit with the
configuration so you know if you have
two hundred users you will consume the
one gigabyte of RAM so probably if you
have lots of users just F may become a
problem yeah okay so it was a little
fluffy answer but the question is you
know Joseph if it's a Twitter you get a
problem if it's a no you're your own I
don't know hello world application it
will be more than enough ok also nice
one now I forgot actually no Twitter
nothing on Twitter the next one so we
covered now the threading and now it's
something interesting 50 mix of is it
worth to migrate to java ee server if
someone uses has 50 megs of war in
tomcat so someone asked me is it's
always better to have the smallest war
possible my is about 50 mix right now
mainly because a lot of third-party just
from common lips and he uses Tomcat with
jpa and or she or he
tomcat JP and web sockets and is it
worth the real je application server
like glass fish or then pyara white lie
and whatever just interesting one
because if everything works in your case
I would just keep it that way but what I
don't like I don't like long palms and I
don't like small deployments or 50 max I
think it this still would be ok because
it's not a huge but if you're interested
in this go to my youtube channel what I
did with just curious I created a small
screen casts this is the last one thin
Wars java 7 in productivity so i created
one skinny war and one war with 200 max
with just just dropped jdk in there and
show the difference so it makes a
difference 50 Max's it will be
significantly smaller but i really like
skinny wars so it is really the speed in
the simplicity is what i really prefer
but this is a religious question do you
prefer you not to have nothing on your
tomcat or jetty and put everything in
your war and I like the diverse so I
would just put you know just use Java 7
or Java 6 and forgot about forget about
the dependencies runtime dependencies
and and focus on business logic so in
this particular case I would be great so
let's put it this way if you would hand
over the application to me and I will
have to maintain it our migrators if I
had a chance but if you are if you build
the application you're maintaining this
and and you know the code and it works I
would not migrate this because there is
no point I think so far I would ask you
know how slow is the deployment so this
would be my my my question and if you
migrate to glass fish or pie or whatever
probably the code gets simpler so this
this is what you get for free okay I
hope
is somehow answered so is it a good idea
to combine entity listener and web
socket to implement notification so this
is funny because it seems like you know
as either telepathy or you hacked my
machines and know what they are doing
because I had this problem recently in a
project and what happened here I created
in a simple app so I'm working on the
new version of the workshop for palace
or another version part so if you go to
Polly's there is there are some were
courses and you see the Java bootstrap
is right after SCADA so it's a quite
popular so thank you for this and I'm
creating the effective Java 7 is the
second part with a simple app is almost
done and what I did in the simple app it
actually does exactly the same so what I
did here is I implemented an entity with
listener and the listener fires an event
and the event is received by a boundary
and the boundary distributes the event
via web sockets so this is exactly what
I implement it it works actually and so
the answers from the question yes you
can absolutely do this but it seems like
he gets a cyclic dependency and I don't
get the dependency because i'm using the
events this is what breaks the
dependency probably and now you can use
API WebSocket entity events and and
multiple events is always the question
who receives the events is it a
particular user or you have multiple
channels as maurya neurological or
business questions but you can
absolutely do this and we did it several
times and funny enough in the current
projects we are using java x and we use
hazel cast again to do the same so we
are using hazel cast on the server and
the client
use hazel cast on the client and they
are notified proactively about all the
changes with I think it's called cache
entry listener and something similar in
the hazel cast arisa there is a listener
concept but in a more traditional
application wary of html5 applications
you can absolutely use web sockets or
long polling for this I implement is
already several times even onstage and
conferences and I think I also recorded
or screencasts if not just pink me I
will record one with long polling or web
sockets so let's double check so there
is nothing here nothing here so this
chat is way lazier than the YouTube chat
interesting trees also more active so
it's already twenty live users which is
really nice so and there is some about
the wlp free license so I will just copy
it to the old e to the chat so we'll see
actually what it is
I said this chat is lazy and and Gerrans
asset things so I'm just the license the
only question is you know if you buy the
support whether you can stick with your
jars without any modification so oh just
forgot the so how to structure charge SF
code ECB so I don't use entity
controlled boundary for for jsf usually
because if you have only a view jsf
pages which is you more and more truth
these days you will and you will get our
way more components on the back end so
what I usually do I have a clear
separation between the presentation
business so I have two packages business
and presentation the business comprises
the components with ECB and in the
presentation I just have Jess f pages
sorry Nick JSF page is rather than the
model classes and the the model classes
just single classes and if you get more
than this I would think about
introducing something similar as the
backend you can even use ECB pattern for
this but it was not necessary so far so
the common observation is you could end
to M relation between front-end
component in back-end component I never
managed to implement like you know a
castle or a component from the
presentation to business it was always
like n2m
so how to confirm two wice love rules
using jsf can we use some CDI
interceptor magic here so the question
is I don't see the relations or dissidia
interceptor is actually back-end
injection and jsf is the paid generation
and why slow is like SAS is a plug-in
ethic firefox plugin you get similar
functionality with chrome and it will
show you why your application is slow
this is the name so you don't need to go
through all the rules I just want to
know the basics oh and for example
expires headers tagging the images just
just CSS files times comes how to go
about this so you cannot answer the
question in general if you use jsf you
have to make a difference whether you're
using something like primefaces or
richfaces then the component providers
are actually responsible to create
whatever needed for CSS and angeas files
and what you can do equally well create
html5 friendly markup and then you will
be entirely a responsible what jsf
generates also you don't even have you
know to to use the resource head
reference to serve your GS and CSS files
via the faces of light you can just use
direct referenced from whatever you like
even from CDN so it is it is not needed
so um I guess would you the problem you
have you are using probably a third
parting component provider which causes
you some trouble with what's the use the
speed and other questions how to
optimize this and you will have to look
at the documentation of the component
provider because it's out of scope of
GSF you have to run GSF in production
mode this would be the first thing to do
because if you're running in development
mode nothing gets minified and yeah and
what you can isn't even though i think
it's called PageSpeed from google is
like web server plugin which optimizes
ft
everything after after after day after
day i think it's called google page
speed so if you install this is like
apache plugin yeah PageSpeed module
exactly there was two engine eggs and
apache and then it will try to fix it
after the fact so this would be the
easiest possible thing because there
will be nothing to do for you so i will
check this first and surprisingly many
of the startups i work with right now I
using Jess F usually prime face not very
happy about the performance and
everything so I'm it it really depends
you know what do you expect from this of
course a single page application on the
client side with our lots of templates
and dynamic behavior will be almost
orders of magnitude faster than than
Jess f of course but GSF have comparable
performance to tool like frameworks like
wicked and what I think even they should
outperform Ruby applicator ruby on rails
applications for instance so someone
someone sheer he a hawk light and I
asked me in people's days I could use
glass efficient production without cause
but I could decide to pay for a
production license too so this was
perfect and today was right by it's the
same situation not not quite the same
because you cannot pay for what value of
them to migrate to a AP and they have a
slightly slightly older bits yeah
exactly
this is correct this is my understanding
but you should know ask the redhead guys
and this is what I don't like in white
light this is my main criticism but it
is like it is you cannot change this so
in Tommy is not this a similar situation
so my understanding of Tommy is you get
get the support from Tommy right away
and pyara is the same so you can order
logic are you can download classf ish
and get support without to anything and
and websphere liberty profile should be
the same so I don't think don't think
you know you have to look at the IBM
page but I think if you download tid
bits and just using under the two geeks
and then we would like to pay for it you
can just keep the bits on your disk and
just pay for you don't have to replace
it with anything else so yeah so now I
got the response from Malik and I think
mark mark anomeric he works for IBM and
says the code base is the same so IBM is
reasonable so you can just no download
the bits once and then to decide what
they would like to pay or not if you're
under two gigs and to answer the
question from you streamer 5412 you
forgot the vertex question and the
answer is i also like vertex is a really
nice concept just you get the same
answer for me as a Sokka I'm still
waiting for the urgent problem in my in
my in my projects i would ask account
equation to you what we are building of
so why you cannot use stock java is too
slow for instance if yes then i could
you get probably a more specific
question or answer for me because still
i'm not using Java Eve because of
scalability whatever is Java because of
simplicity and this is the main reason
so the question is if if you can just
write what you would like to implement
then I could you get more specific
if you are telco company you can go with
acha vertex but then i will also ask you
know along would be also nice you know
so so um so then we answer not the
question from websphere it means it is i
tested this is really nice fast and you
can buy support from IBM or you have to
if you if you exceed the two gig of ram
and so and the next one is with doc in
mind so the question here is basically
are the java application server dr. eyes
enough and what i'm using if you go to
my blog mybrock runs in dhaka on Tommy
for historical reasons so the Tommy runs
in Dhaka entirely then the the the we
can just go to me so the content here
runs on Tommy this this content runs on
on white fly with hazel cast and I have
also won pyara note on hazel cast just
for fun to test everything and all the
servers are dr. eyes without any
problems and inter correlation is very
similar and I don't have a note with web
syllabi the profile and I think the web
celebrity profile would be a little bit
harder to install as I remember if you
install wlp you will have to answer I
know yes or no a question and then it is
installed so on there would be one or
two lines more in a docker to just
automatically answer this question the
devices question but i might be wrong i
remember if you if you install WP you
there's like an interactive text-based
installer and you have to say yes so i
have to say i never had an issue with
application service and doctor and i use
docker for a long time i think i started
with 0 40 was very early on my server
okay so now would you recommend Java for
web mobile application so I mean what we
the question is would i recommend java
film for for mobile application for me
it's a perfect fit so what mobile would
meet from for me as you will expose to
rest services with WebSockets probably
and this is Java is just perfect for
this is what I do actually all time and
all applications are mobile if you think
about this at least in u.s. more than
fifty percent of the user base is
actually mobile users and the mobile
clients have almost the same
capabilities as desktop so in my eyes
Java is great for this and in my
projects we're using Java exactly for
this not only for this it also interacts
in one project with IOT devices like
embedded devices it's just perfect and
perfect means simple to use oh and marek
also did something he says he brought me
another URI I would drop it into chat I
don't even know what it is hopefully
it's not you know a virus now we have it
here it is running Webster Liberty
profile in a docker container so for the
activity Malik you will get now an
official a hex mark or t-shirt to the
next conference so I will put it here
and here so you can run double LP
directly in the container so
so and this is a little bit harder to
answer because if the application
comprises 10 years and wars I would put
it on different containers directo
microservice yes so you would get 10
docker containers each containing one
application server and their communicate
this would be even buzzword compatible
it will be the micro service
architecture and so on how to implement
this first i would put all the wars on a
one application server first make it run
and then you know use multiple multiple
docker containers i'm actually wrong
what i would do first i would ask you
why you have 10 years and not one and it
is possible i will just merge all the
ten years to one war and then deploy it
on one instance to application server of
your choice whatever you considering it
is great whitefly Tommy pyara glassfish
or pyara is a pitch glass fish or or
double LP and then it'll be the best
possible choice and you will have to
have good reasons you know or good
arguments to introduce 10 Wars if I were
in charge of the architecture in your
project so one war in my eyes is always
better if you can achieve this ok so see
what happens here if not we done we were
fast and active so the first time the
church was reactive I think was good
idea to to include the ustream chat so
it is lots of activity here thanks mark
you get mark or t-shirt for for support
from the IBM side and yeah thank you for
watching and see you almost an autumn i
think it is in September's the next time
and i will create the next gist if some
questions are left just write them down
and thank you for the activity i also
enjoyed the show somehow i don't know
always the first monday of the month and
I learned a lot and I save lots of time
because I don't have to
image anymore which is a really great
feeling so inbox zero does not matter
anymore so at least not for a hex so
thank you for watching and see you next
time and oh I forgot a very important
things to me one of the afaq still the
next ax are in December and one
microservices slot in January it is late
i know i got lots of requests dude this
year but i'm too busy with my real
projects so this is what i only can do
and by the way what's new is javascript
for java developers is with what what I
actually plan to do is to explain the
JavaScript as i explained java it the
same way as a bootstrap so actually to
understand what's going on and then dddd
problems types and then scopes and all
this stuff and and then of course i will
cover nice one and at the end explain
angular 10 a little bit source code what
actually happens and try to implement a
simple dependency injection with
javascript so this is my personal goal
because i got lots of questions about
JavaScript so it is going to be less
more stuff in html5 because I covered
html5 and JavaScript one workshop and
this was way to make much stuff so I'm
thank you for watching and I'll see you
in September bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
