right so good morning San Francisco or
good evening for you
and good morning for me and I would like
the presentation with a to study
presentation with a presentation and
introduce myself so as Steve said I'm
working with Java since 1995 I'm a
freelancer and I really like Java
actually started with I started with
swing and then mimei and and servlets at
the same time and then most of my time I
spend on the server but more and more
time or more and more times and there's
a wave to dust something to do on the
desktop and so I had some several
several several Java fix projects and
yeah and and then afterburner happened
and why I would like to explain during
the session so I've write a block which
is a more or less a notepad so block
atom beans are just not to forget things
I write short posts from time to time I
spend some time on yeah yeah pod Munich
and as I would say three to four times a
year with various Java and Java EE
related workshops and and there were
lots of people from USA actually so
which is amazing and if you like to keep
up with the meta stuff like such events
subscribe to the mailing lists it's um
yeah hex toad news is just mailing list
I I post probably once a month and EXI
oh our online courses nothing about Java
Bix yet is just a micro services Java
and the usual suspects okay if you have
questions don't hesitate and please ask
questions I really like questions and
you can reach me over there by a Twitter
I'll show you in a second
so in via Twitter my Twitter is Adam
bean you can also use the night hacking
hashtags I should see this and what you
can also do you can use the D free node
chat if you prefer
and the the channel name is hex so you
can do this or you yeah this would be I
think the best okay
or of course Skype it it will be the
best possible solution because yeah is
this more personal you know one to one
so X TV is is something interesting so
too I get way too many image with
questions regarding Java fix Java in
Java and I couldn't handle to answer in
the image so what I did instead what I
do instead this is to two years already
the first Monday of the month at 6 p.m.
I'm streaming right now the same
actually the same experience and
answering questions so you can ask me
the questions before the show using
github gist and I would try to answer
them and there are already several
questions on about Java fix usually most
of the questions are around Java EE and
D are the online workshops some books
not related with Java Java ethics and
there are my online courses and this is
the last slide so now we can focus on
content and the marketing stuff is over
very good so we can kill keynote so I
see here this is my dashboard I will see
your questions your life hopefully and
now to afterburner so what is the
history or why I created this and what
is it this would this is probably what
we should start and I would draw a
little bit but I would like to show you
first the get a page afterburner
and today or yesterday it depends on it
depends on the time zone afterburner 1:7
Oh came out which is a big release and a
small release it really depends whether
you are a power afterburner user or just
a starter so um so what afterburner is
this is somehow popular framework it is
on my github account got 137 stars which
is amazing because there are actually
just four classes
and how it started so Java and one point
of time Java Vic's came with a fix ml
support so what a fix ml is is the
ability to create your views or define
your views in an XML file and first okay
to start with I don't like XML a lot so
I try to avoid XML whenever I could in
the enterprise Java space always
generated a fixable never or F XML XML
never created by hand and as Java leaks
came out with F fix ml support it was a
little bit odd for me so again
XML this is the same old story but it
was a little bit different so on what
Java fix actually does this and the XML
is like optional configuration of a
factory which creates and defines a view
so the idea of this F xmls this is are
actually a builder pattern which can be
configured by XML file called ethics ml
and also what you get back you get it
something like and not something you get
back a note or parent which is similar
to a J panel in Swink and you could use
a fix ml or not so and then as I got it
so ok this is actually a really nice
idea so we can now define everything in
XML and change it and we get a panel
back so um before Java fix
we used the alotta NetBeans with the GUI
GUI builder for swing and the problem in
NetBeans and the GUI builder was that
the code was generated and you had to
put your business or presentation logic
into into the predefined predefined tags
and the problem was of course if if you
had to change the UI sometimes the code
got broken and and this was not a really
nice experience so on Java fix of the
are on the other side it is impossible
actually to put business logic to the
XML so which months which makes it kind
of interesting the problem I got is or
the question I got to Oracle
was actually opened some issues so how
big the ethics ml is supposed to be is
it one app so should I define one huge
file with the audio application or is it
more like one f-fix ml per view and then
the next question is know what is view
and where to put the presentation logic
how to load the fix ml files what are
the names of the via fix ml files and
then I thought okay I just don't like to
think about this over and over again and
I would like to create some conventions
and this is actually the afterburner so
the afterburner adjusts conventions
around creating something which loads a
fix ml files instantiates the views
handles the presenters and and holds
everything together okay I would just
any questions so far no questions no one
is a good news so nothing on Twitter
perfect okay so afterburner is is a
maven project it perfect and new it's
also no question Steve yeah hex and
afterburner fix is the is the ID and
what do you get you get basically the
four classes I checked out from from the
from from github so um I open the issue
and ask Oracle's okay if we get one F
XML one big F XML file you know how we
can handle multiple presenters so how to
define multiple controllers and
presenters within the F XML file and the
answer was it is impossible there is
one-to-one relation between the XML file
and the presenter so okay if there is a
one-to-one relation between the ethics
ml in presenter what we can say is if
you have a view in the application each
view needs enough XML and then I will
draw a little bit too
get a little bit more visual and hope it
is easier to understand so where are we
now is the following so what we have is
we have a view which is in Java fix
basically a node and then and this view
is created by F XML so of course this
node can be a whole app or can be just a
tap so if you have a tap in your app and
within the tap there is a view so this
could be a node or the whole app could
be a note if you have full app so okay
button the whole app could be also a
node so well then well then I thought
okay but usually in business apps in
enterprise apps it works like the
following so we have multiple tabs here
and each tabs tab has usually something
specific to a use case it implements a
use case or a business process or
something and the convention is the
following each such a view in the app is
oh is a folder so in After Burner you
would get a Java package so this is the
first convention so each of you gets a
Java package with the name of the tab
like I don't know orders orders or
streaming or whatever and and within the
Java package there are always the same
contents and the content is of F XML
file with the name of the package
usually then a presenter what presenter
is I will show you in a second a
presenter a view the F XML file CSS
which is optional properties which are
optional there are a view files which
comprise the whole view this is the main
ideas on the the
the leading idea is a convention of a
configuration so if you if you see a
structure so a view or an app it should
be very easy to to create the same
structure in in Java
without any further designing or
thinking so and this is basically what
afterburner does that enforces the
structure of an over again and amazingly
it was it is it got really popular so
actually I created on a weekend and a
week later I got an email like it is it
is it is used in some hospital in USA in
Detroit or some whatever so it was
actually a little bit scary but no no
bad news so far at least not in the news
right so um any questions so far so what
I didn't covered is the presenter I also
didn't covered what actually how the
view is structured but I will show you
in a second how it actually works no
questions so now I think what I could do
I create a simple java fix application
by the way I using NetBeans it's a free
ID from Oracle it's really nice I use it
usually for server-side stuff and
therefore this is daily builds and the
reason why I'm using daily builds us
some unrelated stuff is because it comes
with great docker support and JavaScript
support what I need in my current
projects so um the problem with daily
builds is sometimes you will probably
see exceptions on arrows but yeah this
is what I also use in my production
projects so a new project and I would
use to you maven archetype so what
archetype is is like a maven wizard and
afterburner comes with like easy startup
with that what I would like to start
right now and and this is igniter and
yesterday I submitted diversion 1 9 4
which is the recent one in the maven
repository it could take a few hours or
even days because it's the archetype
until it's visible but I just have it on
my local machine so it will work in my
case and now I will have to specify the
project name and the project name how to
call it Silicon Valley Java FX user
group oh this is actually a nice name
okay finish and what it will do it will
create an app so a simple app and you
already see there's a dashboard there is
a light there is there is a F XML file
and this F XML file if we go to it and
and open it you see it looks very like
you you will already recognize the
structures there is an uncle pane which
has children and there is a flow pane
with some insects and there's a label
and a button so it is really readable
XML and it actually it it configures the
Builder which which outputs a note which
is an unco pane so if I double click on
the FF XML file the symbol that opens I
was the symbol that I can define the
look and feel of the app which is really
nice so DM the main idea of of afterburn
of course is used as much as possible
the the symbol and I have to admit it
works perfectly well in all my projects
so the separation between generated code
and and and designed code or or or or
implemented code works very well in Java
vyx why are you showing a second domain
reasoner's separation of or inversion of
control because the XML code calls you
and you and your presentation and
business logic does no it does not know
anything about the generated F XML file
ok so we have the dashboard ethics ml
therefore we have to have the dashboard
view and the interesting part the views
are always empty
so in most cases why they are empty
because afterburner would after
das it recognizes that from the name of
the desperate view there should be a
dashboard ethics ml loads the F XML file
and creates the view what you could do
of course you could override this in in
in a method so you can say I'm I don't
like to load it from ethics ml I would
like to create a view by myself but it
was never necessary so far it could be a
little bit too too much information so
therefore again any questions or at
least Steve will have to ask a question
no questions Steve is muted or Steve is
sleeping okay but do you have any
question Steve
okay so so we have so we have to view
and we have the the presenter and the
presenter implements initialize able
which is the fully optional
so what initialize initialize able is
you are forced to implement a method
initialize which is called calls but by
a fix ml runtime so how it works behind
the scenes so in stock Java fix it works
like the following there is a builder
and the builder reads
and parses the ethics ml file and the F
XML file defines here the controller so
what Java X does it parses the file
finds the controller instantiates the
controller and now is able to inject
stuff into my controller so Java fix
comes with built-in dependency injection
and so inversion of control and this is
the main reason why it works so well and
why swing cogeneration didn't work so
well because in a swing case you
generate the code and the swing code or
the swing code was generated by the IDE
and you got you know the blanks where
you had to fill your presentation logic
so um you are dependent on a generated
code in the in the Java fix case it is
inversion of control so what it means
Java fix calls your code so it's Java
fix relies on your code and your code is
not dependent on the generated a fix ml
so not dependent means there's of course
a little dependency between and the
dependency our names so in my case the
dashpot presenter has a label message
and pain light box so what it actually
means we could go back here so we have
here ID light box ID message and button
launch
so this IDs and the field names in code
they have to correspond otherwise it
won't work
so this is the only coupling you get
which is actually our really great news
and the method initialize is called
after it's called after the presenter is
fully initialized by the a fix ml
runtime and the method create lines is
just my public method and the method
launch so we have two other methods so
the question is you know who calls the
methods and this is also nicely solved
in Java fix so I will go back here
there's a method button there's a button
and if you go here you see on action
launch and on action create lights let's
see so what it basically means is that
you can just invoke whatever public
method you have from Java fix from from
from from buttons checkboxes or whatever
and so it actually means a presenter is
just a POJO with injected Java fix
components and public methods which can
be called by event handlers so this is
how presenters are defined in Java fix
and what what After Burner introduced is
dynamic convention that the dashboard
concepts this is the dashboard is the
whole app comprises a dashboard view
- what presenter and dashpot f-fix ml
this is so far now it should be
extremely clear how it works so we are
already here so we have a fix ml created
by the scene builder tool the output is
a note the presenter is created by you
Dec resent presenter gets in optional if
you like injected all the component you
specified here and you can define public
methods which are called by the event
handlers automatically from Java vixx's
not like in swing case you have to say
you know at action performed how it's
called at action listener and implement
method action performed is no more
necessary it is the adapters are
provided by Java fix which is really
nice
so so this was the basic concept no
question so far
nice okay and the dashboard is view at
the handy dashboard view is empty why
this I see the answer is in the
superclass of afterburner as you can see
what what it comes this is 300 lines of
code and what it basically does is it
provides the conventions okay very good
oh yeah a very good question so um I
actually skipped that usually add you
know five slides explaining why not why
model-view-presenter not
model-view-controller
whatever I say say here is based on the
concept called MVP pattern which is
duplicated MVP pattern Martin Fowler so
if we go here we will find a signed
retirement in 2006 ten years ago this
pattern was to retired and we got
actually two it was split in the two
other pattern supervising controller and
passive view and this what we are doing
are more or less a supervising
controller this is actually the d-des
pattern but it is still used a lot in
the net space and in JavaScript pays in
JavaScript space this MVP
model-view-presenter
idea why not Model View controller
because in the MVC space model view
controller no one actually knew how to
interact and therefore Martin Fowler I
know ten years ago said okay look this
MVP is just vaguely defined what we
should do we should specify and no more
hours or more sharp more more sharp
definition of the which we should
provide more sharp definition what
actually presented controllers and views
are and and and Martin Fowler did it so
what it actually means this MVP my
presenter is extremely opinionated
controller so before Java vics and
before afterburner know all my swing
projects were MVP sorry MVC Model View
controller but all of my project were
completely different you know some
projects used events the others didn't
some use interfaces the add and didn't
and I would say this MVP is everywhere
similar so someone saw afterburner said
this is something similar we did for
dotnet for instance so I would say you
can call it controller but if you call
it may MVP it is a little bit more
defined than MVC
thank you for your question great
question okay then then go ahead with
the a fix ml view and what the view does
it provides it provides conventions and
and loads and uses the ethics ml loader
which is part of Java fix to actually
load the view so we got here the view
and there is route to the most the most
important part is get view and what it
does it asks the ethics ml order to
return the parent and the parent is a
note is something like ensuing jpanel or
if you know Java VIX is the note and and
in JavaScript or HTML it will be
something like a div so something which
can as a part of the whole okay nice so
we covered this so the ethics ml view
and therefore if you override get view
you can return whatever like so you
could return to know your own parent or
you can you can add additional notes to
this parent so you can completely you
can completely configure the outcome or
adjust the outcome so I can of course
run the app out of the box so this is
the nice app with so I launched it so
tower in it ready to take off I will
show you what happens behind the scenes
in a second and if you click this now
three and 256 small views who are
created and dynamically added to the
view so what happened here to to 256
times there was a subview created which
which comprises the presenter again the
view of course which is empty and the
which was a little bit delayed to show
you some nice effects otherwise it will
be even quicker so there here i over it
in the the gate view
and this is just a dot okay and why I
created it because projects asking me to
know what is a water body performance so
now we can test the performance you can
create as many dynamic views which are
fully configured with ethics ml so if
you go here there's still a fix ml what
you also see there is within the
dashboard view there is a concept of a
light like a small light bulb and this
this light bulb comprises is the name
light is the package name and it
comprises the light FX ml light view and
light presenter always the same naming
convention okay so we are pretty far
what is the bootstrap process so the app
itself is just stock Java Java Vic's
application so there is nothing specific
what he will usually do he would create
your first view in my case is just the
dashboard view just this empty view is
just instantiated here - part of view
new dashboard view then you can say app
view get view what you get back is the
note and it passed a node to the scene
so there isn't nothing specific to do
you are not dependent depending on some
strange afterburner classes you only
have you know to instantiate the view
your main view and then ask the view for
the for the route component and add it
to the scene and you are ready to go
okay I think now the mechanics this you
know the the relation between the view
the presenter should be clear oh very
good question here
yeah okay the question was that how to
inject properties and more stuff into
the presenter how it works with
afterburner and to show you this we I
wish I would take a little bit deeper
into the application and go to the dash
pad present dashboard presenter so and
what you see here they are this XML is
stock Java vyx and now we get something
strange at inject and this add inject
comes with the other X dot injector to
inject so as you can see I reuse the
idea from from Java EE so these CDI but
it seems like what we can do in the
presenter you can inject whatever like
into the presenter as you can see you
have a string string string and so forth
and even tower and if you go to the
tower this is just stock POJO with one
method post construct which comes from
Chavez II so it seems like you could
even inject pojos so and what happens
behind the scenes is the following and
now now you see actually the true power
of Java fix which happened by a very
small accident or I would say I would
realize Java fix design so now please
listen carefully and if you have any
questions ask immediately
because it is very simple but I don't
know still confusing so the XML loader
parses the XML file instantiates
whatever it finds and returns it back
what it also does it instantiates your
presenter
if they're fixed mail-order instantiates
your presenter you have no hook you know
to do something with the presenter
because it was directly used by the eff
XML order but the cool story is what a
fixer mail order also provides is loaded
set controller Factory and I think Steve
Steven even wrote and Java magazine
article about this right Steve so you
wrote an article also which explains the
mechanics behind us as a member of a few
years ago but what this means is what
you can do you can pass to the ethics ml
loader your own factory which creates
your classes you said something okay
which creates your own classes so now it
becomes a little bit crazy
ethics ml loader finds the controller in
the in the file wait a second here
yeah so if there is no controller
factory specified it will create the
dashboard presenter with class for a new
instance but if you specify your
controller factory what will happen if
it's a male loader or Java fix one time
we'll ask your controller to instantiate
your presenter and you can say okay this
is a little bit crazy but what I did in
After Burner
I said okay I will create something
which are called injector and the
injector is able to instantiate the
presenter but now I can inject whatever
I like into the presenter so I can
inject properties custom objects pojos
whatever like I could even integrate it
with Java or whatever with jax-rs
services no sky's the limit and the
injector the full dependency injection
from Java and actually at the basic Java
injection are 240 lines of code so the
entire injection happens in one class
was a little bit reflection magic and
why I decided to to write it by myself
because I looked at back 10 and Google
juice and Google juice would was
actually a nice idea but the problem is
what Google juice was lacking was
convention of a configuration so in the
case of Google juice I had to specify
modules or over the place it was really
hard to conventionally inject something
from outside and with with with with my
own injector I can provide provide
whatever conventions I like so that the
main reason to create my own dependency
injection mechanism or adjusting
conventions and what the conventions are
is if afterburner finds a class it will
just instantiate this so there is no XML
in the properties files nothing needed
so it's very basic injection the next
convention is whatever is injected is a
singleton which works surprisingly well
for your eyes so I get several requests
in github you know provide request scope
or session scope some some other kinds
of scoping but no one could provide
say interesting use cases to to motivate
me to implement this and so on this is
this is how it works behind the scenes
so the injector is going to be used as a
controller Factory indirectly so
indirect list there is another
indirection the problem is if you go to
2d to github again the afterburner
became really popular and people wanted
to integrate weld injection they
actually did it a wealth injection
spring put or whatever and and the
problem was of course is how to
integrate something without bloating
afterburner and and I also looked at
weld but what would come with many way
too many dependence libraries so um
there were several branches if you go to
two afterburner and there is the branch
top gun and the branch branch top gun
isn't no just whatever possible his or
all branched so they did the community
provided dependency injection with
sculpt with singleton with constructor
injection this is this is the afterburn
on steroids but I never used this by
myself in production and what I this is
the first plant branch a little bit
interesting is the mobile branch
it was contributed by Johann Foss it
uses internally in lots of projects so
it works on mobile devices
and even on iOS and and what I did the
recent releases is the following
so the recent release provided an
extension mechanism and the extension
mechanism is it is based on service
loader in Java so service loader is an
concept which looks like the following
if you place a file with the name comma
X after burner injection presenter
factory which is a functional interface
with a single
and within the file you specify the
implementation afterburner will use this
to inject whatever like so and what what
I did yesterday I closed all pull
requests all issues because whatever the
community wanted to have is now
externalized by by an injector which can
be implemented by whatever framework you
like so since yesterday
you can plug whatever frame that you
like I would still use my own because
the simplest one but you could actually
use Google juice dagger
I got requests to someone asked about
spring boot so I can now integrate
whatever you like I think even you could
even use eg bees as your as your
components okay so this is the main
feature of the recent release you can
look at the unit tests and actually
implemented such a dummy controller so I
will show you how it does debugging
injection injection and there is the
debarking injector and what you have to
do is you have to implement one method
and the class is the controller class
and you will have to return the class
and this is like the context with
already initialized objects and what i
just did i i'm invoking my own injector
but i provided you know debug statement
so what we can do we can send our break
point and it will see exactly when
afterburner instantiates whatever okay
this was a really long answer to a
simple sniffs question but I get such
questions a lot so I will use this
screencast also note to explain a more
deeply afterburner says okay so I hope
this is clear so and and now back to d2
d2 the sample app so now what happens
behind the scene is the following my
injector finds a Class A declared field
which can be private or not tower so ok
is the tower in the context if not I
will use class from the new instance
instantiate the tower then put it to the
context and then inject the tower here
and then if it finds the post construct
annotation and it voc's the method if
there is no post construct it won't it
doesn't
going to be invoked so why project
inject injection is necessary or
important
so in all Java if F projects so far
what's the following we add the package
now imagine or usually you have to call
a back-end a rest service for instance
and what we usually do we encapsulate
the the rest communication in a pro job
and this Pocho is just a testable class
so you can write unit tests or system
tests whatever to test your
communication and then the presenter
gets injected this service class so this
is at inject at inject does the
presenter and this is the view and Steve
Steven asked me how to obtain the
reference to presenter and the answers
yeah just asking the view and you get it
present if you already need it but what
usually happens is you are working
within the presenter so now if you have
a button and you push the button the
button can call public methods I don't
know fetch from server and Finch from
server goes to the service and fetches
the results and and sets the results to
due to DUI back so this is why we need
additional supports and there are
services and there's also a concept of
model classes but there is no difference
between both technically so both this
pojos so what you can do is model you
can have one view and by bind UI to here
and other view also bind stuff here and
then you can cook both can communicate
using model which is singleton so all
injected classes are Singleton's I hope
now it's crystal clear and Steven is
happy with the answer
so and I got a question
Cooper asked me could you just reflect
on Swink namespace to create that if XML
this is I don't get okay he answered by
herself I spit in his model view
viewmodel
is that yeah model view viewmodel is
this what I were I talked and I thought
this was web stuff yes but before I
speed up net there was a thing is called
WPF and this was like XML to define UI
interfaces and this was native stuff
yeah I hope this is clear
dupa okay then we covered already I
think the basic mannix if you have
questions again how it works
ask me so the same is true for the for
the strings so now what only happens I
recognize a string is something special
and with the string prefix what happens
then there can be configuration
properties is fully optional so if you
specify the configuration properties all
the keys are injectable so I can say
prefixed our says happy ending
check happy happy ending so and this can
be injected directly with the values to
the to the presenter also what do you
get you can you get resource bundles
loaded so this resource bundle gets
shrink is a built in Java Java fix
mechanism there is a dashboard
properties and there is and there is the
end so this is also accessible so if you
run the application again run it
now you see noticed our in it where it
comes from because the poacher was
instantiated at low time this is the
output here and launch and say state
towers is okay okay from tower enjoy
something and this this are injected
properties from tower says here for
instance okay so now this package here
they are typical there is typical
contents presenter view XML they belong
together
so this is this is Trinity presenter
view and therefore they are mandatory
tower is the service or model class this
is fully optional there's configuration
properties and this are just recent and
'el okay
now interesting point there's method
decreed lights which creates 250 56
views and you see how it can happens
there is a view new light view so it
just created and then I can save you get
view async so there is a possibility to
create views asynchronously and I got
this request by there was a crown
Fraunhofer Institute in Germany they use
afterburner which seems to be a huge
application to control the power plans
and they wanted to instantiate whatever
possible in asynchronous way so instead
of no saying view get view it I call get
view async which is an interesting Java
8 piece so what happens here I'm passing
the method lightbox get children ad
which is a method reference to get view
async so we just look at this and this
interesting part is this gets view async
is just a consumer of parents so you can
pass whatever you like which consumes a
parent obviously if we if we go back
this get children is a collection of
parents or notes and it consumes a
parent or not and what do you get with
that there are several things first I
ask for review here and I say some sub
play is supply async I provide the de
parent it is it is done in that in a
pool and then I'm using the ethics
platform executors run later so it means
this the updates on the view happens in
in the UI thread so there is there are
no inconsistencies and in exception case
i'm i'm using the reporter this is stock
Java 8 so no no magic no external
framework so what I really didn't like
our external dependencies and
afterburner doesn't come with any
external dependencies so at the end of
the day the size of the afterburner is
around I don't know 10k or something is
a tiny framework ok this asynchronous
instantiate instantiation is absolutely
optional usually what happens in project
at the beginning you are just using this
gate view and then it will block and
wait until it's constructed this you can
instantiate you know so in my case if I
just just do it again
now we just run it and then as you can
see it just creates the views 256 used
in different colors so um you see
usually it should be if I would create
in a row it should be from the from the
from the I think darkest to the lightest
one but you see this is just a random
random pattern so what it actually means
all the views were created randomly and
yeah questions again I have question to
Steve but you can just unsend Twitter
how much time we actually have we are
almost 1 hour so I don't know how much
how much time is scheduled so um you
Steve can just answer this in Twitter
okay so we have that so we we look at
the presenter and we created
asynchronous oh wait a second there is
something ok yeah sorry
okay
duper ask me how how come that very ants
drink doesn't have an annotation like
the rest
so the question from duper is the very
end doesn't have the annotation because
it cannot be injected it it it is used
here in the resourcebundle gets drink
and this richness bundle is passed by
the Java vics runtime so this is the
reason okay this is the reason why it is
not not injected if I would put here at
inject I would get an error because
whatever is in the in the dashboard
properties is not injected it is
provided as a resource bundle and the
resource bundle is passed by Java
Runtime so thank you for for the
question okay so we have 10 to 15
minutes so then I will show you
something interesting so of course we
have to maintain three files always and
write in by hand which not is not always
fun therefore the community created a
really nice plugin and I would like to
show you and this is the afterburner
a fix plugin and I'm I'm using it I've
just pass it to the chat
so and the afterburn of plugin and
install this is our really nice it
compass is extremely well documented and
is very helpful and is a minimalistic
plugin but perfectly documented so to
show you this let's imagine we have one
package light but I would like to create
darkness so I create another view called
darkness and now I will have to create
you know everything by hand but what I
can do instead I can just go here and
say new other go here and say Java fix
afterburner fix and this comes with the
from the plugin file named darkness and
you can see it will create darkness FX
ml darkness present the darkness view it
was really nice the community
contribution because it just created the
plug-in without asking me it was just it
just happened and it just matches
perfectly the convention so it is really
really nice nice work and now even ask
me now would you like to have a sty
sheets CSS tie sheet to create the UI we
would like to have optional property
file and optional resource file sell it
yes I would like to have everything and
then say finish and now it created a
presenter it created a view which
provides you even access to the real
presenter and the nice story is the
plugin creates even that Java doc which
refers to me as an author which is not
true but it's really nice so big thanks
to the author the configuration
properties with nice really nicely
documented and the F XML file so what I
can do right now I can say ok I would
like to have a button and I will put the
button here and the button ok just a
button then a label
and say this label the ID is output this
the ID is important so on the label has
no contents just large so we have to
label we have to button button so and
what I can do in my present right now I
could say here at the XML label output
this has to correspond and the label has
to be a fix in my label and then I could
provide a method safe and then say for
instance output set text as slick on
very jf fix so this and now we can go
back here so in my button and the action
is what is it safe so now if I will push
the button it will call the safe method
here so to activate that what I would
like to do I will go to the app and say
instead of using the dashboard view I
would like to use the darkness view it's
the easiest possible thing okay and one
it
button thanks for the Jetix so this was
the the and nicely the component so what
you can also do you can say
configuration properties and say okay
but I would like to have a configurable
message is Steve and say okay just set
Steve in the source code sorry it will
come in 30 seconds to you no problem so
and now right now if it's already too
many thanks T for the jitters Silicon
Valley Java Java fix group as you can
see it was provided by here it was okay
but I have baked a service and I will
call it I don't know message service
it's just a POJO which needs some
initialization in it connection and this
is post construct and then I can say
private string message or yeah
from then I could also output that so we
have this and then I can say okay now
inject the what was it message service
and then I can just say here plus
service dot message so run it again I
probably have already 15 applications
running so thank see for Jetix and from
back end comes from the pojo so in my
eyes is extremely way or extremely
productive way to build java fix apps
quickly what I also did I create a logic
sample called light fish and I migrated
afterwards to afterburner and light fish
is monitoring for java application which
comprises multiple nested tabs and still
use the the afterburner and then
simplifies a lot the structure it
provides or provides you a structure of
the app so you don't have to twink twice
and know how to how to destructure a
concept into code or how to how to
provide a mapping between the concept
and the code and it is well received by
the community and afterburn itself comes
with four classes so it's one more then
then promised why because yesterday I
created a functional interface present a
factory which provides the extensibility
so this just finds all the presenters
there so one static methods in turrible
and this instantiate instantiate
presenter is the hook which you can
implement configurator cares about the
configuration so it reads configuration
properties injector is covered
conventional injection
and a fixable view is the only class
where the magic happens where all the
conventions are defined and I call it a
framework which is actually not versed
to call it a framework it's a small
library with four classes so this was I
think the most deep afterburner
introduction in history if you have
questions we can dig into deeper into
synchronous asynchronous or whatever
like and this is used by a lot of
projects I don't know how many but I get
them more and more you know pings from
from the community like yeah huge
project are based on After Burner
questions now I can see you as well okay
so have fun with the prices and and
IntelliJ on IntelliJ has great support
well for xml as well even better than
NetBeans so it is a two directional
editing is really nice so uhm yeah very
good morning our problem is 4 a.m. in my
case is great because we can schedule
net whatever you like such a meeting
because there are no collisions with my
clients calendar no I always have time
at 2 a.m. to 4 a.m.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
