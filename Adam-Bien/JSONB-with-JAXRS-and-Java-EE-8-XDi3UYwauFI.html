would like to show you how to use Jason
be together with jax-rs
and for this purpose I would like to
create a project a maven project from an
archetype Java 8 archetype and call it a
jax-rs Jason B so just do this and what
we got is a maven projects with Java 8
support
so now let's we need an entity to be
civilized and let's call it developers
and DT and identity is the developer so
we have the developer and the developer
has a name and H and a constructor and
there should be enough and then we get a
resource class and this is in the
boundary package developers boundary and
the name is developers resource so and
the developer resource exposes the
resources as developers and we have a
cat so we just will return a single
developer for now get string developer
return so what to return so what we can
do right now is we can go to developer
and say public string to Jason and then
Jason B
Jason be provider provider create tilt -
Jason this and what we get back is a
string actually what the other could do
there's an easier way Jason bilder JSONP
builder create this is a shortcut so we
have Jason build I create
- Jason okay and then I can go here and
say return new developer and the
developer so Java developer they are
young so let's say 16 and then - Jason
and let's see what happens so I will run
it on glass - 3 5
it's the reference implementation for
Java 8 it's just called startup it puts
the app and then opens the browser and
this is Jack's arrest Jason B and then
resources developers and as we see it's
empty
so nothing there what's the problem so
the problem is Jason B default
configuration so if we use public
attributes then we see that something
happens and what we could also do
we can use the Jason property and rename
it completely let's say first name and
would be first name so what to do to
change that so I can just say yeah new
builder then with Jason config so Andy
Jason config we need a property
visibility strategy which allows us to
use private attributes as default so
just create one new property visibility
strategy and what I can tell is okay I
would like to use all fields to be all
fields to be visible through and Method
should not be used for serialization so
we have that so done so and what I get
back here is a config and then I can
pass the config and then built and now
switch back developer public and public
let's declare both as private again and
it still works so if I would remove that
so it's not true rather than false it is
empty and with true I allow all fields
to be see Eliza below DISA risible which
is actually comes with great flexibility
because I can ask the field for for the
whole metadata whether it is annotated
or not to build my customer rotations or
whatever is imaginable with
their reflections reflection so thank
you for watching see on upcoming
conferences workshops here put Munich
drug shops
yeah xio or JavaOne so thank you for
watching and bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
