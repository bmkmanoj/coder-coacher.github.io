about something called an array inside
PHP and for this episode we're just
going to really briefly get into a
little bit about the arrays you know how
we actually create them and how we can
echo out each individual array or like
data inside the array so for the last
episode when we talked about loops we've
really briefly talked about arrays and
this is actually the same array as we
used as an example for the last episode
when we talked about the for each loop
so we're just going to go and use the
same one as an example for this episode
now the way we create a race or at least
the purpose of a race is to store a lot
of data in a single variable now it
could essentially say well okay if we
want to store five pieces of data I
could create a variable that I can say
you're not going to call it data 1 is
equal to and then I can take you know a
string like Daniel up here and I can
save it and then I can copy this one and
just create a couple other ones
underneath here we can actually call
this one two three four and then again
we can just change the names in here but
now doing it this way it's going to get
quite annoying when did you actually
want to you know have a lot of data
going on at once so instead of having
each of these variable created we can X
create a very short piece of code which
simply does the whole thing for us
without having to create all these
variables down here so the basic idea
behind arrays is simply to write shorter
code and to use these in a little bit
you know easier way that we can by using
a lot of variables so now we have an
array up here which by the way is
written out by simply writing array
you know parentheses and I'm putting the
data in here separated by a comma you
can use strings you can use integers you
can do you know use a lot of different
types of data now if I do actually want
to write something out in the screen
from this array we can actually go ahead
and say echo the name of our variable
which has the array in it and then I can
actually go ahead and add curly bracket
no sorry not curly brackets just regular
brackets and inside these brackets we
can write from 0 till however many
pieces of data we might have inside the
array remember we do actually start at 0
when we count
so zero would be Daniel in this case one
would be Jane and so on and so on and so
on
so if actually a kata ra0 go to my
browser you guys will see if you get
Daniel if I say - we should probably get
Jacob which in this case we do so when
we talk about arrays there's a lot of
different things we can do with arrays
and it can actually get really really
really complicated you know you can
actually have an empty array and you can
start putting data into the array by
simply assigning it underneath here
there's really a lot of stuff we can do
with arrays and there's actually a lot
of different types of arrays we have
something called associative arrays we
have something called multi-dimensional
arrays we have a lot of different types
of arrays out there now for this episode
we're just going to focus on talking
about you know regular arrays but in the
future we're going to get into the
multi-dimensional and associative arrays
and that sort of thing for this episode
we're just going to going to end it here
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
