talk about something called a CSS reset
sheet which is something I highly
recommend you guys look into before
starting any kind of website essentially
what it is is when you start out a
complete new website only a browsers are
going to have some kind of default
styling applied to all the elements on
your website which you need to get rid
of if you want a completely clean and
controlled website now what I mean by
that is I have created a dip box over
here as an example and I have styled it
so as you guys can see I did actually
give them a dip box a width as a hundred
percent a height as 80 pixels and I gave
it a background color as black now if
you take a look at it you'll actually
notice that even though I told it that I
wanted it to be a hundred percent
there's actually a margin going on on
both the left and the right side and at
the top which is something that is
applied by a browser as a default when
it comes to styling so in order to get
rid of the browser's default styling
we're going to have to add some CSS code
at the very beginning of our style sheet
which sets everything back to zero I
like back to normal so we have a
complete control over what exactly is
styled in which way so I found a website
here and you can actually just go to
google and search for a CSS research
sheet or like a just the html5 reset
style sheet and this can be a bunch of
links that takes it to different kinds
of websites now the one I found here is
one called html5 doctor.com which has a
very good piece of research sheet that I
have used in every single project of
mine and what it can do is simply go
down and start copying the code all the
way down to the bottom where it stops
you're going to copy it go to your
stylesheet then we're going to go ahead
and paste it at the very top of our
style sheet like so and this time after
I saved it and reface my website you'll
notice that suddenly our margin
disappears because now we have reset our
browser so this is why you want to
consider using a reset style sheet and
this is probably something you should do
if you want everything to look exactly
the way that I'm doing
in this series before we get started
okay so this is all I want to show you
guys in this episode in the next episode
we're going to start creating our header
of our website which we have right here
and actually make it look like something
so if you guys enjoy it and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
