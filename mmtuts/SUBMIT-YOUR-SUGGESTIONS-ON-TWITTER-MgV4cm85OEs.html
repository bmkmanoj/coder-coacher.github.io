short update video and what's actually
going to be happening inside this
YouTube channel because as you guys may
notice there's actually a new schedule
from when i upload there will be new
changes in the future and you know stuff
is happening right now and it's actually
happened in the past as you guys may
notice i did actually neglect uploading
a couple of videos because i have a
stick schedule of uploading every
tuesday and thursday and for the past
week or so I've actually been missing
out on these uploads so just figured
that I should explain what exactly has
been going on inside the channel as well
as the plan for it in the future so as
you guys may see in front of me here I
do have a Twitter account that I just
set up not even 10 minutes ago and the
idea behind twitter is that i am going
to use this as my type of communication
between you guys and myself because the
youtube comment system is getting quite
flooded quite happy about that because
there's actually a lot of people joining
up in the channel which is something
that i am quite surprised about I just
never imagined the town getting so big
and so fast even so what is that to do
was because I'm getting swarmed with all
these comments which a lot of times
contains you know very constructive
things such as you know thank you for
uploading or you know could you please
do a tutorial on this or you know
sometimes negative stuff in case you
guys didn't like a tutorial there's
quite a few comments coming in every day
meaning that i'm getting quite swamped
and i can't really keep up with every
single one of them so I set up this
Twitter page here where i will be
uploading you know a tweet every single
time this new video out for example
right now you guys can see i did
actually i did actually create a new
schedule for when I wanted to upload I
have been uploading Tuesday and
Thursdays like I mentioned and today
well not today but for the past couple
of weeks I've been making the schedule
and then set it in sunday i'm going to
go ahead and do it you know a type of
tutorial that you guys want me to do
whether it being within HTML CSS whether
it being within PSP or you know any
other kind of feel that you guys might
be interested in i'm going to go and
take input hopefully regarding the
tutorials that already exists i don't
want to spend a saturday and sunday on
creating new courses as you guys could
see right now i already had three
just running i also have a HTML CSS
course inside my channel i have a
wordpress course i have a premiere
course so what I would like to do with
saturday and sunday is to do a tutorial
regarding something within these
languages that i already have inside my
channel that you guys would like to see
and you guys can go into twitter and
tweet something reply to the to the
tweet and comment some kind of feedback
to what you guys want to see so i really
hope that you guys will use this rather
than going to the comments whenever it
comes to i'm not saying i'm not going to
use you to have anymore not going to be
in the comments of course i'm going to
be so i'm just not going to reply as
often as I used to I do actually read
every single comment on YouTube I read
every single one of them I read all the
private messages so if you wrote
something in the comments and you feel
like I ignored you I did read your
comment I took all your suggestions into
consideration when making you know
tutorials for example the the new PSP
you know the object oriented PHP
programming series and bootstrap that
was actually your guys idea so I did
actually take that into account when I
created the course so I hope you guys
will use the system whenever you want to
actually communicate with me of course
there's a lot of people communicating so
i might not be on every single comment
in here since i will also be on youtube
as well but this is what i'm going to go
to whenever i see suggestions from
people you know what kind of the tories
should be uploaded so i'm going to use
this as a kind of platform to get
inspired of what needs to go into
channel so hope you guys will actually
use this one i am going to maybe every
monday ask you guys what do you want to
see on saturday and sunday and then you
guys can come with some kind of input
you know sometimes for example profile
page would actually take more than just
one video so we might do you know a
Saturday and Sunday where we just do a
profile page for example so i hope you
guys enjoyed this to a video here just
as your update to you know show you guys
what i'm going to be using this for and
i'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
