visual studio code since there's a lot
of things that you guys requested of me
to show regarding this text editor so in
the last episode I showed you how to get
rid up a PHP error message in this
episode I'm gonna show you guys how you
can install extensions inside this
editor here so on the side here this is
actually what you see when you open up
for the first time well except for you
will actually get a welcome message but
when you start it up the first time you
will actually have something going on
this side here will have something at
the bottom here that you can get rid of
if you want to by just dragging it down
and on the side here we do have a couple
of different menus at the bottom here
will actually find one called extensions
and inside of here you can actually go
in search for whatever type of
extensions that they might want to
install so what we can do is we can
actually go ahead and try and search for
something that's really popular when it
comes to visitors to the code which is
how to change the formatting of a
certain code inside this editor here so
were to say something like PHP format
because I didn't have one of you asked
me about how to change the format inside
this editor using PHP code and as you
can see we get a couple of different
options here now if you were to click on
one of them you can actually see how
many stars it was actually rated you can
see how to install it down here at the
bottom and this is something that might
be a little bit confusing to some people
when you start out now I just sort of
recommend if you are completing a new ad
is to just sort of look them through the
one that I do actually have installed
for my PHP boutique all formatting is
the one called PHP in telethons which is
a funny put together word because they
have an elephant SL logo because an
elephants but this one is the one that I
use and you can actually go ahead and
click install over here and then after
installing it you need to restart the
editor node to actually activate the
extension that you just installed and it
does actually have a button here that
allow for you to immediately reboot the
software without actually losing all the
documents that you have open inside the
editor if you want to disable or
uninstall this extension just installed
you can go ahead and do it here as well
the same place we did actually click
install and when you do actually install
an extension I do recommend you to read
the instructions down here the details
about it because in some cases like
configuring your already existing
settings inside the editor can be a
thing that is necessary so it will
actually explain how to do that inside
the extension here now I will have a
separate episode showing how to install
the format and how to get it done the
correct way so you can actually access
it inside the editor so I'm not going to
do that in this episode this one is just
going to focus on installing extensions
so as you can see we can actually click
an extension install and there we go if
you were to install an extension and it
gives you an error message if you try to
access one of its features it could be
caused by the fact that the extension is
not working the way it's supposed to
because a lot of these extensions here
are created by individual people who
just create extensions for software or
exam for this editor here so don't be
alarmed if a certain extension doesn't
work in my case here the one called PS
pcs fixer is one that I tried out the
first time when I did actually you know
install extension for this software and
it did give me an error message that I
couldn't figure out how to solve and in
that case I went ahead and installed in
telephones instead which also has high
ratings and didn't produce an error
message when I tried to format the code
that it allowed for me to do as part of
its features inside the extension here
so this is how install extensions I hope
you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys next
time I'd like to say thank you to all
the people supporting me on patreon
engines the next two benefits such as
lesson materials then go ahead miss it
the link to to see on screen here and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
