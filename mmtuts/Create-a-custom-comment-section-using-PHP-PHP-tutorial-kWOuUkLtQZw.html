create a comment section inside a
website using PHP code now the way I'm
going to show you guys how to do this
it's going to be slightly different than
I think other people might teach you how
to do it because we are going to do this
in two different ways the first way
we're going to do it is where you don't
have to be logged in using a login
system in order to write comments and
the reason I'm doing that is because I
know some people out there don't know
how to create a login system yet and
still wants to learn how to do this now
the second way we're going to do it
after we've done it the first way is to
take the comments section and make it so
that you have to be logged in using a
login system before you can write any
kind of comments so we're basically
going to take this episode and continue
to build on it till we have the final
episode where we do actually add you
know the login system to it so if you
don't want to learn how to do this with
a login system just go ahead and follow
the next couple episodes and I'll let
you guys know when we start including
the actual login system okay so the
first thing we're going to do here in
this episode is we're going to go and
setup the database we need for the
comment section and just set up the
basic HTML part that we need to have
before we can write any kind of comments
so what we're going to do here is make
sure we do X have xampp turned on
because we do need to connect to some
type of database and I'm using my local
database in this case so I'm just going
to go and use xampp for this now that I
have it on we do actually need to have a
root folder for the website now I just
created a folder inside my htdocs folder
inside xampp called
comment section so as you guys can see
it's completely empty I have no files in
here yet so after we have this we can
actually go out and open up our PHP
myadmin
which is where we can actually go in and
create databases so we're going to use
on our website so inside PHP my append
I'm going to click on databases at the
very top here and I'm going to create a
database called comments section now you
don't actually have to call this the
same as your root folder name I'm just
calling it this because it makes sense
to me so after I've actually written it
out I'm going to click create now as you
guys can see
so we hit create is going to take us
straight to the database where it says
no tables found in database so we do
actually need to create the tables we're
going to use to create the comments
section so the first thing we're going
to do before we start coding anything
for the website is that we're going to
go ahead and go to the SQL tab up here
in the top and write the SQL code that
we need to write to create a table for
the actual comments because we do X need
to save the comments somewhere which is
going to be inside the database using
our table here now if you're not
familiar with PHP myadmin and creating
databases I highly recommend you go back
and watch either my tutorials or someone
else's tutorials and how to create
tables and databases because you need to
know how to do this before we create
comment sections okay so now we're in
here
let's go ahead and create a table I say
create table space comments because why
not just call it comments space
parenthesis semicolon now I'm just going
to go ahead and move down my parenthesis
to the next line so we have a split here
and then we're going to go and create
the necessary columns that we need
inside our comments section table the
first I'm going to put in here is going
to be the ID for the comments so I'm
just going to go ahead and say see id
which is comment ID space int for
integer type which is going to be set to
11 so we can write 11 characters of
numbers space not null because we don't
want this to be left as null inside the
database we do actually want to have
some kind of thing in here space then
we're going to set it to auto increments
because we need this to automatically
increase by 1 each time we include a new
post and we don't have to do this inside
our PHP code it will actually
automatically do this so we don't have
to do it ourselves
so we're going to say Auto underscore
increment in capitalized letters space
primary space key so we do X have this
set as our primary key inside our table
we're going to say comment
and go to the next line so now we can
actually start putting in the
information that we want inside our
comment section and that's totally up to
you guys you can follow the way I'm
doing it here or you can create your own
way but I'm just going to go and focus
on a user ID so we can access see who
wrote the comments a date so we can see
what time they wrote the comment and the
message so we can actually see what
message they actually wrote and post it
for our whatever we're posting on here
so the first one is going to be UID
space watch ah parentheses which is a
data type with characters and I'm going
to go and set this one to 128 because I
don't think a user ID is going to be
more than this space not null comma then
I'm just going to go ahead and copy this
line because no need to write everything
twice
and paste it underneath here two times
now the second one is going to be change
to the date which is going to be a
date-time format at which we're going to
use for this example so I'm just going
to write the name as dates and set the
we called the data type to date time and
it's also going to be called not null
underneath here we need to write message
as a name and we're going to change it
from voucher to text which is a binary
type of text which doesn't need to have
some kind of limit like we do it watch
our and we're also going to set this one
to not null and make sure that you
remove the last comma so after we have
this let's actually go and copy a copy
whatever we have here and paste it
inside our text editor and save it
because it's always nice to have our SQL
code saved somewhere so we don't have to
double write something in case we screw
something up and we need to write the
entire table one more time so I'm just
going to go ahead and save it inside my
root folder as I don't know SQL dot SQL
or something so after we have this we
can actually go back to our database and
click go
as you guys can see we have a new
comment section table now if you do
actually go to structure at the very top
here as you guys can see right now we
don't actually have any rows if you go
to structure you can access you the data
type that we need to put in here so now
that we have two database up and running
we can actually go ahead and go down to
our text editor set up a new document
and create our front page for the
website I'm going to go ahead and save
this one as index dot PHP now in here
I'm just going to go and set up a very
basic html5 template which we're going
to use for our front page I'm going to
go and write something else down in the
body part here which is going to be
whatever we want to comment on now in
this example we're just going to go
ahead and say we have a video on this
page and we want people to be able to
write comments for this video so I'm
just going to go ahead and write a very
basic video and I do actually have a
shortcut to just write this out really
quickly like you guys just saw here but
you guys do not create a video by now
because this is basic HTML so underneath
this video we're going to go ahead and
create a comment section using just HTML
which means you need to have a form that
has some type of input that we can
actually write inside of and submit
using a button so I'm going to go ahead
and write text area inside our form the
opening and closing tag and inside the
text area the first tag we're going to
go ahead and give it a name and set it
equal to single quotes not double quotes
of course it still works with double
quotes but for later you're going to
thank me for using single quotes to
begin with so in here we're going to go
ahead and say message because why not
just call this text area for message so
we know what it is and then I'm just
going to go ahead and go on top of the
text area and create two inputs well
let's actually just create one for now
and set the type equal to single quotes
hidden which means that we can actually
see the input but it can still be
submitted when we hit the button
I'm going to give it a name equal to
single quotes as user ID because inside
our database
we need to have three different values
we need to submit when we write a post
the use ID the date and the message so
after this one I'm going to go ahead and
set a value for this input equal to
single quotes and because we don't need
to have a login system for this example
in this episode we're just going to go
ahead and set this one as anonymous and
let's see if I can spell this and
non-new mess I think this is spelled
correctly I'm not American I'm not
entirely sure but this is going to be
what it says inside the database then
now now that we have this we can
actually go in just copy this line paste
it below and change the name to date
because we also need to submit the date
for whatever we're writing in here I'm
going to set the value to something else
for now we don't actually have the value
that we need to put in here because it
has to be the current date time so let's
just go ahead and set that up right now
so at the very top of our front page or
inside the header if you did actually
split up the document we're going to go
and write some PHP tags inside the PHP
tags you need to tell it that if we were
to actually go in and call on a date
function using PHP what date-time format
should it be like what timezone should
we actually use for the date format so
I'm going to go and write date
underscore default on the score timezone
on the score set parentheses semicolon
so inside the parentheses we need to
tell what kind of format we need to have
it in so I'm going to write single
quotes I'm going to write at least in my
case Europe backslash Copenhagen because
I live in Denmark so I would like for it
to be Copenhagen time now if you don't
know what to put in here just go ahead
and google it just go ahead and Google
the
the format or the function name and you
know whatever you can put in here if you
live in America or if you live in India
or somewhere else in the world but this
basic just takes the current time in
Denmark when we do actually submit the
post so now that we have that up here in
the very top we can go back down to our
form and let's actually go and put this
inside PHP codes then tie a form I mean
like so and in order to axis C to form
on the website need to echo the form out
so make sure you write echo double quote
and then the end here we're going to
write double quote semicolon so now that
we have that we can go inside the value
which is equal to nothing right now and
say double quotes punctuation and inside
here we can actually go and write the
PHP date format or date function which
is where we're going to tell it how to
write the format we're going to insert
into the database because right now as
you guys can see the data type we set
for the date which date time which means
that it has to be a very specific way
that we write out the date that we
submit you know to the database so now
that we have the date function down here
we are going to write single quotes and
then we need to set it to year - M - D
now notice that I did actually write
year as capitalized why because we need
to have that space and then we need to
set the time which is going to be a
capitalized age : i : s which is
basically the our format the minutes and
the seconds now that our format the
reason it's a capitalized 8 is because
we're using a 24 hour time format we're
not using the 12-hour we use am &amp;amp; PM but
we're using 24 hours so now that we have
this we do actually have the comment
section almost ready because we need to
add a button as well so at the bottom
here
we're going to add a button and inside
the button tags we're going to go ahead
and write comments so it actually says
comment inside the button and you can
actually click it now the button itself
we're going to go ahead and give a name
equal to submits and we're going to give
it a type which is going to be equal to
submit as well so now that we have this
let's actually go ahead and see what we
actually have done inside our browser so
forward to go to my comment section
website you guys can see we have a video
and we have a comment section down here
which looks very ugly right now but we
will actually style it at one point
let's actually go ahead and move down
the button so it's not on the right side
here by going right after the text area
down in our PHP code and say break like
so refresh and you guys can see we moved
it down so now that we have this we can
actually go ahead and let's actually go
and style it let's just go ahead and
make it nice so I'm going to open up a
new file save it as style put CSS inside
my root folder and link to it inside my
front page so I'm going to go inside my
head tag and link to style that CSS
again if you think I'm writing fast when
I'm writing the HTML you should know how
to write HTML before you go into this
episode so just go ahead and copy this
if you don't how to write it so now that
we have this we can actually go into our
style at CSS and say ok so inside this
website we have a text area open up the
text in here so we can actually write
code and give it a width and we're going
to set the width as I don't know 400
pixels we're going to give it a height
as one hundred pixels I guess let's
actually go and set this one to 80
pixels because there might be too much
let's give it a background color as
hashtag ffff which is white and let's go
ahead and set the resize to none because
we don't want to be able to stretch our
comment section or like our text area as
you guys can see I can actually grab on
to it and resize it which is not very
good inside a website now I can actually
resize it and we have a fixed size for
this text area so now that we have this
we can actually go ahead and style the
button so I'm going to go ahead and go
underneath here and say we have a button
give it a width as 80 pixels
I guess height as 30 pixels let's
actually go ahead and set this one to
100 pixels and width which is good
enough let's give it a background color
hashtag and let's go ahead and set this
one to two a to eight to eight which is
a dark gray and let's remove the border
by setting the border to none and let's
actually go ahead and change the color
of the text set it equal to hashtag FFF
which again is white and let's go ahead
and set our font weights let's actually
start the font family and set it to
Arial which I know is not a very pretty
font but we don't want to worry about
having to import fonts in this episode
so we set it to Arial and save font
weight and set it to 400 so now we get
this looking thing so now we actually
have some sort of section down here
that's actually going to do one more
thing let's go to our button and say the
cursor when we hover on the button needs
to be set to pointer
which basically means to beget right now
as you guys can see we don't actually
get a hand symbol when I hover on the
button now when i refresh the browser
you can see we get a hand symbol so it
actually looks like a clickable thing so
now we basically have a comment section
the next thing we're going to have to do
is actually go ahead and write the PHP
code to submit the comments and then the
episode afterwards we're going to worry
about X is showing the comments
underneath here and then after that
we'll actually look into creating a
login system where you need to be logged
in in order to write comments ok so
that's how it's going to be like I hope
you guys enjoyed this episode it's
already pretty long and I hope to see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
