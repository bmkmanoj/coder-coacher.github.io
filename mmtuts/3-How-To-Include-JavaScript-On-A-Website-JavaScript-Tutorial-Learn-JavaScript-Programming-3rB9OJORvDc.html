lesson in JavaScript and in this episode
we're going to talk about the different
places we can put the code inside our
files now when it comes to JavaScript
there are a couple of different places
we can put it and depending on what you
want to use or for or these what the
code is going to do you might want to
consider putting it in different places
so the first place we're going to talk
about is putting the JavaScript inside
our head tags inside our HTML files now
if we do this it means that the
JavaScript code is going to be loaded
first before the rest of the website now
I would usually recommend doing this if
it's crucial that you have JavaScript
code that needs to be run first before
everything else in the website is
actually loaded and the way we can
actually do that is by going inside our
head tags and then we need to start up
the JavaScript by creating a opening tag
and a closing tag and whatever goes in
between those tags is going to be
JavaScript code so the way we do that is
by writing lesser than script and then
we need to close it as well so whatever
goes in between these two tags is going
to be seen as JavaScript now this is
very similar to PHP which some of you
guys may be familiar with where you have
an opening and closing tag now I want to
just mention it that in the past we also
needed to I can actually show you guys
really quickly we needed to put in a
type call text back slash JavaScript
inside our opening script tag and this
is something we had to do in the past
after html5 we don't have to do it
anymore so if in case somebody tells you
that you need to put it in there then
you can let them know you don't have to
anymore okay so when we have these
script tags we can actually start
writing code so if I were to create a
JavaScript function let's just call this
one hi there
I could actually go ahead and do that
and then I could say something like
alerts hi there which will basically
just write out hi there in a small
window in in the website when it loads
or at least when the function is called
upon and now this is one place we can
put the code and like I said when you do
it this way it's going to be loaded
first which can be good in some cases
now if you want to put the JavaScript
inside your body of your website I'm
just going to go and copy this and
delete it
a good rule to follow is that you should
put the JavaScript in the bottom of your
body tags because it gives the website a
chance to load everything else first if
before it loads the JavaScript tags at
least the JavaScript code and the reason
you want to do this is because
JavaScript like I mentioned before is a
way to change behavior of some of the
elements you have on your website so it
makes sense that the elements has to be
loaded first like Dib tags you know text
and that sort of thing it has to be
loaded first before JavaScript can
actually change it at least modify the
behavior of it so so I'm just going to
go and put it down here so you guys can
see this is another place you could put
it and again it's just like before you
just open up the script tag close it and
whatever goes in between is going to be
a JavaScript code and then all the
content would go up here of course now
there's a third way to do this now we
just talked about putting it inside your
HTML files but if you were to actually
put it inside a separate document we
could also do that and that's actually
something I would recommend doing for
orders sake and I'm just going to go and
do it really quickly so you guys can see
it so let's say I have my clean website
here and I want to add the app script
code to it I can actually go ahead and
create a separate file save it as
something we can just go ahead and call
it scripts dot J s which is the
JavaScript extension
and I can put my code in here now do
bear in mind that once we put JavaScript
code inside our JavaScript documents we
don't need to have the script tags
anymore so now we just put the code in
like this now you do need to do another
thing because right now just like in CSS
files you do need to link to this file
in order for your HTML file to actually
find it so the same rule goes here as
before you can either put it inside your
head tag or inside the body tag and it's
the same rule about if it's something
that has to be loaded first like that
it's actually important to be loaded
first then you put inside the head tag
if it's something that has to be loaded
after all the content on the body has
been loaded then you can put it inside
the body tag so if I were to go down to
the body tag here and create another
script tag like so it's actually going
to leak that because we didn't need that
anymore we're just going to go and write
source is equal to double quotes and
then we're going to write the path to
our file so in this case it would
actually be scripts dot J s so now I
actually linking to our scripts of -
document which is created up here so now
it should be loaded in ok so that's
basically how you can do it and that's
basically all we have for this episode
because I just want to focus and talk
about how to actually link to the files
since there's a small explanation behind
ways to put it inside your documents so
I think we got that covered now and in
the next episode
we'll talk about how to actually get
started on your JavaScript code so if
you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys
