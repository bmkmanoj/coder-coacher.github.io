extensions inside Adam so you can
actually get a ready for our course here
so as you can see a do X have Adam open
here on the left side and I do also have
a basic index that HTML page open inside
Adam now this is not something that you
need to have I just want to have it here
to show you what exactly the extensions
do when we install them and actually use
them and I'm also gonna go and show you
how we can actually change the color
scheme inside Adam since I know some of
you might prefer a white background
inside the editor again the reason that
the background is in fact dark is
because it puts less strain on your eyes
when you sit in code for a long time so
I do recommend using a dark background
for when you sit inside the editor but
again it's up to you now in order to
tint to call a theme inside Adam you can
go up into a file go down to settings
and inside settings we have something
called themes on the left side here and
in here you can see we can actually
change the UI theme and the syntax theme
inside the editor so you can just click
the drop-down and then change it to
light if that's what you want to so you
can try and mess around with the colors
in here to see what you want to use
inside the editor also you can also
install themes down if you wish to again
this is another option if you don't like
the default themes inside the editor so
now you know how to change the theme
inside Adam
so let's actually talk about how to
install extensions now the first thing
you should notice when it comes to
installing extensions inside Adam we
need to do so using something called
packages the way we get into these
packages is either by going to file go
down to settings again and then then to
install at the bottom here or if you
want to shortcut and click ctrl shift P
and then right install and then choose
the second one which says install
packages and themes and then we get to
the same place
in here we can go ahead and search for
any kind of extensive you might want to
use inside Adam the first one we're
gonna search for is one called Adam
beautify if I spell that correctly I
think so search and then you can see we
get something called Adam beautify now I
did already install it so you guys
should have this install button on this
extension here so just going to install
it do bear in mind that wants you to
actually install an extension you do
need to restart the text editor in order
for it to work
we're gonna go and do that after we're
done installing the necessary extensions
okay so Adam beautify go ahead and
install it if you want to know a little
bit more about this extension for
example how to use it
then go and click on the name here and
then you guys can see that it opens up
inside the Browse and we can actually go
ahead and see all the different changes
that were made to the extension and so
on and so on and so on if you scroll
down to the bottom you can actually see
we have a guide that says how to
actually use it so if you're ever in
doubt about how you actually use
extensions then go ahead and take it out
inside the website the second theme
we're going to install is something
called Adam live server after it's done
searching you can go and install it it's
the second one down here called Adam -
live - server which is something that
allow for us to update the browser as
soon as we hit save inside Adam so we
don't have to go all the way to the
browser and click the refresh button
each time we need to see the changes
inside the website which is a really
nice feature to have when you start
developing using JavaScript or HTML and
that sort of thing so after installing
these two extensions go ahead and
restart Adam by closing it and then open
it up again like so and then you can
just go ahead and go out from the
settings here now inside my index dot
HTML page I would like to show you what
exactly we did by installing these
extensions so the first thing I want to
do is I would like to apply to beautify
extension to the document here because
right now the code doesn't look that
pretty yet because there's no spacing I
can't really see what's going on in here
so what I would like to do is I would
like to click ctrl shift P and then
search for beautify and as you can see
we do actually get it as the second
pop-up inside the search field now of
course there's also shortcuts you don't
have to go in here each time you want to
make something prettier and the same
thing goes for the next extension we
don't actually have to go in here and
activate the extension using this search
tool so instead I'm gonna go out and
click ctrl alt B and as you can see the
entire document just got beautified
which means that everything actually
looks a lot nicer than it did before so
I'm just gonna go and save it here so we
make sure it actually looks like this
the second extension actually takes care
of the browser here so each time we save
inside the text editor it
updates the browser without me having to
go up and click refresh each time so
right now connects to see that this text
down here inside my JavaScript code
actually goes in and replaces everything
inside the body tag here which means
that instead of the h1 and the paragraph
tag and now says new text inside the
browser so what I would like to do here
is I would like to change it from new
text to something else and in order to
do that without having to refresh the
browser of course we need to actually
activate the extension we just installed
so again I can go into control cfp
search for live server now as you can
see it does accept quite a few options
but the one you're interested in is the
one called stop server and start server
so you can actually see the shortcuts
for these ones so ctrl alt l and ctrl
alt Q so if I were to go out again ctrl
alt L you can now see that it opens up a
new tab inside the browser with the same
website essentially but the difference
here is that this specific tab is going
to update yourself each time I do
actually save inside the text editor so
we can go ahead and close down the
previous one here now if I were to go in
here inside my text editor and change
the text and write something gibberish
save it you can now see it updates
inside the browser by itself we don't
actually have to go up here and click
refresh each time which is a huge
time-saver when you create huge projects
inside your text editor so this is what
I want to show you guys when it comes to
installing extensions and how to
actually use them in the next episode
you're gonna learn how to actually set
up JavaScript inside a document or
inside a website so we can actually
start using it inside the browser so
hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
