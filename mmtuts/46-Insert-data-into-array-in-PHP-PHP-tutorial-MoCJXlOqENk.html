add data inside an array and this is
whether to raise MT over already has
data inside of it we're going to talk
about how to add data to existing arrays
so the first thing we need to do here is
we need to create an array so I'm gonna
go ahead and create a variable called
data I'm gonna set it equal to an array
do you notice that it didn't put any
kind of data inside the array because
right now what we have here is an empty
array so there's no data inside of it
now we're gonna use three different
methods in order to insert data into
this array and all these methods are
gonna work
whether you have an empty array when a
Raider already has data inside of it
it's basically just gonna add data
behind the array so if you have data
it's gonna be the last data goes behind
there so the first method we're going to
use is we're gonna go and go down to
next line we're gonna reference to our
variable data by writing variable data
and we're gonna add brackets behind it
instead of equal to some kind of data so
right now we can for example say we have
a string called Daniel that needs to be
inserted into this array and then
because we already created there rain
that's up here and then added the data
underneath here now if I were to echo
this out inside the browser of course
the echo variable data brackets and we
want to reference to the first data
because right now because there was no
data inside the array
Daniel is gonna be the first data which
is equal to 0 if I were to go back to
the browser so you guys can see it says
Daniel now in order to see everything
we're doing in here let's actually go
ahead and not echo out just the first
data let's go ahead and write something
called print underscore our parentheses
and then insert our variable data inside
of it because right now it's actually
gonna write out every single data inside
disarray up here so if I were to go back
to the website you guys can see we have
array and then we have the first value
which is equal to Daniel now if we're
gonna need Daniel and then copy paste it
one more time add another piece of data
which could be 15 in this example just a
number go back to the browser refresh
you guys can see we get a second piece
of data
so by adding these underneath your array
you're just gonna go ahead and add data
to it now this is the first method we
can use and this is not one that I
usually use because it's it takes a bit
more code to write it this way now if I
were to go back to my code and delete
these two data go back to my browser
refresh it you guys can see we now lose
the data so we need to make sure we
already have the data inside the code
otherwise it's gonna loose it again now
the second way we can add the data to
this array is by going in and using a
PHP function called array push so array
underscore post parenthesis now the
thing about array push is that we need
to tell it which the raid we want to
push data inside so we have one up here
called variable data so I'm gonna put
that in as my first parameter then I'm
gonna add a comment and then I need to
tell it which data I need to insert so
right now could also add Daniel save it
go back to my browser refresh and you
guys can see we now get Daniel again if
I want to add more data I can go ahead
and copy this paste it underneath here
and again I can add for example a string
like 15 and now we have a second piece
of data now if this is too much code to
write because this is more code to write
than the previous method what we can do
is we can just go ahead and use this
array push and then keep adding data
behind the existing data we have in here
so if we were to say after Daniel comma
15 comma 23 for example save it refresh
the browser you guys can see we can also
do it this way which is kind of nice so
by using a rate push we can avoid having
to write more code then by using the one
we just add the bracket and set it equal
to something so this is how we can
insert data inside an array now just to
show you guys if we were to go up inside
my variable data equal to an empty array
and insert some kind of data inside of
here let's call this one first then I
might want to add another piece of data
called second and now go ahead and
refresh the browser you'll notice that
we have first second
Daniel 15 and 23 like so because we just
add the data behind the existing array
so this is how you can add data inside
arrays and this is something that's
quite useful for you to know if you want
to do something more complicated in PHP
like opticore into PHP or something so
hope you guys find us useful and I'll
see you guys next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
