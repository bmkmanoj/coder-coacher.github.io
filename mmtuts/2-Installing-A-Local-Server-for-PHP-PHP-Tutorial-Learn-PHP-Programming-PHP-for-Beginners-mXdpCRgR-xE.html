about installing a local server on the
computer and this is something neat to
have when we do want to write PHP code
because like I said in the last episode
PHP is a server-side language meaning if
you don't have a server running it won't
actually work inside the browser now
installing a server on your computer is
quite easy to do and it's really quick
to do it's free and you don't need to
worry about it harming your computer in
any kind of way so what we're going to
do is first of all we need to download a
software called xampp now there's quite
a few programs out there you can use to
install the server I like using the one
called xampp and I know a lot of other
people do like it and it's available for
both windows linux and mac so for this
episode i'm going to focus on examp so
we're going to open up our browser we're
going to go to google and you're going
to search for XMPP and the first link
would probably be the one going to app
at different org so we're going to go
and click it and in here you can see we
can download for Windows Linux and Mac
so once you download it and install it
do notice where you install it because
you're going to have to remember that
for later but once you do have it
installed you can actually go to your
you know C Drive or T Drive wherever you
did actually install it and find a
folder called xampp so once you have XM
found I want you to go into it and
notice we do actually have xampp control
Exe if I click it and run it you can see
we get this little window here running
now this is what you can use to actually
run your server and you do actually have
an install right now once you do install
the program called xampp
you will have the server installed on
your computer so in all tax to get the
server running we're going to have to
activate apache and mysql so i'm going
to go ahead and click start on both of
these and now this should be running so
if we go to our browser again go to the
URL and you type localhost backs last
PHP my admin' is it actually actually
take it to the we call it your localhost
where you can see all the different
databases we have installed on our
server
so in my case I do X have a couple of
them and this is actually a fairly clean
new installation of xampp so I don't
have a lot of databases right now but we
can actually go ahead and click on
databases up here in the top left corner
and create a database so we can actually
even just write something create and I
do actually apologize - and aeneas the
button suit should be the same places
just in English of course but as you can
see that it actually just install a
database or set up a database called s
ad ad which was just Dipper as I wrote
in here now databases we use inside PHP
to store data for example when you
create maybe a login system in order to
have a login system you also need to add
users and when users sign up they need
to be saved somewhere so we can actually
you know go in and check if the username
and password matches each other and that
sort of thing
so we need to have a database where we
can save all kinds of information and
this is actually what we have running
right here now in order to just write
PHP code you don't need to do anything
inside PHP myadmin
all you need to do to get PHP code
running or like working is to open up
exempt the control panel here and start
these two buttons once you have these
two started your PHP code is going to
work so we won't actually have to touch
PSP my admin before we actually need to
use databases which is not right now so
once we have these running what you need
to do is you need to go back into Weig
installed xampp and inside the xampp
folder you're going to look for the
folder called htdocs you're going to
open it up and in here you can see I
have a couple of folders and this is
actually my folders I created these
you're most likely going to have some
random gibberish in here like some some
random files which XM installs as a
default when you do X installer for the
first time now what I want you to do is
highlight all the files you have in here
and delete them once you deleted all of
them I want you to right-click and
create a new folder now this new folder
is going to be the root folder for your
website
meaning that this is where we're going
to save all the files for our website so
I'm going to go and create a folder here
called PHP
lessons which is going to be my folder
you guys can call whatever you want so
I'm going to go ahead and create PHP
lessons and go in here so now we can
actually start saving all kinds of PHP
code I do actually want to show you guys
a little example of why we need to
install the local server if I were to go
and open up a new document this is a
completely clean document I did not save
it or do anything to this one yet if I
start out writing PHP code which by the
way is inside PHP tags like this we'll
talk about that in the next couple
episodes and if I were to echo out
something which basically means that I
want to write something on the screen
I'm going to write echo I'm gonna write
hi there or heal there I'm gonna save
this one inside the folder we just
created so I'm going to go inside my
htdocs folder now just a little tip for
you guys I did actually save my htdocs
folder inside here inside my Explorer
tab it's quite you're going to be using
quite often if you do a lot of web
development so I recommend you guys save
it over here in the side as well so if I
go ahead and save this file I just
created inside my PHP license root
folder I say
index dot PHP because we do have the PHP
extension save it you guys will notice
when I do actually go into my browser go
up into my URL and type localhost
backslash and then the name of the
folder we just created so in my case it
was PHP lessons you'll notice that I get
some text writing now if I were to
actually turn off my control panel and
stop these servers and refresh my
browser I'll just wait for to load you
guys will see we have no web page
available and this is why we need to
have the server running because right
now we can't actually get a running if I
were to actually take this document and
just run it inside my browser by
right-click on a right clicking on it
and opening with my Google Chrome
actually it doesn't use it as a default
here okay so did actually need to go
find my Google Chrome for some reason
but I do have it here now and you guys
would like to notice when I do open it
inside Google Chrome just by
right-clicking on the file
we get the PHP code right here so it
doesn't actually write out hi oh they're
like just hi oh there you can access the
entire code here and that's because we
don't have a server running so we do
actually need to go start the servers
and open it inside our htdocs folder
because that's connected to our server
and you guys will see we have the text
there so you need to have a server
running every time you do PHP code
meaning that if you have a website that
has PHP code in it you're going to have
to use it inside the localhost now you
might be asking well what about when we
get it online once you do get your
website online I'll show you guys how to
get a server at least the database
running on your server because you will
have the server automatically when you
upload to an online hosting company so
absolutely guys how to setup a database
at some point inside a hosting company
if you want to so right now you guys can
see I did actually write out hi-oh
there and it's working so that's
basically all we need it I do want to
show you guys one last thing which is if
I don't write localhost or don't write
anything behind localhost you guys can
see we get to this place here what we
can see all the different folders we
have inside our htdocs folder as you
guys will see if I go back into my
htdocs these are the same folders as I
have in here so if you don't want to
write anything behind localhost you can
actually just go in here and click PHP
lessons and there's opens up again so
this is how we install a local server
and this is all we need to actually get
started on PHP so I hope you guys
enjoyed this episode and I will see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
