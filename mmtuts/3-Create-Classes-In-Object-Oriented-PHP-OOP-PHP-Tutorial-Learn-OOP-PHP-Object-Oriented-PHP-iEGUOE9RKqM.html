coding something inside up to grow into
PSP programming so as you guys can see
right in front of me here I have a very
basic index page with basic html5 code
and we talked about in one of the
previous episodes that when we do
actually do opt to go into programming
we don't code the code directly where we
need to use it that's what we call
procedural programming which is one
we've done in one of the previous
lessons or previous courses I did on PSP
in these series we're going to do off
the grounds of programming meaning that
I'm actually going to go ahead and open
up a new document where all the code
containing you know the optical entered
code is going to be saved inside of so
after opening up a new document I'm
going to go and save it inside a root
folder I'm actually going to go to
include a separate folder for my object
and set files so I'm going to say new
folder I'm going to call this one
includes and you guys can call whatever
you want you could also just save it
inside the main part of your root folder
I'm going to go and put it inside and
includes folder so inside this folder
I'm going to go ahead and save the file
as new class dot Inc dot PHP now again
you guys could just call it new class
dot PHP dot Inc does nothing other than
just the name of the file I like to put
Inc inside my files because it's inside
an includes folder so don't get confused
about me putting ink inside max your
file name so now that I created the name
I'm going to go ahead and save the file
like so and now we have a completely
separate file just for the opticore into
code so I'm going to go ahead and open
up my PSP code inside this file here I'm
going to go ahead and just go down a few
lines and now we can actually go ahead
and get started creating these classes
that we need to use inside opticore into
programming now when it comes to a class
it's basically a big object that
contains a lot of different information
such as variables and functions
regarding one thing for example we could
have a class called user which has old
information regarding the users such as
the variables and the functions that
might be related to users now when it
comes to off they go into programming we
don't call these variables and functions
anymore we actually call it something
called properties and methods now
they're not entirely the same as bare
and functions but they're very similar
so I'm just going to go out and say
they're very similar to these variables
and functions even though they're called
properties and methods so inside this
document the first thing we're going to
do is we're going to go ahead and create
a new class so I'm going to go ahead and
say we have a class which is just
written like so pretty simple now we
want to name the class a typical thing
to do for programmers when it comes to
class names is to start with a big
letter so in this case just because
that's the name it's something I'm just
going to go and call this one new class
you guys could call it whatever you want
I'm just going to give it this name
after we give it a class name we're
going to go ahead and open up the curly
brackets now inside the curly brackets
is where we're going to put all these
properties and methods that are related
to the class so I'm just going to go and
create a comment here that says
properties and methods goes here so now
we have a class that actually has a name
and we have a place you can actually put
the properties and methods the next
thing we need to do is talk about how we
actually access stuff inside the class
because this class is going to have a
lot of information but if we can
actually get the information and show
them inside the website then it becomes
pretty much useless if we can actually
get information so what I'm going to go
and do here is I'm going to go ahead and
go underneath the class which is down
here and I'm going to go and do
something we call instantiate a class
which basically means though creating
some kind of object that contains all
the information regarding the class the
way we do that is by creating some kind
of variable I'm just going to say I'm
just going to go and call this one
object because this is what we call an
object when we do actually instantiate a
class I'm going to set it equal to new
space and then the name of the class we
have up here called new class so I'm
just going to copy it paste it down here
and close it off so now we instantiated
the class by creating an object and now
we can actually get access to all the
properties and methods we have inside
the class when we do actually call on
this object here now just to show you
guys what exactly is inside this class
what we can do is after you instantiate
at this class by creating an object is
we can actually go ahead and go
underneath our object and print out
everything we have inside
class just so we can actually see what's
in here so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go and use a function called
back on the score dump parentheses
semi-colon and I'm going to put the
object inside the actual parentheses so
now that we have this we should get all
the information from the class if I go
back to the website right now I'm inside
the index page which we haven't really
started yet
so I'm going to go and go up into my url
go in some include folder and then go
into new class dot Inc dot PHP and let's
actually make sure we spell that
correctly like so and as you guys can
see we now have a object called new
class and right now we have nothing
inside the actual object so this is how
it looks like when it's completely empty
I'm just going to zoom in for you guys
you can actually see this is how it
looks like when it's completely empty so
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to go inside my class and just to show
you guys an example I'm going to go
ahead and create a property now I'm
going to go ahead and do something that
we haven't talked about yet which is I'm
going to declare a public property again
if we can actually spell that correctly
so I'm going to say pop lick I'm going
to give it a name by creating a variable
I'm going to say info I'm going to set
it equal to a string called this is some
info like so so if I go back inside the
browser you guys will notice that now we
do actually see that we have some
information inside this class so this is
how we can actually get started creating
classes does it have a can put stuff
inside the class in the next episode
we're going to talk about what exactly
this public means and talk about some of
the other things we can put in front of
our properties methods when it comes to
public private and protect it I hope you
guys enjoyed I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
