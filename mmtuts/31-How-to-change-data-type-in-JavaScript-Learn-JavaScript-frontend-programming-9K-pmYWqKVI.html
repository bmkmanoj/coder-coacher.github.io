something called type conversion inside
javascript and basically what type
conversion is is when we take some kind
of data type and converted into another
data type so if I were to take some of
these data that I have inside my script
here I have a string I have a number one
integer I have a boolean a function and
have an object now if I were to take
some of these and convert them into
something else again we can actually
convert all of these into other types of
data for example I can take an object
and convert it into a integer so we do
need to make sure that when we do
actually convert data to another data
type that we can actually do it so to
give you guys an example we do actually
have an operator inside JavaScript that
writes out inside the browser what kind
of data we have inside our code so if we
were to go down inside my inner HTML
function down here we simply spits out
whatever tag right before the semicolon
here inside the paragraph tag inside my
website if we were to go back inside and
refresh you guys consider right now we
have nothing so if I were to go back
inside behind the semicolon and say I
want to spit out variable number you
guys consider right now we get 10 if I
were to instead say well I want to get
the type of data we have inside this
variable I can write type of space save
it
refresh the browser and now you guys can
see we get number because right now 10
is a number type if I were to take
variable string instead and replace it
with number now you guys can see we get
string so what we can do in order to
convert numbers a piece of data is we
can go ahead and use a function called
number string or boolean so these are
the three different data types you can
convert to so if we were to go inside
variable number let's actually go and
change suspect to number like so refresh
the browser and now go back inside
variable number and use the string
function so I'm gonna go and say string
parenthesis I'm gonna take 10 and place
it inside the parenthesis now if I go
back inside the browser because number
is equal to the string
function with tenants out of it now I
should get string so right now you guys
can see that this tenon here is no
longer a number data type it has become
a string just like the one we have a bug
here now Joseph's story gots a couple
examples when it comes to the type of
let's go ahead and use this function
here instead so we were to take this
function write it behind instead of
number you guys can see it also says we
have a function if I were to take this
object down here called person put it
inside and set a function you guys can
see we get objects so as you guys can
see we can actually check what kind of
data type we have inside our code using
the type of whether it being an object a
function or primitive values such as a
string or number I hope you guys enjoyed
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
