talk about how to input new fonts to the
website so if we were to take my
navigation here and say okay I want to
add a really fancy font to it what I can
do is I can go into my stylesheet go
down to the navigation and add a styling
called font - family and then and then I
consider - some kind of font now in the
last episode when we created the
navigation we set it to Arial an Arial
is actually a font that we do have
installed in our computer as a preset I
think all computers do have this font
but there's some fonts that computers
don't have and if I want to use them the
way to do it if you want to see the font
is to go online download the fonts
installed on your computer and then you
can use it inside the website now doing
it this way allows for you to see the
font but other people who wants to see
the website online can't see the font so
the way we would need to do it for other
people to see it as well
would be to either link to the font
somewhere online or we can include the
font inside our root folder so what
we're going to do here is we're going to
go ahead and I'm going to show you guys
both ways to do it and we're going to
start out with downloading a font
meaning that you need to find somewhere
online where you can actually download
fonts now I found a website here called
dafont.com which is a really good
website for downloading free fonts that
you don't have to pay for and this is a
well there's a lot of different fonts in
here so I guess we're just going to
choose one and I'm going to go ahead and
choose one inside the cartoon style I
guess we can choose this one called
sketch match which is a really
distinctive font so we can see that it
does actually work so I'm going to go
ahead and download this one now that I
have it downloaded you should get a zip
folder and as you guys can see I have it
inside my download folder here if I go
ahead and right click on it and extract
it you'll see if we get a couple of
different files and depending on the
font you might get more than one file or
not but the one we're looking for is the
one called the name of the fonts and
then dot T TF o dot o TF depending on
which style it is you're getting so if
if you see a dot T TF or a dot dot o TF
didn't need to double click it and then
you can actually then you can actually
install it
so now I have installed it I can close
down this little window here and then
I'm going to go ahead and copy the font
the dot TTFN font and then I'm going to
go into my root folder and then I'm
going to create a folder called fonts
because you do need to include inside
the root folder so might as well have a
directory for it so I'm going to say
fonts then I'm going to go into the
folder and paste it in here now I'm just
going to go ahead and rename it because
skits with the space and stuff like big
letters I don't really like using fonts
that have that so I'm just going to go
ahead and eliminate all spaces inside
here create a small M for match and a
small s for sketch just because that's
how I do it you don't have to do it but
that's how I do it
so now that we have this I'm going to go
ahead and just copy the name of the font
so I have it I'm going to go into my
stylesheet and then we're going to go
ahead and include the font into our
website so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go at the very top of our code
and then I'm going to start adding some
code which will actually go in and look
for the font and give it a name so we
can actually reference to it inside our
stylesheet so the first thing we need to
do is we need to write at as the symbol
use in email addresses and that kind of
thing at font - face space then you're
going to open up the code and then we
can go ahead and write two different
things first of all we need to include
the name of the font and then we need to
include this the source for the font so
where we need to go to actually see the
font inside our root folder so we're
going to say font - family we're going
to set it - it was called my match I
think what was it let's just see what
it's called it is called sketch match so
I'm just going to go and call it s m4
escapes match close it go down to the
next line say SRC for source colon then
we're going to write URL inside of here
parentheses and then we're going to
write the path to our font now we do
also need to include single brackets on
that single bracket single quotes and
then in here we're going to go ahead and
say okay from our style sheet which is
inside a folder we need to go back once
to go to the main part of our route for
folder so I'm going to say dot dot
backslash so now we're going back up
folder from our main part of our root
folder we need to go inside a folder
called fonts backslash once we're in
there we have a font called sketch match
dot t TF I'm going to go ahead and save
it so now we can actually reference to
this font using the font family called
SM so I'm going to go and go down to my
navigation here and I'm just going to go
ahead and call it instead of Arial s/m
save it then we're going to go ed and
try and refresh our website and as you
guys can see it changed to this font
division Scott so if i zoom in for you
guys you can actually see we have a new
style of font now of course we did
actually install the font or even if you
didn't install the font we can still see
it because it's inside our root folder
and being referenced to so what we can
do now is I'm going to go and show you
guys a way to link to a font instead of
including into your root folder which is
what I usually prefer to do because it's
just much easier the only downside to
this is if you don't have internet
access then you won't actually be able
to see that font that you're linking to
meaning if you're working on the train
or the bus or something and you are
sitting on your laptop and you're
working on the website you won't be able
to see the font unless you have internet
access so what we're going to do here is
I'm going to go ahead and go to Google
and I'm going to search for something
called lapto which is a font we don't
have installed in our computer as a
default and as you guys can see the
first pop-up like the first link we get
is google fonts lat o if you see google
fonts it's usually a pretty good place
to go so we're going to go into google
fonts called Leto and then you'll get to
this site where you see the different
examples of the font now this is a
really good font for flat design when
you make flat design either graphic art
or websites or that kind of thing so I
like to use this one a lot so if I want
to actually use this font I need to
continue up here in the corner where it
says open lettering Google Fonts so I'm
going to go and click that and then
you'll get to this part where you can
check on what kind of fonts within the
LAT tool font you want to include if I
want a thin style of it if I want a thin
italic style if I want a light style a
light italic I'm just going to go and
click all of them off because you want
to include all of them
after we've done this you can either go
up in the corner where it has a download
link it's an arrow and you can actually
download the zip folder and then you can
actually include it like we did last
time by just including it including it
inside the root folder now that's not
what we're going to do though we're
going to go ahead go ahead and link to
it like going down to where it says add
this code to your website okay so we're
just going to go ahead and copy this
line go into our website go to the index
dot HTML then we're going to go to the
head part of our website like the head
not the header but the head and on top
of our style sheet because need to have
this file available to us before the
stylesheet since we're using the fonts
inside the stylesheet so before the link
to the stylesheet we're going to add
this line now if i zoom out you guys can
actually see we have this one big line
which is actually really long and this
is where then so it's it's dis big and
what you'll notice is if I go in zoom in
for you guys over here where it says
family equal to lapto colon and then it
says 400 100 100 italic 300 300 italic
now if I were to go into my stylesheet
and I want to refer to this font need to
refer to the one that it's set equal to
so that means lapto with with a big L
because that's how I wrote it now the
font weight of it like you know at the
thickness of the font will be determined
on the number that I set the font weight
to inside my stylesheet and we'll get to
that so if we go into the style sheet
here I'm just going to zoom in down here
which says font family I'm going to go
ahead and write lat so with the big L
underneath here I'm going to say font -
wait an inside here we can write either
100 300 400 700 or 900 depending on how
thick we want it and we can also add
italic or bold or whatever well not bold
in this case so in this one we're just
going to go ahead and say 300 without
anything behind it just 300 save it
we're going to go to the website that we
made and as you guys can see when I
change the to lat oh now this font that
we use right here is pretty thin so you
might actually use 400 instead
we're just going to head and write for
save it go to our browser and it's a bit
thick enough so now we have something
that looks quite good and I think we're
going to use lapto from this point on
inside the web site and I know that it's
not a good design choice to use the same
font over and over and over again
usually want two or three different
choices but we're just going to use this
one for now this is essentially how you
include a font inside a website so we're
just going to go and end it here I hope
you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
