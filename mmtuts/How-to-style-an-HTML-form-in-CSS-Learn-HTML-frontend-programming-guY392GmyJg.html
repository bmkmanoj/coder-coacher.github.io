about how to style the form we created
in the last episode and as you guys can
see you actually already have my form
right here inside my index.html and the
reason I want to talk about styling a
form for an entire episode is because
styling forms can be a little bit tricky
in the beginning and it's not entirely
the same as styling dip boxes and text
so we're just gonna go ahead and take
this one from I guess we're gonna start
from the top of the form and just kind
of work our way down to the bottom and
style each individual input and text
area and button and that kind of thing
so we're gonna talk about how to change
the size is how to alter the text we do
already have the placeholder inside our
text areas and inputs and it might be a
little bit difficult figuring out how to
style the text that you actually see
inside the input if you take a look at
it here we do have a grayed out first
name and last name inside these boxes
and since they're not really text you
might have trouble figuring out how to
style them we're also going to talk
about how to eliminate the resizing
feature of the text area which is
something that you see in some websites
but it's just not something that you
want to do you know all the time so
going into our code we're gonna go ahead
and say well we're going to go ahead and
talk about how we're gonna target each
element in here because we have a couple
of different options either we can give
each input a class and then go ahead and
target the class inside the style sheet
or we can go ahead and just kind of
target the div class we have around our
form call form - box and say inside this
div we have a form and we have an input
and I think that's the best way to do it
in this episode you could also just
target the form but since we might have
more than one form on our website
we would be styling every single form on
our website so that wouldn't be a good
idea for this example so what we're
gonna do here is we're gonna go into our
style sheet and right on top of our
footer underneath our form - box we're
just gonna go ahead and copy our form -
box styling and paste it below now we're
gonna go ahead and change the path so it
says form - box space form space input
so now we're targeting every single
input inside this specific form so we
could give it a width and since we
already have the width down here we
might as well just change it and I think
we should make it into 40
percent because I don't think it's nice
to have a first and last name input
field going all the way across the
screen because that would be too much so
for the present is plenty I think we
also need to give it a height and we're
gonna go and do that below here we're
gonna set it to 30 pixels just because
that's what I feel like setting it to
you guys can do whatever you want I'm
just gonna go and delete these last two
stylings we copied down from the form -
box because I want to show you guys how
it looks like right now so if we save it
you refresh the browser you guys from
noticed if we do actually get 40% for
each of these and that's actually quite
a lot if you take a look at it right
here if i zoom out to 100% you guys will
see it's actually not that bad so what
we can do here is we can actually go
back into our index file and you guys
may remember we did actually not include
a break in between the inputs so let's
go ahead and copy the break tag we have
underneath the last input of you know
the last name and paste it in between
these two like so if you refresh the
browser
you got some notice that we get first
name and last name below each other so
after doing this going into our style
sheet let's go ahead and give it a
margin from the bottom because it wanted
a little bit of spacing between these
two inputs so let's say margin bottom
set it to 4 pixels just because I don't
think it looks nice if we have too much
of a spacing save it and refresh and you
guys will see when i zoom in that we do
have a bit of spacing between them now
here's the thing when we include a width
and a height and that kind of thing you
may notice that both the placeholder and
if you type text it's actually pretty
close to the left side of our text box
so we need to include some spacing to
the left side of this box and the way we
do that is with the padding so if we go
inside our input styling again and we go
down to the next line and we say padding
left now we should probably do it left
and right in case I don't know how long
I last and the first name can be but if
they do actually have a name that goes
all the way to the other side we should
probably also have a padding to the
right side as well so let's go ahead and
delete our padding left
just right patting neck so now we're
going to go ahead and save from the top
and bottom we do want fewer pixels
because I don't see a reason to add a
padding to top and bottom and from left
and right we're gonna go ahead and say
what should we say six pixels and save
it or we could say one percent that
would actually be well let's say half a
percent instead of six pixels so 0.5%
save it and refresh and you guys will
notice we do have a bit of spacing like
so so that's essentially how we style an
input now you guys may notice we do
already have a default border going
around the text box right now
it actually looks quite fine I think for
a white background but if you want to
change the color we can actually go in
and add a border to our input phone and
we're just gonna do that by writing
border colon not semi colon colon and
then we're gonna give it a thickness
which is in this case one pixel space we
can say should it be a dotted line so to
be a solid line let's go to make it
solid for now space and then we need to
give it a color and you can either just
type red orange or give it a color code
I'm just gonna go ahead and say orange
save it refresh the browser and you guys
from notice we have a different type of
border going around our input so if I go
ahead and the lead to orange because I
don't think dorrance is nice I'm just
gonna go ahead and write CCC and the has
tack in front of it of course which is
the color code for a very light gray
which is roughly the same gray as we had
before so now we have this can actually
go ahead and continue so going down to
these down here you guys may notice that
well the dot content size and it kind of
moved over a little bit and the reason
for that is because right now our width
well the dot here is always going to be
centered inside our input and you guys
may notice that we styled every single
input inside this form meaning that
these dots are actually gonna be 40% all
the way to the side and then the dot
will be centered which is in the middle
of course
and because of the height we set as 30
pixels the dot will actually increase in
size to be 30 pixels high and wide so
the way we change DS is we do actually
need to specify these specifically so
what we're gonna go ahead and do is
we've got just gonna go and give these
to a class so down what we have the
radio type inputs we're gonna say class
equal to quotation marks and then let's
just go ahead and say form
- radio and then we're just gonna go
ahead and copy this class paste it to
the one below it since they're
essentially the same save it and then we
can actually take this form that's radio
styling or add these class and put it
inside our style sheet below here come
say class paste in form that's radio and
open up the code so from here we can
actually go ahead and say well we don't
want the width to be 40% let's go ahead
and make the width what we can actually
go ahead and just copy all this down
there we go and we're just gonna go
ahead and say with AZ what should we say
1% I have no idea how much that is but
we can check it out once we do actually
refresh the browser and the height
should probably be something more like
10 percent 10 pixels save it and I do
not think we need anything else user
let's just go ahead and see how it looks
like okay that actually change anything
so let's go ahead and add a like delete
or padding here oh I do actually know
why the reason it didn't change is
because it's still looking at this
styling up here which means that we need
to overwrite whatever styling we put it
put on it up here and this is a very
good chance to show you guys how to do a
CSS hack and it's not really hacking
like you see it in movies but it's a CSS
hack we essentially go in and say that
it needs to ignore any other kind of
styling added to this specific element
and add this piece of code instead now
the way you do that is by for example
the width right now still at 40% inside
our website here even though it said to
1% so inside the width styling after the
1% before the semicolon we need to add
it's good exclamation mark I think
that's what it's called and then write
important in portents like so now what
this important does is say okay this is
a very important piece of code you
should ignore any other kind of styling
that might interfere with this piece of
code so now that we have dis we save it
refresh our browser you guys won't
notice that our styling does actually
work so now we start these boxes again
so they look a little bit more normal
and they're not centered over here
they're not very big now if you want to
style the text all you need to do is add
well right now if we take a look at the
index file you guys will see that we
don't actually have any texts like
paragraph tags around our text up here
which is male and female and if you want
to style this you just need to add the P
tag so it's actually go ahead and do it
just for the heck of it so I made a
couple of P tags I opened and closed it
after the text then I'm just going to go
ahead and copy it up on top of here so
we have it on both of them and now we
can just target the P tags inside out
form so if we go up and copy our form up
here paste it below and say instead of
targeting the input we're gonna target
the P inside the form so now I'm gonna
just go ahead and give it some different
stylings for example give it a font size
as let's say 16 pixels let's go ahead
and give it a color as I don't know well
let's not make any fancy colors let's
just make it a very dark grey which
would be to a to a to 8 of course we
need to add a hashtag in front of it
otherwise it's not a color code and we
can just go ahead and give it a font
family so we have a font - family called
Plateau because I think we did already
add that one this series so I'm just
going to go ahead and save this and
refresh my browser and as you guys will
see we do actually get some styling now
you'll notice that the text did actually
hop down to the next line that is
because we're do I need to tell it to
float:left otherwise like we talked
about with the floating if you don't
float to elements they won't go next to
each other so we need to float left save
it and then up here inside
formed as radio we also need to float it
otherwise it won't float next to each
other and we save it now it actually
opened the wrong browser there but if we
refresh you got remotes to help next to
each other
you'll also notice now that our text is
not entirely in the middle of the dots
and our input is actually floating next
to our other input here now it's kind of
tiny little let me try and zoom in so
you guys can see it yeah so we do have
an input here and then we have the text
coming and then we have another input
and then the text area is actually
floating as well so we need to actually
tell it to stop somewhere so the way we
clear our floats is by writing
clear:both which means were clearing
both of the floating elements so inside
our form that's radio since we wanted to
stop floating when the next input starts
at least the radio input in the
beginning of our code inside form -
radio we're gonna write clear both save
it and as you guys will notice it jumps
down to the next line now you guys will
also notice that our text area is also
floating to the left about female text
and that's because sometimes elements
coming after certain floating elements
if they're inside the same what should I
call it level or like layer of code they
will go next to each other if they're
all child ments that our sisters and
brothers then they will go next to each
other when you float so would you
actually need to tell the text area to
stop floating but for now let's go ahead
and try and move the text down a little
bit so inside our form P styling let's
say padding top and then set it to what
you say 20 pixels that might be way too
much let's go ahead and take a look that
was actually way too much so let's go
ahead and say ten pixels instead this a
little tough for me when I'm zoomed in
on the browser right now I'm Way assumed
in my like I'm at four hundred percent
zoomed in for you guys so it's a little
tough for me to calculate how much we
need to increase in decrease sizes so
this is how we move to text and this is
how we stop so now let's go ahead and
style the text area and remove this
weird-looking resize thing
so going into our code inside our
stylesheet let's go ahead and copy our
let's say let's copy the input that we
created and put it below our form P and
instead of form input we're gonna start
styling the form form space text area
like so now the width we're going to
keep at 40 pixels I guess well let's
let's make a bigger let's make it 60
pixels 60% and the height let's go ahead
and make that one 300 pixels might be
too much I don't know let's go ahead and
just try something out and the Madame de
Martin bottom we're gonna keep it 4
pixels we're also gonna keep the padding
because as well as to form
I do believe once we start typing will
actually will actually need to increase
some spacing on the left side as well
like we did on the inputs so let's keep
that for now the border we want to keep
the same color as the input so we're
gonna keep that there as well if I save
it now refresh my browser oh we did
actually forget one thing we needed to
clear both as well here save it now we
can refresh our browser and we did
actually not get it to jump down and why
did we not do that okay so the
clear:both doesn't work so what we're
going to do instead is we're gonna go
ahead and go into our index file we're
gonna go ahead and take the break that
we have in between the radio input and
the text area we're going to add three
more two apps of spacing so after we've
done that you refresh you guys will see
that it does actually jump down to the
next line so what we can do now is you
guys may notice if I start writing
something inside my form you can see
that we don't quite get the same spacing
let me go ahead and zoom in for you guys
we don't get quite the same spacing from
the top of the letters to the border of
the text box as we do up in the input up
here so in order to add that spacing
we're gonna have to go inside our text
area styling and then movie set padding
instead of just adding a padding to left
and right we need to add one from the
top and bottom as well so we're going to
add six pixels of spacing from top
autum oh six pixels of padding refresh
our browser and you guys will notice we
now have roughly the same spacing now
you might also notice that inside our
text area the fonts are not looking
entirely the same and we need to style
them in order to have the same font so
going into our code again inside the
text area of course we're gonna go ahead
and save font actually let's just go
ahead and copy the the paragraph up here
so let's go ahead and save font size we
want that one we want the color want the
font family so let's just go ahead and
copy that one and paste it below here
inside the text area let's do that as
well for the input up here at the top
the one called input so we have that me
inside the input fields as well I'm
gonna go ahead and save it and refresh
now if I type something you guys will
notice that we have the same font so now
that we have des we can actually talk
about getting rid of this weird resizing
thing we have going on here now you guys
will actually notice that because I set
a certain width and a height we can't
get it smaller than that
hiding width but we can still get a
bigger so what we need to do is we need
to eliminate this little icon down here
in the corner that lets us resize it so
inside the styling inside the text area
we're gonna go ahead and say resize
colon and set it to none save it refresh
the browser and you guys to notice that
we do get rid of it we can't actually
resize it okay so did access skip ahead
a bit here because I wanted to show you
guys that you can also resize the text
area either vertically only or
horizontally only because you see it on
an example like Facebook they do
actually have some text areas that you
can write in such as your newsfeed
inside your user page you can actually
resize it horizontally no sorry
vertically up and down but he can't do
it horizontally so what if you want to
do that well inside resize we can either
say none for you know eliminate
eliminating the resize feature we can
also say both meaning that we can resize
both directions like it is as a default
we can also say vertical
save it refresh the browser and you guys
will notice that I cannot resize it to
the side but I can do it up and down and
then if I want to resize it or Santilli
you right whore re son toe like so
resize I'll refresh the browser and you
guys will notice that we can do it
horizontally but not up and down so
that's another way you can do this if
you want to so I'm just gonna go ahead
and go back here to none since that's
what we want to begin with and let's
talk about customizing the submit button
down here so inside our text area below
our text area we do actually want to add
another styling so let's go and just go
up and copy our form input I guess it's
nice actually let's take the form box
because we can actually use that one
we're gonna paste it below here and
we're gonna say after form - box we're
gonna say well we do have a button
inside of here save it and we're gonna
go and set the button as something else
let's go out and set it in pixels
instead let's say 60 actually notice
let's say 80 pixels let's give it a
height that's the same as the input
since it would match up so we're gonna
set it to 30 pixels then we're gonna
eliminate the padding we don't need it
we're gonna go ahead and say background
color we're gonna set it to blue I guess
so we have something actually let's say
orange because we do have an orange
theme going on on our website right now
so let's go ahead and make the
background call horns now if i refresh
it and you guys will notice we do get
some color going on and all that good
stuff but we still have a border around
a button we do also have a black text
inside of here which might not look very
nice
so let's go and style that as well so
we're gonna go ahead and go up and copy
the border
code from our text area we're gonna
paste it inside our button code and then
we're gonna go ahead and say border
delete everything in here and say none
so now we'll have no border when i
refresh it like so just gonna zoom in
for you guys now what we can do is we
need to style the text
and inside our button here we're gonna
go ahead and say well we can just copy
what we have up here we can say the
color the font size and the font family
and just paste it below here now instead
of having it black I would like to have
it white text so if I save it now
refresh you guys will notice we get a
white text now sometimes and this is
just a little trick for you guys
sometimes when you do write something
like this and you say well it might look
nice if we make everything uppercase so
that all the letters are big letters and
not the the uncapitalized ones and if
you want to do that without having to go
inside your HTML code but do it directly
using CSS code what you can do is you
can go inside your just you're coding
inside your CSS and say text - transform
uppercase and save it so now you guys
notice it's uppercase
so now we do actually have a form that
looks somewhat nice and I would like to
show you guys what we can do with it you
know we do actually submit something
because I did tell you guys last episode
that I did actually need to set up a
server now setting up a server if you
want to do something well let let me go
ahead and mention this because this is
actually pretty important to know when I
started learning about you know creating
forms from stuff in HTML like way back
when I was only learning HTML CSS I
tried to make a contact form and when I
set it up I noticed that I needed to
install a local server on my computer
and you can actually do that for free
and once I did that which you guys
probably don't know what a local server
a server is but I can tell you guys once
I actually did that and got my PHP code
working which needed to send my form to
an email it didn't work and that's
because you do actually need to have the
website online for to send an email to
an actual email address so having a form
like this is nice but if you want to do
something with it you either need to set
up a local server and even then some a
few features won't actually be working
unless you actually get it online so I'm
just mentioning that for you guys
it's pretty important to know so you
don't sit down and try to create a
contact form right now and learn how to
set up a server if you do actually learn
it by yourself and it's still not
working
I can tell you guys straight away it's
because it's not online so we will
actually be talking at some point I
guess about how to create this form and
make it into a contact form and how to
actually send it via email so we will be
talking about in one of the episode
coming up how to actually set up a local
server because it's actually very easy
to do and since we don't have anything
more complicated than just needing to
get some PHP code working like we don't
actually need a database and use it we
just need to get a local server running
so we can use PHP and that is not
difficult at all it takes literally less
than 10 minutes to setup so what we can
do is we can talk about that in one
episode and then we'll create an actual
contact form with this form so hope you
guys enjoyed this episode and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
