noticed inside YouTube and when I say
noticed I'm talking about optimizing
your videos optimizing your channel and
a few things to consider before
uploading or creating any kind of
channel inside YouTube now when it comes
to YouTube this quite a few channels and
videos out there it's actually quite
easy to get lost in between all these
videos but having said this is also
quite surprising to see how many people
don't optimize their videos or the
channel so in this episode we're going
to learn how to optimize ourselves in
order to get ahead of everyone else when
we want to create some kind of content
so you can actually get a chance to get
our videos seen even though we just
started out on YouTube now let's
actually talk about the technical aspect
of YouTube and by that I mean actually
getting your channel noticed all your
videos noticed inside all the other
channels and YouTube videos you might
find out there what you need to consider
first is when you want to optimize a
channel is to not use your private
account as your YouTube channel there is
a way to create a second channel that is
actually connected to your primary
channel which is your personal channel
in order to give your channel a
different look that actually targets the
people you want to attract to your
channel so you don't have to use a
personal channel for it now one way to
do this is to actually go up inside your
settings up in the top right corner
click it warm up the settings and inside
the settings you can see see all my
channels or create a new channel and in
here you can in fact create other
channels that are related to YouTube
channel and you will also have direct
access to these channels using your
private YouTube channel now my case here
just to sorry guys I created a new
account called Emma - its new which
right now has 0 subscribers because I
haven't actually done anything inside
this channel but I'm going to use this
channel to show you guys how to optimize
a YouTube channel so I'm going to go and
switch to my other account the one I
just created so now means up my new
youtube channel called mmm - its new and
inside this time we're going to go ahead
and optimize it together so you guys can
follow me and try and look at your own
channel to see if there's something you
missed inside the optimization when it
comes to your channel now the first
thing I'm going to go ahead and do here
is I'm going to go ahead and edit my
channel layout if you haven't done this
yet it's important that you go ahead and
activate this feature that allow for you
to actually custom
your channel the way to do this would be
to go to the Settings icon right next to
the subscribe button click get and then
allow for you to actually customize the
layout of your channel so I'm going to
say save and after saving I can in fact
add a new section so I can actually
start adding sections whether it being
videos playlists or other channels so we
can actually do a bunch of stuff in here
in order to give subscribers something
they can actually see when they enter
your YouTube channel now the next point
here might not be something technical
but it's really important that when
people do actually go to your channel
they get some kind of personal feel or
some kind of you know a certain vibe
that you want to give them when they
enter your channel so right now as you
guys can see have no logo have no
channel art have nothing inside my
YouTube channel so it's very important
that you give your channel some kind of
look that appeals to the target group or
Denisha that you're trying to target
inside YouTube the next thing we need to
do is actually set a description for the
channel which is inside the About
section so inside here we can set a
channel description which is really
important if you want to insert some
keywords that people can actually search
for and then make your channel pop up
inside to search feed another thing to
notice is that you also want to set an
email regarding business enquiries not
just to give you a way for people to
contact you but also because Google sees
that you actually did include an email
and it makes it up to my search engine
just slightly a bit more another thing
is also do is choose a country so you
haven't done that yet it's a garden set
up to the country inside of or if your
primary audience is worldwide or
international then you can go ahead and
set it to the countries that you're
expecting to get the most viewers from
so in my case I did AXA set match of the
United States not because I live here
inside the United States but because I
noticed a lot of people watching my
videos from the United States a third
thing to add inside the About section is
links because inside links you can
actually add social media icons inside
your banner which is really important if
you do actually have social media that
you want to use regarding your channel
such as Twitter Facebook Instagram
and remember it has to be relevant to
your channel and you have to use the
social media that you do actually
include inside the links here otherwise
YouTube is going to see it as not
relevant because you need to actually
use to social media
all of you to see the ads and
optimization so if you were to go and
say and I'm going to give it some kind
of title so let's say website I can say
we have a www mm to.net I can go ahead
and say done then you guys notice that
if I were to go to home inside my
channel we now have a website link
inside my banner the same thing goes if
we want to a Twitter Facebook Instagram
or Pinterest or any kind of social media
might have you can go ahead and add the
links inside the About section and then
just give it some kind of name which
will be the name of people actually see
inside your banner now the next thing we
need to talk about when it comes to
optimizing your channel it's editing
your channel settings because the
settings in here will actually be a
factor when it comes to optimizing your
channel and making it visible so if I
were to go up inside my channel icon up
in the top right corner click on the
Settings icon
would you also have some stuff inside
the settings you can do in order to
optimize our channel the first place
we're going to go into is connected
accounts inside connected accounts you
can see we can actually connect to a
Twitter account meaning that when people
follow you on Twitter and you upload
some kind of video it's automatically
going to get notified inside the Twitter
account so people can actually see it
when you upload content or if you were
to add some kind of video to your
playlist so if you have a lot of
followers on Twitter this is a really
great way to notify them each time you
create contents the second thing we can
do inside the accounts settings is go to
privacy and inside privacy we need to
consider if we want people to see when
we do actually like videos the playlist
we saved all the subscriptions to might
have personally inside our channel
because if I'm not using this purely as
my business YouTube channel I might have
some personal stuff that I want to save
or like or subscribe to and if I don't
want my subscribers to see it we can go
ahead and keep this private again this
is not really an authorization thing for
YouTube but it's something that might
end up giving you a negative backlash if
you have something that people should
not be able to see now inside our
notifications over here we're going to
go ahead and set and language right now
set mine to English because I want
people to actually write to me in
English
but actually setting a language is
something you need
to do whether it being that you want to
target an english-speaking audience or
something else then you need to set it
inside your language preferences so now
we talked about how to actually optimize
your channel inside the settings here
inside their account settings let's
actually talk about optimizing your
channel inside your video manager so now
you guys can actually see them inside my
channel page and what I can do here is I
can go up inside the video manager I'm
going to go and click it and the first
thing I'm going to do in order to
optimize my channel is I'm going to go
and go to channel inside channel I'm
going to go and go to upload defaults so
I'm going to go and click it and inside
the upload defaults we can choose some
settings that we'll always upload with
the videos for me to actually upload any
kind of video so these are things that
if we do actually set them we don't have
to do it manually each time you upload
anything so the first thing I recommend
doing here is figuring out what kind of
category your YouTube channel belongs
under so if we were to say to use a
category right now - acts educational so
I'm going to choose that one if you guys
have a entertainment channel or
something you can go and use that
instead or if you want to do a gaming
channel there's a few options and you
can choose from now the next menu we're
going to go into is the one called
branding and inside of branding I'm
going to go and set a channel watermark
inside my videos so where to say add a
watermark I can go ahead and say I want
to you know to some kind of file I'm
going to go and choose an old logo of
mine maybe this one and when I upload it
it's going to be a watermark that
appears down in the bottom right corner
of all your videos and you can then
choose how long you want the watermark
tags they appear inside the video so
right now it says after five seconds is
to start actually showing inside the
video you could also said you want to
have an entire video which is what I did
on my channel mean that there's always
going to be a watermark or direct link
to your channel from your videos which
is a really great way people are
interested in watching your videos if
they're not subscribed yet they can go
to your channel and see if you're worth
subscribing to I'm going to go and click
update just to make sure we have a
channel watermark the next thing we're
going to do is we're going to go down to
brands it's now inside branded I'm going
to go ahead and choose a country I don't
know what this again is them because
right now I'm inside Denmark but again
if I were to say I want to be inside do
not
stage we can go and do that depending on
your target group I'm just going to go
to say Denmark for now because that's
what I'm inside of the next thing we
need to optimize and here's the channel
keywords which is really important when
it comes to a channel these are the
words that people find your channel by
using these keywords now the way to find
these keywords is either you know trying
to figure out what people access
searches for when they want to find
content relevant to the stuff that you
create a tool you can actually use to do
this is google adwords we're going to
create an account just go ahead and
click AdWords Google come and inside of
here you can go into the keyword planner
and figure out which words or phrases
you can use they might have a high
search volume that people searches for
and which ones has a lot of competition
so meaning that other people have the
exact same keywords and you will be
competing against those people so really
good idea here is to make sure the
competition is low and the search volume
is very high in order to get as many
people as possible so they don't find
out the channels first as you guys can
see you can also link an AdWords account
if you want to again we can use Google
Adwords if you want to now the next
thing we want to talk about is how to
optimize YouTube videos as you guys may
notice that it actually changed into my
regular account inside YouTube and what
I'm going to go and do is I'm going to
go up to upload to upload some kind of
video I'm just going to choose something
random inside my computer which is going
to be this bandicam video made of
something so right now you guys can see
this is actually the name of the file I
uploaded the name of the file will
actually be the one that is inside the
title of your video when you upload a
video now one thing that hasn't really
been confirmed yet is whether the name
of your file before you upload it has
any effect on optimization but I do
recommend you guys do change the name of
the actual file that you upload in order
to get the best possible search
optimization so people can actually find
you inside YouTube so as you guys can
see I called my bandicam 2017 blah blah
blah this is not what you guys should be
calling the video if I were to have a
tutorial on HTML as you called HTML how
to upload a website or something like
that so now we are inside the upload
part let's actually talk about what goes
into optimizing a video so right now we
do actually have to title
highlighted here when it comes to
optimizing the video the title is the
most important thing will optimize your
YouTube video so if we were to write
something inside the title I need to
make sure something people actually
searches for inside YouTube now in order
to get the proper words that I want to
use inside my title we need to make sure
we know exactly what people are
searching for and now we could actually
go out and ask people but since I'm a
lazy person and I want to have a tool
that does everything for me I have a
tool called two buddy now two buddy is a
free plugin you can actually use inside
the YouTube channel and depending on how
many features you want then you will
need to pay something but to start out
to bada is fantastic when it comes to
optimizing your videos after about a
year of YouTube I had about nine
thousand subscribers they're not using
to buddy and then six months later I had
about twenty two thousand subscribers so
it's something that really does
something when it comes to optimizing
videos and getting noticed inside
YouTube so - but it is a tool that will
help you grow a lot faster so let's
actually go and take a look at it now
having tube buddy installed inside my
browser as a plug-in you guys can see I
do actually have some other buttons that
you guys don't have and what we can then
do down here is we can actually say
explore and then inside of here we can
actually you know type something in here
like how to get noticed on YouTube then
we can actually explore it and see how
many people search is for it down here
in the search volume and how much
competition is there inside YouTube says
you guys can see right now we have a lot
of competition inside YouTube on this
sentence here and the search volume is
quite high as well so right now we get a
score of an average of 4 - 4 out of 100
because even though we have a lot of
people searching for this we also have a
lot of competition meaning that we're
going to go and drown in all the
competition we have and it's not really
worth using this sentence here remember
what we want to do is we want to get as
high search volume as possible and as
low competition as possible so inside -
but I can actually go ahead and say well
let's actually go and insert this
sentence here because let's say I do
actually want to use it we can click
insert and then if I exit you guys
considered now inside the keywords here
have one sentence inside the keywords to
body will also let you know if you do
actually rank somewhat using this
keyword so if I were to say sort and
actually applying close if you were to
pull up inside page one inside YouTube
it's going to give you a green number on
the side here that tells you which video
number you are inside page one which is
really nice if you want to know if
people will actually notice you inside
YouTube now going back inside Explorer
we can also go ahead and say well if I
were to click back on what we searched
before if I go to Auto suggested we can
also see Google's and YouTube
suggestions on which words are really
searched for inside YouTube and Google
so we can actually go ahead and choose
these let's actually see how to get
noticed on YouTube 2017 okay let's go
and check that off and explore it before
we actually insert it because we need to
know if it's a good word or not go to
summary and then we can see we get
somewhat the same result here a lot of
people searches for this sentence here
but there's also a lot of competition so
again it's about finding a search volume
and a low competition rating let's
actually go to insert this as well now
when you have a bunch of keywords down
here I recommend choosing the one that
gives you the highest rating again it
does actually need to make sense to your
video because you don't want to click
bait and you need to remember that
there's actually people watching your
videos inside the search feed so if you
have a title that doesn't really make
sense even though it has a high rating
then it's not really going to work so we
need to make sure we choose some that
makes sense and set it as our title so
forward so actually click this select
the text and then insert it inside our
title we can access see we will now have
a idea about how optimized our search
words are inside the title of our video
so we could actually say how to get
noticed on YouTube - and then perhaps
YouTube tutorial series or something if
that's something that again is
recommended when we go inside to Buddy
and explore if YouTube tutorial series
is something that people access searches
for so I'm just going to go and write it
here there we go
now when it comes to your videos as well
as you guys can see I do actually have a
default upload text which is going to go
and remove that inside your description
is
also really important that the insert
keywords that people actually searches
for inside YouTube now what I usually do
is I do actually take my title copy it
and paste it inside my description
that's the first thing then say
punctuation and then write some kind of
description that actually makes sense to
your video and that might be very
optimized using the keyword planner down
here you know about to buddy so let's
say this video teaches about YouTube
optimization like so now when it comes
to active writing the title the
description and the tags down here
inside the keywords it's really
important that you guys fill out as much
as possible because YouTube does allow
you to write 100 characters inside the
title so let's go ahead and make use of
all those 100 characters at least as
close acid as you possibly can while
still making title optimized for people
actually looking at the title because
you have a really long title that
doesn't make sense
then people might not click any video so
you need to make sure it makes sense the
same thing goes for the description
because you need to write a lot of text
but also keep in mind that people will
actually be watching a description so it
needs to make sense but when it comes to
the keywords down here inside the tags
you need to make sure you fill out as
many tags as possible every single
tutorial and if we have visitors and how
to actually optimize videos on YouTube
just to give you guys an example don't
put in YouTube like so because nobody
goes to the search field and just
searches for YouTube what you want to do
inside the keywords is not put a bunch
of small words that make sense to your
channel or to the video you want to make
phrases that people might search for
because that's how you get optimized
when people go to the search field and
that's how you pop up as person number 1
inside the search page this is an
excellent way to get ahead of everyone
else even the people has more
subscribers and more views than you do
if you want to be the first on the
search page you need to optimize your
channel by having the right tags by
having the right title and by having the
right description this also brings me to
some of the other things in here because
when it comes to uploading videos you
need to make sure you add playlists now
there's a couple of
reasons for that one being that if you
have a video in a playlist YouTube will
somewhat optimize it because it sees it
as part of a series but it's also going
to make it easier for people who are
already watching one of the previous
videos to click to the next video
because if they find it exciting and see
oh there's actually another video in
this series then they're more likely to
actually click it rather than having to
go to a channel and find the next video
it is also more likely that YouTube will
actually suggest the video or this next
video in the series inside the suggested
videos on the right side if you have it
inside the playlist now one thing that's
really note by people when it comes to
uploading videos is the upload schedule
because when you upload videos it's not
just about uploading as many as possible
as fast as possible it's about when to
upload during the day and most
importantly if you have a thick schedule
for uploading there will be certain days
a week and certain times a day the
people are more likely to go to youtube
and search for stuff so it's really
important that you guys upload videos on
those times and when it comes to
uploading at a regular schedule it's
very important that if you decide well I
want to upload every Monday and Friday
then you do it each Monday and Friday at
the same time during the day so if we
were to go inside say public right on
just no Save Changes and make my video
public then there's no fixed schedule
and Google doesn't like that if you
instead go inside and say scheduled and
schedule a video for a certain day let's
say I want to do it like I said Monday
at a certain time let's say 12:00 a.m.
then each time I upload Monday then I
need to make sure upload at twelve
o'clock each Monday because then Google
sees that you have a fixed schedule
meaning that you're more professional
about your YouTube channel which also
gives you a jump ahead when it comes to
optimization now the last thing we want
to do when we want to upload a video is
choosing a custom thumbnail when we
choose a thumbnail it's really important
that you stand out from the competition
because when people search for something
inside YouTube the first thing they look
at is not the title of the video
it's the thumbnail if your thumbnail
looks like everyone else is out there
then it's very likely that people are
just going to glance over your thumbnail
and go to the next video down the list
so go ahead and take a look at the
competition when you want to search for
something that we chose inside the title
of the video
with the thumbnails look like and makes
you look different from them make sure
you stand out and get noticed when
people really quickly glance at the
search page when they search for
something now the last tip out for you
guys before ending this video is
creating a channel trailer so right now
when people do actually enter your
channel and they haven't subscribed yet
then go ahead and see your trailer that
explains a bit about yourself what you
want to do inside the channel in order
to let them know what exactly does
subscribing to you and if it's something
they want to keep watching now hope you
guys enjoyed this video and found this
useful in order to actually optimize
your channel and videos to actually get
yourself noticed inside YouTube and I
hope to see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
