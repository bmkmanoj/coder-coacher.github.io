unboxing video this is actually another
one of those unprepared unboxing videos
that I have started doing now as you
guys can see on the title this is the
Corsair Vengeance k70 RGB keyboard I
don't actually know if the team's name
to course a gaming k7 t I'm not sure
about that but this is the keyboard and
it's not the US Edition okay because
they did actually release the keyboard
like a month ago and everyone all around
the world got all excited for it and
when we went in to actually check and
order the keyboard oh it's only released
in the US you know great job Corsair
announcing it worldwide that is released
but it's finally out and that actually
come out a few days ago and I did order
it it's it got inside the door like five
minutes ago so all I did was I grabbed
my packets put on the table got my
cameras and now we're here so this is
the keyboard and I have not touched it
yet the last video I did I did actually
open it up and look at the product
before I did my unboxing not really an
unboxing video is it so I do have my
faithful knife here and I guess which is
sort of gonna cut into it I'm gonna
switch to the other camera now so you
guys can actually see what I'm dealing
with and I'm sorry if my webcam is not
very good quality it I don't know what's
going on with it today usually it's like
super high quality it's it's almost
better than my camcorder and today it is
just not doing what I wanted to it's
just completely doing its own thing so
it's gonna cut off the sides here but
without actually cutting into the
keyboard that would be absolutely
terrible I would freak out if that
happens that's stuck on me alright so
this is the first packaging this is just
like yeah no idea how long I waited for
this okay
I'm really excited so it's like
Christmas inside my head right now
so okay this is the first packaging this
is what the mailman brought me so I'm
just gonna go ahead and take this ugly
thing throw it back there it's gone and
turn this amazing piece of hardware
around so you can see it
I know the lighting is very porn on the
camcorder I noticed sort of a shine
going on but don't worry when we get the
keyboard out the reflection that's going
to be gone I can exit bring it up you
guys to see yeah now this is actually
the brown key addition so I did actually
wait for it you know Cherry MX RGB Brown
because that's what I think I want this
is actually the first mechanical
keyboard I'm ever ordering so I'm kind
of excited about it so I don't know
should we read the package first or what
should we do okay so it's well okay now
it says definite album I'm not very ok
let's open it so they did actually
change the logo which I don't like
because I actually thought the other
logo seemed a lot more professional but
this one seems more like I don't know
like a kid playing video games and I do
play video games but I also use it for
other things
so I would much rather have this
Universal logo that would work with
everything other than just gave me but
what can you do
so I'm just open this out I know what to
do with this thing I'll put it here
alright so we have the package here this
is the actual second package that looks
very much like the first one I just
opened up but listen to that okay
how'd it do this oh okay that thing came
up so it's very cold well I guess it's
because the mailman just came with it so
it's still sort of freezing from the
outside cold I don't do this am I
supposed to break the package
I think I'm supposed to break the
packaging okay hold on don't drop I
swear I'll be absolutely annoying I'm
not cutting anything if I start cutting
here all right I just rip it I got
muscles I got muscles I can do this
opening it up here all right well that's
a man old popping out all right just put
that over there I do not have very good
coordination for this sort of thing come
on all right
is that everything that's everything
good all right second box go okay so
this is the keyboard and oh my god it
has a really nice thick braided cable on
it I did not expect it to be that thick
which might be good might be bad because
if it's really thick means that it's not
very flexible but it does protect better
just gonna get the tape off the bottom
here because there's actually a piece of
teeth sticking up I don't know if the
angles alts all screwed up on my camera
I just have to listen to it for a second
like you guys might be able to see a lot
we might not see anything on the camera
I'm not sure I'm not really looking at
the camera I'm looking at the keyboard
so as I'm too excited for it ah come on
there you go all this plastic I swear I
mean it is to protect the keyboard when
I get it so Wow listen to that that's
amazing okay I thought that was the
scratch for a second but it was actually
something weird like a piece of wood
okay check it for scratches there has to
be no scratches on it this is my first
mechanical keyboard okay I think it's
good now I don't know if you guys can
see it should probably soo-min with my
camera a little bit here so you guys can
actually see what's going on i've just
adjusted there for you okay
this is prompts which is like I said so
I don't know if they're supposed
be very loud I think they're just
supposed to give a little bit of
feedback oh my god if you know what I
was playing on before the I played with
the racer death stalker thing it's
called which is membrane keys and not
just that they're like super low to the
ground like they're really you can't
hear them at all which is great when I
do recording of game playing that sort
of thing but uh they just like don't
feel like it feels like you could snap
that keyboard in half in like a second
this one it's like completely sturdy oh
I've got a lot of those keys okay so
this is the keyboard I'll put the
package singing aside here and I figured
right after I take this little thing off
the logo because there's a piece of
plastic on there
I figured you could actually try and
plug it in that would actually be kind
of nice wouldn't it oh wait wait got one
more thing that I didn't show you guys I
did actually take it out did it actually
get the wrist holding for the keyboard
how does that snap into place because
that is very important I do use wrist
support or whatever that is it's
comfortable
that's all I need to know there you go
oh it's so exciting
okay let's plug it in now one thing I do
want to mention before we actually do
plug it in is that it does actually have
two USB cables back and forth here it
does have two USB cables which is one is
actually put a keyboard and one is for
the lighting power cuz it does actually
need the extra power for that which I
don't mind I have plenty of USB spread
out and another complaint about this
keyboard like one of the the cons about
this keep of watching actually that it
doesn't have like a USB output into the
keyboard which you know I there's a lot
of stuff going on this keyboard so I
guess they figured it was more important
to actually you know actually get the
stuff working that people actually won
it from this keyboard rather than one
extra USB so I'm fine with that I got
plenty of use B's plugged into my
computer here it's gonna like this
circuit
that's one thing what was that oh right
probably I should plug in to keep up
first there you go
and huh and it already lights up that's
amazing
okay I didn't even plug in the second
one whoo I just hit the microphone
didn't I
okay so this is actually the keyboard I
don't know if you guys can see properly
I do want to change my camera angle a
little bit so you guys can actually see
it probably okay so after playing around
my camcorder for a little bit this is
the perfect angle I thought I would show
you guys now do keep in mind it is very
much daylight outside meaning that you
guys won't see the keys as much I could
actually try and turn down to Curtis
it's actually it's actually very dark
outside today and actually it's actually
working now let me let me open my bay a
writing program I'd like to know if
that's actually working over there
something is definitely not working here
oh no it's working now it's working it
just took a few minutes okay and it's
working I can write my name with it okay
fantastic
this way so now we will actually try and
open up the software I guess and do
something with it they're sliding up
right now as you guys can see it does
have the WASD buttons lit up in white as
well as the arrow keys and the rest of
the keyboard is basically just red now
the great thing about kosair is that you
can actually go online and actually just
download other preferences that people
have already made with the keyboard and
I did actually already install the
software so I'm gonna go ahead and just
get right into it here so I did actually
mess around the software for quite a bit
and I did actually download a couple
examples they'll be really cool to show
off and I figured you know I would just
sort of show where I've gotten to with
the software so far these from what I
can understand and then I'll show you
guys two examples so when you get into
the software
I mean it's people made it sound more
complicated online than I actually
thought it was to get to know the
software there's basically four menus up
here you have profiles action lighting
and settings
now inside profiles you can actually
create different kind of lighting so you
can actually save more than just one
different light
and that sort of thing so you can for
example say okay I'm playing battlefield
or something like that and you can you
know create a profile called battlefield
and down here you can create some
different modes depending on if your
sniper or you know a melee fight or
whatever you are you can actually switch
between these modes using a button on
the keyboard so you know you can well at
least the buttons can be set up on the
keyboards against wit smooth and that
sort of thing so so you can actually do
quite a few things in here you can
actually just go ahead and click
whichever button so like drag and hold
or you know hold shift and just select
everything like you can do a bunch of
stuff and you can select as you guys can
see when I click up here it selects all
and I can actually change the colors of
all I can select just the arrow keys the
WASD buttons or the F buttons or space
which I've set up myself now what you
can also do other than just you know
change the lighting of course you can do
effects and that sort of thing on a
keyboard and I'll actually show you guys
cuz it did actually already do something
to the keyboard if I click a button now
we get ripple effects going on and it
doesn't matter where it click it's gonna
come up from where I'm clicking which is
really cool I think and that's actually
something you can set up by just going
up here and then you know when you have
a profile selected and going down to
type lighting and you can either do the
ripple effects by clicking multiple keys
or you can do single key where you click
one key and that one key lights up for
certain period of time then it just goes
back to normal again which is really
cool I think it might be a bit too
distracting with the ripples I might
change it to the single key one who
knows but I'll actually you know you can
also do actions in here which basically
when you do something like let's say I
click plus it will do a whole bunch of
actions that are really cool like you
can create all kinds of color patterns
which other examples I'm gonna show you
guys if somebody actually doing
something really cool with this I
haven't gotten enough into this to
actually to do something so the reason I
actually downloaded or someone else's
now we also have the lighting where you
can go in and you can actually do
lighting patterns which you
actually create in here and disorder
like you create a lighting profile that
you just drag onto your keyboard inside
profiles here and I'll change the colors
and that sort of thing
then we have the settings with just a
basic set up so let's go ahead and take
a look at some of the profiles that
actually did download I have three
different ones
the most boring one is - one called
payday 2 which is well it's not it's not
boring but it's not that interesting
either
let's see if I can actually get it going
I did actually manage to crest my
program I like the soft way here which
is the first time I've done so but I do
hear there's a lot of bucks going on
with the software and they will probably
fix it in the future hopefully they'll
fix it so I cleared the keyboard and if
I go ahead and click this one down here
consider we have some lights going on
and again this is not this one was the
one that I said was not very impressive
so I'm gonna go ahead and go up here I'm
gonna select the one called equalizer
and just go ahead and play it that is
freakin awesome ah it's like a light
system I understood him stared at all
day I think it's amazing you can do
stuff like that with a keyboard okay so
if I show you guys the other one the
last one it's actually really cool also
how many of you guys can tell but that's
actually supposed to be like a Mario
mushroom just go ahead and play it again
I think it's thing it's so cool I can
actually just make it keep popping down
with mushrooms well you can do a bunch
of stuff and like I said this is just
like scratching the surface of what he
can do I have not really looked into it
that much I've only had it for less than
a day so but it's so cool I really like
this keyboard I did actually test it out
so I can give you guys sort of an
impression of the keyboard itself like
not looking at the colors and all that
now like I said it's the first time I've
ever had a mechanical keyboard so I
didn't really know what to expect and I
did actually end up buying the brown
switches because I was
recommended to me and I did actually
test out the brown switches so I wanted
to make sure it did not have too much of
a what do you call it like like too much
of a click sound because it would go
into my microphone when I went to play a
game and I had to make sure there was
actually something I could use for other
than gaming like typing so the branch
which is actually supposed to be good
for typing which they are I've actually
tested it and inside a game it feels
amazing to be using mechanical keyboard
I'm not talking about this keyboard like
in particular a bit any mechanical
keyboard feels a lot better than the
membrane keep what I used before which
now I see was a bad investment because
well mechanical keyboards are better so
well I think it's really good just look
at this amazing okay so I did actually
find out when the software crashed that
you do actually type the software on to
actually get these effects going on I
mean the keyboard will still work but in
order to get all the lighting effects
like tequila would also light up without
the software but the effects and all
that all controlled by the software so
well I hope you guys enjoyed this first
look and opening video and please do
leave a like if you liked it and I'll
see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
