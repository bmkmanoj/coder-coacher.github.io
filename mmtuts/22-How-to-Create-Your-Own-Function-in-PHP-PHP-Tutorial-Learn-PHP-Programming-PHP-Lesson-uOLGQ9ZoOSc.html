something called a user-defined function
inside PHP and this is especially an
important episode for you to watch
because you will be using user-defined
functions all the time when you call PHP
code so we talked about predetermined
functions which are functions that has
already been made inside PHP and we've
just used it right now we don't except
to create it first but a user-defined
function is a function that we create
that we can use later on inside our code
so to give you guys an example here
let's X go and write out a function just
the basic set up for function which is
by writing function parentheses curly
brackets and this is the basic setup for
a function now there's a couple of
things we need in here first of all we
actually need to write something inside
the curly brackets so we can actually
tell the function to do something and we
need to give the function a name so in
our case we can just go ahead and call
this one you know new calc with a big C
which is the name of the function now
when we call this function it's going to
do whatever is inside our parentheses
sorry not the parentheses the curly
brackets which are in here and for our
example we're going to go ahead and tell
it that when we call the function we
wanted to take a number that the user is
defined or maybe something we defined
beforehand and take 75% of it and then
echo out a string that says here is 75%
of what you wrote and then it's going to
tell us what the actual calculation is
so one thing I want to note out with
functions is that it's very important
well it's not very important you can
easily you know not follow this little
rule here but when you create functions
yourself you need to make sure that one
function does one thing so I've seen
people and I've done it myself in the
past where I have one function that does
a whole bunch of you know stuff all at
once like first of all I would calculate
75% echo it out and then afterwards I
would take the 75% or do something else
with it and suddenly I end up with this
function that does a whole bunch of
stuff meaning that I can only use it one
place inside my website
now a function is supposed to be
something that you can use multiple
times many different places inside your
website so you avoid having to write the
same code over and over again so that's
the whole idea behind functions is that
we don't want to write stuff over again
all the time so one functions to do one
thing so it's possible to use the same
function over and over again so inside
the curly brackets we're going to go
ahead and create a variable which is
going to be new number
I guess equal to variable X multiplied
by 0.75 which is going to give us 75% of
whatever variable X is now variable X we
haven't actually created yet and we're
just going to go and create it right now
so on top our function we're going to
say variable X is equal to let's say 100
so now what we're saying is that we want
to take variable X and when we call this
function then we want to do something
with variable X now on an ëthere inside
the curly brackets we're going to go and
create an echo that's going to echo out
a string which says here is 75% of what
you wrote now we're just going to
pretend here that the user did actually
write what X was equal to so after the
echo we of course need to include the
actual variable we have up here the new
number to be created so I'm just going
to get and copy it paste it after the
string with a punctuation between them
and now we have a function that simply
takes you know X and take 75% and writes
out here 75% of what you wrote now we
need to do one more thing because right
now if I were to actually you know use
this function it wouldn't actually work
because we need to make sure we actually
call the actual variable we're going to
use inside the function now it's
important to note you don't have to use
you know like data outside the function
so we don't have to use like a variable
that's outside the function we could
easily just say that this in here is a
hundred times 75 and then you can just
call the function and it's going to
calculate you know 75
100 now because I want to actually use a
variable outside the function we need to
make sure inside the parentheses we
write which data we're picking up from
the outside of the function otherwise it
doesn't know what variable X is so
inside the parentheses we're going to
write variable X so now it's actually
going to go looking for variable X
outside the function so now that we have
this we actually have the function
created but we haven't called the
function yet if I actually go into my
browser refresh you guys can see we have
nothing and that's because we just
created a function we need to call it as
well just like we would with any other
kind of predetermined functions inside
PHP so underneath here we're just going
to go ahead and call out this function
so I'm going to go ahead and say new
calc parentheses semi-colon so now if
actually goes to the browser you guys
can see we get what we do actually get a
warning here ah okay yeah and I know why
we get the warning inside when we call
the function we also need to make sure
if we do actually include variable X
because you need to pretend like we're
calling this part up here because
variable X is inside the parentheses we
also need to put it inside a new calc
function we actually call down here
because otherwise it doesn't know you
know when to pick up variable X now the
cool thing about functions is the right
now I do actually have variable X on top
of my you know written out function here
but you can put variable X any way you
want as long as it comes before when you
actually call the function down here
because right now we don't know what
variable X is at the moment when we
execute the function but at some point
you know much later in the code when we
do actually decide okay this is what
variable X is and now I want to call out
new calculation you can just simply
write this piece of code down here and
get the actual number so if I save this
refresh now we don't get an error and it
will actually tell us you know 75% of
100 is 75% so we can always go in and
change variable X and this is the really
cool thing about functions because we
have a bunch of code that does something
let's say I need to calculate something
again underneath here where I want to
change you know variable x2 maybe
variable
a Akron X going to say the variable a is
equal to 10 and the new calc I can then
change the variable X inside new calc 2
variable a because now it's going to
refer to new calc and say okay if you
have a variable called a inside our
parentheses so it's going to go in and
replace variable X in here
with variable a because we did you know
we did actually decide to do that down
here and now it's going to go looking
for variable a up here instead so if we
go ahead and refresh the browser you
guys so Steve we get here is 75% of what
you wrote 7.5 so it should probably
include like a break in here or
something so we can actually see what's
going on I'm just going to go ahead and
and echo out a break here like so so now
we can actually see the difference here
there we go so functions is something
that we don't well it can be a little
bit confusing in the beginning but you
just need to know that you can write
functions like so at the very top of
your document preferably so you actually
have the function before you start
calling it otherwise you can actually
find the function but you need to make
sure you have the function somewhere we
can you know call them and then you can
simply write out you know the functions
down here or somewhere else on the
website now a typical thing to do is to
include a document that has all your
functions in it at least you know one
PHP document with all the functions
related to maybe users and one that may
be related to no calculations so you can
actually go in and you know have some
kind of system with your functions
inside your website so this is the basic
idea behind functions and I could get a
lot more deep into this I think we're
gonna stick with this for now since this
is all we need to know in order to
create something like a login system so
for now we're just going to go and stick
with this and then later on we do
actually get some more complicated stuff
we'll actually get more you know
in-depth into functions so I hope you
guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys next
