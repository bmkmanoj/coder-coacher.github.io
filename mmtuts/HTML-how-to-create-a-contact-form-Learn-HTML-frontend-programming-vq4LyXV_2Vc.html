about how to set up a contact form
inside our website and in the last
couple episodes I did actually talk
about how to create the form which you
guys see right here and how to style it
so it looks nice now the last thing we
need to do with it is to actually make
it do something because right now if I
were to fill out the information and
then click Submit we get this piece of
PHP codes what you did actually create
back quite a few episodes ago well in
the forum episode we did actually create
a file called form that PHP that had
this piece of code in it and that's
actually what you guys see inside the
browser and the reason that you guys are
seeing this is because right now our
browser doesn't know or at least our
website doesn't know how to interpret
PHP code so as you guys can see you will
actually be using a bit of PHP code in
this episode and I promise you guys it's
not hard what we're gonna do it's very
easy PHP code so if you guys want to
learn how to make a contact form I
really recommend you guys following me
in this episode because creating a
contact form inside your website is very
valuable so you don't have to just like
put an email address somewhere inside
your footer or header and tell people to
copy this email and paste it into an
email and then send me an email
now it's actually quite nice to have a
contact form inside your website so they
don't have to do all that stuff so we
will be using a bit of PHP and because
we're going to be using PHP we're gonna
have to set up a local server which
don't freak out is not tough to do it
literally it takes no more than a couple
of minutes not even a minute if you're
really quick to set up a server and it's
not something that's gonna harm your
computer it's not harming anything on
your computer so what we're gonna do is
first of all we need to actually get the
server running so we're gonna go inside
a website called Apache friends org and
install a program called X M X am PP
which you guys can either Google I'll
just go ahead and find the web site
inside the browser or like the link that
I have up here and then you're gonna go
out and download the version for either
Windows Linux or Mac whichever device
you're sitting on right now coding on
and once you have it installed you're
going to get this little program here
called xampp now I do want
mentioned that once you have this thing
running you should also pay attention to
where you did actually install the
program because we will be needing to
get into that folder where you installed
it and put our website inside a folder
inside xmp's folder so pay attention to
we're actually installing it on your
computer so now as I'm kind of expecting
you guys to already have it installed so
once you guys have this little program
running here you'll notice do we get a
bunch of buttons in it the top ones
called Apache and MySQL I don't once
you're gonna pay attention to because
these are the only two we need to run so
over here which says actions it should
on your screen say start so you can
actually click it to start it and you
need to start both of these so it axis
has stopped here now I should also
mention if you have Skype open right now
and you're trying to start them and the
Apache one is not letting you start it's
because you have Skype opened so go
ahead and close down Skype run it and
then you can actually open Skype back up
and then I'll actually still be working
so just go ahead and do that if you have
Skype open so once you have these two
running we do actually have a server
running on our computer yes it's that
easy it's very easy to do so now that we
have to serve a running I'm gonna go
ahead and go inside my root folder and
inside the folder installed xampp' which
is on my D Drive in my example you guys
may have it inside your C Drive or
something else doesn't really matter
just couldn't find it and inside that
folder you're gonna find exempt so I do
actually a folder down here called xampp
well mine's called xm2 don't pay
attention to that your folder will be
called xampp so just go ahead and open
it up and then you'll get a bunch of
folders again and the one we're
interested in is the one called htdocs
now this folder if you do actually want
to use a lot of PHP code in the future
it's gonna be very valuable for you
because you're gonna be using this
folder quite often so just go ahead and
take it and put it on the side as a
shortcut or something cuz it's not
easier in the future if you want to use
this folder quite often which will you
you actually will if you want to use PHP
like I said so just go and put it out
there and you Explorer now what we can
do here is then go inside this folder
and once we're in here you'll notice
that I do have a couple of folders in
here you guys might have an empty folder
you guys may have an folder with some
stuff in it if you do have something in
this folder and you just installed it
just go and delete everything you have
in here you don't need it if it's empty
you're ready to go so once we have this
folder open you guys will notice I do
actually have some folders in here and
that's because I do actually have some
websites in here that do actually sit
and work on right now but what do you
want to do is take a root folder and
take the actual folder called root
folder with all the stuff in it and then
copy it in here as you guys can see I do
actually have a fold in here called root
folder - which is my name of my root
folder you guys might just have root
folder doesn't really matter and once
you have it in here we do actually have
the website running on our server so
going inside our browser let's go ahead
and go up into the URL and this go ahead
and type localhost enter and you guys
will notice that we get this little nice
thing going on as you guys can see I can
actually see every single folder have
inside my htdocs folder you guys might
only see your root folder because you
only have one folder in there right now
and you can either click it or we can go
back into the URL and say localhost
backslash and then name or your folder
root folder - which is my name for the
folder insert and you guys will notice
that we do have our website running now
since we have it running on our
localhost now on the server we can
actually do something with this PHP code
so if I fill out my contact form again
I'm a mail blah blah blah actually let's
go ahead and say hi and then submit it
you guys will notice that I get some
text up here it says Daniel Nelson which
was my first and last name it says I'm a
male and it says hi so we do actually
have something printed out and the
reason we have this printed out is
because we did actually create some code
inside our formed at PHP which is our
folders actually running once we hit
submit and we did actually print out our
first last gen
and message in these last four lines so
we're gonna go ahead and take this from
the bottom again and just kind of talk
about what this code means and how to
actually make it to send an email so now
we do actually have this thing running
so now the connects go ahead and write
some code oh I should mention every time
you want to do some PHP code and you
want to open up your root folder again
using the server you need to go in xampp
and run these two servers you need to do
that every time otherwise you won't see
your website inside your localhost so
once we have this all figured out then
so let's actually go ahead and make it
make some code inside our PHP form so
inside here what we actually did was if
you guys notice inside my browser at the
very top where we did actually submit
our form we did tell it to take our
first input field we have an input field
call first set it equal to whatever I
write in there which was Daniel in this
case and take our input called last set
it equal to whatever I wrote in there
called Nielsen and take the gender set
it equal to whatever I chose in a
multiple choice thing and create a
message called high because that's what
I wrote in my message box so this is
something we can see because we did
actually use a get method to send this
on to this form have you used a post
method let's actually go ahead and take
a look at that inside our HTML form up
here we used a get method inside our
form which means we can actually see
this inside the the URL and for this
example we can might as well just use it
because we can see it but something some
other example we have to have it more
secure such as username and password and
that kind of thing you want to use a
post method right now this is not
something that's very secretive so let's
just go and use the get method so what
we're essentially doing is we need to go
ahead and go into the URL and tell it to
take the value of our first the value or
our last the value of our gender the
value of our message and print it out so
inside the code what we didn't you know
in the form episode what we did actually
go and create a variable which is we
create some kind of object
at PHP and this variable is gonna be
equal to what we have in the URL called
first you know first was equal to
something we get it from the URL using
the get method here inside PHP and we
did the same thing with all other all
the four ones we included inside the URL
so once we had those we could actually
go ahead and echo them which means that
we're gonna write them on the screen and
then I simply echoed out the variables
we created from these values we got from
the URL meaning that we do actually
print out daniel nelson male hi so now
what we can do is we can actually create
our email form below here so now what we
want to do is first of all we need to
tell it well first of all let's actually
go ahead and write the the mail function
that we need to actually send the mail
which is simply write by writing male
parentheses open and close and then
semicolon at the end because we need to
write semicolon every time in PHP code
in between these tags or like these
parentheses we need to put four values
in there you need to tell it who it's
going for like we'll be sending it to
what is the subject of the mail what is
two texts or the message of the mail and
we need to include something called
headers which tells us or like tells the
person we're sending it to who it's from
so what we're going to do here is first
of all we need to get well we can
actually delete these echoes because I
just did it to kind of show you guys we
did actually get these values but the
first thing we need is who are we
sending it to so what I'm gonna do here
is I'm gonna go ahead and create a value
called to set it equal to the email
address I want to send it to
now of course right now I don't want to
show you guys my email address I'm just
gonna go ahead and say John at dough.com
which is a gibberish email I just made
up you have to put it into either a
colon or what is it called a brackets no
what is it called its called quotation
marks or single quotes you have to put
it in between those once it's text if
these were numbers like numbers only you
can actually write them without the
quotes or single quotes
then we need to close it off again so
right now if we were to echo - we would
actually echo out this email underneath
here we need to tell it what the subject
is so I'm just going to go and create
another variable called subjects now you
can name these whatever you want them to
I'm just calling it - and subjects you
guys can name them whatever you want to
set them equal to space and again we
need the quotes or two single quotes
close it off at the end and then we need
to tell it inside what the subject is
now the subject in this case could be
for example my websites if I can write
this correctly website contact form so
now your subject when once it actually
sends the email will actually be my
website contact form the next thing we
need to include is something called
message which we did actually get from
up here inside the URL so what we're
gonna go ahead and do is we're gonna
create another variable actually we
don't need to do that but you already
have the message up here so we're just
gonna keep that for now the next thing
we need to create is something called
headers now headers can be a lot of
different things for example right now
we need to create a completely PHP text
to the email like we need to tell the
people that are receiving the email what
the first and last name is of this
person who just sent the mail we need to
tell them what you know the person is
and what the message is and we're going
to do that in PHP in this episode you
can write in the HTML inside the PHP
contact form but then you need to
include some more tags inside the header
we're gonna create right now and we're
just not gonna do that in this episode
so now inside the header or headers I'm
gonna go and call it here we're gonna
create who it's from that's all we're
gonna do in this episode so in order to
do that it's just going to make now it
doesn't matter if you use single quotes
or double quotes it doesn't matter I'm
just used to using single quotes I'm
just gonna go with that one but inside
here I'm gonna go ahead and save from
and you need to write it like this you
need to write from with a big F :
space and then
- right who it's from so we're gonna go
ahead and run an email address on who
it's from so in this case if I did
actually ask the person for the email
inside my contact form I still probably
done that if I did actually ask them for
the email I could just have taken the
variable we got from the URL called
email and used it in here okay so I'm
back again I had to leave really quickly
because somebody was knocking on my door
but they're left now so we can actually
go out and continue with this lesson now
right now we talked about getting an
email address from the URL now we don't
actually have an email address set up
inside our form as an input where they
can type in the email and send it so
instead we're just gonna go ahead and
create a variable down here called email
or mail or something it doesn't really
matter you can call whatever you want so
two equal to some kind of email so I'm
just gonna go ahead and say Jane at doe
but come and make sure how closely with
the semicolon at the end so now that we
have an email which by the way like I
said if you had it from the URL you
could just simply use this code up here
and use whatever name you call the input
that had the email in it down here
instead but now that we have this we
want to include it down in our headers
where we need to say who it's from and
there's two ways you can do this even
either we can just go ahead and take out
Jane at dough.com paste it inside the
single quotes after the space after the
colon and would actually say it's from
Jane at door come but since we have a
variable up here with the email in it
you actually need to paste a variable
after the single quote because now we're
referencing to this variable up here
which is set equal to this so if we say
it's from a variable called email it
will actually say it's from Jane at.com
now the reason we're pasting it outside
the single quotes is because inside the
single quotes we're just saying that
this is regular text and if I were to
paste this inside the single quote you
guys connect to see my PHP code actually
turns the same color as my text in here
meaning that it doesn't recognize it as
PHP code so we need to put it outside
our single quotes and we also need to
put upon to a
in between because once you actually
switch from regular text like this or P
it's a HTML code because you can't
actually put the HTML code in here by
creating like a P tag or something we
need to put a separator called
punctuation in between the quotes or two
single quotes and actual PHP code so now
I'll actually say that is from Jane Doe
comm so now that we have all these
informations here we can actually go
ahead and go down to our email or like
our mail function and start filling in
so we need one value to begin with and
the one value that we need to start with
is who is it - and right now we have an
email said John at.com
set to a variable called - so we're just
gonna go and paste that in there then
we're gonna say comma and then we need
to add what this object actually is of
this post or like this contact form and
we do have this object here we're just
gonna go and paste it in here like so
now we need to include the message of
the actual contact form which we have up
here we got it from the UL paste it
below here and then we need to say what
the headers are for this email and again
we just write a comma and paste it in
there so if I were to send this right
now it wouldn't actually work because
like I said you do actually need to have
the website online to actually see
anything because even though we have it
on a local server right now it's
actually not connected to the Internet
and in order to make it connected to the
Internet you need to actually upload it
to an online server somewhere so even
though we can't see that it's working I
can promise you guys this will actually
send an email to this person up here
with all this information in it now this
is how we send it but what if you want
to add a customized message that says
Daniel Nelson just sent you a message we
just sent an email with this message and
then we write out the actual message
here well what we can do then is we can
actually go ahead and just go in between
here and create another variable called
new message
or we can call it mail message set it
equal to and then start adding the text
we want it to have so right now if I
were to write you got a mail from and
then we need to say who it's from and we
do actually have the first name up here
so we're going to copy this variable
that equal to the first name of the
person who fill out the contact form and
we paste it after here and of course as
well we need to add a punctuation as a
separator so you got a mail from antenna
so probably add a space in here Daniel
then we need to add another piece of
text so we need to write another
punctuation single quotes again and then
we say space with well actually no let's
just go ahead and paste in the last name
as well so if you have the last name so
it's Daniel Nilson
we're gonna go ahead and add a what you
call it we're gonna go ahead and just
add these single quotes punctuation
paste in the other variable called last
punctuation and then we can write our
message again with something now the
reason we're doing this thing is because
it only recognizes two space with the
actual text so we needed to finish off
our first name and then say okay now
we're writing text again and then we
just wrote a single space which means
that now recognizes the space in here
then we're gonna say last name or at
last at least include the last name and
then again we start a message over here
so if you want space after our last name
we need to add two space first and then
we can say you got a mail from Daniel
Nelson who said the following and then
we can say : and now if you want to add
another line you're actually gonna have
to do it using something called let's
actually go ahead and include it here
you're going to go ahead and include
inside after the of what we call it the
colon you're gonna say /if
actually find on my keyboard here it's
right there /and then you're gonna say r
/m which means that now we're going to
the next line inside our PHP code this
is the PHP way to interpret a new line
instead of the BR we used inside our
HTML code so now we're going to the next
line we can actually start adding some
more to our message here so what we can
do here is we can afterwards just go
ahead and include our message so we're
gonna say punctuation because we're
gonna include our message up here which
is PHP code so we need to add the
punctuation to actually tell the
difference between HTML and PHP and then
we have the message here and then we can
actually close it off so now we're
saying you got a mail from Daniel Nelson
who set the following the next line and
then the message okay so now we have
this we need to actually change the
message down here in the mail function
to be mail message instead of message so
now that we have this it will actually
send you guys this to the forum now a
last thing we might want to need here
after you send the mail you probably
want to send the user back to your front
page we have the contact form so once we
run this form actually let's go ahead
and go back to our web site here so I
can show you guys what I mean if I go
down to the bottom zoom out a little bit
and say Daniel Nelson male hi submits
you guys will notice that we get nothing
that's because we just ran an entire
script we just wrote in PHP and it just
sent the email but what now we didn't
tell it to we didn't tell it where it
needs to go afterwards so inside a code
at the very bottom below on mail we say
ok after you sent the mail we're gonna
say header which is a function so we're
gonna add the parentheses close it
afterwards with the semicolon and inside
the header we're gonna go ahead and say
we need to go inside the header function
and we say single quotes you say
location with a big L colon space and
then we need to tell it where it needs
to go to afterwards right now I think we
just make it go to our index page our
front page so we're gonna say index dot
HTML so now if I save this go back
inside my website submit the form you
guys have noticed that whoa we jump back
to the front page so now we just send an
email to the person we told to inside
our form so this is how you create a
contact form using PHP code and I
realized this is PHP and I hope you guys
did find it interesting now what we're
gonna do in the next couple of episodes
is we're gonna go ahead and just kind of
finish off the website like right now we
don't have a gallery we don't have
anything you don't even have a sub page
inside this website so even though this
website doesn't look very pretty
we did do a lot of the basics in here
like this is basically just the template
to show off some of the different
features you can do with HTML CSS and
now I did actually include a bit of PHP
so for now I think this is good in this
episode and in the next couple of
episodes we'll talk about how to
actually create galleries and that kind
of thing and then we will talk about how
to actually upload the website at the
very end now if you guys have any
suggestions to stuff you guys want to
learn in this episode or like in this
series go ahead and put it in the
comments I will go ahead and read it and
then I'll actually create a couple of
lessons in how to actually do this stuff
so hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
