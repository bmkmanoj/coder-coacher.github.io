something called a JavaScript objects
and an object inside JavaScript is
basically something we've touched on
before in previous episodes but I
haven't really talked about it as
in-depth as I would like to so we're
gonna spend this episode and maybe a
couple more talking about what exactly a
JavaScript object is how we can create
them and how we can access them inside
the browser now if you come from a PHP
background and JavaScript objects is
slightly different from PHP objects so
don't think PHP if you come from a PHP
background just kind of start over from
new and just learn this from scratch
because the concept is slightly
different so when I say that we've
actually done objects before without
actually really gone in depth in it what
I basically mean is that when we create
something like a variable inside our
website let's say I create a variable
called person and set it equal to a name
for example my name which is Daniel
right now we created an object and this
might be slightly confusing for some
people to understand especially if you
come from a PHP background but whenever
we have a variable that is equal to some
kind of value we have an object now
don't get me wrong this is a very very
very very basic object okay this doesn't
really have any properties in it meaning
that right now we don't know if this
person has an age you know first-name
lastname gender hair color that sort of
thing right now person is just equal to
Daniel and that's a very very basic
simple object so what we can do is we
can actually go ahead and create an
object you know a variable that has
different properties in it such as 8
hair color first name last name and then
we can access these values later on so
let's actually go and create a more
advanced object let's actually go ahead
and say we have a person that is not
equal to Daniel because that's way too
simple instead we're gonna go ahead and
say well this person has different types
of properties and the way we do that is
by writing curly brackets so right now
we have curly brackets and then inside
the curly brackets we're gonna live
all the different properties so the
first property I would like to have
inside this person is going to be the
first name now just to make this more
simple for you guys I'm just gonna write
it out in one line to start with because
often online you will actually see
people write it out in one line or
multiple lines so just so you guys don't
get confused I'm gonna go and write in
for in just one line first and then in
separate lines afterwards which is
probably my preferred way of doing it so
we have a first name and the first name
is Daniel and do bear in mind that at
the next used colon inside in between my
first name you know the actual name of
the property and the value so first name
is equal to Daniel and then we're gonna
say comma space then the next property
we would like to have in here is my last
name so I'm gonna write last name
Kol one space Neilson which is in fact
my last name comma and do bear mine now
we had two different properties so if I
were to say okay this is too confusing
this is in one line I can actually go
ahead and move it down to the next line
so every time you have a comma I'm gonna
go and move everything down one line
just so we have a list of stuff going
downwards which to me it's much more
simple to look at so this is how I would
actually do it in future episodes I'm
gonna go and go down to the next line
and I'm gonna say well we also have a
age which in my case is going to be 25
do bear mine I didn't put it inside a
string because this a number you don't
have to we could put it inside a string
if you wanted to but I'm just going to
leave it as a number next line I'm gonna
go ahead and say I have a hair color
which is brown now because this is the
last property I'm gonna put inside this
object I'm not gonna put a comma at the
end because if we were to look at this
as one line of code you know we wouldn't
actually put a comma at the end of the
last property because it wouldn't make
sense because it's ending off anyways so
we're gonna go ahead and just leave out
the comment from last one
okay so now we have a very basic object
here that has different properties in it
that has different values so if we were
to actually go down to the next line and
say well what if I want to write this
out inside the monitor and I'm gonna go
ahead and write documents dots right and
inside the parentheses I'm gonna go
ahead and say person punctuation first
name and that's how we access the
different properties we first of all
need to write the object name and then
whatever property we wrote inside the
object and then we can actually go ahead
and write out that specific property you
know separating it with a punctuation so
were to save this refresh the browser so
you guys can see it says Daniel if it
were to change the first name to my age
you guys can see if you get my age
instead so that's the basic idea behind
at least the properties that we have
inside an object and when it comes to
you know these sort of objects we not
only have properties like the ones we
have here you know first-name lastname
age hair color we also have methods
which we're going to talk about in the
next episode because I think we should
just focus on talking about the
properties in this episode to not make
it too confusing and make it look like
it's much more difficult than it really
is so to make it more simple I'm just
gonna go and split the object episodes
into multiple parts so we're talking
about one thing per episode so hope you
guys enjoyed this episode and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
