our next episode we're going to learn
how to show and hide the password inside
a form inside HTML so a lot of you
requested of me to teach you how to
create this little button inside for
example a locking system that you can
click and then when you type something
inside for example the password feel
like then activate the button and then
see the password as you type it and then
click it again to actually hide it and
turn it into this password field again
so that's what gonna do in this episode
as you can see it did already create
part of the form that we're gonna use in
this episode so for which I go inside my
index page you can actually see that I
do have a form tag I didn't set an
action or a method because we're not
really gonna do anything with this form
we're just gonna show in hide the
password so we can actually just go
ahead and remove this and we have a
couple of inputs in here the first one
is a regular text input that has a name
as you ID which is the user name and
then I have a placeholder called user
name then the second input is going to
be a password type which is why we see
these little dots instead of the actual
letters that are type in I set the name
to password or PWD and the placeholder
says password and then we have a login
button down here at the end now this
would of course also have a time set to
submit and then probably a name to
submit as well if we had to be correct
technically when we had to actually use
it afterwards and so what I want to do
here I want to create a button that when
you click did you then see the password
that you typed in so what I'm going to
do here is I'm just gonna go ahead and
duplicate the button that I have here
like so and I'm gonna cut and change the
type by actually I'm not gonna change
that I'm just gonna go ahead and remove
it entirely then I'm also gonna go and
remove the name here because we don't
actually need that and I'm gonna go int
into text inside the button because we
need to say something like show / hide
or something because we just need to
shown how to password now this button is
going to be right next to the password
input so I don't think we should
actually write something else than this
and inside the button tag we're gonna go
ahead and set a on click event because
when we go to click this button you want
to activate some kind of JavaScript
function so I'm gonna go and say we have
a unclick attribute which is going to be
equal to
and then we can actually refer to a
function in JavaScript so I'm gonna go
and say we have a function called
something like change
PWD u parenthesis let's actually spell
that correctly you there we go so now we
actually activate a function want you to
actually click this button now one thing
you'll notice is that it already create
a main dot JS file which is just going
to be the JavaScript file that we're
going to write the function inside of
and I have it right here so what I'm
going to do is I'm gonna go ahead and
say we have a function called change PWD
you make sure you write all the caps
last letters the correct way then I'm
going to say clearly practice because we
want to open it up and then we're gonna
code and write whatever code is going to
change the password view inside this
function here now one thing needs to do
first is actually check if we did
already click the button or not because
right now our form has the input set to
password and what I want to do using
javascript is so once actually change
the type from password to text once I
click this little button down here so we
need to actually have some kind of check
that us actually see if we already click
the button or not so we can actually
change it back again to the password
type if we already click the button so
inside the main de Jas we're gonna say
something like and we're gonna do that
on top of the function here I'm gonna
create a let variable again if you don't
know what a let variable is I do have an
episode on it a couple of episodes
before this one I think might be the
last one so just go and check them or
not if you're a little bit in doubt
about it
so we're gonna say we have a lead very
bowl what we're gonna say login PWD
status or something like that then we
can go and set this one equal to false
because right now we haven't clicked
this button here so we're not showing
the text inside the password field okay
now before we do anything inside the
function there's one more thing you need
to do inside the index page which is we
need to add an ID to the input that we
want to change because we need to be
able to grab the input in order to do
something to it so inside the index page
I'm gonna go inside my input here and
I'm gonna go ahead and add an ID so
we're going to say ID equal to double
quotes and I'm gonna go and set this one
to
lock-in PWD change again just to give it
some kind of name as an ID I'm gonna
copy it save it go inside my main
today's file and now we're gonna go and
go inside the function and actually do
something to this input now the first
thing I want to do inside the function
here so I want to actually grab the
input and set it equal to a variable so
we can actually use it so I'm going to
say we have a variable called let's and
then we can say gets locked in inputs or
something set it equal to document dot
get element by ID parentheses semicolon
and then we're going to go ahead and say
we want to set the ID to the ID we just
created inside our index page so now we
do actually have the input and now we
can actually do something to it so
underneath here I'm gonna go ahead and
do a check because we need to check if
the login password status is equal to
false and if it is then when I click the
button I would like it to change into a
regular text type okay so we're gonna go
and save you haven't if statements and
inside the condition I'm gonna go ahead
and check if login password status is
equal to false then afterwards I'm gonna
go and create a else if statement to
check if the login status is true inside
the if statement we're now gonna go and
get the login input from up here that we
grabbed and then we're going to run a
JavaScript function called set attribute
parentheses semicolon and inside the set
attribute we have two different
parameters we have first of all the adds
if you want to actually grab from inside
our index page or inside this input and
then we want to set the new value as the
second parameter so the one we want to
change is to type and I want to change
it into a text type okay then we're
gonna go ahead and underneath here set
the login password status to true
because otherwise we're gonna run this
same if statement then I'm just gonna go
ahead and copy paste this inside the
else if and I'm gonna go ahead and
change the login password status to
false so then the next time it
actually go ahead and go back to the if
statement and I'm gonna couldn't chance
to type two password again like so then
the last thing we're gonna do in here is
we're gonna go ahead and set the login
password stat is not equal to false but
instead equal to true because we do
actually change this one each time we
click the button and the last thing we
need to do inside the index page because
there was one more thing we forgot was
to include a type to the button here
because otherwise it's just gonna
refresh the browser want to click the
button and think that we actually
submitted the form so we're gonna go
ahead and set a type to button like so
then we're gonna go ahead and refresh
the browser and as you can see when I
write something we get a password type
when I click show/hide we get text when
I click it again we then get the
password again so this is how we can
actually shown how to password using
javascript I might do a tutorial as well
inside my Taylor series because I notice
is something that a lot of you have
asked about both when it comes to
JavaScript and jQuery so I'm gonna go
ahead and create a separate episode
using jQuery okay hope you guys enjoyed
I'll see you guys next time I'd like to
say thank you to all the people
supporting me on patreon engines the
next two benefits such as lesson
materials then go ahead and hit the link
to do see on screen here and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
