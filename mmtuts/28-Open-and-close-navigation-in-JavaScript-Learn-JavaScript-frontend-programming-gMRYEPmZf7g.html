exercise in JavaScript using all the
stuff we've learned so far in all the
previous episodes so if you guys can see
this is the example I showed you guys in
episode 2 when we started learning
JavaScript and in this example here I
made an interactive menu that we could
click on in order to open and close it
so as you guys can see we can actually
do something inside a website using
javascript so in this episode we're
going to learn how to build this exact
menu here now what I have for you guys
is a small document or at least a small
zip file that you guys can download
inside the description of this video
because you're going to need to have the
image that we use in this episode we
have two small X up here and we also
have the logo so what I'm going to go
and do here is I'm going to go ahead and
go inside a completely new document that
only has the very basics of an html5 set
up now inside this document we're going
to go out and set up the stuff that we
need to use in order to get started with
the JavaScript part so inside my head
tag I'm going to go ahead and link to a
style sheet that we haven't created yet
so I'm going to say link going to click
tap because I'm going to insert my text
editor and as you guys can see we get a
link to a style sheet I'm going to go
ahead and click style dot CSS and I'm
going to go and create a new document
called style but CSS so we actually have
this document just created a link for so
I'm going to say it's done dot CSS
inside my root folder as you guys can
see I do already have the image and the
closing image so I'm just going to go
and save my stylesheet in here and now
we can actually go and get started on
creating the things that we need inside
our front page because this is index dot
HTML meaning that this is the front page
so inside the body tag I'm going to go
ahead and create an nav tag meaning that
we're going to create a navigation here
just going to go to move it out so we
have some hierarchy and inside this
navigation and inside the opening nav
tag I'm going to go and include an ID
because we're going to have to use it
when we want to do something with
JavaScript so I'm going to say ID going
to call this one menu even though we
could call it something you know
slightly more slightly better different
going to call it menu for now inside the
knapsack I'm going to go and include an
image because needs have the logo
once at the website as you guys can see
have a logo in here by the way this is
the clean website it will program right
now so if we go back inside my code
editor save this and link to my logo dot
PNG file you guys can see we now have an
image of course we didn't do any styling
yet so I'm going to have to do that in a
second after we have the image inside
our navigation I'm going to go and
include an unordered list inside the
unordered list I'm going to create a
list item and an anchor tag I'm just
going to say has tag inside the link
because we don't want it to link
anywhere yet this is just an example and
inside the anchor tags I'm going to go
and write home because we need to have a
link in here I'm just going to go and
copy this down a couple more times five
times and the first one at least the
second one is going to change to cases
the third one is going to be personal
projects the fourth one is going to be
about me and the last one is going to be
contact so now that we have a very basic
navigation here I can actually go ahead
and go inside my stylesheet and style
this so inside my Styles you I'm just
going to go and include a couple of
default things that we need to have
whenever we start a new website so I'm
going to create a multiplication symbol
curly brackets which means that we're
styling
everything inside this website going to
write margin I'm going to set equal to
zero and create padding set it to zero
now if you don't know what we're doing
here we're just resetting which is
basically resetting all the margins and
padding's inside the website since some
browsers have some default padding's and
default margins that we want to get rid
of so now that we've done this we can
actually go ahead and start styling our
navigation so I'm going to say nav curly
brackets and then inside that we're
going to go ahead and give it a width
we're going to set the width to 240
pixels because why not we can just do
something after width we're going to go
and set background color I'm going to
set it to white
and after the color we're going to go
and set a precision because whenever our
scroll inside this website I want the
navigation to stay out in the left side
so I'm going to go and set the precision
to fixed like so and I'm going to set
the top to zero I'm going to set the
bottom to zero and I'm going to go and
set left to zero so now I should have it
going all the way from the top to bottom
and then all the way to the left side of
the browser so the next thing we need to
add here is a set index because we're
trying to create a navigation it's a
good idea to keep it on top at all times
so I'm going to go and set the set index
to a thousand which just means that
would be basically putting it on the top
layer whatever we have inside the
website and I'm going to go ahead and
add a transition effect now the
transition effect is because whenever we
go inside the browser inside my example
here you guys may notice that when I
click the clothing icon
it doesn't just pop closed it actually
slides to the left and closes up that
way like so so we need to have a
transition on this entire navigation in
order for it to transition when we do
something with JavaScript so I'm going
to go out and say transition : I'm going
to set it to all ease in out and I'm
going to go and set it to 200
milliseconds like so now just in case we
want to have it working for more than
just one browser at least for just a
couple of default ones let's actually go
ahead and set WebKit in front of it like
so so now that we have this we can
actually go ahead and style the logo we
have inside the navigation if I do
actually go back and what we do need to
include a background call on the entire
website so let's have to do that first
I'm going to say body I'm going to set
the background color to some kind of
dark grey so - seven - seven - seven now
if we go back to the web site as you
guys can see we now have a very dark
color and we have the medication bar on
the left side now we need to start the
stuff inside the navigation as well
so if I go back inside my stylesheet
right after the navigation we're going
to go and say nav space IMG for image
and we're going to go ahead and set
display block just so we're sure we can
actually send to this by a margin and
we're going to go and set the width to
80% of course you guys contains whatever
styling you guys want to I'm just kind
of setting up something I think looks
nice I'm just going to set the width to
80% I'm going to say margin:0 auto to
get it centered then afterwards I'm
going to just push it down slightly from
the top of the website so I'm going to
set padding top and I'm going to go
ahead and say 30 pixels so now let's go
back inside the website you guys can see
we now have a logo here so now I want to
style the actual navigation so what I'm
going to do here is that I'm going to go
and go back inside my styling after the
image styling here I'm going to go ahead
and say we have a noun that has a
unordered list inside of it curly
brackets and inside the unordered list I
want to move it slightly away from the
left side so let's say padding left I'm
going to say 30 pixels I also want to
move it away from the logo from the top
meaning that I want to set a padding top
like so I want to move it away 60 pixels
now I'm just going to go and copy this
and start styling the list items meaning
that we're just going to you know copy
paste and just include the list item up
here and inside of here I want to set
the list style to none
so we have no bullet points inside our
menu and I want to set a padding to 4
pixels and zero pixels like so just so
we get a little bit of distance between
the the menu items so now that we have
this we can go ahead and style the
actual letters we see inside the
navigation you know giving it a font
family a color you know a font style so
we're just going to go and paste this
down we just created here I'm just going
to include a anchor
after the list item and inside the
styling we're just going to go and
delete what we have in here I'm going to
go to include a font
- family set it to Arial because why not
and I'm going to go and include a font
weight I'm going to set the font weight
to 300 I'm going to set a color to s tag
- 7 - 7 - 7 which is the same as the
background color I don't really like to
use completely black colors because it
gets a little bit too aggressive so
using a dark grey color makes it a lot
nicer we're going to use a text
transform because we want to make it
uppercase like so and now if I go back
inside my menu here you guys can see we
now have this now we do have an
underline which I just notice now so
we're going to go up to the top where we
have all the styling and just say we
want no text decoration so we're going
to say text-decoration:none like so so
now I have a very basic menu here and
what we need to do now is include the
closing icon up in the top left corner
then we can actually click in order to
close the menu so inside my index page
right before the nav tag I'm going to go
ahead and create a div like so and
inside the opening tag of this div I'm
going to go ahead and give it an ID I'm
going to set this one to toggle now or
menu let's actually do that that sounds
better and we're going to go ahead and
set a on click event so that when we
click this thing something happens so
we're going to set this on click
attribute and set it to toggle menu
parenthesis and save it so basically
what we're doing here is when we click
this little dip here we're going to go
ahead and activate a toggle menu
function that we haven't created yet
which will actually close the menu so
what I'm going to go and do now is I'm
just going to go to style what we have
here the div tag so it looks nice by
going back inside the style sheet I'm
just going to go to the bottom here and
I'm going to go ahead and write as tag
toggle menu
curly brackets and then the first thing
we're going to write is a width I'm
going to set it to 20 pixels now because
I want this to be a complete square I'm
just going to set a height as well to 20
pixels I'm going to set a background
color to white I'm going to set it
background-image:url like so and I'm
going to set the image to let's actually
go out and see what we call this one
because I don't remember close the PNG
so I'm going to say closed dot PNG now
after this one we're going to go ahead
and set a background size because need
to make sure the X you know the image is
actually covering the entire tip so I'm
going to say background - size and I'm
going to go ahead and set it to cover so
make sure it covers the entire div
inside backto tip I'm going to go and
set a background repeat' because we
don't want this to repeat inside the div
so I'm just going to say no repeat and
then afterwards we're going to go to set
a position because need to make sure the
position is at the top left corner of
our navigation at all times so I'm going
to say position fixed then we're going
to go ahead and say top we're going to
say zero pixels we're going to say left
zero pixels now we need to include a set
index because we need to make sure it
stays on top of the navigation if I were
to give this one a set index as 500 it
would actually go behind the navigation
so we need to make sure we have it above
a thousand or just a thousand source on
the same layer so I'm going to give it a
thousand fifty just to give it something
and after we've done this we need to
make sure that when you hover the mouse
cursor on top of this dip box you want
to have this hand icon appearing you
know like it's a link so I'm going to go
and say cursor and I'm going to
the cursor to pointer then afterwards
we're going to go ahead and give this
one a border because right now if I were
to refresh to show you guys you can see
it squeezed all the way up against the
left side of the corner so I want to
push it away to slightly but I don't
want to have any spacing between the
side of the browser and the actual X you
know with the hand icon we get when we
hover on it so I'm going to go and give
it a border I'm going to set the border
to ten pixels just to get quite a bit
and I'm going to go to set it to sell it
and a background color of white so it's
the same color as the actual background
of the div after we've done this I'm
just going to go ahead and give it a
border radius because why not which
means that we are rounding off the
corners of div about a supporter radius
and set it to 2 pixels after we've done
this I want to include a transition
because I want to when I hover you could
take the example here when I hover on
the logo or the icon up here you guys
can see it gets slightly transparent if
I close it as you guys can see I want to
have this transition effect so if I go
back inside the code I'm just going to
go ahead and copy the transition we have
up here inside on that tag and paste it
in at the bottom here so now we have
this I'm going to go ahead and create a
hover effect so I'm going to copy what
we have here just delete all the code we
have inside of here and say we have a
opacity I'm going to set it to 0.7 like
so which means that now what we do
actually need to include the hover like
so which means that now if I go back
inside refresh you guys can see that we
get this hover effect a transition hover
effect the change of the opacity so now
that we have all this we can actually go
ahead and start including the JavaScript
code we need in order to open the
closest navigation so what I'm going to
do here is I'm actually going to go
ahead and go inside my index file in
here I'm going to go to the very bottom
since I want to load the JavaScript code
after all the stuff has been loaded
so I'm going to go to the bottom here
right before we close off the body tag
I'm going to go to include a script tag
inside the script tag we're going to go
and include a variable because in order
to keep track of when we actually open
and close the navigation we need to set
some kind of value this value can user
be true and false it can be 1 or 0 it
can be whatever we want it to be so I'm
just going to go and say we have a
variable called toggle status so we know
the status of the navigation and I'm
going to set equal to 1 now in my head 1
means that we have it open and 0 means
to be close it ok so after we have this
variable created which we don't actually
use yet I'm going to go and create the
function we created in the top here
called toggle menu so we do actually
activate toggle menu when we click this
X icon so I'm going to say if you have a
function called toggle menu parentheses
curly brackets and then inside the curly
brackets we're going to go and create an
if statement which we talked about in
one of the previous episodes we just did
so inside the parentheses of this if
statement I'm going to go and say well
if toggle status is equal to 1 then it
needs to run whatever blogger code is
inside these curly brackets here so I'm
going to say toggle status is equal to 1
then it needs to go inside the document
dot and get some kind of element that
has a specific ID which in this case is
the menu that has an ideas menu and do
something to it we want to get element
by ID parentheses and get one called
menu then afterwards we want to say okay
after we get this menu we want to change
the styling develop inside to CSS file
so I'm going to go ahead and say style
and do pair mind the way I'm doing it
right now only allows for us to change
one styling at one time meaning that we
need an entire
elana code if it were to change
something else we do have another way
you can do this with the styling if you
want to start multiple things inside
just one line of code but for now we're
just going to go and do it with you know
like we do it here so I'm going to say
style which means that we're now saying
we want to style this object dot and
then the attribute inside the CSS you
want to change which in this case is
left because right now inside my menu I
can find it at the very top here the nav
tag over here that has a ideas menu
right now has a left set to zero which
means that it's touching the left side
of the browser if I were to set this as
a negative it's going to go and move
beyond the browser meaning they want to
change this to a negative number which
is going to be the same width we
included for the endtime map so inside
the index file I'm going to change the
left so they're equal to double quotes
minus 240 pixels and close off the code
so now when I do actually click the menu
at least click the icon up there it's
going to go ahead and set menu which is
the entire navigation - left - 240
pixels now after doing this we're also
going to have to change the toggle
status that included up here to
something else so I'm just going to go
and copy this go down the next line
inside the if statement and change the
the toggle status to zero so right now
table status has changed so if I were to
click this button again right now
because this if statement checks if the
target status is equal to 1 which right
now it has been changed it is no longer
going to run this if statement because
toggle status right now is going to be 0
after the first time you click it so
what we can do here is we can go ahead
and include an else if statement
parenthesis curly brackets and inside
this else if statement we're going to
check if toggle status is equal to 0
inside the curly brackets I'm just going
to go ahead and copy the two lines of
code we have up here move it inside
of course the toggle status after we're
done running the LCS statement needs to
be change back to one meaning that the
next time it's going to go and go back
to the if statement up here now in here
you want to change the menu back to zero
Sonata - and 240 you want to change it
to zero so once you guys will notice now
is that when we do actually go back
inside the website refresh I click the X
icon it moves away when I click it again
you guys can see we now get the
navigation back inside the browser so
this is how we can do you know very
basic JavaScript coding using for
example a navigation and again like I
showed you guys you've been using quite
a few of the things you've learned so
far using variables to be using
conditional statements we've been using
comparison operators inside the
parentheses inside the else if and else
statements and if statement
we've been doing quite a few things in
here so if you guys enjoyed in the next
episode I think we're going to be doing
another exercise so hope you guys will
enjoy that I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
