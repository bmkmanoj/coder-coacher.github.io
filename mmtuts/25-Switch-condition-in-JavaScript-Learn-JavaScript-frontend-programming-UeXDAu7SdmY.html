conditional statement we have inside
JavaScript called
a switch statement now a switch
statement is very similar to the
previous ones we talked about in the
previous episode which was the if-else
if-else statement however a switch
statement is something want to use if
you have a lot of data that we want to
check for for example if I wanted to
check for you know which day of the week
it is today then a if statement an
else--if statement and you know all the
ones who talked about in the previous
episode there might be too much code to
write so we can do this much more simple
by writing a switch statement now as you
guys can see inside my code here I have
a very basic estimate five setup I have
a paragraph called test and I have a
variable called day now of course day is
just a variable that I created
I haven't actually set it equal to
something yet and underneath here I have
a very basic document.getelementbyid II
called test and I want to insert some
kind of HTML code inside the paragraph
tag down here and right now it says it
is plus day which basically means that
we're going to say it is and then
whatever the variable day is it's gonna
go and insert that into this sentence
down here so what I want to do is I want
to create a switch statement that checks
what day of the week it is right now and
then insert the day inside this text
down here if I were to actually go
inside the browser you guys can see that
says it is undefined because right now
day is not equal to anything yet so the
way we create a switch statement is if I
were to go down in between these two
lines of code and say switch parentheses
curly brackets I can go ahead and set
the condition inside the parentheses and
whatever that is gonna be equal to I'm
gonna have different cases inside the
curly brackets so it's slightly
different than an if statement so right
now because I want to check what day of
the week it is right now I'm gonna go
ahead and go inside the parentheses I'm
gonna create a new date objects we
talked about in one of the previous
episodes we do actually need to write
this in big like so and the date object
I want to get day parenthesis which
means the right now inside this data
object I want to get the current day now
this is going to return some kind of
value
if we were to actually go ahead and spit
this out inside the browser you know by
just copy pasting it down here just to
test it you guys can see the right now
we get three and that's because right
now at least right now where I'm sitting
it's Wednesday so we were to count the
days of the week Monday is one Tuesday
is two and Wednesday is three so right
now we're getting Wednesday so what I
want to do here I'm just going to go
back here what I want to do here is I
want to say okay so this is gonna return
a certain data you know a certain piece
of data which is three I want to go
inside the switch and I want to check
for certain cases that might happen
inside whatever since at the parenthesis
so case one but right in case it's going
to be equal to one which means the right
now max is checking if this statement
down here is equal to one if it is equal
to one I want to say :
I'm gonna go and jump down to the next
line I want to set day equal to Monday
like so I'm going to go down to the next
line and what we need to make sure to do
here is we need to include something
called a break now a break is something
we have to do each time we end off one
of these conditions or one of these
cases we have inside the switch
statement so now that we have case one
we can actually go and create case
number two so I'm gonna say case 2 which
means that if this data appears equal to
two then it needs to run whatever is
inside these this case down here so I'm
gonna say : next line and then I'm gonna
go ahead and set the equal to Tuesday if
I can access pel that as da y and off
the line of code down and break so I'm
gonna go ahead and fill out one case for
each day of the week so I'm just gonna
go ahead and copy paste what we have
here I'm gonna paste it down and I'm
gonna go ahead and change the case to
three I'm gonna change the text to
Wednesday then I'm gonna go and copy it
down again change the case two for
Thursday
like so then we have case five which is
going to be equal to Friday and then the
last one or at least the two last ones
down here just kind of couldn't comment
down really quick it's going to be six
and zero because sunday is equal to zero
when we want to get the day so it's not
equal to seven okay so I'm gonna go and
change these days really quick I'm gonna
say Saturday and Sunday because remember
Sunday is zero when we do actually get
the day of a new date object okay so
right now we have seven different cases
here but one thing we need to make sure
we do is the last case doesn't need to
have a break at the end so I'm just
gonna go and remove that because the
break right now is obsolete meaning that
whenever we hit a break is gonna stop
the code from running into the next case
but because we don't have any other
cases after case number zero it's just
gonna go and stop the code automatically
so we don't need a break it's it's
completely obsolete so right now we have
a bunch of different cases here and just
like with the if statement we had
something called an else statement
meaning that if one of these were not
true then it just go ahead and run
whatever the last statement was which
was an else statement like the one we
talked about in this episode we also
have something similar to an else
statement that just runs a specific code
if none of these statements are true
so after case zero I'm just gonna go and
run down to the next line and I'm gonna
go ahead and create something called
default which is basically just going to
be the default one is gonna run if none
of the cases are true so I'm just gonna
go ahead and say we have de which is
equal to I don't know question mark just
to make it funny which basically just
runs this code down here if the switch
doesn't know which day it is so one
thing to bear in mind is that because we
removed the break from case zero because
we didn't have anything underneath the
case zero because we just included the
default one of course right now we're
gonna have to include the break again
because it's on the last piece of code
we don't need to have a break in so I'm
gonna save this and right now if I were
to go
inside my browser refresh you guys can
see it says it is Wednesday because
right now it's actually checking the
current date which is equal to three and
because case number three says day is
equal to Wednesday it's gonna go out and
spit out Wednesday inside the browser
now of course right now you could change
this into anything meaning that I could
also go inside my sir would actually say
if variable day is a specific case then
we can also run a specific code so I can
actually go ahead and go into a variable
day set it equal to Wednesday because
there's Wednesday today where I am
witness day and right now if day is
actually equal to Wednesday we're gonna
go ahead and check down here if it is
equal to Wednesday then it's gonna go
ahead and run whatever is down here so
it's actually going to go ahead and say
day is going to be changed to you know
hey or something else instead so right
now if I were to actually go inside the
browser because right now it is
Wednesday because day is equal to
Wednesday the switch is going to spit
out the first case what actually goes in
it says what is day well case number one
says if it's Wednesday you need to
change day to this so inside my browser
because we inserted the day down here
it's going to go ahead and say it is hey
so we can also go ahead and check for
Strings inside these cases here it
doesn't have to be numbers it can be
true and false statements like a boolean
it can be all kinds of data we can
insert inside the switch so we could
actually say if they is equal to
Wednesday then it's going to go ahead
and say if this is actually true then
should spit out hey if it's false then
should spit out
no so right now if we were to actually
delete all these you know things we have
down here we have a bunch of cases I'm
just going to remove all of them like so
remove the last break because we don't
need it right now if I were to go inside
the browser it is still gonna say hey
because this is going to be true but if
I were to change the word into something
else right now
can be false meaning that's gonna change
it to no so a switch statement can do a
bunch of things and it's basically just
an extension of an if-else if-else
statement you know just a much simpler
way to do it depending on how you feel
like using it it's really up to the
application you're building which one is
the most optimal to use so hope you guys
enjoyed this episode and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
