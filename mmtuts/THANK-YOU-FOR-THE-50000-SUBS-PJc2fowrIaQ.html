America stmas I wish you a Merry
Christmas I wish you a Merry Christmas
and a Happy Happy New Year who has a
stack of them happening here okay that's
another singing what did we call him in
golf yeah my girlfriend sitting over
there she's not talking she's just
making sure that the dogs in place
because we have two dogs we have villa
sitting right there looking at me
confused about me dancing to bingo and
then we have another dog that's in her
cage right now because she just went
outside for a walk with my girlfriend
and it's raining right now so you might
be able to hear a little bit of rain in
the background do the points cuz we hit
50,000 subscribers in the channel now
I'm not I'm not really sure what to do
for 50,000 subscribers so I thought that
well first of all to take a crappy
webcam that doesn't have very good
quality well mostly because of like we
spent the past many minutes trying to
figure out how to make the quality
better and it's simply because the
lighting in here is not very good it's
evening right now so it's stark outside
the everything has been windows are
closed off and everything so people
can't see in and if you follow up my
block tutors you'll know that we live in
a camper we went from an expensive
apartment to to the camper to get rid of
all the fields and everything because we
couldn't afford it so now we're just
sort of living out on the countryside
next to next to a fishing lake so it's
actually quiet it has a good view I'll
make another vlog episode just showing
off the area that we live in because
some of you guys wanted us to do a
couple of log episodes now and then just
to you know
to make things more personal so what I
thought we could do for 50,000
subscribers now you don't know a lot
about me personally other than some of
the issues we had with the apartment and
moving and you know issues with
uploading schedules because I had to to
work too much and so I thought it'd be
really fun idea to just share one thing
with you guys which is that I am a crazy
chilli lover when it comes to food and
my girlfriend actually a couple of
months ago bought me this chili called
the Reaper chili hot sauce you guys can
see it here if you can actually see it
for the the quality on on the camera we
didn't eat some of it and it's a you
know it's just we took like if you had a
huge pot of sauce like meat sauce we
would just take like a small Kim's in
there cuz it's it's incredibly spicy so
we thought that for 50,000 subscribers I
would try and and test my spicy
lovingness to the fullest and then try
and eat four chickens we wanted to get
like you know like hot wings but we
couldn't find them at the store so we
bought like you know like chicken
tenders or something like that instead
and we're gonna just have a lot of chili
on it and then I'm gonna eat for them
and and see if I can actually cuz I
should be good at eating chili but I
don't know when it actually comes to it
if I can do it my girlfriend has her
he's a chicken too and she talked about
doing this with me and she chickened out
right before we had to record the winner
said I like the left by chili so she got
that you know like the typical they call
it you know like watch it's chili they
usually put on like nachos or something
so I'm stuck with the spicy one because
I'm just gonna try and pour some one day
maybe I should let my girlfriend do it
cuz if I do it myself I might chicken
out and not put enough on it well she
actually suggested that I should have
like a lot to drink next to me
would you have anything left I can't see
it oh we have like we had up till here
and others I got like the bottom left of
its everything is pouring out maybe now
that's thinking about it is what kind of
Chili's is it I think it's just called
the reaper chili made with a reaper
peppers so it should be pretty spicy I
think you know if we just put that much
in our meat sauce it's almost too much
for us to eat so so worst thing is I was
I was actually hungry before we started
because we have no food no fridge so I'm
basically eating my dinner now good so
you don't have anything left afterwards
and it's just really really spicy oh
yeah that's it tells me to dip it even
further into the sort of plate oh my god
is so spicy I do it hmm
I do have some soda next to me just in
case it gets too spicy she says it's
embarrassing that I'm already
now you can't have this the dog is
looking at me hungry I am eating it I
did go to I went to a restaurant once
where they had like they had you could
you could order Mexican food and I know
I'm supposed to look at the camera you
could get like Mexican food and if you
want it
Nicko bring out chillies like actual
chillies like some of the hottest in the
world and that's right it and I spent
the next hour walking back and forth
outside the restaurant because my my
stomach just couldn't take it I was
actually physically hurting I was going
through the plate now he's played oh my
god I have three left's I need to have
it ready I'm going to have it ready now
I'll put it back again yes you're
welcome in your mouth you care
she's asking me to talk while I'm eating
this oh my god I have to drink something
I have to drink something like my lips
are burning I didn't know it didn't get
better just pasta Chile around my mouth
okay so I'll take this you're gonna take
this chance here to do a bit of talking
about the channel because it is there's
some new things happening to our channel
right now like we have a new logo I used
to do I used to do rainbow you tend to
wipe my hand okay I'll take some time to
promote the channel so right now there's
a new logo in the channel you guys may
notice it's like everything's burning
like my mouth
am i inside of my mouth I can't already
tell my stomach it's not but I feel good
about this afterwards
okay so I did a for the past six months
so a year the town has been changing
yourself quite drastically have they met
my girlfriend I did at the do too but
much more at a much more serious level
than I did before
like it used to just be like a hobby
because my family told me that that it
wasn't something you could actually do
for a living then I met my girlfriend
who was very supportive about it and I
started changing the content and making
it more professional painting the
thumbnail taking there I really want to
open this it's changing I forgot what I
was saying
painting the the look of the entire
channel after we moved here and I could
start doing you to full-time I've been
taking a lot of time to try to come up
with with a schedule for the videos
because there has to be some sort of
fixed schedule during the week so I had
to figure out what exactly people were
watching the videos and whenever would
fit me to upload them I've also been
painting some things for the past couple
of days such as logo and I set up a
patreon account which you guys suggested
I should do after my last couple of walk
at the search where I talked about you
know us moving here and you know not
being able to make a living of just you
know all the work that I had to do with
that was that was the reason behind I
couldn't make the videos on time so now
I changed quite a few things I've made a
patreon where you guys can go in and all
the lesson materials that I had on my
videos that you guys could download for
free
I made part of patreon now so you guys
will still have all the videos and
everything nothing is going to change
about the quality of the video some of
you guys were a bit concerned about that
and when I uploaded my eh own video
today I think or tomorrow depending on
when I make this video but I just wanted
to show everybody that it's not going to
the quality of the content I'm not gonna
cut off some part of the content say
well you want the rest of it then go to
patreon and pay for it
you know patroness only used to do extra
that you guys might want to have so if
you guys want the lesson files for the
video then you can pay a small amount
every month and then you can get access
to both lesson files that we'll have
even better descriptive details about
what's in the video like what's going on
and you know much more descriptive than
than the video at least I'm trying to
make it better than the video it's
always going to be updated in case
something changes in the programming
languages and such Oh God
you keep telling me to eat more it's not
just the spiciness it's just the taste
of it I think the taste of all the
overwhelming chilli is just a lot I am
also when you pay that small fee every
month you will also get a chance to
download the actual videos from YouTube
so you can actually have them stored in
your computer children I have to go on
YouTube each time you want to see it and
you don't need internet to see it if
you're I don't know traveling by train
or something you need access to it and
you always have it in the computer which
is nice besides that I also offer just
if you guys want to donate a bit then I
have a $1 donation per month thing going
on in there as well which is to support
our living here and I'm also gonna
inside the patreon trying to offer some
promotional things in case you guys want
to promote yourself and because I'm not
gonna be tough to fill double you just
have to our YouTube channel from scratch
and it just gives you a chance if you
want to get seen on my channel a way for
me to earn a little bit more and a way
for you guys to promote yourself so okay
so I just wanted to to just really
quickly talk about patreon because it's
new thing and it's something that you
guys have been telling me I should do
and I knew about patreon before
I just didn't set up a picture because I
didn't think my content was worth it but
with you guys supporting I finally
decided to do it and of course in my
broken support as well
oh my god I think my lips are like look
at how rich they are they think that's
from Chile it's 50,000 subscribers you
have to eat everything
Ethan quick Anton sees the one who's
gonna sleep next to me tonight so it's
not just me who's gonna get to feel the
the afterburn of what's going on here so
yeah and it's cold if there's something
I don't like it's cold food it's okay
you can do some gosh our mouth is okay
there's no count as eating it I can't do
the last one
I feel better to do that one I know it
just makes everything work but it gets
to taste out I'm disgusting oh my god my
stomach
yeah
you can eat it I like spicy food can't
do the rest I can't do an arrest she's
saying honey
honey eat the rest of it 50,000
subscribers if she was here right now
she would not be eating half of one of
them oh my god I need more to drink no
no no if I I think if I take a piece of
paper put it here the kids can't see
there's one left oh my god this is so
bad we have an artificial fireplace it's
not real fire in case you guys ho my god
I'm lightheaded I feel like I could
actually pass out I'm not gonna puke no
oh my god I'm lightheaded
like - everything's spinning I'm not
even kidding no there's no way that last
piece is going down no stop it I'm not
gonna do it how I might actually faint
like I'm not even kidding like
everything's spinning
I might even faint so I just want to say
that I'm really grateful for 50,000
subscribers when I started for channel I
never thought it was actually gonna make
to 50,000 subscribers this is Bella
I don't have to realize this is one of
the dogs she's waving she once was he
didn't want to be part of the video but
I asked her to draw the attention away
from me yeah she's not used to getting
picked up when I met her the first time
my girlfriend got him from a place where
they didn't really treat her well so she
was scared of people and that's one we
have an extra lighting over here
she's right burned herself so she's
really awkward when I'm holding my like
she looks really uncomfortable has
YouTube not new skin picked up and it's
actually it's actually 2 o'clock a.m.
right now as we're doing this for you I
didn't even mention that so we're
sitting in the middle of the night hour
I added tweet on Twitter again if you
guys want to see any cancellations and
what like cancellations but if I miss an
upload because I'm busy with something
regarding the channel you can you I'll
let you guys know on Twitter oh god and
you guys can can you know any any news
is gonna be on there Oh same time
something really important yeah over the
past many days I've been up to about 4
a.m. 5 a.m. some some days because I was
busy working creating the the content
for patreon so our day routine has
completely shifted we stay up at night
now for some reason so we we sleep so
like 12 a.m. no 4 p.m. it's called we
stay up till 12 o'clock
well we sleep till 12 o'clock and then
we stay up so for clogging night and
that's just our routine now so we need
to paint it and actually we're not gonna
go to bed now because I'm totally my
body is just on fire right now cuz of
their chili I'm not gonna go to bed now
but we want to we want to
around our day schedule again I think
it's actually getting better no nothing
no no no no I'm not gonna eat the last
piece like I'm I can actually feel a
nosebleed coming up because of the chili
she really doesn't want to behold you
said almost meat-free ders is sitting
over there her Kate's just getting
herself ready by my girlfriend's getting
her then Villa and and Mesa that's the
cat so when I met my girlfriend she had
Bella and she had Mesa which is careful
it's hot so this is music my
girlfriend's cat our cat now she is a
bit overweight I'm surprised I can even
hold her and the funny thing is that we
don't even feed her like she's actually
like she's just like on a diet
he's been on a diet for the past year
and she's still oh wait she's really
sweet
she catches on mice outside that's my
might be why she eats a lot more than
what we hit her
she's really sweet and she doesn't do
anything right now we have another cat
living next to us and it's like it's
very territorial so Miss is always
fighting the other cat that we called
the grey cat so we have to like in the
middle of the night when she is outside
we have to run out and get her and you
know so when they were fighting in the
middle of the night we have to run out
and fetch her and take her back inside
like fight off the other cats just so
you guys are prepared there's a huge
personality difference between Bella and
Frieda which is my dog like Villa it's
like very shy and like oh don't touch
that and Frieda is so happy all the time
and really really really enjoys
attention yeah yeah yeah you came back
up daddy don't eat don't eat only dad
don't eat the chili
have to be careful a couple of days ago
for the first time ever she just like
jumped up and caught the food in my hand
I was handing it over to my girlfriend
when shaking because she's excited she
thought she was going to sleep because
he was in a cage
she piece on the floor at night that's
why she has like a big gate she can she
can sleep in so see you see so excited
so she's shaking right now she's super
excited and happy to empty sturdy coz he
was playing in mud when my girlfriend
Walter there's evening so yeah so I'd
like to like just to just talk about
what we live right now like our daily
routine is I wake up at noon right now
at least I go out in my office which is
in a tent we actually all ordered a tent
from the US which is a new type of
tending can't get in the US that has
like sound isolation and it's like heat
proof so even though it's winter right
now it's ice cold outside like like
Frost degrees out there kidding what do
you call those in English before winter
been there been there and such a good
talk so our routine is that we wake up I
go out and work pretty much how many
hours a day do I wait on YouTube like 12
hours I work 12 hours a day a day to to
get YouTube ready and it's not just
recording like it's it's doing
everything it's see you up like
basically promoting the channel in in
various ways that people can find me on
YouTube I actually got a comment a
couple of days ago that was that I
thought was kind of funny a person wrote
a complaint to me saying that if he was
searching on a PSP tutorial that was not
related to anything that I had made yet
I would still pop up on YouTube and he
didn't think that was a good thing
because he couldn't find what he was
searching for so I guess my 12 hours a
work a day has been paid off of it
so yeah so I'm out there 12 hours a day
working in order to do all sorts of
things for YouTube and not just creating
videos I did actually try to record
today for you too I have to upload in
two days
and today's but just been horrible I was
sitting out there for literally five
hours because it was it was raining
there was planes driving by like flying
over my head and there was like traffic
and that's just oh don't touch that it's
hot we have a light bulb here to create
more lighting it's warm and the dark
like sniffing it yeah so oh it's a thing
I'm seeing something really important
those planes going by and everything so
I couldn't record the episode today
which is a really long episode it's
building an entire website well done the
entire website but a lot of a website
using HTML CSS so no don't step on that
so it just didn't happen today because
there was a lot of interruptions so I
hope that I will be able to make it in
in a few days or so yeah so just to
finish off the video I just want to say
that we have our camper here
it's almost ready because we have my
office set up out in the in the front in
the in the front end is actually a tent
with in a tent my girlfriend she spends
her day in here working doing her thing
and everything is almost set up and once
it's set up and it's ready I can
actually do this for a small block at
the so just showing off at the camper
and where we live so you guys can see
what we're actually living and to see
what kind of weird alternative way I'm
likes to do that I've built in order to
record the videos it's it's kind of a
fun thing the people who made the ten
also contacted me I wanted to to see
what I made with the tent because it was
sort of a weird thing to fill the studio
out in the wilderness using a tent so no
I'd like to show you guys once a once
everything's ready and and I can do that
so okay so I think I'll end it
oh yeah one more thing if you guys like
to see the lockup so for me it doesn't
have to be me sitting here with
Christmas tree and engulf and you know
eating chilies but this tip you guys
like to see just a short video from time
to time with me you know something
happens here maybe something funny
happens with the dogs or no just to make
a channel move to see den like you know
to see how Denmark looks like when we're
out in the city and stuff go ahead and
and leave a like or I'm in the comments
and we'll do more that sort of thing you
know just - Merry Christmas I should
also say my girlfriend has been saying
from the beginning remember to say Merry
Christmas will Christmas people we
decorate for Christmas and we celebrate
Christmas all year long so you know
we're like those annoying type of people
who celebrate Christmas way too early
and we also have a calendar here before
we're celebrating Christmas we have a
bunch of calendars for the dogs and
everything so okay and the cat and the
cat so enough talking I hope you guys
enjoyed this video please people please
do leave a like and let me know in the
comments if you guys want to see more
this sort of thing you know hopefully
with better quality like I do have a
camera but it's not the best camera I
actually think the webcam is better at
recording so we just stuck with the
webcam today and try recording with it
yeah before like really good vlogging
becomes a thing I would like to do like
a recording of themselves like right
before each episode to sing hey we're
gonna do this today and you know but
right now the money isn't up for it for
a decent camera so no in the future
might be a thing so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I'll see you guys
next time wait at the wave can't see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
