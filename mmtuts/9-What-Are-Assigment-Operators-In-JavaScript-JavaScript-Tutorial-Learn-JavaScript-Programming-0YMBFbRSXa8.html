about something called operators inside
the other script and for this episode
we're going to talk about the type
called assignment operator now the basic
idea behind assignment operators is that
we can actually go ahead and add a value
to a existing variable so let's say I
have a variable called X which is equal
to 10 and I want to add or subtract or
multiply some kind of number to the
existing value the way we can do that is
we can actually go ahead and write X is
equal to 10 which is up here plus 5
because in this case I want to add 5 to
the existing value now this can actually
be written in a different way which is
better if you're lazy as a programmer
which is essentially mum take X and we
say plus equal to 5 these two lines of
code does the exact same thing and the
part of the equations here that is
actually the assignment operator is the
equal sign and a plus equal sign so
these symbols here are actually what
some operators are now the way this down
here works is that we take a new value
like the one we have up here and we add
it to the value of x that's that's
basically what the plus symbol is doing
is just taking X and saying okay we need
to do something to X in this case we're
adding five we can also go ahead and say
we want to multiply like so or divide or
subtract whatever you want to do and
then just going to go ahead and use the
assignment operator to do that thing to
X so that's the basic idea behind
assignment operators and I'm not going
to spend too much time about this
because it's fairly simple just like the
previous episode so now we talked about
operators and we can actually start
getting into some of the more fun stuff
I guess inside JavaScript so I hope you
guys enjoyed this episode and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
