something called variables inside the
other script and variables you will be
using all the time inside JavaScript so
it's quite important to learn about
variables now when it comes to variables
it's slightly different than if you know
a bit of PHP so even if you know PHP you
should follow along this lesson just to
see what the differences are now a
variable is basically when you said
something equal to some kind of data to
give you guys an example I can actually
go ahead and create a variable here by
writing Y and then the name of the
variable which could be for example
person I'm just making this up so right
now what we did here was we said okay
we're going to declare a variable called
person which means we're creating a
variable called person every time you
create a variable for the very first
time you have to write var in front of
the name like I did here so right now we
have a variable but it's not equal to
anything yet we haven't actually set
equal to some kind of data so if I were
to go after the name person say equal to
some kind of string which by the way is
some kind of text I can actually set
this variable equal to Daniel so right
now this variable has a value now
there's another way we can actually do
this because we could actually declare a
variable right now I can just go ahead
and declare this as I don't know dog for
example close it off so now I've
actually declared this variable but it
doesn't have a value yet but because I
already declared the variable I can
actually go ahead and go down to the
next line for example and say dog is
equal to Lita which is the name of my
dog by the way there you go so right now
we declared the variable and then we
gave it some kind of value so you can do
it either of these two ways but as you
guys can see the basic idea here is that
IMAX is storing information inside these
variables so can actually use two
variables later on for functions or
methods that we might create at some
point which
I'm actually talked about yet but that's
why it's so important we learn about
various variables before we actually
continue talking about functions and
that sort of thing now one thing I want
to mention which you shouldn't learn
about yet but it's just a good thing to
know is that you can store multiple
pieces of information inside one
variable and you can do that by actually
creating an object now a variable can
become an object and you know by doing
that we can store many pieces of data
let's say person has a name and a AIDS a
gender you know a certain height we
could store all that information inside
one object which would actually be a
variable we turn into an object but for
now we're just going to go ahead and
stick with learning about variables here
now just to kind of show you guys if I
were to document right which we learn
about in one of the previous episodes
something inside our browser I could
actually go ahead and say okay you have
a variable up here called person just
going to go and copy the name of the
variable and insert it inside our
document right if I save this go into
the browser refresh you guys can see it
says Daniel because variable person is
equal to Daniel if I were to take
variable dog save it refresh you guys
can see it's called freedom so this is
the basic way we can actually create a
variable and you just need to remember
that the first time you create the
variable you have to use var later on
you don't actually need to use var
anymore because you already declared it
so everything underneath here we can
actually go and say okay well what if we
want to do something with this variable
let's say I have a variable here let's
actually go and delete all this stuff
let's say I have a variable called
number one maybe equal to one so now I
have a different type of data now we
have a number so that actually need to
use the quotation marks then I have a
second variable which is called number
two which is equal to two if I were to
you know write a function that does
something with these here I can actually
go ahead and say
a what we don't even need to write a
function we can actually go ahead and
just go inside our document right down
here and we can say number one plus
number two and we don't accept the right
value in here even though we could do it
because we're not declaring it
we already declared it up here we can
save this and we get three because one
plus two is equal to three okay so
that's the basic idea behind variables
we will get more into this whoops like
an ecstasy I forgot a semicolon there we
will be talking more about variables
later on and how to make objects out of
them and do more complicated things but
for now just know that this is a
variable so if you guys enjoyed this
episode and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
