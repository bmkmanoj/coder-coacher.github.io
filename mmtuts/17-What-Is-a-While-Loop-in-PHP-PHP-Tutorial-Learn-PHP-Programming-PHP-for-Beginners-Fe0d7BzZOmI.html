something called a loop inside PHP and a
loop is something I'm going to use quite
often when you code PHP code so my
thought was for this episode we're going
to do an introduction to what loops are
and we're going to talk about the first
loop which is called a while loop at
least the first one I'm going to talk
about now there's different types of
loops out there and as you guys can see
that actually lists a couple examples
here well I did actually list all the
examples here we have something called a
while loop do-while loop for loop and a
for each loop so the one we're going to
focus on today like I said it's the one
called a while loop now the basic idea
behind a loop is that well let's look at
it this way if you have an if statement
we're basically checking if a certain
condition is true and then we're doing
something on the screen like for example
writing out hello in an echo now a loop
is going to keep spitting out
information and repeat it like
repeatedly spit out information as long
as a condition is true so to give you
guys an example let's actually go ahead
and write out a while loop down here so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
and write while parentheses curly
brackets and then inside my parentheses
we need some kind of statement that we
need to check if it's true so for this
example let's actually go ahead and say
we have a variable called X which needs
to be less than 5 now right now we don't
actually have X set to anything so I'm
actually going to I'm actually going to
go ahead and create a variable up on top
called X which is equal to 1 so inside
this while loop we need to write
something that needs to happen on the
screen while this statement in here
keeps being true so for this example
let's actually go ahead and echo out
some text and I'm just going to go ahead
and echo out hi there now I'm going to
go ahead and include a break so we go
down to the next line because we will
actually be looping out a couple of
sentences here so let's actually go and
include a HTML break and we did actually
talk about that in the last episode I
think two episodes ago or was the last
episode I don't remember but if we do
actually include HTML tags inside a
string
then we can actually see the text as
actual code if you're echoing it out
inside PHP so if I save this now what I
have here is something called it's
something called an infinite loop and
it's not something that you want to have
because right now X is equal to one and
if I were to say okay while X is equal
to one or like while X is lesser than
five which is going to be the whole time
it's just spit out hi there if I were to
run this in the browser right now it's
going to keep spitting out infinitely hi
there and that's what we call an
infinite loop so we don't want that
inside the browser since it can
essentially crash your computer so what
I recommend you guys to do is to always
check for these and loops you always
want to make sure this condition in here
will end at some point so underneath our
echo we're going to go and write
something we talked about pretty early
on in these PHP episodes which is
basically that we're going to say that
we're going to take our variable called
X plus plus meaning that once we go down
to the bottom of this you know whatever
is going on in here then it needs to add
1 to X meaning that while it loops
through this the first time X is equal
to 1 but when it gets to the end here
it's going to be equal to 2 meaning that
when we start over X is equal to 2 and
it's going to keep doing that until it
becomes 4 where when it hits 5 it's
going to be equal to 5 meaning that's
going to stop because now X is actually
greater than lesser than 5 so let's
actually go ahead and loop this out on
the screen and just see what happens and
as you guys can see we get hi there hi
there hi there and hi there 4 times now
if I were to set this less than or equal
to 5 of course we would have one more
because now we do actually say that it
can also be 5 but this is the basic idea
behind a while loop now again like I
said there's different kinds of loops
and you might want to use them depending
on different purposes now with databases
I usually like to use while loops in a
lot of cases now I do also use two other
loops as well but in a lot of cases I
mostly used a while loop which is why I
think you guys to get really familiar
with the while loop specifically because
we will be using it once we do actually
learn how to set
for example locking system that sort of
thing from the database so this is the
basic idea behind a loop and it's really
not that complicated the most
complicated thing about loops is
memorizing what each of these loops
actually does and when you need to use
them in certain situations so this is
the basic idea behind a while loop so
hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
