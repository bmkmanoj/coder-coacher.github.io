use the login system we created in the
previous episode in order to change up
some of the content we have inside our
website here now as you guys can see we
do actually have to login field the very
top here we also have a message that
tells us if we're actually logged in or
not and the next step would actually be
to change up some of the content we want
to show if we're locked in and then tell
it not to show it if we're not locked in
now there's a difference though because
the comments section down here we can
actually type stuff and actually submit
it is a lot easier to change then the
buttons we have down here which says
delete and edit because the comments
section just need to show if you're
logged in so if there's any kind of ID
inside our session then it needs to show
it whereas the buttons down here needs
to only show if there is a session ID
inside the session and it matches up
with the user who actually posted that
specific comment so in this episode
we're just going to focus on tinting up
this text area here in order to make it
match you know if you're logged in or
not so the first thing I'm going to do
is we're going to open up our code and
we're actually going to go to our index
of PHP file and go down to where we
actually wrote the message that tells us
if we're locked in or not because
essentially we're going to do the exact
same thing here with our comment area so
I'm going to copy this go down to my
form text area this is actually the one
we type in we want to write a post and
we're going to go ahead and paste in our
if statement right below our PHP opening
tag so what we need to do now is we're
going to go and copy our entire form
that we have down there and then delete
it and then we're going to go ahead and
go in between what we say if we do
actually have a session set echoed this
down here and we're just going to paste
it in like so now if we're not logged in
we need to come up with some other kind
of message right now it says you are not
logged in because we actually copy
pasted but we could actually write that
you need to be logged in to comments
now I would like to discuss doing this
method that we just did here where we
simply said you had to be logged in or
not because we could essentially also
have another forum down here where when
you start writing in it and then you
submit the actual posts then just going
to come with an error message saying oh
you have to be locked in before I can
actually post now doing it that way is
possible because we could essentially
when we hit the submit button save the
information of what the person actually
wrote inside the text area and then when
we send him back to the front page then
re-enter the same text inside the text
area because if we don't do that then
he's going to lose all the text he just
spent time writing maybe he didn't even
realize that he wasn't locked in so from
a usability point of view that doesn't
seem like a very good idea in my head so
that's why I recommend doing it this way
where we actually just give them an
error message saying you have to be
logged in in order to comment which is
also a lot quicker to actually do so
there's some good sides to doing it this
way so if you go back to the website
let's actually make sure we actually
saved everything
I did refresh the website well we do
actually need to reset there we go
and now I can actually see down here we
have a message that says you need to be
locked in in order to comment but it's
right now floating to the right side
which we need to fix as well by
inserting a break but right now because
we're not locked in it's showing this
let's actually go and fix the floating
thing so if we go back into our code I'm
going to go ahead and insert a break
right after the iframe let's actually
interrupt - and the same thing below
let's actually do that inside here there
we go
refresh and as you guys can see now the
Texas down here instead now who do
actually go up and lock in so our
username was admin a post password was
one two three four login you can see now
it actually shows the comment area which
is quite nice so that's basically how
need to do this and it's not really
difficult to do as you guys can see and
if you have any kind of content inside a
website that needs to change if you're
logged in or not this is the way to do
it so it's very simple to do and like I
said some information that needs to be
shown the website if you're logged in
let's say you have a user page of the
user when he's actually locked in that
specific users information and you know
thumbnail or you know profile image that
sort of thing needs to be connected to
his actual user account meaning that we
need to do the same thing in order to
fix that as we would need to do down
here where we have to delete and edit
buttons so that we're going to talk
about how to in the next episode
and then afterwards undoing that I think
we'll start talking about how to
actually reply to out the post that you
haven't actually written yourself so
that's basically it for today it's a
really short episode I hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
