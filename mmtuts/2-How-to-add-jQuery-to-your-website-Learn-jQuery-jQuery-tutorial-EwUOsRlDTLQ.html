jQuery inside our websites because in
the previous episode we talked about
Jacob being a framework or or we call a
library so going to need to download the
library before we can actually use
jQuery inside our code so the first
thing we're going to do is I'm going to
go and open up my browser and inside my
browser I'm going to go ahead and go to
jquery.com and inside dickard calm you
guys can see you can actually download
take you over here the right side so I'm
going to go and click it and inside of
here we have two options either we can
download Jaykar and include inside a
root folder or we can link to reducing a
CDN which stands for content delivery
network now the pros and cons when it
comes to downloading jQuery vs. using a
CDN network is that if I were to use a
CDN I will always have antiquary updated
because it's online and the online
version will always be updated but by
using a CDN Network I can work offline
which is what we can do if we were to
download to a career can actually go and
work on my website when I don't have
internet so you have to consider which
one you want to do now when it comes to
me I prefer using a CDN Network because
I always want my period to be updated
and most of the time when I do actually
work on websites that do have internet
so I'm going to go and use a CDN network
but I will show you guys how to download
it and how to install it the CDN way so
we're going to start out by actually
using a CDN network so what I'm going to
do here is inside this web page I am
going to scroll down to the bottom where
it says CDN which it does right here you
can get go with the CDN and we're going
to go and click on the link called code
that jQuery comm so I'm going to click
in and inside of here we can choose
which version of Jaykar we want to use
I'm just going to go and use the latest
one and I want to use the minified
version because the minified version is
going to weigh less when we do actually
use it inside our website so when it
comes to optimizing your website it's a
lot better to use the minified version I
would actually not recommend using the
uncompressed version unless you plan to
changing stuff inside jQuery so for us
beginners
we're just going to go and choose the
minified one so when I click it you guys
can see we get a piece of code I'm just
going to go ahead and copy it paste it
inside my website right underneath the
title tag we need to make sure of it
inside the head
because we wanted to load before
everything else inside the website so
I'm just going to move everything up so
it looks nice because right now
everything is on different lines like so
and like so so now we basically just
included taker using a CDN and this is
all we had to do in order to do this now
if you were to actually download theory
I'm going to go and go back inside get
calm just going to go back to a
downloads page go to the top and you
guys can see when download a couple of
versions of jQuery so I'm going to go
and click on the link here called
download the compressed version of
jQuery 3.2.1 with you guys it might say
something different because you guys
might be in the future so there might be
an update to jQuery so I'm just going to
go and click this one then you guys can
see it downloaded now after downloading
the file I'm going to go to an insert it
inside a root folders I'm going to go
and open up my group folder and inside
my root folder I'm going to go and
create a new folder so I'm going to go
and say new folder I'm going to call
this one
Jas for JavaScript code and inside my PS
folder I'm going to include all the
JavaScript files that I might have
inside my website including the jQuery
file because day curry is JavaScript so
I'm going to paste it in here after
pasting it in I'm going to go and copy
the name so if you actually have the
name of it let me go back inside my code
and if you were to delete the CDN
Network up here just to show us how to
do this manually by actually downloading
the file I'm going to go to include a
JavaScript script tag and again we don't
act need to have this type
text/javascript because we're inside
HTML 5 now it was only in the previous
version of HTML we needed to have that
so inside my script tags I'm going to go
and include a source because I'm going
to set equal to J crew - 3.2.1 dot min
dot J s because that was the name of the
file we downloaded and again we insert
it inside a JavaScript folder you'll
need to tell that we need to go inside a
JavaScript folder then forward slash
because we're digging into the folder
and then we have this file here so this
is how we can include jQuery if you were
to actually download the file now I
actually ready to
right j.crew inside of document so this
is basically what I want to show you
guys today I hope you guys enjoyed
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
