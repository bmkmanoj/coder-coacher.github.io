going to do a review of two different
screen recorders that I'm using for my
youtube channel now the reason I have
two screen recorders is that you know
depending on the purpose that I'm
recording if it's a tutorial or a
gameplay I need to use a different
screen recorder and I'm going to get
into the details about that in a second
first of all if you're interested in
doing some sort of gameplay or tutorial
recording you just ask yourself three
questions first of all the program
you're looking for is a cheap and
affordable because you want to make sure
that you don't spend a ton of money on
really expensive programs because a lot
of these program developers they really
know how to overcharge for programs when
you can get other stuff for a photo for
affordable price that is a lot better
and both these programs are affordable
they're very cheap they cost around what
is it like thirty seven dollars for
fraps and I believe it is thirty dollars
for action if you just want the home use
if you want the commercial use for
action then it's fifty dollars now the
second requirement is that is it easy to
use because I don't want to sit and
spend at least an hour
having to get to know this program
before I can start recording stuff if I
need to sit and spend a lot of time
learning to use the program I'm already
uninterested in it now both these
programs are also really easy to use
they only take a few moments to get to
know and then you can start recording
which is another good thing the third
requirement that I need to have in order
for this to work is that I need to make
sure my screen recorder course in real
time believe it or not a lot of screen
recorders out there when you want to
record something and you want to record
your audio you know in another program
next to the screen recorder if you were
to merge these properties to recordings
in post-production
sometimes in some screen recorders after
a couple of minutes the sound starts to
be off like it's not going to fit with
the
pre-recording anymore which gets really
annoying because it means that the
screen recorder either records too fast
too slow so you know both these programs
well actually there's one point I need
to get into here because fraps if you
want to use fraps this is fraps over
here on the right side of the left side
as you can see fraps is really good for
gameplay recording if you want to play
video games on your YouTube channel or
something like that and you want to you
know record it I recommend using fraps
it records completely in real time
there's no issues they're the only two
little problems I have with fraps is
that the file sizes you know the raw
file after you're done recording a
pretty big if you want to do
fraps recordings I recommend getting an
external hard disk or something to
record onto but after you're done with
post-production you know after you're
you're not done editing your clip and
stuff after you export it again the file
sizes will decrease with a lot like more
than 20% of 200% or something like that
I don't know it's going to decrease a
lot it will go from like 20 gigabytes to
500 megabyte which is a lot the other
thing about fraps is that if you're on
Windows 8 like I am fraps cannot record
your desktop this tutorial I'm doing
right here is you know my desktop I'm
not inside an application which means
that fraps cannot record this and it's
because you know perhaps has not learned
or at least you know at the moment the
people who made fraps has not you know
made it compatible with Windows 8 yet so
you know that's a big problem for me
especially because I do a lot of
tutorials there's this little feature
down here that says monitor Aero desktop
which means that it will record the
desktop but that is only if you have
stuff like I don't know Windows 7 or a
Mac or something like that for Windows 8
this is impossible at the moment at
least you would have to install some
other program that sort of you know
takes a picture of your screen or record
your screen and then you need to record
that program and you know it gets really
complicated action screen recorder will
record
Desktop no matter what which is awesome
it even has adjustable frames you can
choose which part of the desktop you
wanna record it also has where you can
go into like you know do you wanna
record gameplay and applications which
is also awesome
the only issue there like the only
downside to action the only reason I
actually do use fraps sometimes is that
if you do some video games action has an
issue with recording in real time the
worst example I have is when I play Call
of Duty and I recorded the gameplay with
the application games an application tab
here it was actually I just ended up you
know just leading the whole recording
because I couldn't every two minutes I
had to adjust my sound with my video
clip which just got really frustrating
so you really need to be careful about
you know which one you buy depending on
the purpose if you want to do tutorials
the desktop recording here that I'm
using right now not the games and
application one but the desktop one and
the one with the frames will actually
record in real time I have had no issues
with that one and like I said it's not
all games it's just a few games that
I've had issues with with real time but
it's enough to sort of ruin it so if you
want to do games I really recommend
getting fraps and not action if you want
to do games and desktop recording I
recommend doing action if you want to do
just desktop of course there's no reason
to get fraps so you can really get into
an argument here and most people will
recommend fraps and again you know if
there's a way to record desktop on
Windows 7 for example or Mac or
something like that with fraps then of
course you could choose fraps just know
that action also have more settings
depending on what you want to record and
stuff you can choose like a high setting
for like the video size how many you
know if it's 1080 pixels or what it is
so you know it has a lot more settings
you can actually see I'm recording right
now in action which makes this awesome
that's really it you can sort of take
this information and
then decide you know which program
should you get I hope I make this a
little bit more clarified for you so
that you know depending what you need to
record which one you should get of
course there's other screaming coders
out there but these are the two of like
the five screen recorders I've tried out
that works really great so you know I
hope you guys find this useful go ahead
and leave a like if you liked this video

and I will see you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
