inside JavaScript and this episodes can
be very similar to the previous one
where we talked about how to turn an
array into an object so today we're
going to talk about what exactly an
object is you know what we can use it
for and how to create them and how to
insert arrays and properties and methods
inside these objects so when it comes to
objects it's a very simple concept when
we want to create something using Java
scripts we can take similar information
for example information regarding a
person and insert them into one object
now doing it this way makes a lot easier
when you want to use that person at
least any kind of information regarding
a person inside a website and just pull
out the information and use it so the
first thing we're going to do here is
I'm going to go ahead and show you guys
how we create an object so as you guys
can see inside my code here I have a
very basic html5 set up and I have a
paragraph tag in here that has some
ideas tests and then inside the script
tags is where we're going to go ahead
and create these objects we're going to
insert the information from the objects
inside these paragraph tags so the first
thing we're going to do is we're going
to go and create an object so inside my
script tag I'm going to go and create a
variable what is it equal to some kind
of name which could be person I'm going
to set it equal to an object or at least
the information we need to put inside
this object here called person so I'm
going to say curly brackets and then
afterwards I'm going to say a semicolon
because want to end off the code and
then inside the curly brackets we're
going to go out and tell it the name of
the first property if you have inside
this person now properties are let's say
you have a person that has an age you
know a gender a hair color you know
these are properties inside this person
it's simply information that it will be
the same on every single person like you
know some kind of information that's
going to repeat itself on each person
but the values of these properties are
going to change so for example the
gender is going to change from person to
person
which may be the hair color or maybe the
hair color or the age everything is
going to change from person to person so
we're going to go ahead and create a
property here and the first one is going
to be first name I'm going to say colon
and then I'm going to go and write a
string
because a name it makes sense that is a
string going to call it Daniel which is
my name so now we have the first
property inside this object here inside
the object called person so now we can
go ahead and add new properties to it
now we can also add something called
methods and arrays to this person if you
wanted to but we're going to go ahead
and wait with that till later
so after Daniel I'm going to go and say
comma because we want to add a second
property to this person here it could
for example be an H or maybe a last name
let's actually go and do that last name
colon and then you can go ahead and set
another string as Nilsen after we have
this we can go ahead and set an 8 just
we have a couple different in meta or
needs a couple of different types of
data inside this person so I'm going to
go and say age and set to 25 just to
show you guys it doesn't have to be
inside double quotes this is just
because this is a string and 25 is just
an integer so we're just going to do
that without the double quotes so now
that we have this I want to show you
guys another format we can write this in
because if I were to go somewhere in the
internet and look up you know how to
create an object in JavaScript most
people are not going to write it in this
way you know in one line of code that
will actually go ahead and put
everything down in a couple of lines
just so it makes more sense when we look
at it like this okay so now it makes
sense that each property has its own
line
so we can change it whenever we want to
so now that we have this we can actually
go ahead and try to spit something out
inside the paragraph tag so remember
this is just a block code that keeps a
bunch of information regarding one
person of course we can have multiple
people inside this object here but we're
just going to stick with one for now so
what I'm going to go ahead and do here
is I'm going to go ahead and go down to
the next line I'm going to say documents
dot get element by ID parentheses double
quotes we're going to call this one test
because that's the idea have my
paragraph tag up here punctuation inner
HTML is equal to and then we want to set
it equal to the variable we have up here
called person are these two objects
called
I'm going to say person and then
typically in other types of programming
languages such as PHP or something else
this object up here looks very similar
to something we call associative arrays
inside you know other programming
languages but we do call this thing an
object and we want to treat it that way
meaning that when we want to get from
the data there's actually two ways we
can get the data either we can go ahead
and treat it like an associative array
even though it's not an associative
array it is an object and we can do that
by writing brackets and then inside the
brackets we can go ahead and say well
the first data up here is called
first-name so I'm just going to go ahead
and copy that and insert it inside a
string like so and then I'm going to go
ahead and end off the code here with a
semicolon and then if I go inside the
browser you guys can see they will now
get Daniel now of course this is you
know how to write out the data from an
object if you were to do the associative
array method but we're going to go ahead
and treat it like an object like I said
so we're not going to write it like this
I'm just going to go and delete it
instead we're going to go ahead and say
punctuation and then say first name like
so and this is a very simple way to get
out data from an optic as you guys can
see if i refresh the browser we get the
same data so this is how I'm going to do
it from now on just in case you guys
have any questions regarding why do we
not put it inside brackets well because
this is the way that people usually do
it now the next thing we can do with
this object up here is we can actually
go ahead and add a method to it now a
method is basically a function inside
JavaScript but we insert the function
inside an object we rename it as
something called a method so what I'm
going to going to do up here is I'm
going to go ahead and say well ask if
you have the age I'm going to go and
create a method that prints out both the
first name and the last name of this
person so each time I need to call on
this person's full name inside my
website I can just go and refer to this
method we wrote down here to just prints
out the full name so the way I'm going
to go and do that is I'm going to go
ahead and give it some kind of name you
know like we did up here with the
properties I'm going to go and call this
one full name like so and I'm going to
go and say : then we're going to say
function
because we want to say we're starting up
a function right now parentheses curly
brackets I'm just going to move it down
to the next line so we can actually see
two code inside the curly brackets just
like we did up here with the object
itself now inside the curly brackets I'm
going to go and return a piece of code
called this punctuation first name plus
double quotes which is a string I'm
going to say space inside the double
quotes because it just wants a space in
between the name plus this dot last name
semicolon so now that we have this we
can actually go ahead and print out the
full name of this person inside the
object now if you have any questions
about this it's basically we're more
inside an object we can actually go out
and instead of saying person like I
could just copy paste it down here
person first name I can just go ahead
and say this because I'm returning to
this object them inside of right now so
this is another way of doing this and
it's just a much simpler way to do it so
now I have this function here I can
actually go ahead and go down to my
inner HTML code down here and I can go
ahead and print out the full name inside
the paragraph tags so I'm going to go
and say we have the object called person
dot then I'm going to say full name
parentheses save it go inside my browser
and as you guys can see we now get the
full name when i refresh the browser so
this is how we can use functions in
sudden objects which then get renamed as
a method now the last thing I'm going to
show you guys is how to use arrays
inside objects because you know of
course it makes sense to have more
information there's one thing inside
this person let's say I also have a pet
or at least I have multiple pets and I
want to write the names of all the pits
I have inside this person so the next
thing I'm going to do after the age is
I'm going to go ahead and say that I
have pets colon space or well doesn't
really matter if you have space or not
then after the colon just like inside a
race I'm just going to go and say
bracket which means that when I was
starting up an array then I can insert
data inside
it's here so I'm going to say the first
one is going to be Frieda
which is actually my dog's name I'm
going to say have another pet by saying
comma after Frieda and the second path
is going to be Bella then after Bella
I'm going to go ahead and say I have a
third pet called Mesa which is the name
of a cat so if I go ahead and save this
well we do need to add a comma
afterwards because this is not the last
piece of data inside this object save it
I can actually go down will be printed
out the message down here change it and
say we have pets brackets then I'm going
to say zero because you want to get the
first data inside this object here this
inside the array of this object here now
do bear in mind just like in other
coding languages and I have mentioned
this before that when we use brackets
like this inside a raised zero is going
to be the first data and then from there
on you start counting one two three four
and so on so it's always going to be
zero one two okay so right now inside
the browser you should be getting
freedom like so if I were to go back
change it to a - we should get Mesa
inside the browser like so and this is
how we can print out data from an object
and this is just a very cool way of
saving information on you know a lot of
data regarding one person this could be
anything from a car to you know a house
or a country you know information what
to say regarding these objects and it's
this really cool way of doing things so
if you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
