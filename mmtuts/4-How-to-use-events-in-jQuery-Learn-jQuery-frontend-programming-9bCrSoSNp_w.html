something called an event inside theory
and an event is basically when the user
goes to a website and does something and
then after doing it something happens
inside the website so when this does
actually happen we usually say that an
event has been fired so we're going to
talk about these events in this episode
and there's actually quite a few with
them there's actually a lot of events
inside geekery so we're not going to
talk about all of them but just going to
take a few examples so you guys know
exactly what events is now in case you
guys interested in learning about the
other event you have inside daiquiri I'm
going to go and even link the
description so you guys can take that
out afterwards now in summer website you
have made a few examples in order to
show you guys what exactly an event does
inside a website so if I want to go
inside my website we're going to go and
actually do it first and then afterwards
I'm going to show you guys the code so
inside my website you guys can see I
have a few examples of paragraphs and
each paragraph has a piece of text now
we were to actually do what the text
tell us to do you guys will notice that
the text will actually disappear once we
do so so we're were to go to the first
one that says hover me if it were to
hover you guys can see it disappears if
we were to click on the next one that
says click me
it disappears if we were to double click
the next piece of text like it says so
it disappears now the next one access
says leave me alone which means that
okay I'm going to go and move my cursor
outside the text and it disappears so we
can do a bunch of stuff when it comes to
jQuery when it comes to these events and
it's not only when we use the mouse or
something we can also do stuff when we
use the keyboard or if you were to do
something with the form inside a website
there's a bunch of things we can
interact with in order to do something
inside a website using jQuery now the
last one here says press Enter and just
to serve as an example it doesn't
involve making stuff disappear I'm going
to go ahead and show you guys what
happens when I click enter and as you
guys can see now we've got our
navigation inside the website so we're
to click enter again it disappears so we
can keep doing this if you want to
inside this little example here but the
main point is that we can do stuff using
events so who wants to go inside the
code just sir gosh the events that I
chose inside of my document here now
again I'm just going to take it from the
top because as you guys can see
include the Stasi because had to style
the navigation need to show gas at the
ends and then also went ahead and
included the navigation that you guys
saw and again this is not Jaykar it is
just basic HTML but just so you guys
don't get confused about you know
where's the navigation at it's inside my
HTML documents okay now this down here
is actually what we want to focus on
because these are the paragraphs that I
did stuff to in order to actually do
something so the first one here has an
ID as p1 that says however me then
inside my PA occurs down here as you
guys can see first of all I started up
by document.ready
function the basicness is inside the
Jaykar wants the website is done loading
then is to start loading all these
functions down here now the first piece
of jQuery code says I want to get an ID
called p1 which was the first one up
there and once I hover on it which is
the events then I want to do something
so the Harvard here is the event to be
fired once you did something inside the
browser now the next one down here has a
ID as p2 meaning that we're taking the
next paragraph here that has an ID as p2
and once I clicked it something needed
to happen and again I just simply hit it
from the website and the third one which
was the double-click I just included a
double click event instead and so on and
so on and so on so as you guys can see
you also have something with the mouse
there's a bunch of events that we can
use inside our code now the last example
I showed you guys with the menu is a bit
more complicated than the other ones
again it's not really complicated but if
you haven't done Cakery before it might
seem a bit complicated so the basic
thing I want to explain here is that I
did actually use an event called key
press that did something once I clicked
enter key and again it went ahead and
showed the navigation and it went ahead
and hit it after I clicked it again so
I'm not going to get too much into this
jquery function here because it's not
really relevant to today's subjects but
just to show you guys a few examples of
what exactly events are these events
this is what they do and if you guys
want to see more of them i'm going to go
ahead and leave the link in the
description and again there's so many I
can't show off everything inside this
episode number 4 anything off the
episode I want to mention one more thing
I didn't in the previous one we've
talked about syntax do you notice that
each time you write a line into a curry
code we close off the code
with the semicolon okay so this is
basically one line of code and then
inside this line of code I have a second
line of code which again I close off
with a semicolon so just to make sure
you guys remember that
make sure you close off your code
otherwise stuff is not going to work
hope you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
