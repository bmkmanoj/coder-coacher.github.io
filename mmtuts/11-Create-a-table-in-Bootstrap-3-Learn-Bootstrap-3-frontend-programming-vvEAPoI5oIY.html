tables inside bootstrap because when it
comes to bootstrap it has its own way of
creating tables in order to make sure
that our tables become responsive inside
other devices so what we have so far
inside our website is what we did in the
previous episode where we created a
banner we have a gallery and then we
have a navigation up here now what I
want to do is I want to include a table
underneath my gallery down here so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and go
inside my code inside my index file I'm
gonna go to the bottom we do actually
have the gallery which is right here and
I'm gonna go and copy the article tags
we have around the gallery because we're
gonna go and use this inside our table
as well so underneath the gallery
article I'm gonna go and copy in another
article and close it off down here like
so then inside the class of this article
we just paste it in I'm gonna change it
from index gallery to index table again
if you didn't follow the previous
episodes this article here is basically
just a container that I created this is
not part of the bootstrap formula this
is actually something that I created
okay just to be able to style the stuff
inside our bootstrap tables so now that
we have this we can actually go ahead
and include some kind of table so I'm
gonna say we have a table tag like so
just a basic HTML tag and inside the
table tag I'm gonna go and give it a
class now the class is going to be
called table so this is actually the
bootstrap styling of including here
inside the class called table so now if
I go inside the table and start creating
some data we can go and create a table
row now inside the first table row we're
gonna go and include a table header so
we're gonna say th and inside the first
one here I'm gonna go and say name just
to give you some kind of data then I'm
gonna go and copy this table header
three more times like so I'm going to
change the second one too I'm actually
gonna go ahead and call the first one
first name the second one is going to be
last name then the third one is going to
be age and the last one is going to be
eye color
like so so now that we do actually have
some headers in here we're going to go
ahead and create some data so I'm going
to copy what we have here paste it below
and instead of saying table header I'm
going to go and change these to table
data center set of t8 I'm gonna say tea
D now inside the first row I'm gonna go
ahead and say that the first name is
Daniel which is my name
the last name is going to be Nielsen the
age is going to be 26 the eye color is
going to be blue then I'm gonna copy
this table row so we have another row
inside our table and again I'm just
pointing out it's just for me to
demonstrate what we can do with
bootstrap you don't have to have two
rows inside a website table just in case
are confused one of you guys so inside
the table row inside the second one
we're gonna go and call this one Jane
then last name is going to be Doe and
the age is going to be 35 and the eye
color is going to be brown like so then
if I go inside the website refresh you
guys can see that now we get a table at
the bottom of the website now right now
the table is actually grey that's not
because the table is actually great by
default it's simply because the
background color of my website is great
just in case you guys wondering so what
I'm gonna go ahead and do here is I'm
actually gonna go ahead and change the
background color of this table down here
I'm gonna do that by going inside my
style sheet that I created myself I'm
gonna go ahead and copy the index
gallery class from the gallery section
paste it below and change the name from
index gallery to index table which is
the class who wrapped around the table
inside the index file so I can actually
save over width as a hundred percent
that's fine we want to have a background
color as white and we want to have a
padding at the top and bottom so I'm
gonna change the padding from 30 to 60
so we have 60 both places
save it refresh my browser and now you
guys can see we get some spacing and a
background color so now that we have
this I'm actually gonna go ahead and
change the layout so we don't have a
container fixed with inside the browser
why are you gonna go and use the
container which as you guys can see is
at the banner create some kind of
wrapper that all the content is inside
up so
thinking because we're using a table
it'll be better to have a container
class so back inside my index file I'm
gonna go ahead and go inside the article
tag right before we create the table and
I'm gonna go ahead and create another
dip box like so I'm gonna get the dip
tag a class name like so and call it
container so now we insert the table
inside the container we do actually get
a wrapper going around the table so I'm
just gonna go and move everything out
like so make sure that everything looks
nice like so and save it then we go
inside the website and as you guys can
see now we get a wrapper now when it
comes to the tables inside bootstrap we
do accept different stylings you can
apply to the tables using bootstraps own
classes so if I go back inside the code
go into my table I can also say we have
a second class called table
- striped the sexy make sure we spell
out correctly like so and if I go back
inside my website refresh you guys can
see that now we get a striped background
color in case you guys want to
illustrate some kind of data and to make
sure that the people watching the table
can actually distinguish the different
table rows from each other what we can
also do if I go back inside my code is I
can go ahead and give it one called
table bordered like so if i refresh the
browser you guys can see that now we get
a border around the entire table and
around the rows so now we do actually
get some kind of grid system which looks
kind of nice also if we go back inside
the code we can go ahead and include one
called
table - hover we do get this hover
effect when we hover the cursor on top
of the table so we can actually see
which row we're highlighting so as you
guys can see we do actually have quite a
few different style links we can apply
to the tables and we can combine them
just like I did here I included my table
bordered with the table hover so we can
actually combine these classes together
to get different effects now the last
one I want to show you guys is one
called table condensed at least the last
one when it comes to these stylings here
so if I go back inside my browser
refresh you guys can see that now the
cell padding's inside the table gets cut
in half so right now we get a much more
compact table which in some cases might
be better if you just want to illustrate
data and not have something that looks
nice so if I go back inside my code I'm
just gonna go ahead and go back to have
table bordered which I think looked
nicer just gonna couldn't refresh the
browser so now we looked at different
styling so we can include inside the
table but let's actually go and look at
some styles we can include inside the
cells so if I go back inside my code I
can go inside the table rows or the
table headers or data as and I can
include stylings to these as well we can
take the one containing all the headers
I'm gonna go and give this one a class
I'm gonna set the class to warning which
gives it some kind of color that
indicates a warning again it just
indicates some kind of color right now
there's no warning when it comes to
first-name lastname eights an eye color
but just to give you some kind of color
I'm gonna go and say warning and when i
refresh you guys can see we get this
yellowish color we can use all sorts of
colors we can use warning we can use
success that's actually going to include
some classes to these different table
data down here like so let's call the
first one danger you can call the second
one info you can call the third one
warning just like we had before you can
call the last one active and then if I
go back inside the website you guys can
see that now we get different colors we
get red blue yellow and dark gray and
the green color up here so we can
actually colorize our table now the last
thing I want to show you guys which is
actually something that's quite
important is that if I were to resize
this table right now you guys can see
that the table if I scroll down to the
bottom here just simply get squeezed now
we don't want to do that we actually
want this thing to become responsive
when we do resize the website so we can
actually do that using classes as well
if I were to go right before we have the
table up here and create another dip box
put the table inside of it by copying it
deleting it insert it inside the div tag
whoo everything else it looks nice and
then I'm gonna go ahead and give the dip
tag a class name I'm gonna call this one
table - responsive like so and now if I
go back inside the browser
refresh and start resizing the table you
guys will notice that it starts changing
so now that we do actually get to a
browser that's much more smaller than
the table we have we start getting this
scrollbar we can actually use so we can
scroll horizontally left and right in
order to see all the data and I know
some of you guys might be thinking well
when it comes to responsive certain all
the rows or the cells move underneath
each other to make everything go
vertically downwards well when it comes
to tables we usually use them to
illustrate data and it wouldn't make
sense if you want to have rows
indicating that that this is one
category of data we need to make sure
everything is to the side of each other
so when we do actually get much more
below what the table actually has when
it comes to a width we need to make sure
we can scroll and not make the content
jump underneath each other so this was
basically all I want to show guys when
it comes to tables I hope you guys
enjoyed I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
