installing a local server on your
computer and then this episode we're
actually going to start writing some
code in PHP so as you guys can see
before we get started I really quickly
want to mention that you should have
their patch a magical service running
inside exams control panel if you don't
have this running you won't actually see
the code we're going to write in this
episode so what we're going to do now
after we have this running we're going
to go to the browser we're going to type
localhost inside our URL and hit enter
now you guys are probably just going to
have one folder from last lesson I will
have a bunch of voltage because I do
accept more than one project but just
make sure you open up the folder you
created in the last lesson so I'm going
to open up the one I called PHP lessons
now in here you guys will notice we do
actually get a directory the reason we
get a director right now is because we
don't actually have a starting page for
our website now when it comes to
starting pages if we do actually open up
our code editor and create a new
document if I were to save this new
document as index dot HTML it would
actually recognize it as a starting page
we can also write index.php and we'll
also you know recognize this as our
starting page so it doesn't really
matter if you use index dot HTML index
dot PHP it will automatically see this
one as a starting page no matter the
extension so after we say this as index
the PHP inside our directory of course
inside our root folder inside htdocs'
then we can actually start writing code
now the thing about PHP documents is
even though we have the PHP extension we
can still write HTML and JavaScript code
in here so if I were to open up you know
just a very basic HTML 5 layout this is
just the starting layout for a new
website we have the HTML tags up here we
also have the doctype so we have the
HTML opening and closing tags we have
the body tags we have the head tags and
just a small title tag and here with two
meta tags so this is a very basic you
know starting layout for a website
inside HTML now in order to write PHP
code we need to use something called PHP
opening
closing tags now the way we write those
is by saying lesser than question mark
PHP which by the way is the opening tag
if you want to close it again
you're right question mark greater than
so everything that goes in between these
tags are going to be PHP code you should
mention that you have to write these PHP
tags if you want to write PHP code
otherwise it's not going to recognize it
as PHP code so in between these tags we
can actually start writing something and
the first thing I want to teach you guys
is how to print something on the screen
now in the last episode I did actually
show you guys an example of how to print
something I didn't really explain it
very well but I just kind of showed you
guys so we can actually write echo
inside our PHP tags which is essentially
that we echo something out on the screen
we actually write something on the
screen so I'm going to say echo space
court agent marks and then we need to
make sure we actually end the line of
code by writing semicolon at the end
kind of the same way as we do in CSS
when do you want to end off a piece of
code so in between the quotation marks
we can actually write something so this
time I'll say hi there and do notice
that Alexis belt-high correctly this
time and if we were to save this and
refresh it inside our browser you guys
will notice that when i refresh it does
actually see oh you got a index document
and it's just automatically going to
take me to it as you guys can see right
here so right now we have a piece of
text this is hi there now if I want to
write something else we can also use a
statement or like a function called
print now print does the same thing as
echo does there's a couple of
differences but right now there's not
really any important differences other
than I should point out that echo is
faster loaded inside your browser so if
you want to print some text and you want
to be fast echo is faster even though
it's very very you know little amount of
faster it is so we can actually go down
to the print and write quotation marks
again and I can actually write my name
so we'll say hello there I hide
Daniel and we need to make sure we end
up with a semicolon of course if it were
to save this refresh my browser you guys
will notice we have some text going on
now we don't have a space in between
here and that's because I do actually
need to add a space after there and then
we'll actually create the spatial mean
but these are two ways you can actually
print out stuff inside a browser now I
do want to point out since we're dealing
with text right now you guys will notice
I put what you call it quotation marks
around the text if I were to write
numbers we can actually go ahead and
eliminate the quotation marks and simply
write out some kind of number we can
write 12 for example if I save this it
will actually print out 12 so you don't
have to put it in quotation marks if
you're dealing with numbers you can if I
were to put these in quotation mark is
still with both printed out as 12 but
this time it's going to see it as a
string which is what we call it when we
put you know a line of text inside an
echo for example so right now this you
know 12 is not seen as an integer you've
seen as a string which is you know text
so this is two basic examples of
printing out stuff and we can actually
also write equations inside these echoes
so even though we did just talk about
printing out stuff I also want to show
you guys if we can actually calculate
using PHP so if I go into my echo and
say 12 let's say something simple 10
plus 5 and I save it refresh my browser
you guys will notice it as 15 because 10
plus 5 is 15 so we can also do very
basic math statements which is going to
become useful later on if you want to do
you know functions or if you want to
make statements or if you want to you
know just just do something a little bit
more complicated we will have to do a
little bit of math later on because PHP
is a a technical question Oh programming
language so we will probably be doing
some math later on now
these are some of the basics ways we can
actually print out stuff and that's what
I'm going to focus on in this episode in
the next episode we're going to talk
about something called variables and
variables are something we're going to
use quite often in PHP you're going to
use
a lot in PHP so hope you guys enjoyed
this episode and I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
