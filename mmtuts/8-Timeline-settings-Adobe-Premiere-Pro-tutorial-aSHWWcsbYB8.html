the features we have inside the timeline
and before we do that I need to mention
that premier like any other Adobe
programs like to work in layers now what
I mean by that is right now we do
actually have one clip inside the
timeline and that one is on layer one
meaning that if I take another clip I
don't actually have to drag it on top of
the footage I can actually drag it on a
layer on top of this one so this is a
really good way to prevent you from
actually destroying the existing footage
and it makes it easier to go back and
make changes if you want to to the
existing footage
now the reason need to know about the
layers is because some of the features
we have inside the left side here will
actually affect how you insert footage
inside the timeline and on which layer
its gonna be on if I were to actually
double-click my other footage down here
you guys can see that when I do actually
insert the footage inside the timeline
we inserted right on top of the existing
layer which you don't want to do and do
actually want to insert it and a layer
above this one so what we can do is we
need to actually tell it which layer we
want to target and we can do that down
here to the left side by holding and
dragging these V one and A one which
stands for video one and audio one
inside the next layer which means there
right now if I were to insert it now it
gets inserted into the next layer now we
still have a problem though because
right now as you guys can see it still
breaks the already existing footage
which we don't want it to do so what we
need to do as well is we need to
actually go in and click these buttons
which are called toggle string lock
which means we're telling the timeline
we don't want this footage to get
affected when we insert footage inside
the timeline so right now because we did
actually tag these on you won't get
affected and we told premier to insert
the footage on the next layer now if I
insert you guys can see it gets inserted
in the next layer and the existing
footage is not breaking now we also have
some other features down here which is
the padlock which simply locks the layer
we could also do that instead if you
want to insert footage but not affect
this layer but doing it this way when
to actually edit the footage which can
get quite annoying if you just want to
do this just so you can insert footage
what we can also do is we can actually
mute the track so we can't actually hear
the audio from this video and now if I
play it you guys can see we have no
audio if I uncheck it now we have audio
again we also have an S which stands for
solo track which means that right now I
do actually have two videos on here but
if I only want to hear the audio from
one track we can take this one on so now
we can only hear the audio from there
one so that's basically the one I want
to say gas in this episode I hope you
guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
