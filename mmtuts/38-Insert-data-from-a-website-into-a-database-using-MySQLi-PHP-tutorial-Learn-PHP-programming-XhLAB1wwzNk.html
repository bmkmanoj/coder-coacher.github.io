data inside our database directly from
our website using PHP code and as you
guys can see in front of me here I have
the same code as we did in the previous
episode but we learned how to select
data from inside the database that's
because we're going to use basically the
same code in order to do the same thing
when we want to insert data inside our
database so as you guys can see in front
of me I have all the same code ends at
the index file as the database
connection inside my gpa's file and I
will also include the database code to
our actual database inside database code
that SQL now if you guys don't have
these files and you want to get access
to them maybe because you didn't watch
the previous episode you can go ahead
and download these files in the
description so you can actually follow
this lesson so just for the sake of it
let's actually go ahead and go through
the code from the previous episode so
the basic thing we have here is the
database connection at the top of our
index file so we can actually get access
to the database which is in here and
inside the body tags we just simply
wrote a SQL statement they will actually
you know do something with the database
then the next line we just simply query
this SQL statement so it actually does
something to the database using the
connection we have down here and then on
the next line we just simply check if we
had any kind of results from this select
statement if we did not have a result
it's not going to run the if statement
down here now if we did actually have a
result it's going to run a while loop
that will actually assign all the data
to wherever row and spit it out inside
our website so when we want to insert
data instead of selecting data what
we're basically going to do is we're
going to go and delete this if statement
here we're going to delete the result
check like so so we only have these two
lines of code so what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to change these select
statements and what I'm going to change
it to is the insert statement I have
inside my database code file here called
database code that SQL I'm just going to
go ahead and would wrap this for you so
I can actually see everything so I'm
basically just going to copy this code
we have here go back inside my SQL
statement inside my index file and pay
in here and save it and that's basically
how we insert data inside the database
so just to explain what exactly is going
on here basically we just have an insert
statement that I inserted instead of the
Select statement and then below here we
just simply say you want to run a MySQL
I underscore query function that simply
courage this code and does something
with it inside the database now since
we're not selecting anything we
basically just need to run the code and
then it simply creates the user called
Daniel Nelson blah blah blah and put
them inside the database so basically we
don't actually need to add the variable
here we just need to actually run this
function down here called MySQL
underscore query and this will actually
work so this is basically how we can
insert data into our database directly
from our website using PHP code but I
know some of you will ask me how do we
actually use this inside a practical
example because right now I just sort of
hand wrote the data inside the single
quotes and here how do we actually do
something inside a website that will
insert data from for example a form into
the database let's actually go ahead and
go inside the body tag and I'll show you
how to do this I'm going to go ahead and
create a form and inside this form I'm
going to create a couple of inputs so
going to say we have an input called
text we're going to have a name for this
input this one is going to be at least
the first one it's going to be the first
name of the person we're going to have a
placeholder called first name and again
this is just basic HTML code so you guys
should know how to do this by now so I'm
just going to go and copy/paste this
input statement a couple of times so we
have for all the input we need to have
inside our insert statement so we need
one for first-name one for the last name
one for the email one for the username
and one for the password now for the
password one I'm going to go and change
the type to password I'm going to change
the names of all of them so we have the
second one up here called last which is
last name going to change the
placeholder to last name I'm never
actually sure this is one word or two
words because thing is not my native
language but I'm just going to go and
write it one word
the third one is going to have a email
so we're going to write email as the
name we're going to write e - mail as
the placeholder inside the fourth one
we're going to write the username so
it's called
UID which is what I usually call a
username then we're going to write
username inside the placeholder and
again this is basically if you want to
create a user for for example a website
inside the last one we're going to write
PWD put a password and then inside the
placeholder password like so now just
for the heck of it let's hang to go and
include a break in between each one of
them because I know once we do X to get
inside the website it's actually going
to spit these out on one line and I want
them on separate lines so I'm just going
to go and include a break here I'm going
to go and include a button at the end
because when you taksa click something
to actually activate this form so I'm
going to say sign up which i think is
two words in English inside the button
tag I'm going to go and include a type
set to submit so that actually registers
that we submitted this form I'm going to
set a name equal to submit now the
reason I'm including a name inside the
button is because once I do actually
want to check if the user click this
button I want to use the name in order
to actually check for the submit I'll
show you guys in a second now some of
you people asked me what about required
the attribute called required inside the
inputs why do we not just include those
using HTML if you want to make sure that
the person actually filled out all these
fields because the way we would
typically do it is using PHP code you
would actually go and check if the user
did actually type in everything inside
the inputs well when it comes to writing
code in HTML or JavaScript or jQuery if
I were to write the required attribute
inside the inputs using HTML we can
actually get around it inside the
developer tool inside most browsers so
it's not entirely secure when we use
required inside HTML and so we don't
want to do it only the HTML way we
actually want to do the PSP way or with
some other kind of thing
language because it's much safer okay so
now we have this you can actually go and
go inside the form tag and say okay once
I hit the submit button I want to run
some kind of PSP code now the PHP code
right now it's actually down here but I
want to create a separate file and
insert this code inside that file and in
order to actually run that script once I
click the button because right now it's
just going to run this code as soon as i
refresh the browser and I don't want to
do that okay
so I'm going to go to set an action
which is going to be the path to the
actual file that I want to run once we
do I click the submit button now inside
my root folder I have a index file I
have the database code you guys can use
if you want to copy my code from the
database and I have an includes folder
now inside this includes folder I have
my database connection and like I said
in the previous episode all the code
that goes inside thing codes folder for
me at least is going to be code that is
not a direct page inside the website but
instead just some PHP code that gets run
in the background we don't actually
physically see inside the website so I'm
going to go and include a path to a file
that we haven't actually created yet
inside the includes folder called so
we're going to say includes because you
need to point to the file or to the
folder and inside this folder we have a
sign up dot Inc dot PHP file which again
like I said we have an X created yet
that's actually what makes me write that
correctly like so and what I'm going to
do now is I'm going to go and include a
method so we need to actually decide how
secure do you want this information to
be when we do actually send it to our
side of the link the PHP file right now
we're going to do that using a method
attribute which is going to be set equal
to a post method since when we use the
post method we can actually see the data
inside the URL so if we were to use a
get method we could execute the data but
because this data is more sensitive
because you have passwords and that sort
of thing I want to use a post method
okay so what we need to do now is we
could actually go ahead and copy this
code down here then delete it and insert
it inside a new file
save it inside the includes folder as
signup dot Inc dot JSP like so so now
we're going to actually run this file we
will X include a user inside the
database but wait once we do actually
click the form button and go into this
file it will not take us back to the
front page and we need to fix that so
inside this file we're going to go ahead
and go to next line I'm going to say we
have a header function inside PHP which
simply takes us to another file so once
it has actually run this code up here
it's going to take us to the front page
again so I'm going to say we have double
quotes location colon space dot dot
forward slash because it needs to take
us back a directory because I'm inside
my includes folder and then it's going
to load index dot PHP if we could
actually include some kind of success
message so we're going to say question
mark signup is equal to success if you
want it to now the last thing we need to
include inside this file is right now
because I copy paste this code inside a
new document right now we don't actually
have access to our database connection
so I need to go back to the front page
and say we have this include one
database connection copy it and then
just leave it because you don't exit
either inside the front page anymore
go back to the signup page and include
it at the very top here so now we do
have access to where for column which we
need to have access to in order to
actually connect to the database so now
we have this we could actually go back
to the front page refresh and as you
guys can see we now have a form with a
couple of inputs and then a button now
what is going to happen now is if I were
Tyson click the sign up button is going
to go ahead and run the code inside
signup the link the PSP now right now
since we haven't modified our insert
statement yet it's just going to create
a user called n Nelson blah blah blah
inside the database but it's not going
to take the information we typed in
inside the input fields so we need to
change that so inside my sign up during
the PHP file we
right after we have they included
database connection I'm going to create
a couple of variables so I'm going to go
and say that variable called first which
is the first name it's going to be equal
to dollar sign underscore post brackets
now this post variable here so super
global which simply takes the data we
passed down from the forum into this
document and it's going to assign it
equal to variable first okay now the
name of this super global post is going
to be equal to if we were to go back to
the forum here equal to the name that we
assigned the input so want to get the
data from this input we need to refer to
the one with the name first so I'm going
to copy this name go back to the post
superglobal paste in the name and then
simply copy this statement a couple of
times because we need to get all the
other results as well which were a thing
about five of them we're going to change
the second one to last because that's
the last name it's going to change the
third one to email the fourth one is
going to be change to UID and the last
one is the password now again right now
there's no security for this password it
has not been has to anything when we
insert into database I know some people
actually comment on that this is just a
very very basic signup form okay so now
that we have all this data we can
actually go ahead copy the first name go
down to the SQL code down here and paste
in variable first so I'm just going to
do that for all of them instead of last
name Nelson I'm just going to paste in
last instead of the email I'm going to
copy a miracle email and we're just
going to continue doing this till we
have everything filled out like so so
now that we've pasted in all the
variables inside our insert statement
there's one more thing we need to fix
because right now I just included the
database connection but because we're
already inside the includes folder I
need to delete the include part inside
the path so we just need to reference to
DBH that Inc the PHP without the
includes path okay so now that we have
this we're basically ready to actually
test this out so I'm going to go back
inside the website I'm going to refresh
and then I'm going to go and type in
some information inside the form
and then click sign up because now we'll
actually take the information from the
form and use it inside the insert
statements so I'm going to write John go
email could be John at gmail.com we're
going to go insert a username as John
Doe I'm going to set the password as
test then when I click sign up you guys
can see we get this path in the UL that
says sign up equal to success and now if
we were to actually go inside the
database consume out a little bit for
you guys right now we have two users
inside the database one is called Daniel
and one is called gain if I were to
actually refresh the table you guys
considered now we have John Doe so this
is how we can actually insert data
directly from our website using
something like a form hope you guys
enjoyed I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
