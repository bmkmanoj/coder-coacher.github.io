parameters inside a constructor method
inside a class and this is something
that's more realistic to what were
actually going to use object-oriented
for when we do actually use it inside a
real website because you will be passing
parameters inside some of the classes
you create in object-oriented
programming
so what we did so far in the previous
lessons is that we learn how to create a
class in this case I created a new class
called users and inside this users class
I went ahead and created four different
properties that were equal to first last
hair color and eye color and I just gave
them some kind of value so based off
this you could actually go ahead and
create a new object called in this case
users which is equal to the class name
now after instantiating the class using
the new object here we could go ahead
and echo out one of the properties from
the class so what we're going to go and
do now is I'm going to go and pass some
parameters inside our constructor method
now in the previous lessons we talked
about the constructor being being some
kind of method that just ran as soon as
we called on a new object while this is
true we also used to construct a node to
pass parameters inside our objects so to
give you guys an example if I were to
take one of these properties up here
let's actually go and take the first
name and go ahead and refer to it inside
our constructor here so I'm gonna go and
say we have this point to the property
called first and I'm gonna go ahead and
set it equal to variable first now you
might be asking well why we use in a
variable called first inside our
constructor well look at this as being
the same as a function in procedural PHP
if you were to use a function and want
to use a variable inside the function
we're gonna have to include the variable
inside the parentheses inside the actual
function name meaning that we're
actually taking some kind of variable
from somewhere else inside the website
not inside this property here and
passing it inside the constructor and
then making the variable into the
property up here so don't get confused
by the fact of using a variable first
down here and a variable first up here
too
these two are not the same what I'm
simply doing here is I'm saying that
once I want to call on this constructor
here then I'm gonna go and pass in some
kind of information that is going to be
equal to this property up here once that
directly pass it in so it's actually
going to change the property from Daniel
to something else okay to show you guys
an example it's actually going to use
this so right now we created this
constructor here that has a parameter
called first and we created this line of
code which went ahead and assigned
variable first to this property we have
up here which right now is called Daniel
now for were to go inside my index file
and refresh the browser you guys can see
we get an error message
that's because inside this class here we
just said that inside the constructor we
require one parameter
call first so I'm gonna go ahead and
copy this go back go to our new
instantiate a class up here called users
and say we have some parameters so I'm
gonna go and say get parentheses first
which means that now we can actually go
ahead and use this object here because
now we have one parameter inside the
constructor so the constructor directly
links to the new instantiated class we
create inside the object just so you
guys don't get confused so what I could
go ahead and do now is I could actually
go ahead and instead of this variable in
here well we could create a variable up
here called first and set it equal to
John inside a string of course like so
which means that now if it were to echo
out first using this object here you
guys can see you get John because we
just changed it we created this new
object based off the blueprint we have
inside users and we change the parameter
to John so remember an object is created
based off the blueprint which is the
class okay so just to make this a bit
more clear for you guys let's actually
go ahead and go inside a constructor
function and add the last parameters we
have inside our properties here like so
like so and like so so now we have four
different parameters inside our
constructor method
what we need to remember is we need to
actually go down hints at the code and
assign these parameters to our
properties up here inside the class so
I'm gonna go and change the names from
first to last inside the second line
gonna change the third line to hair
color and then I'm gonna go and change
the last one to I color like so so now
that we did this we can actually go back
inside our index file because right now
for what to refresh the browser again
we're missing some parameters so if I go
inside the optech we created here I can
go ahead and pass in more parameters now
instead of actually doing it this way
with a variable I'm gonna go ahead and
delete the variable and go directly
inside the parentheses here and say we
have a string called
John then we're gonna go and say his
last name is Doe then we're gonna say he
has a hair color as blonde and he has an
eye color set to brown like so so now we
just created an object based off this
person here meaning that now that we
have this object we can go ahead and use
all the properties and methods we have
inside the class so forward to go inside
my class and say we want to create a new
function or new method inside this class
I'm gonna say we have a public function
and I'm gonna go and call this one full
name parentheses curly brackets and what
we can do now is we can actually go
ahead and say we want to return and then
reference to this first punctuation
double quotes punctuation and then refer
to this last semicolon add a space
inside the string here so we can
actually get some spacing between the
first and the last name and then if you
were to go inside my index file say we
have the optical users meaning that we
want to take this blueprint here with
this information inside of it we can go
ahead and spit out full name of this
person here so forward to refresh you
guys can see we get John Doe so the
basic idea I'm trying to get across here
is to get
go ahead and create many different
objects like this one I could actually
go and copy this one more time and
create many different instances of users
so can actually change this one to again
my name if one or two daniel nielsen my
hairs brown and my eye color is blue
like so which means that I can actually
go ahead
Timms just want to use this too so we
have a different name for it and refer
to another object I have and simply spit
out the name again so we're using the
class as a blueprint I know I'm saying a
lot of times I just want to get the
point across that the class is a
blueprint now one more thing I want to
point out which is really important is
that inside my class right now I set
some values up here inside the property
which right now doesn't really make
sense to have because we're simply
changing the values down here inside the
parameters so I can actually just go
ahead and delete all the different
values inside our properties now do bear
in mind we still need to have the
properties because we're assigning this
value inside the parameter to our
property up here so we need to have the
property existing in order to assign a
value to them so just to show you guys
if I were to go back inside the index
page refresh the browser you guys can
see we still have Daniel Nelson because
like I said we don't actually use the
values inside the properties here we
assign new values to them and then use
them using the objects who created
inside our page here now before we end
up this episode I think it's really
important to do some kind of recap just
to explain what exactly has been going
on inside our code because using objects
like this with actual parameters is a
different concept than what we've been
doing in all the previous episodes okay
so what we did so far is we created a
class we call the users and inside this
class by creating some properties I said
that at some point we're going to have
properties called first last hair color
and eye color we don't have the values
yet but we're going to get them at some
point then inside the constructor
function down here I said okay well we
have these four properties and we need
to make sure we add some kind of value
to them when we call on a new object
okay so we're gonna go and include the
four different values were going to go
and include inside the object once we
create it I want to instantiate the
class and these parameters are going to
be assigned to these four properties
using these four lines of code meaning
that now using these four parameters we
can go ahead and use methods inside this
class on the parameters we pass inside
the parentheses here because the values
are going to be equal to the properties
inside the class now I hope this little
recap makes sense to you guys in order
to explain what exactly we did in this
entire episode because some people get
lost when we try to get into the concept
of constructors and actually adding
parameters and creating optics based off
classes and the use class is the wrong
way which is a bad habit we don't want
to get when we start learning
object-oriented programming
remember we need to be able to create
multiple objects that are unique from
each other and in order to do this we
need to add different parameters to our
objects at least when we create classes
that requires that objects are different
so if you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
