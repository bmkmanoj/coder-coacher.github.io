style and kind of do a touch up on our
locking system you create it in the last
episode because I have people asking me
well we created this really ugly looking
thing here but how do we actually make
it look like a real login system you
know that the exes see inside a website
so in this episode we're just going to
focus on actually putting our login
field up here inside a header like a
menu bar or something I'm also going to
put the lock out button inside a menu
bar then we're going to go ahead and
take our signup sheet or like our signup
form and put it inside a separate
document for itself
so we will actually be including two
pages inside our website here we're
going to have the front page with our
well just our header and then we're
going to have our signup page with our
header and a signup form so what we're
going to do to start with is something
we should probably have done in the
first episode which is we're going to go
and take all our you know we have this
document in here called sine of the PHP
lock in the PHP and lock out the PHP and
all these documents do is they run a
script when we load them that either
sign us up
locks us in or locks us out and I don't
want these to be called sign up dot PHP
and lock in dot PHP and so on because
these are basically what I like to call
include files now these are not a page
inside our website these are just a file
that runs the script so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to go ahead and open
up my root folder I'm going to go ahead
and right-click create a new folder
called includes and I'm going to go
ahead and take my lock in the PHP lock
out the PHP and sign up the PHP and move
them inside my includes folder and what
I'm going to do here is I'm going to go
ahead and close down my sign of the PHP
because right now the path has actually
changed I'm gonna close my lock in and
lock out the PHP then I'm going to go
back into my root folder and open up
these files once more because now the
path should be correct well before we
open it up I do want to change the name
of these files so they'll call login
dots Inc the PHP logout if s actually
change it here there you go logout Inc
the PHP and signup dot Inc the PHP so
now
writing it like this sign up dot ink the
PSP is not some kind of file extension
it's just basically us naming it
something else
and I just like putting dot ink and it
doesn't do anything it just it's just
for naming purpose that we write this so
now I can actually go and open this up
and we now have these files inside here
now because we just did this we're going
to need to change a couple of things
because we just changed the path to
these documents meaning the right down
side our front page our login form our
signup form at our lock out form are
actually linking to some kind of
document that we change the name of and
change the path of so we're going to
have to repass and rename these things
down here so inside our login form we're
going to go into the action we're going
to write that the path is inside
includes back slash login docs Inc the
PHP I'm just going to go ahead and copy
my include path here and go down to my
signup form include it in here as well
and change the name to sign up Inc
the PHP and the same thing for the lock
out form down here there we go now we do
need to do one more thing because if we
go back into our logout and login and
sign up the link to PHP we do actually
need to relink to our database file that
we do actually have here that connects
it to the database because now we change
the path so we need to relink to this as
well so going into a walk in Inc the PHP
I'm going to go to my include DBH the
PHP code up here I'm going to write dot
dot backslash DPH dot PHP I'm going to
just go to copy to dot backslash and I'm
also going to go down to my header
location then hit the bottom the
function that actually takes us back to
the front page women to actually log in
and I'm going to change the path to dot
dot backslash index type PHP as well I'm
going to go into my stand-up getting to
PHP now can do the exact same thing I'm
going to include it inside my include
function up here and inside my header
function at the bottom I'm going to go
into my index again and now what we're
going to do is I did actually mention
we're going to have a separate page just
for the signup form
now because we do this we need to make
sure that our session has started on
every single page inside our website now
in the last episode I did actually
mention that we could simply take the
session start and put it inside a
document by itself there'll be a test on
top of every single page we have inside
the website and we're going to do that
right now so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create a new file that's
completely empty I'm going to save it
inside my root folder as header dot PHP
and I'm going to go ahead and take this
document and put it on top of every
single page we have inside our website
which means that I can actually go ahead
and take everything from our opening
body tag down here inside the HTML code
and copy all the way to the top here I'm
going to copy it and delete it then I'm
going to go into my header the PHP and
paste it in so now if we do actually
include this document on every single
page we should automatically get our
system start and all the starting code
for our HTML file if I go back to my
index file I'm going to go ahead and
open up my PHP code at the very top
because we do actually need to include
this header dot PHP document just
created here so I'm going to say include
single quotes and we're going to say
header dot PHP semicolon so now if we do
actually refresh our website you guys
can see looks exactly the same now of
course you couldn't see any difference
because we didn't have anything inside
the header but what we can do now is we
can actually go ahead and start setting
up our signup page inside our website so
I'm going to go up and create a new
document again save it inside my root
folder as sign up dot PHP and that's the
reason I wanted to change the name of
our files because right now we will
actually be creating a file or like a
page inside our website call sign up the
PHP and if you still had our you know
script that simply just went in and
signed us up which is called sign up the
link to PHP right now these files would
essentially start getting mixed up and
we will get confused in that sort of
thing so it's nicer to have them inside
a separate folder at least if it's just
a script so inside our signup that Inc
sorry not outside of that ink but I'll
sign up dot php' we're going to go ahead
and go into our front page copy
everything and paste it into a sign-up
the PHP file now in here we're going to
delete everything that we don't want to
be inside our page you know the page
itself meaning that we're going to go
and delete our logout button so we just
have the signup button or like our
signup form in here so we're going to as
well delete our login form what was that
was that the actual login form that was
not the login form but we will just keep
that for now
so we're going to also delete our login
form like so so now the only thing you
guys should have inside our signup the
PHP is the little PHP code up here that
checks if you're actually locked in and
our actual form that signs us up inside
the website so now if I do actually go
ahead and go to my browser and go up and
change the path up in my URL to PHP
lessons back slash signup dot PHP you
guys can see the get you are not locked
in and we get a sign-up form only so now
I'm going to go back to my front page
inside the browser and inside the code
as well so now we're going to go ahead
and remove this signup form from our
front page so I'm just going to go in
deleted here like so and I'm also going
to go ahead and delete all these breaks
we have here because there's no reason
to have them here so what we can do now
what we have inside our front page at
least is our lock in the form we have a
message that tells us if we're locked in
and we have the lock out form now
because I said we're going to put these
inside a header you know like the login
form and the lock out form we're going
to go ahead and copy our well let's
actually go and set up ahead of her so
let's actually go and go until I headed
a PHP file go down beneath the body tag
which is at the very bottom here and
we're going to go ahead and create a
header tag which is going to include our
navigation and all that sort of thing so
I'm going to go ahead and create the
header tags and I'm also going to go and
create our nap tags for the navigation
and inside these nap tags I'm going to
include a unordered list and inside of
here I'm going to include a list item
and an anchor tag
there we go now we need to you know menu
points inside our menu we need one that
goes to the front page and need one that
goes to the signup sheet so I'm just
going to go to copy these down like so
and inside our first link we're going to
go and write home or something there you
go
and inside the second link we're going
to write signup we might not actually
need this in here but let's just go and
put it in here for now so now that we
have this we can actually go ahead and
you know choose the path because we do
need a path to actually go to the front
page I'm going to say index dot PHP and
in the sign up I'm going to say signup
dot PHP so now that we have this
connects go into our front page refresh
and you guys can see we got two menus up
here we get home and sign up and we can
actually go back and forth between these
two pages now now we need to actually
style our header so we're going to go
ahead and go into our header document
and inside the head tags we're going to
go to link to a style sheet I did
actually link already but you guys need
to make sure you actually have a link to
your style sheet in here and we need to
create the actual style sheet now so I'm
going to Bob a new document go save it
as style dot CSS inside my root folder
and we're gonna go ahead and start
styling our header tags so I'm going to
write header curly brackets and I'm
going to say with 100% I'm going to say
height as why not put it as 60 pixels
and we're going to give it a background
color as a very dark gray and this is
just going to be hashtag
tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu because why not so now
that we have this we can actually go and
refresh our browser as you guys can see
we do actually get this navigation
looking thing let me just zoom out for
you guys so it looks more realistic so
now we need to change the actual margin
because we do accept a margin at the top
here we don't want that and we need to
change the styling of the actual menu so
we need to go back into our styling here
and at the very top of our style sheet
I'm going to go ahead and write star
which means that we're styling
everything
open up the code and I'm going to say
margin set to zero pixels and padding
set as zero pixels there we go and now
we're going to go ahead and style the
actual text inside our navigation so I'm
going to go and say NAB space ul space
Li and space anchor tag open up the code
and I'm just going to go to copy paste
this a couple of times at least two
times there we go
and for the first one we're going to go
ahead and delete everything down to the
UL tag on the second one we're going to
delete down to the Li tag now I don't
know why I'm explaining all this to you
guys because you should be knowing how
to style a basic navigation by now so
I'm just going to go ahead and move a
little bit faster here now inside our
list item I'm going to say list style
and set it to none and I'm also going to
go and include something up in my star
code which is text decoration
whoops tell us about correct incorrectly
decoration there we go and set it to
none I'm going to go back down to my
anchor tag down hit the right bottom I'm
going to say color and let's set it to
white so font family set it to Arial
because that's the only fun that I have
right now that looks somewhat normal and
we're going to say font size and so to
maybe 16 pixels now what we're going to
do is I'm actually going to go and
refresh my browser to see what we have
so far and as you guys can see it looks
a bit more normal
let's actually go ahead and go down to
our list items and save floats lift and
then we're going to take our UL tag and
say float right and I'm just going to
give it a small margin from the top as
maybe 20 pixels so I have no idea if
that is enough but we will actually just
do that yeah that seems pretty good
I'm also going to go ed and give it a
margin right our ul tag because we do
want it not touching the right side the
browser going to give it 60 pixels
because why not we can actually see
what's going on and I'm also going to go
ahead and go down to our list item and
say margin right and say maybe 20 pixels
I don't know there we go so now we have
a menu up here
so what we want to do now is you want to
take all login form and put it inside
our header instead of having it down on
our front page so the next thing we're
going to do is I'm actually going to go
into my index file I'm going to copy the
login form like so delete it and then
I'm going to go back into my header the
PHP and in between my home and sign up
because usually you have to login form
next to the signup button at least in my
head you do I'm going to go ahead and
open up some PHP tags and yes you can
actually mix PHP and HTML code like
we're doing right now in case you didn't
know and I'm just going to go and paste
everything in here now here's the thing
because this is now PHP code and not
HTML code anymore we need to actually
change all the double quote jab inside
the text to single quotes so I'm just
going to go and highlight every single
one of them it's so nice with this text
editor i'm using right now that i can
actually go in and just highlight
everything and tee and change everything
at once so i'm just going to go and
select everything go there we go and we
do actually one more thing all right we
do actually need to echo out this code
so i'm just going to write echo right
before all the HTML code just paste it
in double quote and double quote at the
very end here semicolon so now we should
have a form inside our header there we
go now because you know it looks like
this it's because we haven't actually
styled yet so let's actually go ahead
and style it so if i go back into my
style sheet we can actually go ahead and
say that inside our header UL let's just
go ahead and copy that then we have a
form
inside this form we have an input so and
these input we want to float left just
going to go to these here let's like to
see what we've done so far okay we did
nothing apparently because we do X need
to also float our form just going to
delete down here and I'm not sure if we
need to float left or right okay we need
to float left so now would you actually
have these here and now what we can do
is we can actually go ahead and take our
inputs for some reason that's not
floating while it's not floating ah
right with it actually I'm pretty sure
we added a break inside this form so
let's actually go in here yes we added a
break inside our inputs or these right
after the inputs so we need to delete
those otherwise the float styling is not
going to apply there we go so now we
have a login form up here and we can
actually start styling this login form
selected looks again somewhat nice so
I'm going to go and say that my input is
going to have boarder set to none
because it doesn't look very pretty and
I'm also going to go ahead and give it a
margin right because we do actually want
some spacing so I'm going to say margin
right 10 pixels
well that might actually be way too much
let's actually say 6 pixels and we also
want to give it a margin left because we
need some spacing in between stuff
actually we don't need margin left now
we don't need that there we go so now we
need to stand a lock in form or like the
button that we have inside the form so
we're going to go and copy the input
here and we're going to say lock in film
input button instead and again we want
it to have a border as none we want to
float it left and we want to make sure
that the what do you call the margin
right is set to maybe something a little
bit more than 6 pixels let's actually go
ahead and put that to was it 20 we put
all the other items and then we're going
to go ahead and give it a background
color
Webster's just background now I can't
really see my keyboard when I'm typing
because at the microphone in front of me
but I'm going to go ahead and set this
color as white
I'm guessing even though it wouldn't
probably look very good so now that we
have this let's actually go and change
the color as well of the text so it's
like I like the same color code is the
navigation background and we did not
change anything for some reason why did
the background color not change did it
change
it did change I'm just not noticing it
that seems to font size to 14 pixels
well actually 16 pixels inside the
button I mean there we go and what let's
just keep this stunning for now this
looks fine if you do want this you know
mouse cursor that actually you know
turns into a hand when you hover on top
of a button or something because right
now the buttons don't actually have that
mouse cursor simple when you hover you
can actually go and go into your button
form with button styling and step cursor
to pointer so now if you do extra View
press you guys will notice we get this
hand symbol so now we have something
very basic and I can actually go out and
delete this so you guys can see how it
looks like like set and what we can
actually do now is move our lockout
button up there now the lockout button
only needs to be there if in fact locked
in so what we're going to do here is
inside our header we do actually need to
write a piece of code and what it acts
include this code somewhere already so
we're going to go into our index file
and we're going to copy the if-else
statement that actually checks if we're
locked in I'm going to copy it put it
inside my header right before the echo
that echoes out our login form and just
make sure everything looks nice by
moving it up a little bit so now what we
want to do is we want to say if we are
locked in then do this if we're not
locked in then do this so we wanted to
when we're not locked in to show the
lock in form so I'm going to go and copy
our echo of the login form down here
delete it and paste it in instead of
this air code we have inside the else
statement
and who everything else it looks nice
and now we want to do is instead of
echoing out sessionid
inside if we're in fact locked in if you
want to echo out the lock out form so
I'm just going to go ahead and copy our
lock out form from the front page lead
all the breaks we have here again save
it inside our header I'm going to go and
paste this in instead and again just
like the locked-in form but you also
need to echo this out and change all the
double quotes in here because we don't
want to close up whatever we're doing
here so we're just going to go to echo
this out like so if i refresh you guys
will see it right now a lock a lock out
button that actually disappear if I do
lock in you can see that we have a
lockout button so we did actually change
everything in here so now this
completely disappeared if I do want to
sign up I can hit the sign up button
and as you guys can see we do actually
have the ID of us locked in written here
if i zoom in for you guys there we go we
do actually have our ID written out and
we can actually send ourselves up now
again if you want this not to show if
you actually locked in already you can
actually do the exact same thing as we
just did with the lock out let's
actually going to do that and copy the
if-else statement that we have inside
our front page we're going to go to sign
up and we're going to go ahead and paste
it underneath here and make sure it's
inside PHP tanks of course because we
didn't actually do that so now we're
going to paste it in and we're going to
copy the entire signup form and we're
going to paste it in where we have our
you know if you're not logged in then
show this I'm going to paste it in there
who everything else it looks nice and
I'm going to change all the double
quotes again now a habit that I
sometimes do myself when I create these
sort of ones before if I do actually not
have well every time I create any kind
of form I just use single quotes every
single time because then I won't
actually have to do all this nifty basic
business that we're doing right now of
having to change everything inside our
form into single quotes area
so now if we are in fact not locked in
it shows the form if we are locked in
then I want to instead of writing out
our session ID I want to write a string
that says you are already locked in
because you know already locked in so we
can't sign up refresh and as you guys
can see it says you already locked in
because I am actually locked in if I hit
the logout button what we do actually
get an error because we did not fix
something inside a lock out form
apparently ah did not include my pecs
lesson here
that's why go back again let's actually
redo that so I'm going to walk in as you
guys can see well I wrote something
wrong there we go
I'm locked in now if I do actually go
back to the signup form it says you
already locked in and if I do actually
lock out takes me back to the front page
and it locks me out and tsubasa looks
nice again so that's basically how we
style and create the sort of lock in
form now again this code to be used to
actually tell them you know if we're not
locked in until this if you are locked
in show this that's the only difference
you're really going to do every single
time we're going to show certain content
for example let's say you have a forum
and you need to be locked in in order to
write something inside the forum well
then basically you're not going to show
the text area that you're going to use
to write something you know like a
message that you can post inside the
forum you're going to say that it's not
going to show if you are not locked in
like in here if you are locked in then
you can actually paste in the you know
write something form inside this part up
here so this is the basic way we create
these sort of things so I hope this kind
of gave you guys an idea about you know
the whole styling aspect and all that
stuff from doing this I did actually say
that we were going to spend this episode
creating error handlers and we did not
we did actually focus on creating this
which I think is still pretty important
so we're just going to go ahead and end
it here hope you guys enjoyed I know
this was a long episode in the next
episode we will in fact do error hand
thing so guys enjoyed I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
