one gonna look at how to fix your
quality of the logitech HD pro webcam
c920 which you may have purchased or not
so when it comes to the quality of this
webcam I would say that it is very good
quality it has some people though
complain that the quality is not very
good and there can be a lot of reasons
behind why the quality might not look
good on your computer when it might look
better on someone else's computer when
you see it some sort of recording on
YouTube or something
now the first one can look into is habit
into preferences correctly which I
figured that some of you guys may
already have done and still the quality
is not good the second thing we're going
to do is actually fix the quality issue
where some of you guys may even
experience the quality somehow one day
you're using it at the quality is good
then the next day whoa what happened to
the quality so we're going to learn how
to fix that and sort of get into why
that is happening so first of all let's
go into preferences inside preferences
here we have you know just the basic
options here we're going to go into
quick capture inside here what you're
going to do is first of all icon down
you're going to go down to audio
recording quality you can choose the
best one again if you're not using audio
recording quality this doesn't really
matter but if you're using the webcam
for audio you choose the best one over
here the video recording quality you
want to choose
Lula's which is a large file size which
is basically a this software that you're
using here does not compress the footage
when you're done which increases the
file size in order for it not to take up
too much space but it also increases the
quality when you choose not to have it
compress it so go ahead and choose
looseness here and I think that's
basically it in here then you have some
basic options since here we're not
really going to get into that because
that is not really going to improve your
quality now for the actual recording
quality my quality right now should be
okay and the reason that some you guys
may not look okay if you go into
advanced settings here and take a look
at the the image quality now you may get
a couple of the weird things that
happens from time to time which is that
when you start recording the there might
be a lot of lag going on like it's like
the movements not very smooth when you
want to smooth the movement
to make sure that you turn up well first
of all all the compression issues that
we just looked at in preferences has to
be absolutely turned off don't compress
anything second thing is that over here
which says write sound right light turn
those off because the more stuff you
have on here the motive webcam has to
focus on the settings meaning that the
less concentration it has on the actual
framerate so make sure you turn off the
right sound right light autofocus turn
that off make sure you just focus it
where it needs to be in here in advanced
settings need to make sure that the
exposure level is somewhere in the
middle again you know if I look at the
quality here I can play around with it
and it will get dark and that sort of
thing you just need to make sure you
don't get this thing I don't if you guys
can tell but it's kind of wavy lines
going across there so just make sure it
looks you know presentable down in the
game now if you're recording in the
evening gain when I turn it obviously
all gets brighter you know how much how
good is that you know when you when you
in the evening and it's really dark and
you want to turn up the game so you can
see something now gain the higher gain
is the worst quality you're going to get
that's one of the biggest reasons that
people get crappy quality when they
after they're done touching their
settings don't turn gain all the way up
you actually need to turn it as far down
as possible and instead trying to get
the delighting with either this one up
here or you know the brightness down
here don't touch the gain don't don't
make it so high that it's just insanely
you know bright because it's going to
screw up your quality it's like messing
with the ISO under under on a regular
you know camera or camcorder the higher
up the ISO is the more lighted in takes
but also the worse you know the less
crisp it looks so you don't want to
touch this one too much down here and
brightness again you can you can play
with that Foley you know as much as you
want I do usually do not want to turn
off two months because it does give kind
of like a white sheet over here not a
white but a white sheet over your
footage which is not good the contrast
don't turn that up too much either
because you get this weird thing don't
turn it too low either I find that
roughly
II uh this area here is fine again if
you need to turn off the concert if you
if you use the footage here for an
external program like editing video
editing software if you do use it for
recording I find that contrast you know
I usually like to add it on in there and
then I just sort of take a pretty normal
there you go pretty normal looking image
when I start out color intensity you
know it's the colors of your skin again
you know I like to adjust that sort of
thing post-production so I'm just going
to keep it around here the white balance
I know a lot of you guys are like oh my
god you know if it's especially in the
evening that white balance is going to
be all over the place if you turn it off
that actually does some sort of special
auto correction when you have it on
where you know it takes some of the
background and says ok you know the
background needs to be white and then it
looks at us as oh you tube blue okay I
fix that too so turning on the auto
would actually be more advanced than
just turning it off and trying to find a
spot because it's not always that you
are able to find a spot
however turning this on will also do
stuff to frame it I even experienced
when I was recording that it skipped
frames
meaning that when I recorded and then
edited the footage together I would have
I would start saying something my audio
would be synchronized because I record
the audio separately
I would synchronize the audio in the
video and five minutes later it wasn't
synchronized anymore because the video
was either going too fast it just slow
is all over the place so you know
turning everything off I think it's very
crucial when you do this sort of thing
save it you're ready to go the biggest
thing here is make sure the preferences
are correct and don't turn up the gain
too much because it decreases to quality
I'll show you guys a I mean let me turn
off some of the yes I do actually use an
external light source so oh you know
it's all dark and stuff let's turn up
the gain and actually see the difference
in quality let me just turn it up here
now I don't know if you guys can tell
but the the color the quality of my
footage should be a lot worse now more
you turn it up there with the
worse the edges the pixels themselves
gets washed out which is not good so you
know not having this is pretty damn good
you know use an external source instead
don't don't sit in the darkness and use
the gain to turn up the price let's get
and get an LED light or something much
better hope you guys enjoyed this little
video here I hope you could help you
guys with the video quality and I hope
to see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
