to create a database inside PHP myadmin
and in this episode we're going to talk
about how to create a table inside a
database now just to kind of remind you
guys one table stores one type of data
inside a website meaning that we might
have one table the stores information
regarding users we might have another
table that stores information regarding
a post inside a forum so we can have
many different tables inside a single
database now as you guys can see I do
actually have one table up here which I
created as an example for you guys to
see it and you guys will not have this
one the only thing you guys will see
when you do actually click your PHP
lessons database is create table which
is this part down here now when it comes
to creating tables inside PHP myadmin
there's two different ways you can do it
you can do it the easy way
and you can do it the hard way now in
our case we're not going to do it the
easy way because we do actually need to
do the hard way inside our PHP code when
we do actually get back to the PHP part
which means that I see no reason for us
to actually learn how to do it the easy
way and the hard way so we might as well
just do it the hard way and it's good
practice for you guys so we should do
the hard way you know anyways now the
way we can actually go ahead well let's
actually show you guys the example I
created here if I do actually go into
the table I created inside my database
you guys can see I do actually have two
types of data inside my table down here
I do actually have two two lines of
information I have a user called Jane
23b which has a password as another
password I also have another user called
Danny nine four eight a which has
another password as well now each of
these users has a unique ID just so we
have you know an a unique number we can
refer to for you to the users now this
is an example of a table and one thing I
do want to you know point out is that
when we have data inside a table it's
going to be split up into columns and
rows meaning that the columns are going
to be the IDS the username the password
which I created here and the
those are going to be the data that has
been put into the columns now each table
is going to have one column which has to
be some kind of unique we call it a
primary key which means that it has to
store information that cannot be
identical to any of the rows meaning
that if my for example my user called
Jane has an ID as one no other user can
have the ID as one as well and this is
something all tables must have they must
have a primary ID which cannot be
identical to any other kind of row so
knowing this and I notice is already
getting a little bit hairy we're going
to go ahead and try and create a table
ourselves and in the next episode we
will actually try creating the actual
data that goes inside each table so
let's actually go ahead and click on PHP
lessons over here the left side so we
make sure we're all the way back in the
beginning and now we're going to go up
to the SQL tab up here in the top which
is where we're going to create our
tables the hard way now the easy way
would actually be just to go down here
and say name and write something and
decide how many columns and well let me
access show you guys how this looks like
if I do actually give this table a name
it could be posts and I could decide
okay I need four columns I'm going to
click go now we get this little thing
where we have our rows and well actually
these are going to be our columns
meaning that we can have one column this
you know has information regarding topic
of the post it could also be the content
of the post and it could be the date the
post was made and then we can actually
decide what type of information like
what type of data it is now even though
this is the easy way like I said it can
be a little bit confusing with all the
dropdowns with all the different
information we have in here if you're
new at this so let's actually go ahead
and go back by clicking on PHP lessons
over here in the left side and go up to
the SQL tab at the very top now in here
we can actually go ahead and create SQL
code which will do something with the
database now SQL code is a different
type of coding language that deals with
databases
now this is actually the code that you
need to know because you will be using
this inside your PHP code as well which
is why we're going to do this the hard
way like I said so inside the SQL tap
here we can write code I'm actually
going to go into min figures a little
bit we're going to go ahead and create
the code that creates a table inside our
database called PHP lessons so as long
as you click on PHP lessons we already
selected which database to write the
code in so inside the coding field here
we're going to go ahead and say create
space table space and then we need to
decide on some kind of name for this
table in our case we could call this one
posts just because and then we're going
to say parenthesis semicolon now I'm
going to go and push down my parenthesis
a little bit at least you know one side
of the parenthesis so we can write
something in between here so in between
here we need to write what we need to
have inside a column inside our table
and the first column is going to be our
primary ID or like our primary key it's
called and in this case we're going to
go and call this one ID I'm going to say
space and then I'm going to go ahead and
give it some kind of a data type which
there are actually quite a few of but
we're just going to talk about some of
the basic ones in this episode so for
the ID I'm going to go ahead and call
this one int which stands for integer
which is a number I'm going to say
parentheses and inside the parentheses
we need to tell it how many numbers that
can be inside this ID in our case I'm
just going to write 11 because why not I
don't think we'll ever get to 11 because
there's actually quite a few numbers in
there it's 11 numbers after each other
so unless there's like a ton of posts
like millions of post inside our website
I don't think we're ever going to
surpass this so I'm just going to say 11
for now space then I'm going to go ahead
and call this one not know afterwards
which basically means that this one
cannot be empty we need to have a data
inside this column otherwise it's not
going to save this information inside
the database okay that's basically what
not null means
space and now we're going to say
primarykey capitalized letters and this
means that this is going to be the
primary key that no other rows can have
the same number s so now we need to make
sure that nobody has the same number as
the first person or like no users a post
has the same ideas each other and the
way we're going to do that is providing
space and then we're going to say ow to
underscore increment which basically
means that each time a new post has been
made it will increase our ID by 1 which
means that our integer is going to start
out add 1 then when another post come in
is going to be named number 2 as an ID
and when another post come in is going
to be named as 3 so it's just going to
keep counting upwards which is going to
prevent us from having the same you know
number inside our ID now after we're
done with this column we're going to
write comma we're going to go down to
the next line and now we can actually
start writing the actual information we
want regarding the post so for the first
information we could for example say we
want a topic actually know let's say
subject instead because that makes sense
so we have a subject of the post space
now instead of having numbers because
int is just numbers we want characters
inside our subjects meaning that we want
something called ba cha like so space
actually no but let's put something
inside the parentheses first let's
actually go ahead and say we want a
maximum of 128 characters inside the
subject so if the person actually writes
a huge subject line that's more than 128
characters long it will not save this
information okay after this we're going
to go and say not no comma next line
that's all we need because the only
reason we have so much written in the
first line is because this one is a
primary key and because it's a primary
key we cannot have repeating itself at
any point which is why we added Auto
increment
so after this one we can actually go
ahead and just copy-paste what we have
here so next line and I'm going to
change subject to content now this one
is going to be set to watch as well but
that's actually going to increase the
number because the content can actually
be pretty long inside a post let's go
and write a thousand again we don't we
also want to have not null I'm going to
go down to the next line and then we're
going to go and say date because what if
we want to have the date when the post
was actually made so I have to write
date we're going to change the data type
to something called date time and then
we can actually go and delete our
parentheses because it because we don't
actually need that inside date time now
what this one does is that it tells us
the date in year month day and then the
time as hours minutes seconds and
milliseconds if I remember correctly and
this one is also going to be set as not
not now if you guys have questions
regarding you know how are we going to
make sure that the correct type of
information goes into these columns and
we'll take that a later point when we do
actually start writing the actual stuff
so don't worry about it for now let's
just go ahead and focus on learning how
to create a table so let's say this is
all the information I want regarding a
post now you want to make sure that the
last line does not have a comment
behind it because the comma is only
going to be in between each column and
there's no column after this one so just
go ahead and Eve out the comma after we
have this a good advice for you guys is
to actually save or like copy this code
and paste it inside maybe a blank file
here we can paste it in and save it for
later points because maybe you do access
screw something up at some point and you
have to delete the table and instead of
having to write everything again you can
just go ahead and paste it in from a
document or something so after we had
this I'm just going to zoom out a little
bit we can go ahead and click go down
here in the corner and as you guys can
see my SQL returned an empty result set
which means there was no errors so after
we created this we can actually go down
PHP lessons and see we have another
table called post well you guys are
going to have one table now I'm going to
have one called user as well just
because you create an example but for
you guys you're going to have one called
posts so if you go ahead and click it
you guys can see that there's nothing in
here we have no data and this is
actually how it looks like when it's
empty and just to show you guys a
comparison this is how it looks like
when you have data inside a table
because if you actually have something
inside my user table here so this is
basically how you create a table in our
next episode we're going to talk about
how to actually fill in data inside the
tables here and I do realize that some
of you guys may have some questions I in
the beginning databases can be a little
bit confusing when it comes to actually
creating the tables but the more we do
actually get into this you guys will
actually you know get the hang of it so
hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
