about something called functions in PHP
now when we talk about functions you
basically have two different types we
have predetermined functions and we have
user-defined functions now in this
episode we're just going to focus under
predetermined functions the user-defined
functions will do a little bit later so
when we talk about what a function is
it's essentially a piece of PHP code
that does one certain thing so when we
talk about a predetermined function we
talk about a piece of PHP code that has
already been defined inside the PHP
language meaning that right now I can
actually use it straight away now a
user-defined function is a function that
I write myself which I can't use yet
because I haven't created it yet so to
give you guys an example of a
predetermined function let's go ahead
and write some some text here I'm just
going to go out an echo a string called
hi Daniel
now when we do actually write this out
let's say I want to create a function
that goes in and looks at my string to
calculate how many characters are inside
this string and it's always going to
count the spaces I just want to mention
that so in order to write a function
like that you have to write the name of
the function and then the parentheses
what we're going to put whatever we want
to you know use the function on inside
parentheses so we do have a function
called string length and the way we
write that is by writing STR LEM for
string length so it actually goes in and
calculates the string length so right
now we did actually create the name for
it and we need to create the parentheses
so we need to put in whatever we want to
count the string length of inside the
parentheses so I'm going to take my
string and just kind of place it in
there so now if we calculate it we can
actually count ourselves we have one two
three four five six seven eight nine
characters including the space so if I
save this and echo it out go to my
browser refresh you guys can see we have
nine so this is one way of using a
function called string length or St
our lem which does something we also
have another one which we can actually
called string underscore word underscore
count this one will actually count the
number of words we have inside the
string now again all the different
functions I'm giving you guys examples
of right here I just focused on strings
there's functions for all kinds of crazy
stuff and the ones we're just focusing
on here like I said is strings so if we
go in calculate or like refresh our
browser you guys can see it as two
because right now we have two words
inside the string now we also have
another one called STR rev3 reverse now
this one is actually kind of funny
because if we write it out save it you
can see right now it says hi Daniel if
you refresh the browser it's going to
take everything backwards which is just
you know a fun little thing you can do
we also have another one called string
position which actually goes in and
looks at a certain word to be defined
and tells us we're inside the string
it's placed so if we write STR POS and
we actually give it to different buddy
call it parameters inside the
parentheses so right now we do actually
have the whole word I like the whole
string then afterwards we're going to
say comma and then we're going to tell
it what word we wanted to search for so
right now I could say hi like so and
once I do actually refresh my browser
it's going to tell me zero and that's
because when we calculate spaces like
the space that is position that we
always start at zero so right now eight
is zero is one
the space is three no - sorry I can't
count D is three a is four and so on and
so on so right now high starts at
position number zero if I write Daniel
you can actually see that it should be
zero one two three they've you see
inside the browser like so so there's a
lot of
an awesome function just to do one last
one which is actually like to do is call
string replace so we say string on the
score replace and now we can actually
give it three different parameters
inside the parentheses so right now we
have hi Daniel which is the full word
and we've used this one we actually need
to have these like the word we want to
use in the beginning so I'm actually
going to write Daniel in the beginning
comment and then I'm going to tell it
what I want to replace the word Daniel
with in the next parameter here so I
want to replace it with Jason so right
now we have hi Daniel we're going to
find the word Daniel and then replace it
with Jason so if I go in and refresh my
browser you guys can see if you say hi
Jason it doesn't say hi Daniel anymore
so these are like some examples of
functions there's actually quite a few
functions out there does a lot of
different things inside PHP and which is
focused on some string functions here
there's so many functions out there and
if you're familiar with JavaScript
you're also going to recognize that a
lot of these actually does the same
thing as a lot of the JavaScript
functions except it just called
something a little bit different if
you're interested in doing something
specific with your text just go ahead
and google it that's usually the you
know the web programmer way of doing
things if you want a function that needs
to do a certain thing always google it
to see if it already exists out there
and if it doesn't you can always create
it yourself with a user-defined function
like I said we're going to learn how to
do that a little bit later not in this
episode so if you guys enjoyed and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
