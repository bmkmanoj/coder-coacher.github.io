next episode on how to create PHP now in
this episode somebody asked me to show
how we could change the URL name inside
a website if we have a PHP based website
now what I'm talking about is instead of
it saying amen to that net for which
last article PHP question mark ID equal
to 1 and name equal to hello world then
we could have something like enters the
net force last article Forge last one
for slash hello world which is much
cleaner to look at not just from a
usability point of view but also for
sale because when we want to optimize
for search engine so your website will
pop up more often inside a search engine
it is proven that search engines love
that your URL looks clean so instead of
having this long messy URL it's much
better to have a clean looking URL now I
do have a separate episode in my HTML
course showing how it contains the what
he called the URL using something called
an HT Access file and we're going to do
something very similar to that in this
episode so don't worry if you haven't
seen that episode we're going to take
everything from scratch up till well
pretty much from start to finish so so
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to first of all show you that I do have
a website ready I do have a website
called even towards the net and inside
this website I have a front page and I
also have you know a style seed and a
couple of pictures and that sort of
thing so what I want to do is I want to
create an article page called article
dot PHP
once I visit that article page I wanted
to show certain information on the page
depending on what article I want to
display now typically using PHP which
you should know by now if I want to show
a specific article inside a website we
will write something like if it were to
cover the UL here and show it inside
here just as an example if I want to see
a specific article inside a website I
would say m to the net for slash article
dot PHP and and then the ID of the
article so I would say id equals
- I don't know 23 which might be the ID
for that specific article inside the
database and then the article name equal
to hello world and maybe also a
timestamp if you want that so we could
also say and time equals to some kind of
random number that is equal to the time
that the article was uploaded so but you
get the idea we have this long
complicated URL inside the website and I
just want to reduce it down to a much
more simple format so what I want to do
to start with is I want to go ahead and
tell the server that once it loads up
this specific page called article 2 PHP
it should not show inside the UL article
the PHP we need to show something else
that's much cleaner and then it should
still go into our server and fit the
specific page that we want to show with
this new URL so the way we do that is
using a HT Access file now an HT Access
file is a configuration file for your
Apache web server that you have on your
on the Internet so what it does is that
once I load up my website inside my
online version of the website the server
is going to check for this htaccess file
first and then see if there's any kind
of conditions or rewrite rules that it
needs to check for before it displays
the website inside the browser so if I
told the server that well if somebody
writes immatures the net force last
article then it should show article -
speed article dot PHP instead of a page
called article if that makes sense so
that's what we're going to create in
this episode now don't worry about the
fact that we're going to create a
htaccess file it is very easy to do I'm
going to show you how we can do it so
what I want to do is I have a page here
called article the PHP inside this page
are told it that if we were to load up a
website that has a ID and a name set
inside the parameters of the URL then I
want to get those parameters and then
show it inside my website so it says
Kalai tea is and then the get variable
from inside the URL and the same thing
with article name is and then the name
variable inside the UL so that is just
basic PHP you should know how to do this
section here by now so what I want to do
is I want to open up a new file and I
want to go ahead and save it inside my
root folder of my website I'm going to
save it as dot eight T access it's very
important that you don't put anything in
front of the dot it has to be
punctuation HT access because that's the
name of the configuration file in the
same way as you don't change index dot
PHP into front-page the PHP because then
the server gets all confused and doesn't
know which page need to load up as the
front page the same thing goes here so
eight T X's with the punctuation in
front of it going to save it now inside
of here there's a couple of things that
we can do well there's a lot of things
you can do in sudden htaccess file
because like I said there's a
configuration file but the one thing you
want to do is you want to rewrite the
URL inside the website so if I were to
let's say go to this server here load up
this website I want to turn on something
called a rewrite engine which is
something that allow for us to do this
rewritten thing inside the URL so what I
need to do is I need to write the first
command which is rewrite rewrite engine
and set it to on now what this does is
that it turns on the rewrite engine that
allow for us to actually do what we're
about to do so once we've done this we
need to write a couple to rewrite
conditions in the same way as we do with
PHP Yui we have a couple of condition
first if there if the conditions are
true then we want to run a certain piece
of code so this is a way for us to not
get errors inside our server when we
load up the website so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to say rewrite cond
which stands for rewrite condition and
then I want to go ahead and say
percentage then I want to say curly
brackets and then say request on the
score file name in capitalized letters
so we want to say requests underscore
file name and then afterwards I want to
say what exactly we're trying to request
here because right now we're saying I
want to check the server for a file name
or I want to take the file name that we
have here inside the URL and I want to
check the server for something specific
so I want to check if we have anything
that matches it and what I'm trying to
match is if we have any kind of
directories that is equal to the name of
whatever we wrote inside to you else
overwrite for slash article then I want
to check if we have a folder or
directory inside the server called
article and the reason I want to do that
is because if I do have a folder called
article then I don't want to load up a
page called article because it's going
to screw up something inside the website
if you have a document and a folder
called the same thing so I want to say
we want to check if we do not have a
directory by saying - d that has the
same name as the URL don't get too
confused about this and I'm trying to
explain it as well as I can
the next condition we want to check for
after checking if there is a folder
inside the server that has to say name
is the UL if I want to check if we have
a certain file with this name inside of
it so I want to check if we have a file
called article and then check if it has
a certain extension if the file exists
inside the server it means that we have
the file they want to show when people
access just slash article and if that is
true then we need to continue to the
rule they want to create so another way
of checking if we have the file existing
in the server that we want to show which
is important so again I'm just going to
copy what we have up here paste it in I
want to request a file name from the URL
and then I want to check not if we have
a directory
and again up here we're checking if you
do not have a directory with the
exclamation mark down here I want to
check if we have the file name which is
with an F call something specific
someone to check if we have the file
name with a dot PHP extension so we say
backslash dot PHP if we have this file
name then everything is good so far and
I want to continue and actually do
something inside this server here so if
I do actually access Internet forward
slash article then I want to load up
article that bhp instead and that's what
we're trying to do here so we just tried
to access a document that wasn't
accessed in the URL and show it instead
so after we check for all these
different conditions that has to be true
otherwise it's not going to continue
then we want to create a rewrite rule
which is the thing that actually goes in
and fetches the correct file and showed
it and shows it inside the browser
instead of what we wrote inside the URL
so I'm going to say we have a rewrite
rule and inside this rewrite rule we
need to create a couple of different
things first of all we need to tell it
that if you write this specific thing
inside the browser this specific path
inside the browser then I want to load
this specific page inside my server so
the way we're going to do that is using
something called regular expressions
which we talked about and when the
previous episodes on this course here in
my PHP course so if you're not familiar
with regular expressions I do recommend
that you go back and check that out
first you don't have to you can still do
this tutorial completely will out in but
it makes it easy to understand if you
know what regular expressions is so what
I'm going to do here is I'm going to go
ahead and say what is called a thing is
called a carrot the little symbol that
goes up which is this one here double
arrow which means that anything before
what I'm about to write here so I want
to save that anything before inside the
URL and then say article
so if the ul has article inside of it
somewhere then it's just going to just
go and ignore everything before that
so if we have article inside the URL I
want to say forward slash some kind of
ID because remember I want to get the ID
and the name of this specific article
and again you can change this in
whatever way you want to in my example
here I'm getting the ID and the name so
if you had a user name or user that
locked in to a website then you probably
have something like a user ID and a user
name or something so what I'm going to
do here is I'm going to write a regular
expression that is going to allow
certain characters to be used between
this forward slash and the next forward
slash if that makes sense
so the regular expression is going to
say well we're going to go ahead and
first of all create an actual regular
expression by saying parentheses and
then I want to create the rule for this
specific regular expression so I want to
say brackets and inside the brackets I'm
going to tell it what I want to allow
inside this specific section of the URL
now for now because I know we have an ID
for the article
I just want to allow numbers and not
characters such as a B C and D so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to allow
numbers from 0 till 9 and that's it and
then I'm just gonna go and write plus
because we can have more characters or
more numbers coming after each other so
it's not just going to allow 0 to 9 but
also 10 11 12 13 14 and so on so I want
to write plus at the end here so this is
going to be the first parameter inside
the article URL so now we need to allow
for the next parameter which is going to
be the article name so I'm going to say
forward slash and then I'm just gonna go
and write another regular expression now
this one is going to be slightly longer
because we do want to allow for a bit
more when it comes to names inside for
example an article what I want to do is
I want to create a couple of different
conditions inside this regular
expression so I want to say I want to
allow again for numbers 0 through 9 I
would also like to allow for letters
from a tool sets which are going to be
non capitalized I also want to allow for
for capitalized letters from a till set
and I would also like for specific
characters or symbols inside the UL such
as let's say my article name is hello
world but in two words and because we
can't have space inside two UL some
people like to use dash or underscore as
part of the URL name I also want to
allow for - and underscore inside the UL
so we can go ahead and write this if you
want to let's actually go and switch
these around because it looks nicer and
after doing so of course we need to add
the plus symbol again because you want
to allow for more characters now after
we did this we need to tell it what we
want to redirect to once we load this
inside the UL so if I actually write
this we just wrote here inside the URL
then I want to load up another document
with and other set of parameters inside
the UL so this is what is going to be
inside the URL and the next part is
going to be what we want to redirect to
inside the UL so what I want to redirect
to is going to be a article dot PHP
document so I'm going to say article dot
PHP which we do have inside the server
because it does exist and it's also the
document we checked for inside the
second condition up here so I wanted to
check for article type PHP and then I
want to go ahead and add the parameters
such as ID equal to something which
again we don't know yet because it could
be any kind of article so what we need
to do now is we need to add a
placeholder for a parameter which is
going to be done by writing dollar sign
one so this is going to be the first
parameter placeholder inside the URL
here afterwards I want to say Ann's name
equal to dollar sign two because we have
a second parameter or a second variable
inside the URL so if you have more than
two then you just add three four five
six and seven and so on inside and what
we have here so after doing this it's
going to go ahead and say well the first
parameter which is dollar sign one is
going to be the first regular expression
the second parameter is going to be the
second
regular expression and that's how it
works inside this code here now this
code here is technically going to work
inside our website so I could
technically run des inside the server
and it's going to work but I want to try
to avoid errors later on inside this
specific document in case I have more
rules and conditions below this specific
one we just created here so I'm going to
create brackets at the end here and
closing in an opening bracket and
opening and closing in that order and
inside these brackets I'm going to write
NC which stands for non case which means
that it's not going to matter if we have
big letters or small letters inside the
URL so if I were to write article inside
the actual website with a capitalized a
it's not gonna make a difference it's
still gonna see it as just an a instead
of it freaking out because it's not a
lowercase like a wrote inside this
document here now the next condition
here comma capsulized
l is going to make sure that these
conditions up here only apply to this
specific rule down here so if we were to
create another rule later on below this
code here it's going to ignore these
conditions on top of this so that's
something that I think is good to have
inside your code so I'm gonna go ahead
and save this and I'm gonna go ahead and
open up my web server and I'm gonna go
to upload my first of all my article and
my htaccess file to this specific server
so when I go online and go to m2
studnets just go ahead and refresh it
and I try to access article dot PHP
again I'm just going to show you what
happens if we do it the regular way if
it were to say article dot PHP and
question mark ID equal to two and name
equal to hello world then you can see if
we're to zoom in then we get article ID
is to an article name is hello world
because that's what I rode inside my
article the PHP file now if I were to go
ahead and go inside the same URL and
instead just say article
for slash let's say four instead /my -
name - is that's Daniel then you can see
it changes inside the page but the URL
still looks well doesn't look like what
we had before it actually looks like the
new condition or the new rule that we
wrote inside our HT access file so it's
still going to get the variables and the
parameters inside the URL even though
we're using PHP code and and this is
something that wouldn't work with my
HTML tutorial on this specific subject
so this is how we can create a new URL
that looks a lot cleaner than this huge
filename that we would have instead if
were to say dot PHP you know dollar sign
question marks and all that sort of
thing so this is much better for
creating websites now you might ask me
well what if we have more than just an
article page inside a website with
parameters inside of it so instead of
you know just having an article would
also have a profile page such as profile
PHP well inside your HT access file
you're just going to copy what we have
here I'm not going to turn on the
rewrite intent again because we already
did so so we don't need to and I'm just
gonna copy paste it down and I'm going
to change it from profile to you know
whatever we have in here instead like so
and it's going to change accordingly
inside your website so we need to do
this for all the pages that you have
inside your website so that is the thing
you will need to do but this is pretty
much higher do this and you change the
URL inside the website which again looks
a lot prettier than a typical PHP
website so I hope you enjoyed and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
