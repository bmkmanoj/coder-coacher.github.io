inside your website and is going to
continue off the previous episode we're
talked about error handlers inside PSP
so if didn't watch the previous episode
I recommend you guys go back watch it
first and then return to this episode
here so what we're gonna do today is I'm
going to show you guys a form which is
essentially a signup form inside a
website and when the user submits the
form depending on the error message that
they might receive we're going to
display it inside the website okay so as
you guys can see in front of me here I
have a very basic form that has a input
set to first name then we have another
input set to the last name email
username and password essentially the
information we need when we sign
somebody up inside the website now when
the user submits the form the
information gets sent to a sign up that
anchor PHP file which is the file that
takes information from inside the form
and does something with it okay and
we're sending it using a post method so
inside the signup form you guys can see
that at the top here we have a basic
check the checks if the user actually
clicked the button when they enter this
page because you can actually go inside
the UL go into this signup the link to
PHP file without actually clicking the
button and run the code even though you
you didn't actually click the form so we
want to avoid the people actually signed
himself up inside the database without
actually having clicked the form so this
is the first take that we're doing
inside our signup form here now the
second thing we're going to do is we're
going to include the database connection
and again we're not using a database in
this example but if we were to have a
database this is where we would actually
connect to it and then we get the data
from the form now down here we do
something with the data such as checking
if some of the inputs were left empty
which is one of the error handlers we
have down here we also make sure to take
up some of the characters are not valid
inside the the code here and we didn't
do this one in the previous episodes if
you guys want to have this preg match
function that checks for characters just
go and copy what I have here okay now we
also have a check down here to check for
a valid email so if your email address
is not a real email address then it's
going to throw an error message as well
and then finally down here we have an
else statement that
sans the user up if there was no error
messages inside the script here now I
just want to mention that there's a lot
more error handless we could use inside
the script but I just want to
demonstrate how we can use error
handlers and how can get error messages
inside our website so I'm not going to
show you guys all the examples of all
their handlers you might have inside a
sign up script if you guys want to see
more of these go ahead and take up my
login system tutorial which is a few
episodes from now ok so what I want to
do and what I want you guys to notice is
that when de is an error message
I'm not simply echoing out you made a
mistake I'm actually taking the use of
back to the front page using a header
function and then I'm closing off the
script to make sure that no other else
statements and checks and he actually
continues because we just want to close
off this entire script here and when the
user goes back to the front page is
going to go to index the PHP question
mark sign up equal to empty at least for
the first check here with the empty
inputs they might have typed in now when
it does that
inside the index page we need to graph
this data and then do something on the
page depending on what it says inside
this data here now what I want you guys
to notice is that we could essentially
just have deleted the signup equal to
pardon to sat empty but by including the
sign of equal to actually creating a get
method inside our index page meaning
that we can actually grab the data
inside once we go back inside the index
page using the same way as we did up
here okay just using a dollar sign
underscore get instead of post okay just
gonna go and reset everything now again
if you guys don't have the code here
just go ahead and watch the previous
episode and then copy the code from in
there or you can go ahead and download
the lesson files in the description of
this video here okay so what I want to
do now is I just want to show you guys
how the form actually works inside the
website but because they were were to go
inside the website you guys can see I
have to sign up from here I didn't
mention that I did actually include a
stylesheet inside my index page so
that's why you can actually see that the
website has been styled just slightly
okay
I'm gonna zoom in for you guys so you
can exit see what's going on and what I
want to do now is I want to click the
sign up button without actually typing
any
in because in the URL it should say sign
up equal to empty okay so when I click
it you guys can see this index.php
question mark sign up is equal to empty
meaning the right now we should display
an error message depending on what is
being said in Santa ul okay now another
thing we're gonna do at the end is if I
were to type something in and something
goes wrong if I were to go back to the
index page all the data that the typed
in is going to be deleted so we want to
make sure that they still have the data
once they go back to this page here
again we're gonna do that at the end
here so what we're gonna focus on now is
just getting an error message so what I
want to do is I want to go inside my
code and we have two ways we can do this
I'm gonna show you guys one method that
we could get the error message and then
afterwards I'm going to show you guys
the second method okay so we're going to
go underneath the form here because I
want to display the the aramis is
underneath the form so I'm going to open
up my PHP tags like so and the first
thing I want to do is I want to get the
full URL so I can actually see if we
have a certain string inside the URL and
if we have a string that matches with
what we're searching for then we're
going to throw some kind of error
message so I'm going to say we have a
variable called full URL equal to and
then we're going to set equal to a
string and inside the string we're gonna
say HTTP colon forward slash forward
slash dollar sign on the score server
which is a superglobal that we can use
to in order to actually get the URL and
then we're going to get the website host
so we're going to go inside the brackets
and say HTTP underscore post which is
the first part of the URL and then
afterwards we're going to get the dollar
sign underscore server brackets and
inside the brackets we're gonna get the
- a quest underscore you are I and now
we should have the full URL from the
browser words actually echo this
variable will actually get the entire L
okay
underneath here I'm going to go ahead
and create an if statement because I
want to check
if we have a certain string in Santa's
ul so I'm going to say we have a
function called string position or STR
POS parentheses and inside here the
first parameter is going to be the
actual URL so we're gonna get full URL
the second one's going to be the string
that we want to search for so in this
first one I want to search for if any of
the fields were left empty and again
when we get sent back to the website
using using the first error handler you
guys can see that it's going to say sign
up equal to empty so I'm just going to
copy that go back inside my index page
and paste it in so what this does is
that it says okay if we have this string
inside the URL then it's going to tell
us the precision of the string inside
the UL but we can't really use that for
anything so instead we need to check if
we even have the string or not so we're
going to go after this function here
string position and set it equal equal
to true so we're checking if this one is
inside the UL then do something
incentive statement okay
inside the if statement here I'm then
going to say that we want to echo a
string because we just need to create an
error message and then we can say
something like you did not fill in all
fields exclamation mark and what we can
also do and again using styling I did
actually create two classes that would
turn the text green or red so I'm just
going to go back inside my code here and
create a paragraph tag around my string
here just so we have some kind of
coloring or something going on so the
user can see if they did something wrong
or if they actually signed up
successfully so I'm just going to say we
have a paragraph and a class as equal to
single quote single quote and insert a
class called
error because that's what I created
inside my style sheet what's gonna close
off the paragraph over here like so and
what we do now is basically just copy
this paste it on a Neath here create an
else--if statement instead and then we
check for another string inside the URL
so we can go back inside our sign
updating
PHP take the next one which is character
so CH AR go back inside the index page
and paste it in side instead of the sign
of equal to M T coffee paste we're going
to do this two more times so I'm just
gonna paste it down twice take the next
one which is sign up equal to email
which is also an error message because
it didn't type in a valid email and I'm
just going to change the text under top
two here so we're going to say you used
invalid characters and just paste it
here and just copy it here because it's
just about the same we're going to write
down here we're just gonna say you used
invalid email and invalid email just to
type it correctly and the last one down
here is going to be the one that checks
if we had a successful sign up again the
rule of thumb here's that you always
need to take for success last inside the
script so we're just going to go and do
that here so what I'm gonna do is I'm
contents want to sign up equal to
success which is what I have inside my
signup form and I'm going to change the
text down here to you have been signed
up and then I'm gonna change the class
to success because that's what I have
inside my style sheet now one last thing
we should do here as well is to include
a exit function inside each of these if
statements afterwards because if the
first if statement actually is true and
you know we throw some kind of error
message depending on what it says in
here then we don't need to run the rest
of the scripts down here so we just want
to exit this script and just not run
them at all because it's a waste of time
so just gonna include that inside here
as well like so now we're going to go
back inside the website refresh and as
you guys can see it already says you did
not fill in all fields because we did
already try and submit the form up here
as you guys can see if it were to delete
and just go back to the front page like
normal you guys can see there's no error
messages I clicked the button we now
have an error message it says you did
not fill in all fields
if I did fill everything in like so like
so like so you guys may notice that the
email address is not valid so when I
click it says you used an invalid email
now for what to actually go up and try
and sign everything incorrectly so I'm
gonna say Daniel Hilson use mmm toots at
gmail.com which is my email and just
some random username and password click
Sign Up
you guys can see it now says you have
been signed up and that connects you see
I did a spelling mistake here let's
actually go and fix that you got signed
up okay so this was the first method we
can use in order to create error
messages inside a website now the second
method here might be a little bit better
when it comes to making the website a
bit user friendly because if I were to
create an error in here I'm just gonna
fill in everything again signup you guys
can see it deletes everything inside the
signup form when I get taken back to my
error message now if it were to just
maybe create an invalid email then it
would suck for me as a user if I had a
huge form inside the website I need to
fill out and then just because I make
one mistake in the email address
everything gets deleted and I have to
fill everything out once more okay we
don't want to give the user that bad
experience so what we can do here is I'm
just going to show you guys one example
with the email you guys can just go
ahead and repeat the process to do the
other error handlers but what we're
going to do is I'm going to go back
inside my index page and comment out all
we did inside the PHP code here now the
first thing we're going to do in here is
we're going to just repeat everything we
did here but using a second method that
might be a bit better so I'm going to go
down underneath the code here that are
just commented out and in this example
we don't need to get the entire UL of
the website which is kind of nice
instead because we did actually say sign
up equal to some kind of data which is a
get method we can go and use the get
method in order to get the error message
so the first thing we're going to do is
an if statement and I'm going to check
if we do actually have signup set inside
the UL so if we don't have signup equal
to then I'm not just gonna run the code
down
here okay so I'm going to say inside the
condition if we do not by writing
exclamation mark heaven is set
parentheses set to dollar sign on the
score gets brackets called signup which
again is the first data inside the
statement will create a get method which
in this case is signup the second data
is after the equal sign which is success
okay so inside here I want to say okay
if we do not have a sign up inside the
URL then I just want to exit the script
here because I don't want to do anything
because the use apparently haven't
submitted the form yet but if the use
access of minute deformed then I want to
create a our statements curly brackets
and then I want to start running all the
different error messages so the first
thing we're going to do is we're
actually going to get the data from the
signup data inside the URL so sanam is
equal to something and we need to get
that piece of data to comes afterwards
now we do that by going inside our else
statements and setting a variable that
we can call something like signup check
to check what kind of message we're
getting which is equal to dollar sign
underscore get brackets single quotes
signup which again is the get method
from inside the URL and now this
variable over here is going to be equal
to whatever comes after the equal sign
here
okay so afterwards we can just simply do
another if statement that checks if
signup check is equal to a certain
string so going to say if it's equal
equal to for example MT then it's going
to run the code inside the if statement
so can again just copy what we have up
here at the top the echo and the exit
where we echo out some kind of message
just gonna paste it in here like so and
I'm going to do the same thing below
here instead we're just gonna use an if
statement of course because we don't
want to just keep running if statements
tomorr say else if and we're going to
change the string that we're checking
for inside sign of check two
ciao which is character and then we're
also going to change the error message
inside the actual check here I'm just
going to copy the text from up here
paste it in
copy paste entire thing two more times
because we have four different ticks the
second one is going to be email and
again we just want to copy what we have
up here so we're just gonna say you used
an invalid email we're just gonna paste
it in like so and the last one was this
success message like so I'm just gonna
copy paste one more time and there we go
okay now this should work the exact same
way as the previous one we just did up
here so which go back and start the
website refresh you guys can see it
still says use an invalid email because
I'm still inside the same page here with
their own message if I were to go back
and just you know leave something empty
it still says you did not fill in all
fields so it's still working in the same
way as the previous one we just did so
what we can do using the get method
inside the URL is that we can actually
go ahead and if the user makes a mistake
inside the form such as not typing the
correct email send them back to the form
and then take the data and take it back
with him to the form and insert them
inside the fields that he did not make a
mistake in okay so that way we won't
have just empty fields when he comes
back to the page here so just to show
you guys what I mean and inside the
signup form we can go to the part of the
script that creates the error message
for the email and as you guys can see we
have signup equal to email inside the UL
when we do actually get sent back and we
can go out and add more data to it if
you want to so I'm going to say and or
the ampersand symbol and then I can add
more get methods to it if I want to so
in this case because the email is
incorrect I want to still get the use of
the rest of the data that he created
inside the form so I'm going to go up
here and say okay the email was
incorrect so I'm going to leave that one
MC when we go back to the the front page
but the other ones here might not be be
wrong so I want to also send back the
first name the last name and the user
name I'm going to go ahead and Eve the
password MC because I think there should
be able to
type that once they go back but the
other three here I want to send back to
the front page so it doesn't have to
fill them out again okay so I'm going to
pass these inside the UL and say and
first is going to be equal to dollar
sign first which is our first variable
and we're gonna say and last is going to
be equal to dollar sign last which is
the last variable and then the last one
here we're going to include is the
username so we're going to say you ID is
equal to variable you ID like so so now
who were to go back inside the website
just to test it out I'm going to just
you know try the wrong email address
submit and as you guys can see we now
have a bunch of data inside the UL up
here so what we can do now is I can go
inside my index page go to the top where
we have the form and I'm going to create
an if statement around each input so I'm
going to save you have the first one up
here which is the first name and create
a well first of all the PHP opening and
closing tags because we need those and
then I'm going to go ahead and create an
if statement and I'm going to do the
same thing as down here well check if we
have a certain get method inside the UL
then you should go ahead and get the
data from it and put it inside the input
okay so I'm just going to copy what we
have in here pasted up inside our
condition and not take for the signup
but instead first which is the get
method that has the name as first which
is equal to the data we passed on to the
form and I'm going to go ahead and go
inside my if statement here and then I'm
going to just copy the input from down
here and echo it out inside here as a
string like so and do pay attention to
single quotes and double coach because
you don't want to to get these confused
by by one another and after the
placeholder include a value that is
going to be equal to two double quotes
the get method from inside the URL now
we want to create a variable out from
this one first so I'm going to set a
variable first which is equal to the get
method and I'm just going to take this
variable here then
paste inside the value here like so now
the last thing we're going to do here is
I'm just going to go after the if
statement create a paused statements and
say that okay if we did not have this
set inside the UL it apparently means
that there was no error messages when it
came to the first input here so I'm
going to just echo out the form that we
have down here which is the default form
we didn't do anything to so I'm just
going to again echo inside the else
statements I show you single quotes as
my string and I'm just going to leave
stay input down here like so so now if
we have the get method call first inside
the UL then it should go ahead and input
it inside our input here if we do not
have it then it's just going to leave it
empty when we go back to the front page
okay now I'm just going to copy the if
statement here and the else statement go
below here and I'm going to do a second
check for the last name so I'm just
going to copy the last name input we
have down here and delete it insert it
inside the two echoes like so and again
we're just going to include a value set
to variable last so I'm going to go
after the placeholder included here you
need to change the variable two variable
last and again we also need to change
the variables up here so they match to
get method inside the UL so come see
last like so the last thing we need to
do to the last name here is also change
the the e set statement to last because
we want to check if we did actually have
a last name inside the UL and now what I
want to do is I just want to copy paste
this down to the username because that's
the last one we did actually want to
check for inside the code here so I'm
just going to go down create the PHP
tags so we can actually include it
inside the tags here paste in the if and
else statement then just copy the
username input down here and paste it
inside the echoes and just kind of paste
and paste and make sure we change the
value inside the one we have inside the
if statement and want to change it to
UID
then we're going to change the variable
up here to UID and we also want to
change the is set statement to UID like
so so now if I were to go back inside
the website and just go back to the
front page whoops I mean to actually get
an error message let's go ahead and
check what it says it says undefined
index first in line 13 so if we go back
here take line 13 we can see that we
forgot to aah
we need to change it from not set to set
of course so we're going to just delete
the exclamation marks because we don't
want it to to actually create a variable
out from the get method if it doesn't
exist like so now one more thing we need
to change in here which again is a
mistake on my end is that we cannot use
variables directly inside a string like
we did here so we need to actually
separate the PHP and the string so we
need to say single quotes around the
data and then add punctuation in between
the single quote and the variables here
so we just need to copy what we did here
and paste it on top of the rest of them
like so and do the same thing here for
the first part like so and like so so
now we have the variables like to show
the inside the inputs here so now if I
were to go back inside the website
refresh just to reset everything and
then type in a proper first name a last
name and then pretend we just messed up
the email just gonna write something
random write a user name such as Denny
for 5a and then just a random password
if I were to sign up you guys can see we
still have the data inside the form once
we come back even though we have an
error message okay so this is one way
you can create error messages and also
keep the data inside the form if you
were to create an error inside the
website I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll
see you guys next time
