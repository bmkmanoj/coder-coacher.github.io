form inside a bootstrap website and the
reason we want to do this is to make
sure the forms become responsive when we
do resize the browser or if I were to
view the website inside different
devices so we're going to continue
building off the website we did in the
previous episodes meaning that we're
going to go ahead and include a form at
the bottom here right underneath the
table we created now if you guys are new
to this series and you're just jumping
into this episode you don't need to have
what we have inside this website so just
go ahead and follow along and you should
have no issues learning how to create
forms inside bootstrap so what we want
to do is you want to go inside our file
and I'm going to go ahead and go down to
the bottom of our website and to start a
completely new section which right now
we have a article here called index
table which was the table we created in
the previous episode I'm just gonna go
ahead and copy it and just paste it
right underneath our table like so then
I'm gonna go and delete everything we
have inside the container inside the div
and then what we end up having is a
simple article tag that has a class's
index not table but form and again the
index test form is not a bootstrap code
this is something we did in order to
target any kind of styling inside this
article tag so in case we want to change
some of the stuff the Boosh app does for
us we can actually target anything
inside this tag by targeting this class
here so this is only for us to to mess
around with the bootstrap code then
inside the article tag I include a
container we could either call this one
container fluid or just container then
inside the container we're going to go
and include a couple of columns because
when we create the form I would like to
have it a certain width so we're gonna
go and use two columns inside bootstrap
to get this effect so inside the
container I'm going to go and create a
dip box and inside this dip box I'm
going to give it a class I'm going to
call it row and then inside this div I'm
gonna go and create another dip now this
div is going to have a class set to
something similar to what we have up
here which is in this case column SM
you just gonna quit and copy it now what
this one does is that it allows for us
to optimize for tablets
meaning that one we do actually hit the
tablet with you should start shifting
around the content inside the website so
I'm gonna cordon paste this in here and
I would like to say that well when I
include this form I would like to have
it one third of the width of the browser
so what I'm gonna go ahead and do here
is I'm going to go and say well we have
twelve columns inside bootstrap going
across so 12 divided by 3 is going to be
4 so instead of 2 we're gonna say 4 then
because we need to have 3 of these
columns I'm gonna go ahead and paste it
in two more times so now 4 plus 4 plus 4
is equal to 12 then what we're going to
do is I'm gonna go ahead and include the
form inside the middle column so I'm
gonna go inside the middle one and just
leave the other two empty because the
only reason they're here is to divide up
the spacing inside the width of the
browser or inside the width of the
container not the browser inside the
column we're going to go and include a
form at least the form tag then inside
the form x we can start including all
the form elements that we want to
include inside our form now when it
comes to bootstrap it's important to
know that when we use elements such as
inputs
text areas or select tags we need to
include a class to them in order to make
them 100% with inside the container
we're inside of so if I were to go ahead
and say well inside this form I'm going
to go and start off by saying we have a
dip box that has a class we're going to
set this class equal to form group now
the reason I include this dip tag around
some my elements inside the form is
because I want to make sure that the
right spacing in between my form
elements so if we were to say well I
have a contact form and inside this
contact form I have a label that says
need to write your full name or
something then underneath the label I
want to include a input so we can
actually write stuff in it now these two
because they belong together I'm going
to go and include them inside this dip
box so inside the dip box we're going to
say we have a label then inside the
label we're going to go ahead and set a
four attributes to make sure we do
actually understand what this is
actually for which means that we're
gonna go ahead and give it a value as
name just to give it something then
inside the label we're gonna cut and say
full name : something then underneath
the label we're going to go ahead and
create an input like so we're going to
set the type as text I'm going to go
ahead and give it a name as name just to
give it something now when it comes to
this like I mentioned we need to give it
a class so right before the type I'm
going to go and say class we're going to
set it equal to form - control and when
we do this the input becomes 100 percent
of the container which right now is the
container we have up here or the column
we have here it becomes the full width
of this container so we need to make
sure we have this if you want to have it
the full width of whichever containers
inside of so we can go ahead and include
a couple more of these form groups
because we don't just want to have a
place where the person can write it the
full name you also want to have a place
where you can write in an email address
so we're going to go ahead and paste it
down here I'm gonna change it to email
I'm also going to change the text in
here to e-mail and then inside the input
I'm gonna go and say we have an email
like so again do bear in mind that I do
have two form control class inside the
second input as well because we need to
have 100% if I want you go inside my
browser now and refresh you guys will
notice that at the bottom we do get a
form that has full name and email
outside the input tags so right now we
can actually see what we need to type
inside these areas here now can access
oome in a bit for you guys so you can
see now we want to have some spacing in
here and like I said the reason I
included the form text inside an article
where so we can actually start styling
these sections ourselves so if we go
back inside my style sheet I can
actually go ahead and go down to the
bottom and say we have not an index
table but an index form because that was
the class who gave it inside our index
page
up here okay so we go inside this town
so you want to say we have a width as
100% background color should be white
it could be two one and two I can
actually go ahead and change the two
f3f3f3 just to give it some kind of
light gray color we want to have a
padding from top and bottom which is
fine and now if we were to go ahead and
refresh you guys can see that now we get
some spacing in here so it actually
looks a bit nicer I'm going to go and
include a couple more things because we
need to have some kind of well at least
to demonstrate to you guys we need to
have some more LMS than just inputs if I
were to go back inside my index that
HTML file go down underneath the form
group we have in here I'm just going to
go and paste another form group and I'm
gonna go ahead and change the text from
email to age or something it's going to
change that here like so and instead of
having an input I'm gonna go and say we
have a select then inside to select we
can have a couple of options so we say
option one could be I don't know 10 plus
then we can have a couple more options
that has some other 8 in here we can
just use something so let's say 20 plus
or 40 plus 2 so if you have some kind of
options in here so what we can do now is
in order to make this go all the way
from the left to right let's actually go
and refresh the browser just to
demonstrate you guys will notice that
the aid stops right here like we don't
have it 100% width so if we go back
inside my bootstrap code and say we have
to select up here I'm gonna go and give
it a class set to form control just like
we did inside the input if a word should
refresh the browser now you guys from
notice that now we get a hundred percent
width which is a lot nicer looking in my
mind so why not have this instead so we
can do this with text areas as well and
just to give it a really quick text area
just to show you guys I'm just gonna go
in and copy paste and we're going to
change this from message message like so
and I'm going to go ahead and give this
one a text area
so paste it down well we don't actually
need to paste it down give it a class
set to form - control like so if we were
to refresh the browser now you guys can
see that now we also have a text area
again we also need to actually give
these a name attribute because when we
do actually pass this on to some kind of
hand look we need to get the values but
just to get the styling from bootstrap
this is how we need to do it so now that
we have this let's talk about buttons
because a button inside bootstrap is
slightly different than just a regular
HTML button if I were to give to some
kind of styling right now I have a
regular button here I can actually go
and say submits inside the button if I
were to go inside the button tag and
include a class and then set the class
to BTN which gives us the standard
styling for a button space and then I
need to tell it what kind of styling
specifically I want for this button
you'll want to have some kind of warning
button do I want to have a default
button or what kind of styling do I want
to give this button so for what to go
inside this button tag and say well
let's actually go ahead and say we have
only this button tag because I just want
to show you guys how it looks like as a
default if I were to refresh you guys
can see we get this boots up looking
button down here if we were to go back
inside my code and save what we want to
include a different styling I can go and
say we have a BTN - default if I were to
refresh the browser now you guys will
notice that this button down here
changes into something else now we get a
hover effect when we do actually hover
on top of the button now my mind is
actually looks nicer but just to show
you guys we have a bunch of these I'm
just gonna go ahead and copy paste this
a couple of times about that many times
and then I'm gonna go and change the
second one to primary let's actually go
ahead and write that inside the button
so you guys can see which one's does
what the third one is going to have a
success styling paste it in here the
fourth one is going to have a info
styling
we can paste it in the fifth one is
going to have a warning I can paste it
in that's actually going to copy it up a
couple more times because we do need to
have at least one more then we're going
to go and say danger and then the last
one is going to be linked so now from
what you go inside my browser just to
show you guys the different buttons we
have you guys can see we get a bunch of
different stylings the last one here's
the link which is why it looks like a
link and then we get all these cool
looking buttons in here that has
different colors and different you know
hover colors when you hover on top of
them and it just looks so much better
when we do with the boots that way
rather than having to restyle it ourself
inside our own style sheet so if we want
to have a quick button we can just go
ahead and use the bootstrap styling so
now that soda gasps the colors inside
the buttons let's actually go ahead and
talk about the sizes of the button if I
were to go back inside my code and just
say want to remove some of these buttons
here let's actually keep the primary one
because it has a nice color like so and
let's say I want to include a different
size I can go inside the class and I can
go ahead and say well what if I want to
button - to be large I can say LT if i
refresh the browser you guys can see
that now we get a big button inside our
form if it were to instead say small by
saying XS refresh the browser you guys
can see we get a much smaller button and
again you can recognize that this LD MD
sm + XS is the same we use inside the
column names when we want to decide how
big the column should be so if I go back
inside my column up here you guys can
see that SM which stands for small so
when we do actually get inside tablets
it's going to have a certain styling
it's kind of the same way when it comes
to the button sizes so it's the same
ones we use inside the button - and then
the size I'm just gonna go and say SM
because like that one better now if I go
back inside my browser and just refresh
so you guys can see you to prophesize of
it like so if I were to say well
we want to button to be the exact same
way as these inputs up here by having
100% width we can go and do that as well
if I go back inside my styling here and
say well we also have a class called
button block like so go back inside my
browser we get fresh you guys consider
now we get a full width button which is
something that looks a lot nicer in some
cases so we can also go ahead and do
that when we want to match the button
with our inputs up here now the last
thing we're going to talk about when it
comes to buttons is that sometimes we
don't want a button to be activated so
in case right now I were to go inside my
website say well I need to write some
kind of email to you some 20-plus
provide some kind of message and then I
can actually go ahead and click the
button but what if I want to disable the
button until some specific requirement
has been met but we can actually go
ahead and add a class that disables the
button until some kind of requirement
has been met and again if you ask me
about how to actually switch from an
activated button and a disabled button
you're gonna have to do it using
JavaScript or PHP so we're not gonna get
too much into that in this episode but
just to show you guys how to disable a
button let's go back inside the code go
inside the class and write active which
is the styling we use to activate a
button if I were to refresh you guys can
see that now we get this constant effect
that looks like we have actually clicked
the button inside the browser if I want
to disable the button instead of active
you can write disabled like so the cons
at the browser you guys will notice that
we not only get this graded out picture
or created out button but we also get a
different cursor when we hover on top of
it so right now you can see we can
actually click it well we could click it
but we get this effect that looks like
we can't click it again if you want to
deactivate the button completely you're
gonna have to do it using JavaScript or
PHP but we do get the styling that Mason
looks like you can actually click it so
the user actually knows whoops I can't
click the button now before we end off
the episode I just want to show you guys
the responsiveness of this form we just
created if we were to go inside my
browser and just resize a little bit
like so let's go
down to the bottom you guys consider we
get this flexible form that allow for us
to resize the browser and then it shifts
into you know whichever size we're
watching it inside of so Ford's watching
inside a cell phone this is how it
actually looked like which is quite nice
hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
