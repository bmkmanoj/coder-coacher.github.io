episode on how to learn jQuery now in
this episode we're going to talk about
what exactly daiquiri is and why it's so
good to learn when you want to build a
website so when it comes to Jaykar is
technically not a programming language
it's actually a JavaScript framework or
what you might call a library that allow
for people to use jQuery inside a
website that simplifies JavaScript so
basically what a curry is is a
simplified version of JavaScript that
allow for people to write JavaScript and
websites but in a much more simple way
so if you right now have learned
JavaScript and you want to program it in
a simpler and easier way then caker is a
great place to start if you come from a
background where you don't want to learn
JavaScript because it might be too tough
then again gator is a great place to
start and having said that I'm not
saying that Gator is something that
people learn if they think JavaScript is
too tough most people who learn
JavaScript is actually using jQuery
today because it makes it much easier
and it's just such a powerful framework
when it comes to creating websites using
javascript so it's both beginners and
professional people who use this dagger
today on most websites so the basic
concept when it comes to jQuery if I
have to put in one sentence is do more
with JavaScript but write less code so
that's basically a curry is now I'm from
here I do actually have an example of a
piece of jQuery code that does the exact
same thing as the JavaScript code does
over here so as you guys can see it both
makes it easier to write JavaScript code
but it also allows us to create
different functions into a crew that we
normally inside JavaScript have to write
ourselves
so inside Jaykar you can actually do in
a much more simple and easy way now
regarding what you have to learn before
you connect to get started learning
jQuery I highly recommend you guys learn
HTML CSS first because we will be using
HTML CSS inside our code when we have to
learn jQuery because jQuery uses HTML
CSS in order to do stuff with the code
now some people also tell you that you
need to learn JavaScript before getting
into de curry it really depends on what
your viewpoint is regarding to a curry
if you are one of the people who think
that you need to learn JavaScript first
because it's a good way to learn the
fundamental
of jQuery then yes I recommend you guys
learn JavaScript because since jQuery is
technically JavaScript we will be using
Java code together with jQuery code at
some point these episodes here and yes
that is actually a thing you can in fact
write jQuery and mix JavaScript into it
because like I said it's the same
programming language but a different
framework now in case some of you people
haven't learned JavaScript before
getting into this episode the thing that
jQuery actually allow for us to do
inside websites is to change the
behavior of the website when users
interact with it or certain amount of
time have passed inside the website or
something has happened inside the
website we can use jQuery or JavaScript
in order to change the behavior of the
site so to give you guys an example of
what I mean by changing behavior if I
were to go to a website that has a
banner as soon as you enter the website
and the banner slides after a couple of
seconds then the sliding effects is what
we do using javascript and jQuery so the
stuff that actually moves inside the
website or changes for me to actually
click on something that is what
JavaScript and jQuery allow for us to do
and again that's just very basic
examples of what we can actually do with
it because we can do incredibly powerful
stuff using jQuery and JavaScript when
it comes to websites you know stuff that
is much more complicated and just
clicking and stuff and making it
disappear move around so this is
basically what jQuery is now in the next
episode we'll talk about how to install
jQuery because they will need to get the
jQuery code from somewhere because it is
a framework or like I said a library so
we need to get the library from
somewhere whether it being from online
or downloading it and inserting it
inside a root folder our website
so if you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys
