talk about how to set up a HTML file
because right now for word to see this
in a browser the browser would not know
where the file starts where it ends what
kind of characters I'm using or what
kind of HTML I'm using because right now
we're using html5 and it would not know
that so in order to actually do stuff
that it looks really cool we create text
and boxes and navigations we do need to
define all this information for the
browser first so inside our front page
which is the index dot HTML we're going
to start up a piece of code which will
actually determine what kind of HTML
we're using so we're telling it we're
using html5 so to do that every time you
create a HTML tag you need to use the
lesser than symbol which is the arrow
punch to the left and then you need to
use a closing which is the arrow
pointing to the right side or like the
greater than symbol anything that goes
in between here is going to be a HTML
tag now of course there's certain HTML
tags that are predefined inside HTML so
you cannot just write your own tags you
need to actually write the tags that are
available so the first thing we're going
to write here is exclamation mark inside
the tags duck type space and then HTML
now the duck type part I have written in
big letters because that's how I have
always done it I do not know if it's
case sensitive but just to make sure you
should write it in capitalized letters
to the HTML you can write the small
letters so this piece of code basically
just defined what kind of HTML we're
using that's all we need to do on the
next line we need to open up the HTML
document so we're going to write the
lesser than symbol which by the way I'm
going to say open up the code from now
on and we're going to write HTML and
then we're going to close the code
underneath here we need to actually
close the HTML page by writing opening
the code back slash HTML and then
closing the code so right here
everything that goes in between these
two tags would actually be part of the
website
so as you guys can see it's very easy to
open and close tags by simply writing a
backslash when you want to close
not all things need to be closed with a
backslash for example the top part here
did not need to be closed a image to put
on a website does not need to be closed
either in the pass HTML version you have
to but in html5 you don't have to
anymore so there's a couple of things
that you just need to remember that they
don't need to be closed like with it
down here and it's just something that
like I said you need to remember so
inside these tags we can actually start
filling stuff on our website and when
you start out you need to have a head I
need to have a body so like you can see
I did actually just really quickly
create a head tag that opened it and
then a closing of the head tag then I'm
going to go and put them on the next
line now we also need to have a body tag
underneath the head tag which I'm just
going to write like I did before
an opening and a closing tag of the body
so now we might ask what goes inside
these two well inside the head tags you
have stuff like linking to other
documents you define what the title of
the page is you defined
scripts for JavaScript you define a
bunch of stuff inside the head but you
don't actually physically see in the
website now inside the body however is
where all the physical stuff is going to
go okay and as we go along you will you
know just start learning what it is that
needs to go inside the head and what
needs to go inside the body and you
start noticing a pattern of what you can
do what you cannot do so inside the head
we're going to define what kind of
characters we're using in our website
and we do that by writing we open up the
code and then we write meta space char
set equal to quotation marks and inside
here we write you TF - 8 and then we can
just go ahead and close off the arrow
here so inside here we just defined that
we're using a certain type of characters
which essentially is I think pretty much
all the Latin characters all the special
characters I do not know if Chinese or
Japanese might go in
into this category but I know that all
European languages American languages
you know those kind of languages go as
part of this so underneath here what
we're going to write is title and like
you can see I just sort of created the
opening and the closing tag of our title
now what the title is is if I were to
open up a browser so you guys here at
the very top here you have at the moment
I have something called a new tab and
the new tab text in my browser is
actually the title so if I were to go to
Facebook it will actually say Facebook
up in the tap up here and that's the
title of our website or at least the
file so what I'm going to go and create
here is just a star AML file I'm not
very good at thinking at the spot but
that's what it's going to be called
right now well no let's call it the
front page that was much better
front page I went ahead and saved it and
now if we actually go on preview our
page by opening up our root folder I'm
just going to go ahead and grab it
really quickly here it is right there I
can actually right click on the HTML
file and then say open with and then I'm
going to go ahead and use my Google
Chrome because that's the one I like to
use so inside Google Chrome we can
actually see that it says front page up
in the tap and we do have a blank page
because we didn't actually write
anything on it yet so this is
essentially what we need to actually get
started on a website and I'm actually
just going to go to zoom out slightly so
you can see everything and once we have
this we can actually start writing code
inside our body of course we also need
to link to our style sheet so I think we
should just go ahead and do that
straight away the way you do that is by
writing well you need to open up the
code need to write link ok I just went
and created really quickly here you
write link space arielle which stands
for relative equal to quotation marks
and then style sheet goes in here then
you say space after the quotation marks
type and then you set it as text back
slash CSS and then afterwards here you
still have a href which is hyper
reference and here we actually need to
link to where the stylesheet is so right
now our stylesheet is inside a folder
called CSS if you take a look at where
our index file is or where our you know
front page is you can see that it's
right out here and in order to get to
our style sheet we need to dig into a
folder so you need to take from where
the current file is at and then where it
needs to go so we need to go inside a
folder called CSS we go into the folder
by writing back slash and then we write
the name of our file which is style dot
CSS okay
just going to zoom out and get on one
line so now we actually told to go
inside our style CSS and it will now
load all the different styling that we
have written inside our style at CSS so
we're going to save this and we can
actually preview our browser like so and
you can actually see the texts that are
typed inside my HTML Siege is actually
popping up at the very top it's very
tiny for you guys I'm going to go and
zoom in we can actually see we have some
text up here so that's essentially what
we need to get started on the HTML file
the the stylesheet however is already
ready we don't need to write anything in
here so we can essentially just good
start on writing stuff so that's
essentially how we get started on both a
smell file and a style sheet so in the
next episode we'll actually start
creating stuff because right now all we
did was set up the the file and we
created some text so I hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
