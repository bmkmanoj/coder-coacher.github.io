properties and methods inside optical
answer programming now static properties
and methods is a way for us to pull out
information from a class such as a
property or method without having to
create an object first so we can
essentially just pull out the
information without instance hitting the
class now you might be asking well if
you can just pull out the information
from a class using a static property or
method why even create an object in the
first place I'm going to go out and
answer that in the end of this episode
after we actually learn how to create
these static properties and methods so
let's actually go and get started on
that so inside my index file as you guys
can see I have this object here that I
call object that instantiate the class
called new class now I'm going to go and
delete my object called object with
since 10t it's the new class class and
then I'm going to go and go inside my
new class class now inside the class I'm
gonna go and create a new property so
I'm gonna go and say we have a public
property and we're gonna go ahead and
call it static just to give it some kind
of name I'm going to set it equal to one
actually we're gonna go and set equal to
zero so now that I have a public
property what I'm gonna do now is I'm
going to go ahead and insert the keyword
called static right after the word
public now what this does is that it
goes ahead and creates a public static
property inside my class meaning that if
I were to go inside my index file now I
can go inside my PHP tags and simply
echo out new class I'm gonna go ahead
and say : : which means that now I'm
trying to access a static property or
method and this one is called variable
so we're gonna go and use the dollar
sign static now why are we using the
dollar sign now when we haven't used it
before well when we call an aesthetic
property we need to call it variable
static because we're not trying to get
access to an object anymore we're simply
trying to access the property directly
so now need to use the keyword variable
before we actually say the name of the
property so now that we do this I can go
inside my browser refresh and as you
guys can see we get 0 which is in fact
the number we have
the property now the next thing I'm
gonna go and do here so I'm gonna go
ahead and show you guys how to create a
static method inside the class so we're
gonna go underneath my two string
function here I'm gonna go and call the
new method public static function we're
gonna go and call this one static method
parenthesis curly brackets and inside of
it I'm gonna go and refer to this public
static property up here called static
now when we do this at least before when
we used to do this you would simply go
inside our method and refer to this and
then point to the property now because
these are static elements we can't do it
this way so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna go ahead and return and then use
the keyword self colon colon now the
self simply says they were pointing to
this class were inside of right now kind
of the same as this up here and then
we're gonna go and say we have a
variable static property and remember
because we're using static properties we
need to include the variable sign so now
that we did this we can go inside the
index file and instead of echoing out
the static property we can go ahead and
echo out the static method called static
method I'm gonna go and refresh the
browser and as you guys can see we still
get zero what I could do in here if I
wanted to if I wanted to add if I wanted
to add another number to the zero so I
could actually go down here inside right
before the self text I would say plus
plus and as you guys can see it now
turns into one so we can use the
increment or decrement as inside the
function itself we wanted to we could
also just say you know return to self
static plus one if you wanted to it's
going to give the same answer so this is
how we can refer to static properties
and methods inside optical into
programming so why use static methods
and why use objects because right now
you guys would say well it doesn't
really make sense
that we could simply go in and and pull
up methods and properties without having
to create Optics first you know
why do that that's unnecessary well one
thing about static methods and
properties is that if I were to create a
static method like I did down here
I can't refer to any of the other
functions we have in here because
they're not static static properties and
static methods only refer to other
static properties and methods they don't
refer to the other methods we have
inside of the class or the other
properties we have in here so that's one
really important thing to note now
another thing is that we do use objects
inside of to go into programming again
if you listen to the word
object-oriented programming is that it
revolves around using optics and the
reason we want to use objects and
instantiate classes instead of just
simply using static properties methods
and just pull out the data is that we
want to be able to create more instances
of the same class remember the classes
of blueprints and when we do actually go
in and create static properties and
methods we actually change the class
itself so we need to make sure we use
blueprints and we don't go in and just
simply pull out the data directly from
the class like we would using procedural
programming where we just create
functions and we just pull out the
functions and use them because if you
were to just create an entire class
using static properties of methods it's
like saying I want to do operator into
programming but I want to use procedural
programming inside object-oriented
programming so it doesn't really make
sense so the question really comes down
to when do you want to create multiple
instances of a class and when do you
just need to create something that you
can use once because once you create
this static function and method because
once you create static properties and
methods you can only use them once you
can't create multiple copies of it
because essentially making changes to
the same property and method where when
we create objects you create copies of
the blueprint called new class that
allow for us to create multiple objects
based off the same class okay
hope you guys enjoyed now see you guys
