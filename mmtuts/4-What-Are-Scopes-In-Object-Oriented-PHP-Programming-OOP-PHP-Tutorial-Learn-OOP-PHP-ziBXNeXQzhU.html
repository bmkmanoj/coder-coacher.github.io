something called scopes inside
object-oriented programming now scopes
is what we saw in the previous episode
where we created this class here called
new class and inside the class who
created a property called info now in
front of the property we added a word
called public public is one of the three
sculpture of inside object-oriented
programming which are public protected
and private now when it comes to public
when we insert this keyword in front of
our properties and methods it basically
means that we can access this
probability and method wherever we are
inside the code so ever were to be
inside my index file and I wanted to
access one of these properties and
methods I can go ahead and do so from
the index file now if I were to set this
one to protected like so it means that
any other kind of classes that extends
to this class can used information that
are inside the class so this information
here or this property here would
actually give me an error message inside
my browser if I were to as you guys can
see I do exit at the message here if I
were to refresh the browser now you guys
can see we get an error message and
that's because right now the property is
actually protected meaning that we can
only access it inside another class
where we have it extending to this class
here so just to show you guys an example
what exactly protected does inside the
code and when they hadn't created
another class inside a separate document
called parent class now this parent
class here has a property inside of it
which is also public and the string
inside this prophecy says hi there now
if I were to say I want to access this
property here and I want to do it using
new class and not the parent class what
I can do is I can actually just go ahead
and delete this property in here and say
ok I'm just going to go and use the
property inside the parent class now
what I can do here is I can go ahead and
extend this class to the parent class
here making this class a child class a
parent class okay don't get confused by
the names I just called them new class
and parent class so what I can do is go
ahead and after the class name say
extends to parent
clacks which is the name of the parent
class up here as you guys can see and
when I do this all the properties and
methods inside the parent class becomes
available to me as long as it's either
public or protected ok so if I were to
go inside my code in front of my inside
my index page as you guys can see I
detected change from the layouts here
don't get confused by all this basically
what I did here was I included my class
files I included the object which is a
optic of new class not parent class and
then what I'm going to do here is
through this object here which is new
class I'm going to go ahead and access
the property inside and other class ok
so inside a body tag here I have an echo
right now it echoes out object which is
what we have up here and I went ahead
and chose the info property we have
inside new class now again if I were to
save this and refresh the browser you
guys can see you get undefined property
because right now we don't have info
inside our new class anymore because I
deleted it what I can do instead is I
can go and say well we have one called
name inside parent class and because new
class is extending to parent class we
inherit this property down here meaning
that if we were to say name inside my
index base instead go back to my browser
you guys can see we get hey there so if
I were to go back inside my parent class
and say well right now this public what
if I were to make this one protect it
like so I can actually go ahead refresh
my browser and as you guys can see it
says cannot access protected property
new class name and the reason for this
is because inside my new class we can
only use whatever is protected inside
our parent class if we use it inside the
actual class itself
so right now if I were to go and just
access this property directly from our
index page I can't because it's not
public it's not everyone who can see
this information the only one who can
see it information from the protective
property he
is the class that extends to it so if I
were to go inside my new class and
create a public function which in this
case would be a method which is what we
call it inside object-oriented
programming
I'm going to go and call this one data
actually let's call this one named
parentheses curly brackets and then
inside this function I'm going to go
ahead and say I want to get this
information from the parent class now
when we do this and we extend to another
class these two classes should be seen
as one class meaning that I can actually
go ahead and inside this function here
write return variable disk which means
we're accessing some kind of information
inside this class in here and like I
said we want to look at it as we're
combining the classes when we extend to
them so right now both classes are one
class so by saying this class I'm
meaning both classes so inside this
class we have a property called name and
I want to return name from this parent
class okay and we can use it inside this
function here because we're extending
and the probability down here is
protected meaning we can use it inside
the class so now because used it inside
a method which is actually public inside
this class here we can go ahead and
refer to this function inside our index
page I go in here and I say name
parenthesis which is the function we
just created if I go and refresh the
browser you guys can see we get hey
there so now we have the third scope
which is called private and of course
right now protected means we can use it
inside the classes that actually extend
to attend this class here public means
we could use it everywhere inside our
index page even if you want to but if I
were to set this one as private right
now only this class here called parent
class can use this information here so
forward to create a public function down
here blah blah blah I could only do it
through this class
I cannot go inside new class and refer
to name inside the extended class
okay because just private it doesn't
matter for extending to it we can only
use it inside parent class if I were to
go inside my browser now you guys can
see that now it's undefined property
because we can only use it inside this
class if we would just copy-paste public
function down here inside my parent
class like so and say we want to refer
to the same one down here so this
basically does the exact same thing if I
were to go inside my index page now and
change the name of our instantiate a
class up here to parent class which
means that now we're not instantiating
this one anymore
called new class now instantiating the
parent class instead I can actually go
ahead and refer to name and print it out
inside the browser because the function
down here is not private only the
property is which means that we can
access the information and use it inside
functions inside this class here okay
now I hope this wasn't too confusing
because this is actually very simple
this is just like when we have a regular
function and we have a variable that's
outside a regular function in PHP and
want to use it inside a function then we
can't do it because it's outside the
function scope so it's basically the
same concept here so remember private
means that we can only use it inside
this class protected means we can only
use it inside this class and any class
that extends to it and public means we
can use it anywhere okay so if you guys
enjoyed I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
