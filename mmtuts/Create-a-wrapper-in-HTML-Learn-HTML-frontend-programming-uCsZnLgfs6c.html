about something called a wrapper and
essentially what a rapper does is that
it creates a container then we can take
all the content of our website and put
it inside up then by using the wrapper
we can then tell the website where we
want the content to start where we want
it to end and where we want to position
the content so you can either put
everything on the left side of the
screen you can Center it I can put in
the right side of the screen so to kind
of give you guys an example of what I
mean I do I have a Masonic come open
here and as you guys will notice is that
most web sites out there do actually
have this invisible box that all the
content has been put inside of so as you
guys can see I do actually have
everything highlighted here and you can
kind of imagine that on the left side
here it's like a straight line going
down and then on the right side you have
straight line going down where all the
content stays inside up so that's
essentially what a rapid does so the way
we create it is well first of all a
wrapper is used typically many different
places on a website so we can use it
inside the header to you know tell all
the content inside the header where it
needs to stay you can also use it inside
the section we can use it as inside the
footer we can use it many different
places which means that when we create
the wrapper we're going to go ahead and
give it a name and it has to be a class
name because like I mentioned the last
episode a class name can be used many
different times so we can use the same
wrapper multiple times so to kind of get
started here I'm going to go ahead and
create a dip box that goes outside my
header tags so I'm going to go ahead and
open up my div before the head of starts
and I'm going to close it after the
header then I have to give it the name
by writing out class inside the opening
div tag equal to quotation marks and
then I'm going to call it wrapper now I
don't have to call a wrapper but it's
just a typical thing to call it I'm
going to save it then I'm going to go
into my stylesheet because right now a
div is not actually styled yet it
doesn't know what to do so we need to
make it behave like a wrapper
bye styling it so inside the stylesheet
I'm going to go ahead and go on top of
my header code because I like to put my
wrapper code at the very top because
it's used many different times on the
website so it doesn't really belong
anything
anywhere specifically in the hierarchy
so I just like to put it in the top here
so I'm going to go ahead and refer to a
class by writing punctuation so we have
a class called wrapper then we're going
to open up the code and then we need to
add two different elements or like two
different pieces of code we need to tell
it what with it should have and we need
to tell it where it needs to be
positioned so the width that we're going
to write here depends on what you think
the website should have over with
so the typical thing is actually 960
pixels but it really depends on how big
you want your website wrapper to be if
you take the example again you can see
that Amazon does actually have you know
as a specific width for the wrapper we
could make it larger so that the content
goes all the way over here to this side
or we could make it even smaller so
everything stays inside right here it
really does depend on what you think now
I should keep in like I should mention
that some browsers like some computers
are not big enough let's say a small
laptop you can't really view a website
that has a wrapper that is really really
big like let's say 1,000 300 pixels wide
because it's just not going to fit
inside some computers so we need to keep
it at like my rule of thumb is no bigger
than 1200 pixels but then again some
websites are X like some computers
actually smaller than that so you know
just keep that in mind so the width
we're going to give this wrapper it's
960 because it's just a typical thing
like I said now the position is we're
going to position this in the middle of
the screen so I'm going to go ahead and
say that we're going to give it a margin
: of 0 Auto which means that we are
telling it that we wanted steerer pixels
from the top we wanted to automatically
look on the side you know how much space
is available then we wanted Sewer pixels
again from the bottom and then we wanted
to take the left side and then tell it
you know how much space is available and
then kind of calculate from the left and
right side how much space is available
and where does it need to be to be in
the
Center so you know might not have made
sense the way I just said it but when
you write spacing this way by only using
two different parameters so like two
different valuables it typically goes
from the top right bottom left which
means that we write two variables we say
top right bottom left in this order we
could also just write it like this which
is essentially the same like this this
is exactly the same thing because like I
said it takes top right bottom left okay
so this is how you create a wrapper and
if I go ahead and save this and then
refresh the browser of our website
you'll notice that suddenly our header
becomes you know only a small part of
the website and it acts as stays inside
the wrapper and because you put the
header as 100% with 100% of the
container it's inside of is right now
the wrapper which is 960 pixels so it's
not going to be a hundred percent of the
total width of the browser that we have
open here so just to kind of show this
as an example what we're going to do now
is we're going to go ahead and take the
wrapper inside the index that HTML sheet
I'm going to take the opening tag of the
div and move it inside our header tag so
on the other side of the header tag and
then we're going to take the closing of
the wrapper and move it just before the
closing of the header tag like so then
we're going to take all the content
inside the wrapper and just kind of move
it up once so it looks nice if I save it
now the only thing that should stay
inside the wrapper should be the image
and the nav tags that we haven't really
styled yet so if i refresh the browser
you'll notice that only the image stays
inside the wrapper which is what we were
looking for so this is what we use a
wrapper for and now anything I put
inside this wrapper tag is going to stay
within a certain border which is what we
want so this is what I wanted to teach
you guys in this episode in the next one
we're going to talk about classes and
divs I don't know like classes and ID's
specifically because I feel like we'd
really need to talk to you through since
we use them a lot when we make websites
so if you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
