something called a global scope and a
local scope inside PHP and this is not
really that complicated so we're just
gonna make a rose short episode of this
now as you guys can see I do have some
stuff in the screen already I have a
variable called X which is equal to five
and have a function that we created
called something which has a variable
inside of it called Y which is equal to
ten now the whole idea behind global and
local scopes is that when we have a
function any kind of variable we define
inside the function is gonna be a local
scope meaning that we can only use it
inside the function itself now any kind
of function defined outside the
functions or like any kind of variable
defined outside two functions are gonna
be inside the global scope meaning that
we can use them you know for our code so
if I do actually have an echo down here
and I were to echo out variable x go to
my browser refresh you guys will see you
get five now forward to try echo out
variable Y because it's inside the local
scope of the function we're actually
gonna get an error message because right
now we cannot figure out where is
variable Y at so this is the basic idea
behind local and global scopes there's
really not more to it than this but you
just need to remember that if you want
to be able to use a variable inside you
know your code and you want to use it
you know outside of function need to
make sure it's in Santa global scope and
not inside to the local scope so I hope
you guys enjoyed the reason we wanted to
talk about this in this episode is
actually because we're gonna talk about
something called superglobals in the
next episode so hope you guys enjoyed
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
