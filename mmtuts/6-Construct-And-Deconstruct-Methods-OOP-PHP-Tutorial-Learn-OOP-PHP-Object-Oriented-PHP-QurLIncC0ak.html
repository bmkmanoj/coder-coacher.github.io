something called magic methods inside
object-oriented programming now magic
methods are methods that are built
inside the PHP language and the two
we're going to talk about today is the
method called construct and destruct now
to give you guys an example let's
actually go and create a construct
method right on top of the methods to
create it in the previous episode so I'm
going to go underneath my properties and
I'm going to go and create a public
function which I'm going to go out and
name underscore underscore construct
parenthesis and curly brackets now the
underscore underscore is something you
guys have to write and you have to call
it construct so you can't change the
name of this constructor here now one
thing about constructors is that you
should only create one of them because
what this constructor does that this
method does is that it goes ahead and
run some code as soon as the class has
been loaded so whatever's inside is
function here inside this method is
going to go ahead and run as soon as you
call in this class okay so what I'm
going to go and do here is I'm going to
go ahead and say we have a echo inside
this method here I'm going to go and
echo out a string that says this class
has been instantiated so we notice
actually been started and what we can do
now is we can actually go inside our
index file and as you guys can see all I
have inside my index file is a link to
my class and I just want to instantiate
a new object based off our class and I
simply echo it out get property so right
now inside the browser you guys can see
I am a property because inside the class
we have a probability that has the
string inside of it now if I were to
refresh my browser you guys can see we
get a message that says this class has
been instantiated and then afterwards I
am a property so whatever's inside this
constructor method inside of our class
is going to be called as soon as we call
on this class using an object so now
that we know you can actually start some
code when we call in this class we can
also go and talk about the destructor
which run some code when we actually
close off the class so underneath here
at the bottom of our code I'm going
go and create another public function
I'm going to call this one underscore
underscore d-struct parentheses curly
brackets and whatever code is inside
this method here is going to run as soon
as our class has stopped running so I'm
going to go ahead and say we have an
echo that says this is the end of the
class like so now if I went ahead and
refresh my browser so you guys can see
we now get this class has been
instantiated
I am a property this is the end of the
class so basically what these methods do
is run a piece of code whatever is
inside the method as soon as we call on
the class if it were to take this object
here and just you know create a new
object underneath it based off the same
object we're just going to rename this
as which is going to rename this as -
you guys can see we get a second message
because now we're instantiating the
object one more time which means that
the constructor and destructor has been
run twice so these are two methods that
we do use a lot when it comes to after
granted programming in PSP so you guys
need to remember that we have something
called a constructor and a destructor or
we guys injoyed I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
