episode we're gonna learn about
something called regular expressions
inside PHP now when it comes to regular
expressions we use these together with
strings in order to go inside the string
and see if we have a certain set of
characters that exist inside the string
and if it does then we can return a true
or false statements we can also use
regular expressions in order to replace
characters inside the string so we use
regular expressions a lot when it comes
to something like error handlers when a
user submits a form in order to check if
they did it correctly so it's very
important that you learn about regular
expressions before you start doing a lot
of complicated scripts that require user
input because they're really useful when
it comes to checking if the data that's
out then is actually corrects so inside
my document here you guys can see that I
have a basic string that is equal to a
variable and I'm going to be using this
string together with the functions know
to show you guys what exactly we can use
these regular expressions for so when it
comes to a regular expression let me
actually go and show you guys how it
actually looks like so when we have a
regular expression we put them inside
first of all a string and in between two
four slashes so whatever we put inside
in between the forward slashes becomes a
regular expression okay so to give you
guys an example here let's actually go
ahead and use the first function called
prick underscore match so I'm gonna say
prick underscore match parenthesis
semicolon and what this function does is
that it goes in and takes a certain
string like the one we have up here and
then searches the string in order to see
if we have a certain set of characters
inside the string here so if I go inside
the the function down here the first
parameter is going to be the regular
expression we want to search for inside
the string so I'm going to say we have
forward forward slash and then I can go
ahead and type something in between the
forward slashes I could say Daniel which
is what I want to search for inside the
string and then the second parameter is
going to be the string that I want to
search inside up so what happens now is
that we do actually get a true or false
statement because it does actually check
if Daniel is inside the string up here
so what we could do here and what we
usually do is if we put this inside an
if statements so I'm going to say if
then inside the condition I'm just
to paste in what we have here like so
paste it inside the condition and if I
do actually have Daniel inside the
string then I want to say something
inside Dave statement so I can actually
echo it is a match then I can go inside
the website refresh and as you guys can
see we then get it is a match now if we
go back inside the code again we do have
an optional third parameter we can use
inside the the function we have here so
if we want to have an array with the
result inside of it I can go and add the
third parameter and say that it's going
to be equal to a variable called array
just to call it something and what I can
then do is I can go inside here and
instead of saying echo I can for example
say prints underscore R and then get the
array and print it inside the website so
we can actually see what we do actually
have inside the array here now one thing
you guys may notice is that we do only
get one result from inside the function
here if we were to go back inside the
function you guys can actually see that
inside the string I have Daniel here and
I have Daniel over here but while only
getting one result and that's because
the prick match function only goes in
and checks if we do have this statement
down here existing inside the string and
it's just going to ignore everything
else as soon as it finds the first
result inside the string here now if I
want to have all the results printed out
inside an array what I can instead use
is something called the prick Mets
underscore all function which goes in
and takes all the results from inside
the string and inserts it inside an
array so we were to save disco penguins
at the browser you guys will notice that
we do get more results now just to make
sure you gas and ecstasy this correctly
I'm just gonna go ahead and view the
page source instead and one thing you
guys are also going to notice is that
even though we get two results they're
going to be inserted inside an array
within another array and you might be
asking why do we have a
multi-dimensional array inside the
result here well the reason for that is
that if I were to go back inside the
code and do a second search inside the
same function here I can actually go and
do
that and then the second result is going
to be inserted inside a new array inside
the multi-dimensional array so we have
an array that has many erase inside of
it okay now one thing I want to point
out here before we start doing multiple
searches inside one expression is that
me writing Daniel like this is the same
thing as me writing Daniel inside a pair
parentheses here because we're just
doing one expression inside the
parentheses which means that if I were
to go out and just delete the
parentheses and say okay I also want to
see if we have an eye inside the string
so I can actually save parentheses
around an eye which means that now this
is the same as doing this right here
putting parentheses outside the entire
search and outside the NI so now we're
actually doing two searches inside one
expression so forward to just go ahead
and delete the outer parentheses go
inside my website and refresh the
browser you guys can see that we get a
second array inside the array here and
I'm just going to go inside mother view
here so you guys compare to see it and
as you guys can see we get a second
array so right now if we were to refer
to some of the data in here I need to
refer to the first array and then one of
the other rays inside the first array so
for what to go inside my code here and
say I want to not print R but instead I
want to echo the array variable we have
here and I would like to echo out the
first array which is the main array we
have outside the other race then I want
to echo out one of the arrays inside
that array so I can do the first one or
the second one so for were to just go
ahead and save it go inside the browser
refresh you guys can see we get Daniel
now the last function want to sir gasps
related to regular expressions is one
called prek underscore replace and this
basically goes in and replaces some of
the characters that were inside the
string here with another set of
characters that we decide beforehand so
if I were to do this I'm just gonna go
and delete the if statement we have down
here because we don't need to do this
using a if statements and just going go
and delete all this
and insert the prick Metz function
inside this one line and remember to add
the semicolon at the end here now I'm
going to set this one to Craig
underscore replace and I'm actually
going to set this one equal to a
variable because we want to when we
change the string up here if I were to
just echo the string afterwards let max
go and do that down here just going to
say echo the string here even though we
changed the string using the prick
replace function down here it's still
going to account the same string as we
have up here so we need to set the prick
on the score replace function equal to
another variable and then we I call that
variable down here instead so I'm going
to say we have a variable called string
- just to be creative and set it equal
to prek underscore replace now of course
we also need to go in here and do a
couple of changes first of all I just
want to replace Daniel inside the string
and then the second parameter is going
to be what I want to replace it with so
I'm going to insert some kind of text
here I could say John so we get John
inside the string instead of Daniel and
then the third parameter is going to be
the string we want to use in this case
here so I'm just going to copy the
string name from up here and paste it
instead of the array variable we have
down here I'm also gonna go ahead and
echo out the string to instead of string
without anything and save it and go
inside the browser and now you guys who
noticed that we have my name is John
John is my name so this is how we can
use some of the functions related to
regular expressions and when it comes to
regular expressions there's so much more
we can talk about because just simply
writing Daniel inside the expression is
not really that advanced so in the next
episode we're going to learn how to do
more advanced searches when it comes to
regular expressions so we don't just
write Daniel or something inside the
expression here okay so hope you guys
enjoyed I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
