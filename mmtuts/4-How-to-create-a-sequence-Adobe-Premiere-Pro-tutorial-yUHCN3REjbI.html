set up new sequence inside our projects
and a sequence is something we have to
have if you want to be able to take
footage and drag it inside your timeline
so the first thing we need to do is set
up a sequence that we can do that by
going up into file say new and then
sequence once you hit sequence we need
to actually choose the settings for the
sequence which is basically the video
formats that he wanted to display down
inside our timeline so right now we have
some presets that you guys can see we
have quite a few actually but the one
we're focused on at least for regular HD
TV you know if you want 1080 pixels it's
gonna be the one called HD V so we're
gonna click the drop down and inside
here you get quite a few options we can
choose 720 pixels of confused 1080
pixels now I want to explain the
difference between 1080i and 1080p
basically 1080i is where you have
something that renders the footage one
line at a time going horizontally where
it's in ATP is where you render it in
pixels which gives you much better
quality on your footage when you create
videos 1080i is basically what you might
see in the past where you might see wave
Li lines inside the footage which might
ruin it so we want to focus on 1080p
compared to 1080i now I'm gonna go and
choose the one called xxx behind it
which is basically the framerate we want
the footage to be viewed in now you can
also go into settings if you want to and
change the settings of the sequence we
just made here and if you want to change
anything in here like the audio or the
video you can go and change it inside
here if you want to have a higher
resolution you can also do that inside
here so we're just gonna go ahead and
stick with the basic 1080p 30 frames per
second sequence here now once we've done
that we can actually go ahead and choose
a name for it so I'm just gonna call
this one main which is just the main
timeline we're gonna have inside our
project you can have many different
timelines you know many different
sequences which can be combined inside
one sequence at the end if you wanted to
you can make it really complicated or
you can just go ahead and stick with one
sequence throughout your whole video
it's really up to you some we're just
going to go ahead and say ok and then as
you guys will note
we now get a preview window up here with
some with the black screen which is
because right now we don't actually have
anything else at our timeline which also
appeared and now you guys can see inside
our project window we also get a
timeline so that's basically it for
creating an actual sequence and in the
next episode we'll talk about actually
putting footage inside our project and
putting it onto a timeline and you know
some of the basic info we have down
inside our timeline because we actually
got some new stuff down here now we're
gonna go ahead and talk about those so
hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
