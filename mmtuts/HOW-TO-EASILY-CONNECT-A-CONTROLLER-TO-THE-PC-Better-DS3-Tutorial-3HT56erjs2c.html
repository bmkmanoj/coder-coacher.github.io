improved version of a tutorial I did way
back on how to accent hook up a
controller to your PC now the reason
we're doing an improved version is
because well first of all the last row
is kind of getting outdated and second
of all it seems that a lot of people
have issues using motioninjoy which is
the software have used way back in the
last tutorial so in this one we're gonna
actually talk about how to use something
called better ds3 tool which should be a
lot better first of all because the
first of all the the user interface is a
lot easier to use and second of all
which is probably the more important one
this one is actually done offline
meaning that you don't need internet
connection to do this which also brings
me to another point
some people have experience with
motioninjoy which is the one you need to
run online that they actually get more
aware and viruses from it and that's
because when you use motioninjoy and you
actually use it over a period of time
information is sent constantly back and
forth from the server
meaning that there might sometimes slip
something through to your computer which
is not what we want so this tutorial is
going to show you how to use your
controller without getting any viruses
or anything which is good so let's just
get started here so we're going to start
out by actually open up our browser here
and inside our browser you're going to
search for something called motion enjoy
comm packs let's download and are you
thinking oh but you just told us we're
not going to be using it true we're not
going to be using this software but we
do need a driver from this website that
is going to allow us to actually use the
other software so in here you're going
to go ahead and go to you know
motioninjoy comback slash download
you're going to go down and you have to
download the newest version of it which
is at this this point in time zero point
seven point one zero zero zero and down
here which says 32-bit and 64-bit all in
one side one you're just going to go and
click on site one and it's going to
download a zip folder for you you're
going to go ahead and unzip that folder
you're going to install motion joy when
at the end I'm going to ask you if you
want to run it or not just go ahead and
say no you don't need to because it's
gonna open up that connection like I
said you don't need to software you just
need the driver so just install it have
it under
and never touch it again okay second
thing you need to do is you're going to
go to Google well google.com and in here
you're going to search for how to use a
wireless well I search for ps3
controller on PC how to use Wireless ps3
controller on PC the top link is from
digital Transcom which says you know how
to connect it to the PC and we're just
going to go ahead and click on that
you're going to come into this link here
and don't worry I'm not just going to
share the link and then say okay here
you go now you can install by yourself
we're actually going to take take
ourselves through this step by step in
this tutorial so as you can see it says
how to connect a ps3 controller to a PC
when we slide down it says that you do
actually need well it doesn't really
mention motion joy here but from all the
other places I've been that says when
you need to use this software you do
need to have motion to install so that's
why we installed it just to make sure
now when we go down step one I like to
tell you downloading a better ds3
program so do X need to download this
program first which will it has a link
to down here so when you open that up it
has this better ds3 tool that you can
download here when you download it you
don't need to install it all you
introduce unzip it and then when you
open it up it opens up ok and when that
happens you're going to get this neat
little software here then just go ahead
and find it let's see it is in here it
is called motion well better ds3 tool it
looks like this when I open it up ok as
you can see right now have nothing
connected to it so what we're going to
do now is take you guys through
step-by-step on how to use it I did in
fact have an issue with it when I
installed it which was that I had my
controller set up but it would not work
I had it even registered that my
controller will stand when I wipe it up
controlled it it even said it was there
and it would vibrate on everything but
it didn't work so I'm going to show you
guys how to actually fix that so we have
it open now and what I do is right now I
do actually have a ps3 controller in my
hands with a wire you need to hook it up
to your computer with a wire it does
actually support a Bluetooth connection
this software here but I have never
tried it you do actually need a
Bluetooth signal sender thing to your
thing so you do actually to spend like
seven bucks on it so I just went ahead
and just tried it with the wire so but
what do you need to do now is actually
hook it up and I'm going to do it just
now like so and as you can see it pops
up and there's a couple of things you'll
notice here is that first of all it has
the name of our controller which is good
the battery state is actually saying
that right now it is charging it if you
have a Bluetooth connected to it and you
disconnect your wire it will actually
tell you how much battery you have left
on the controller here which is really
nice
so what we want to do here to start out
is first of all you want to go ahead and
say well let's go ahead and say new and
down here you have a little you know a
couple of options here you want to
select the one called X input which is
the Xbox input and I know I know some of
you guys have ps3 control just I have it
to just follow me along here and you'll
do just fine
you're going to go ahead and click on
that one what I will do now is open up
this window here where you do actually
to give it a profile name so I'll just
say test because I have a profile
already and what you need to do now is
as you can see it has all these things
here you need to hook up like triangle
has to be a certain button at that sort
of thing you don't have to do all that
just go ahead and click on autofill the
xbox360 button up here click it and here
you go now one issue you're going to
have is that well if you're using a ps3
control you're going to have this issue
at least if you're using the Xbox
controller this is going to be all you
need okay if you're using a ps3
controller however you're going to have
to scroll down a bit because some of
these buttons are not correct as you
guys may know all the buttons are the
same on Xbox and Playstation except for
the bumpers like l1 r1 l2 our art are
too those things are not the same it's
actually switched around so we do
actually need to go ahead and go to the
shoulders it's called here where it says
l1 you will not have left Bombo you will
actually have the one called left
trigger which you need to turn into left
bumber up here instead down here in l2
you need to change it from left bumper
to left trigger have access something
okay you do the same thing with the our
buttons so down here with our one you
say right bum but that's what it needs
to say when you're done
actually I'm sort of switching this
around sorry guys
left bumper is going to be left trigger
l2 is going to be left bumper r1 is
going to be right trigger and r2 is
going to be or is it our right bumper
there we go okay that's the correct way
you need to have it because i forgot
that i already i thought i was in inside
the profile i already made so this is
how needs to be okay so doing this will
now have you set up the correct way for
the ps3 controller down here in the
bottom you have a status with the leds
it can either show the battery level or
i like to put it at custom and then set
it as controller one which i like to do
now what one thing you might want to do
is uncheck the one called automatically
apply to controls when connected which
will actually when you connect the
control automatically apply this setup
here to your joystick when you set it up
now i do not want that because I already
have one set up so I'm just going to go
ahead and set save profile there we go
and now if you go down to select a
profile you should have well I have to I
have my original one and then I have
test which is the one we just made when
I was it like this one here you can edit
it you can create a new one you can
delete it or whatever the bluetooth
pairing down here if you do have a
Bluetooth setup on your computer and you
have it hooked up to control you can
actually apply this one
there's also control panel here which
I've not messed around too much you can
just go in and do some advanced settings
in here you don't need to do that it's
actually working now now the issue that
you might have if you look at your
controller at least if you have a ps3
controller
you might notice that the buttons you
know that says you know which player are
you under control you know the four LED
lights if it's sorry if it constantly
says that it's charging and that you not
play a one then you need to actually
unhook your what is it called the wire
from the PC and plug it back in and it
will work
okay that's how I fix mine I tried
opening up a game it did actually
vibrate when I went in and vibrated
tested inside edit and set that my
controller was hooked up but when I
played with it it would not do anything
so you need to unplug your wire and plug
it in again and it will work this is all
you need to do all you need to do is to
start up this program you don't need to
start up motioninjoy all you have to
install it mostly enjoys is hidden away
now okay we have the driver now don't
uninstall motion joy though because
you'll uninstall the driver - just make
sure you have it installed and somewhere
in the computer open this one up hook in
your controller and it should work one
more thing I want to mention if it is
not working when you hook in your
controller make sure you have the the
wire inside your controller first and
then you hook it into a computer I saw
that somewhere that that might be a good
idea to do I'm not sure why it doesn't
seem to ruin it for me but if that's an
issue you can try that that's pretty
much it for it you guys and I do not
think there's anything else I need to
mention here if for some reason it is
not still working I do not know what the
issue is often I do get a lot of
comments on you know oh it's not working
and please tell me why this is not
working and I have to do just as much
googling as you guys do when you ask me
that question and I'm not trying to be
mean here but really I get a lot of
those questions all the time I can't
Google every single time I get an answer
so yeah just go ahead and google the
issue if you if you have an issue that's
how I found out that I just had to
unplug and in pluck my controller wire
again so but I hope this helped please
do leave a like if if it helped it will
help this channel a lot and I'll see you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
