navigation inside a bootstrap website
mean the right now as you guys can see
we have no navigation inside this
website here so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to show you guys different
ways to create navigations using
bootstrap now push that navigations are
very similar to other bootstrap concepts
meaning that right now if we were to
create you know grid systems or images
we use classes in order to change up how
this would actually look like so right
now because we want to create a
navigation we also use classes in order
to change the layout or the look of it
inside bootstrap so inside my code here
inside my index file I'm going to go
ahead and go on top of the div tag that
we created containing the class called
container fluid so the container for the
navigation is not going to be inside the
container fluid class that all the
content of the website is inside up
we're just going to take that and put it
outside this container so inside a body
tag right on top of our container fluid
class we're going to go to insert an app
tag which is just a regular html5 net
tag that we have inside it's Emma five
now inside this net tag we're going to
go to include some code but before we do
that we need to include the necessary
classes inside the tag so we're going to
say class instead of equal to navbar and
we need to tell it which type of navbar
we want to have inside our website now
we have two types we have a default one
and then we have one called inverse and
all this does is that it changes the
color of the actual navigation now if
you are the type of person who says well
I don't like any of the colors that
which type offers me inside the website
don't worry you can actually go into the
styling of the actual you know website
and change the color yourself so I'm
just going to go and stick with the
default one called
navbar - default like so if it were to
save it and refresh my browser you guys
can see we now get this default you know
navigation bar up and on top of the
website that's just great now if I were
to say in that bar inverse just to show
you guys it changed the color to black a
couple of things you guys will also
notice is that we do actually have a
default border radius around in that bar
so if you guys want to solve anything
regarding
this specific style you can see here
then you need to go ahead and style the
active class called nap bar okay so
let's actually go and change this back
to default which has a Gray's color and
a border which I personally don't really
like but we can always change that later
I'm going to go and put inside this net
tag and inside the net tag we're going
to go to add another container fluid
like we did down with the content so I'm
just going to go and copy it here and
paste it inside the actual net tag and
close it again so now that we have this
we can actually go ahead and include all
the content for the actual navigation so
I'm going to go inside our div tag
called container fluid and I can start
including a logo or the navigation if I
want to inside these tags the first
thing I'm going to go and add is a logo
now the way to do that is not by just
creating some kind of image file or
something like that we need to do the
bootstrap way meaning that I'm going to
go and create a div tag then I'm going
to go ahead and call navbar header like
so meaning that this is going to be the
header of the website now of course if
you guys want to you can always change
the tag so it doesn't so it doesn't have
a name as div you can actually call this
one header if you want to it's all up to
you just make sure you include the
proper classes inside these tags so we
do actually know how the layout is going
to be like so inside this net bar header
I'm just going to go to move it down a
bit I'm going to go to include an anchor
because I want to have some kind of logo
that links to the front page to
something so I'm going to say the hyper
reference should be index dot HTML and
I'm going to go and include some text in
here we could insert an image so if you
wanted to I'm just going to include text
because it's easier for now so I'm going
to call this one mm toots like so and
I'm going to go and save it now this
anchor tag is also going to have a class
because we need to make sure we have the
proper classes when it comes to
bootstrap so because I'm using a logo we
use something called an app bar brand
meaning that were branding the website
with some kind of text or one image so
I'm going to give it a class I'm going
to call it nav bar
our deaths brand like so and I'm going
to go to mute press the browser and what
you guys will see is we do actually get
this default styling for text or the
emissive incident side the navbar again
if you guys want to change that because
right now it doesn't look very pretty we
can go into the styling of the website
that we created ourselves over here and
just change the actual text layout so
after we have the brand I'm going to go
and include the actual unordered list
which is going to be the navigation so
I'm going to go and say we have a UL tag
which is unordered list I'm going to say
we have a list item inside this
unordered list so now we have the basics
of a navigation now inside the UL tag we
need to include another class again who
should have likes classes so we need to
make sure we add the proper classes in
order to get this working properly so
inside the class we're going to say we
have an AB space and then we want to say
we have a nav bar
- net which then adds the proper
stylings in order to get this net bar
working properly so now that we have
this we can actually go inside our list
item and start writing the anchor tag
that needs to wrap around the actual
link and then the texture needs to go
inside the actual list item so we can
say we have a anchor tag like so and
inside the anchor tag we have a piece of
text so Chris say this one is called
home and then inside the hyper reference
we can go ahead and just link to the
index page you know just to have some
kind of link like so now one thing we
can actually go ahead and add which is
optional is we can go and say well when
I enter this website I wanted to tell me
inside the navigation by highlighting
the actual navigation of the page I'm
inside of you know to show the user
which page were actually inside right
now so what we can do is inside the list
item that's actually going to copy it
down a couple more times so we have more
than just a home page gonna call this
one sample I'm going to call the next
one contact just have something now what
I can do like I said is I can go inside
my list item of the first one because
when I enter the website the first time
I'm going to be inside my home page so
I'm going to go inside the list item of
the home page and add a class called
active now if I do this as you guys may
notice when I
the browser we get this little square
going around the link that says right
now we're inside the homepage now just
to show you guys if it works actually
you know resize the actual browser you
guys can see we do actually get a
responsive which is what we want inside
a website you know when we do actually
use bootstrap because this is why
bootstrap is so awesome when it comes to
layouts now the next thing we need to
talk about is how to make a drop-down
inside our navigation so if I want to
have sub pages we can actually have that
inside the website so when we want to
create a drop-down we need to go ahead
and change again the classes of the list
items we have inside our website if we
were to just shift this out a bit so we
can actually see the code in here if I
were to say well the sample page is
going to have a drop-down menu I can
actually go ahead go inside my list item
at a class and call this one drop-down
and this is an actual class inside
bootstrap that tells it that we need to
add the styling for a drop-down so
inside the drop-down list item we're
going to go ahead and move down the
anchor tag to the next line we're going
to go move down the closing list item so
we have some kind of hierarchy that
looks nice after we do this we need to
change the anchor tag inside the list
item because right now we need to style
it and we need to tell it using the
JavaScript included inside our links up
here that we want to create some kind of
toggle functions when we click the
sample menu it opens up all the sub
menus so inside the anchor tag of the
actual drop-down item I'm going to go
and include a class like so and I'm
going to go ahead and call this one
drop-down toggle like so now often
included the actual class we need to
include another attribute inside the
anchor because you need to tell the
JavaScript that needs to open up the
actual navigation when we click this
button here I'm going to go and call
this one data that's toggle equal to and
I'm going to go and set this one equal
to drop down like so now the last thing
we need to add inside the anchor tag is
we need to add the actual icon that
tells the user inside the website that
this is a drop-down menu you can
actually click this and it's going to
have more menus underneath
so inside our anchor tag right before we
get the actual text of danga tag which
is called sample here I'm going to go to
include a span tag like so I'm going to
go ahead and get the span tag a class
called carat which goes in and gives us
the icon that we want to include inside
this menu so for what you refresh the
browser you guys can see we get this
little arrow here that says this is a
drop down now if you guys want to add
some spacing you can also do that by
just creating a regular HTML spacing in
here so we can say n + n + B as P and
then we can refresh the browser and as
you guys can see we now get this little
spacing in here so now that actually
looks kind of nice so the next thing we
need to add is the actual drop-down
menus so inside the list item here you
know before we go outside the list item
you want to include another unordered
list
now this unordered list is going to have
a class I'm going to set this class to
drop-down - menu like so inside the
unordered list we're going to go ahead
and add a list item and this list item
it's just going to be a regular list
item like we wouldn't any kind of
website so we're going to say we have an
anchor tag inside this list item we're
going to just reference to as tank which
means that we don't actually go anywhere
just stay outside the page and I'm just
going to go and create a text called
list one just to have something and now
what we can do is we can actually go to
copy this paste it underneath a a couple
times change it from list 1 to 2 and 3
if we were to refresh the website you
guys can see that when I click this icon
nothing actually happens yet and the
reason for that is that we did actually
change our hyper reference inside the
actual menu that we see here to go to
index dot HTML so we need to change this
one to a hash tag just like we did
underneath here because we don't want
this navigation to take us anywhere I
want to actually click it so now we
create the necessary code known to get
the navigation to work I went ahead and
resize the browser so you can actually
see this inside our website environment
so if I were to go up to my drop-down
and click it you guys can see we
actually get the navigation working now
if it were to resize the browser back
down to a
Atlit you guys concealer also works
inside tablets so this is a really nice
way to get navigation to work without
having to put a lot of code into it
other than what bootstrap actually gives
you inside bootstrap so this is how we
can create a navigation now so many guys
might be asking me Daniel okay we just
learned how to create this navigation
that has you know a navigation in it
with a drop-down but what if I want to
navigation to be in the right side of
the browser instead of on the left side
right next to the logo well if you go
back inside our code we can actually go
inside unordered list the one right here
and add another class called navbar
right I'm going to say nav bar that's
right
if I then refresh the browser you got
some notice that when I change the
layout to desktop mode the navigation is
going to be on the right side like so
and it works again just like before now
we can also use this for is let's say I
have Facebook and I want to have a
Facebook link in the right side of the
browser and then the navigation on the
left side I can actually go inside the
code and then delete the navbar right we
just included and on an e-2 unordered
list I'm going to go and create a second
unordered list now inside this unknown
list I'm going to give it the exact same
classes as we did with the previous one
meaning that we're going to have the nav
and let bar Neph inside the class like
so but I'm also going to go to add that
bar right like so now inside this on
order list I'm going to go and add just
one more list item and another anchor
tag now what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to go ahead and say well need to
link to somewhere I'm just going to go
and say we need to hash tag which means
we stay on the page when we click the
link of course if you guys have a
Facebook link that goes to your Facebook
profile you can go and include that
instead of hash tag I'm just going to go
and say hash tag for now so inside this
anchor tag I'm going to go and include a
span tag like so I'm going to go ed and
give it a class which is going to be
equal to glyph icon like so and then we
need to decide what kind of icon we want
to have inside this navigation link
again you don't have to include
span tag I'm just doing it because if I
want to link to Facebook there might be
a really nice icon we can use node to
represent Facebook so if I go back
inside my browser you guys can see I do
actually have a link over here called
get bootstrap comm which is where we did
actually get all the links for bootstrap
and we can then say forward slash
components and then we come into this
list here that has glyph icons in it so
I can act go ahead and choose one that
might link to Facebook or do something
else
so I'm just going to go and find one I
think looks really nice here okay so
they'd like to choose an icon with a
shopping cart in it so in case the user
has to go to your website to buy stuff
then we can have a shopping cart up in
the top right corner so what I'm going
to do here inside bootstraps website is
I'm going to go and copy the text that's
right underneath the actual icon that I
chose kind of copy it and then I'm going
to go inside my class and paste in the
glyphs icon class that we got from the
website if I save it now and then add a
bit of text inside the anchor tag
because we don't actually have text yet
again you don't need to have text but
I'm just going to go and say card I'm
going to go into my website refresh and
as you guys can see we now get a card
with the word card so this is how we can
actually create navigation bars on the
left and the right side of the browser
now the next thing we could add to the
navigation could be a search field so
let's say I want to have a search field
right next to the contact button up here
I can actually go back to the code and
add a search field so if you go back
inside the code I can say well I want to
have a search field right next to the
main navigation so we're going to do is
we're going to go in between the first
unordered list and the second unordered
list I'm going to go to add a form tag
we're going to say form enter and then
inside the form test we're going to go
and create a div box now the dip box is
going to have all the different elements
in the form inside of it except the
button so what we're going to do here is
I'm going to go ahead and go inside the
div box and I'm going to go and include
an input and the input is going to have
a type we're just going to call this one
text because it makes sense and we're
going to go and give it some kind of
name you know just for the sake of it
we're going to call this one search and
the next thing is going to be a
placeholder
now the placeholder could be anything
you guys wanted to have inside of the
actual input
we call this one for search as well so
now that we have the bare minimum for
the search form we need to include the
proper classes because remember this is
bootstrap when you type classes in it so
inside the form tag I'm going to go and
include a class now the class at least
the first one here is going to be the
navbar form like so let's actually make
sure we spell that correctly nav bar one
like so and the second one is going to
be which position we want the navbar to
be in so do we wanted to have in left
side on navigation on the right side
we're going to go and set this one to
the left side so I'm going to say nav
bar - left
so what we get now is a very basic form
inside the navigation what we also need
to include is a class inside the div tag
down here so I'm going to go and say
class and it's going to be called form -
group like so and then inside the input
tag we also need to add a class so we're
going to say class equal to double
quotes and the class name is going to be
called form control so we're going to
say form - control like so and then
before we can finish this one off we
need to have a button so underneath the
actual Dib group or the form group that
we have inside the div tag we're going
to go and include a button like so now
the button is going to have some kind of
text net I'm just going to call this one
search like so and inside the button tag
we're going to go and include a type
we're going to set this one to submit
space and then we're going to go and set
a class and this one is going to be
called BTN for button this is just a
standard button class inside bootstrap
and then the next thing is going to be
what style of button we want so we're
just going to call this one the button
default just to have some kind of button
I'm going to go into my navigation I'm
just going to refresh and as you guys
can see we now have a search field you
can type something and we can search of
course right now we don't actually have
anything inside a website that actually
handles the search bar but if you want
to have that using PHP then we can
include this search field
so the next thing we need to add inside
the navigation is away from the
navigation to stay on top of the website
when we do actually want to scroll down
into the content so for word to say we
want to scroll down of course right now
the navigation doesn't stick to the side
of the website now the way we fix that
is by going up to the main net tag the
events at the code and we add another
class to it so inside the class we're
going to go and say we want to have
navbar - fixed - top save it
refresh and as you guys can see when I
scroll it become stuck to the top of the
website which is what we want to have
and this is something that at these
personally I use a lot so this is
something that's really important to to
have inside a bootstrap website if you
guys want to have it fixed to the bottom
we can also go and change that so we can
sense at the top we can say bottom if i
refresh you guys can see now get stuck
at the bottom of the website so the last
thing we need to have before the close
off this episode is how to make a
collapsing menu so right now - you guys
can see when I do actually resize the
browser into what's called tablet or you
know cell phone you the navigation looks
like this which is not really what we
want to have inside the website I'm just
going to change this back to top because
it looks a lot better this is not what
we want to have inside the tablet we
don't want to have the navigation as
these bars on top of the website we want
to have this little icon up on the top
that says click me or something then we
click it and then we can open up the
menu so the way we can do that just by
going inside our header which right now
is called navbar header which is inside
a div tag inside this div tag we just
have the brand name of the actual
website so right now we have mmm toots
inside the header here so if I want to
create this drop-down or this open/close
menu I can go inside the header here and
right before we actually add the anchor
tag for the net brand I can go ahead and
add a button so we're going to go to the
Save button open it up and inside this
button we're going to go and include
some different types some classes and
some JavaScript functions so we're going
to say first of all space I'm going to
set a type
button the next attribute is going to be
class it's going to be set to navbar
toggle like so and the next thing is
going to be an attribute called data
toggle which again is JavaScript and
these for the JavaScript to know what to
actually do in here this would be data
not theta like so so they're equal to
collapse like so so now that we have
this we need to include one more
attribute inside the button which is
going to be called data target I'm going
to set this equal to double quotes and
it's going to be called hashtag my net
bar and that bar has to be with a big n
so we're going to say nav bar like so so
now to create the active button we need
to include what needs to go inside the
button now we could add some text to it
if you want to we could also add some
you know an actual icon of some sort I'm
going to go and do that so I'm going to
go and include a span that has a icon
inside the span tag so we're going to
set a class we're going to set it to
icon bar like so which adds one line of
bar inside the actual button so because
you want to have this typical you know
three line navigation that collapses or
opens we're going to go and include two
more so now when I save it and refresh
the browser you guys will see now we
have these three lines and we have a
button if I click it nothing happens
because we need to tell it what it needs
to close and open so in order to do this
we need to wrap the entire navigation
around a div box which activates or
deactivates want me to actually click
this button up here so in order to do
this I'm going to go right on top of the
unordered list that has sent a
navigation in it at least the one we
want to have as a drop-down which should
be I think pretty much everything so
we're going to go to include a dip box
on top of the first navigation I'm just
going to go to close the dip box right
on the knees my navigation down here at
the bottom after the shopping cart
because I want everything to open up
when I do actually click this button
here again if you guys want to shopping
card to always be available and just the
main navigation to to open close you can
go to close to div tag before the actual
shopping cart open forward to the search
bar if you just want the main navigation
to open close so having done this let's
actually go up to the opening div tag
and add the necessary classes and ID's
that it needs to know types to get
activated by the the button we created
so inside the div tag we're going to go
and say class and we're going to go and
set the class to collapse space we're
going to add a second class called net
bar collapse dance collapse like so then
afterwards we're going to go to add an
ID and we're going to call this one my
net bar and again because we're
referencing to a my net bar with a big n
we're going to go and make sure that my
net bar has a big n as well so now that
that saved is refresh the browser you
guys will notice that the menu has been
closed there's no menu in here
once I click the button it opens up and
again we can toggle this by keep
clicking it so this is how we can create
a really awesome navbar inside bootstrap
again remember if you guys don't like
the actual styling of this navigation
you can go ahead and change it inside
the styling of the active style sheet
that we attach to this to the actual
document and just do your own styling to
it one thing I want to add before we
close off is when I do actually resize
the browser so you guys will notice that
when get into desktop mode the drop down
actually disappears because we can
actually you know see the entire
navigation but once I get far enough
that it doesn't become available to us
we can do the open and closing with the
navigation so I hope you guys enjoyed
this episode I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
