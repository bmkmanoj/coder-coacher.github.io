update our database using SQL code and
this is going to be the same code you're
going to use inside your PHP code to
update your database so try to memorize
this if you can so what we're gonna do
is we're going to go ahead and select
our database which I do actually have
selected here and then we're gonna go to
the SQL tab up here in the menu inside
here we're gonna go ahead and write SQL
code that will actually go in and update
our table called Post so right now if
you take a look at the table you guys
can see you have an ID subject content
and date now let's say I want to change
my subject from this is the subject to
this is another subject instead now in
order to do that we need to write a
piece of SQL code so I'm gonna go ahead
and go into my SQL code writing window
here and then I'm gonna go ahead and
write updates space and then we're gonna
go ahead and write the name of the table
called posts then I'm actually gonna go
ahead and say enter now it doesn't
actually matter if you say space and
then continue to write here or if you
say enter I'm only hitting enter because
it looks a bit nicer when we type it in
into the window so underneath here in
the next line I'm gonna go and write set
space and then we need to type what we
want to change inside our table called
post so right now we do actually have a
subject so I'm gonna write subjects and
I'm gonna set it equal to the new text
that I want it to be so I can actually
say this is a test
instead afterwards we can either write
comma and then say another one if you
want to change something else as well
let's actually go ahead and change our
content so let's actually say content
equal to single quotes and we're going
to say this is the content so now I
actually gonna change the huge piece of
text we have inside our content area and
replace it with this small piece of text
so we can actually keep adding inside
our table here but let's just go ahead
and update these two for now so I'm
gonna go ahead and say next line we're
and I did actually capitalize this but
it doesn't really matter if you
capitalize it or not it is a habit to
actually write all these capitalize when
we do actually write code so when I say
update you know I rather capitalized set
is capitalized where is capitalized
it's just a coding habit to do it this
way so it doesn't matter if you guys
want to do it or not it's still gonna
work in here so I'm just gonna go ahead
and capitalize them for now after where
we need to select where we want to
update this or at least we can if we
want to we can actually just go ahead
and delete where and just run it because
it is selecting from post these things
in here but if we do this and we do
actually have many different types of
posts inside our table called post then
we're gonna change every single one of
the posts in there and teams the subject
and the content of all of them now maybe
we don't want that because let's say we
only want to change the post of a
certain user who did actually write the
post so let's actually go and say we're
and then we're gonna say ID is equal to
1 so we're only gonna change the post
where the ID is equal to 1 so after I
run this well let's actually go ahead
and yeah that's actually going to run
this and you guys will see if we get one
row affected now if I go down to post
you can see that we do actually have
some different content in here we have
this as a test and this is the content
so now we did actually change the text
in here and that's the basic way
updating works inside our database here
so now you guys can see what it actually
change the content and the subject so
that's the basic way updating works now
you can go a little bit more deep into
this and it's gonna get a bit more
complicated but for now this is all you
guys need to know in order to do
something with PHP code inside a
database so hope you guys enjoyed this
episode and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
