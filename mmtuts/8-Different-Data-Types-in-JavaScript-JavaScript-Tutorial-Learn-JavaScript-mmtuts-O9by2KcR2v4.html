next episode on how to program the other
scripts now in this episode we're going
to talk about something called data
types which might not sound as the most
exciting thing to talk about but it's
very important that you know about data
talk before you get into JavaScript so
in the last episode we talked about
something called variables and variables
and data types sort of go hand-in-hand
because we store data inside variables
who need to know about the different
types of data we then store inside
variables so when it comes to JavaScript
when we create a variable like we talked
about in the previous episode we do so
by declaring a variable by using the the
key would ba let me write the name of
the variable so we can call this one
name it one two and then we set it equal
to some kind of value or we can just
declare it and then not set equal to
anything so I'm just gonna go ahead and
set it equal to Daniel because it's my
name and what I want to point out here
with this example is that right now we
have a variable that is declared using
var and that is something that is sort
of a lazy way of declaring variables but
it's the way we do it in Santiago script
in other programming languages which
sometimes declare variables by defining
what kind of data that is inside this
variable so if we were to take another
programming language like C sharp we
would do so by saying that we have a
integer inside this variable for example
so instead of Bob we would say integer
and then use some kind of number because
that's a number an integer so in
JavaScript we just used the keyword
called BA in order to define that we
have a variable and this is going to be
relevant a little bit later on this
lesson when I start talking about how we
can actually figure out what kind of
data we have inside a variable because
right now we can't really see what kind
of data we have inside this specific
variable other than looking at the data
which is right here but when we look at
it inside the browser if we watch
actually console.log what we have here
console dot log parentheses and then put
this variable and log it inside my
console inside the
browser you're actually going to notice
that we just have Daniel but I can't
tell what kind of data this is even
though I could probably guess this is
going to be a string because it has
characters and it's a word but we can't
really tell by looking at the browser
here what exactly this type of variable
is so later on this episode I'm gonna go
and show you how to configure that out
but before then we're just gonna go and
talk about the different types of
variables that we have or different
types of variables for different types
of data we have inside JavaScript now
the first data type that I want to talk
about in this episode is something
called the string datatype and I did
just create an example of it right here
and a string is essentially we create a
word or sentence using characters now we
define a string by wrapping double
quotes around whatever word we want to
create and it's very important that when
you create text you need to make sure
you wrap that the text inside double
quotes otherwise it's not going to be
seen as a string which is what we call
text so if we were to remove these
double quotes and save in you can now
see we get a uncaught reference error
inside the browser because it doesn't
know what Daniel is defined as what kind
of data is Daniel so we need to make
sure that we go ahead and wrap double
quotes around the data here now we could
also go ahead and use single quotes so
were to just use single quotes like so
it's also going to work now there's not
really a big difference between using
double quotes and single quotes when it
comes to JavaScript but when we create a
string using for example single quotes
and I want to write some text inside of
it if I say Daniel is Nilsen because
that's my last name if I can actually
spell it correctly if I want to use
double quotes inside the actual string
as part of the text that I need to make
sure that I didn't use double quotes
around the string otherwise it's gonna
cancel out I don't know if you could
just hear my dog snoring he's right
underneath me otherwise it's gonna
cancel out the string and when I say
that I mean that if we were to actually
go here and do like this where I'm using
double quotes around the entire string
and
inside the string then you can see that
is has a different color and we get an
error inside the browser because we just
cancel out the string and continued it
afterwards which we can't really do so
in this example we could also say it's
why use a single quote in this example
the same thing goes we can't use single
quotes around it otherwise it's going to
give us an error now I do want to show
you another example here because this
might not be the best way of solving the
issue if you let's say you have a piece
of text that has both double quotes and
single quotes inside the actual text
then we can't really use the solution
where we just switched out the quotes
around the string so in this case we
would actually need to escape the simple
order the character that we use inside
the string so if I'm using single quotes
around the string and I want to use its
as part of the string then I need to
escape the single quote inside the
string does that make sense so what I
can do is I can write backslash right in
front of the single quote and now it's
going to escape the single quote and not
see it as part of you know defining a
string so if we were to save this you
can see that we still have the single
quote inside the browser if we could
actually zoom in so you could see it
there we go
and the same thing goes if it were to go
around a string and use double quotes
there we go save it and I can see we
escape the characters inside the string
so this would be the best way of doing
it if you were to use the string
wrapping inside the actual string now
I'm just going to go and create a
comment here so you know that this is a
string datatype so I'm gonna write
string data type there we go and then
I'm gonna go and go down to the next
line now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
go and create something called a numeric
data type which means numbers and I did
not write four slashes I need to make
sure I do that there we go now a numeric
data table is when we use numbers inside
variables and we basically have two
different types we can use the first
example here is going to be I'm just
gonna create a variable which I could
just call num1 set it equal to 1 which
will be a
number type inside a variable that we
could also do like this just to create
something longer and this is still going
to be a number type now we also have
something called a integer now an
integer if I just create another
variable here it's going to be a number
that has decimal points behind it so for
were to say this number here dot
something is going to be an integer so
just have some kind of decimal points
behind it and the same goes for negative
numbers if we were to go inside number
one if I were to write negative whatever
number we have here is still going to be
a number and if we were to go down to
next one here and do the same thing it's
still going to be an integer so
negatives and positives both go when it
comes to number types now there's
another thing I want to explain when it
comes to numeric and string data Tosh
because I might get questions about it
in the comments which is the fact that
if I were to create a string datatype
and just call it something like number
instead equal to a string and insert
some kind of number inside of the string
is this going to be a number data type
is are going to be a string datatype
well because we wrap double quotes
around it it's going to be a string
datatype so this is not going to be seen
as it will be seen as a number but not
as a string datatype so there's a
difference between using numbers and
using data types if you could say that
so so this is not going to be a number
data type it's going to be a string
datatype because it's inside double
quotes if that sort of makes sense now
the next type of data I want to talk
about is something called a boolean
which is something that we also use
quite a lot when it comes to using
javascript because a boolean is a true
or false statement and in JavaScript
would do a lot of things like conditions
which means that we say is this the same
as this over here or is this statement
true or false then do something inside
the code so we use boolean us a lot when
it comes to writing scripts inside
JavaScript so a boolean if I were to
just write a variable here I can just
say durable bool just to give it a name
set it equal to
or I could create one just gonna create
a new one
I said equal to false and we're just
gonna make sure we don't have the same
names for these variables here like so
now when it comes to boolean since a
JavaScript there's another thing I want
to show you which is that if I were to
create a third boolean down here called
a boolean a bull 3 and said equal to 1
it's going to be the same as setting it
equal to true because in programming one
is going to be true and 0 is going to be
false so I'm just going to uncreated
here so the first statement up here is
going to be the same thing as down here
and again false is going to be the same
thing as 0 so just in case you're aware
of it we can also use ones and zeros to
define true and false inside JavaScript
now the next one I want to talk about
something called undefined and undefined
is something that we did talk about in
the previous episode I do believe if I
remember correctly and undefined means
that we have a variable that does not
have any things that equal to it yet or
we haven't put any data inside the
variable so if we were to go ahead and
create a variable and call it something
like hey and just declared but not set
it equal to anything if it were to take
variable hey console lock it you're
going to see that we get undefined which
means that we have no value assigned to
this variable which brings me to the
next data type which is something called
null so we'll just go ahead and create a
comment to say we have something called
null data type which is not the same as
undefined a null data type is when we
take a variable and set it equal to
nothing so we do have something that we
can use to define they have it equal to
nothing because we don't want to have
undefined inside our variable here so
what I can do is I can say hey to set it
equal to null which is going to set
equal to it's the same thing as saying
it's equal to nothing but undefined says
that we haven't set equal to anything
which is different in JavaScript so
right now forward to echo out
hey to or not echo it out but console
log in you can see that we get null
inside our browser here now at the
beginning of this episode I mentioned
something about JavaScript being able to
tell what kind of data you inserted
inside a variable but we as humans if we
were to see it inside the browser might
not always be able to tell what kind of
data that's inside the variable so if we
want to actually know what type of data
we have inside the variable we can use
something called an operator which is
called type of so if we were to go
inside the console lock down here and
say we have something called type of
space it's going to go ahead and tell us
what kind of object or what kind of
object is just just written inside the
browser to set it but what kind of data
we have inside the variables so right
now you can actually see that no it says
is called an object and that is not true
but it's something about the browser not
being able to tell what exactly null is
for a data type so don't think about the
null being an object in this example
here you know the other data itself is
going to tell something different so
just ignore the fact that it says
objects inside the console because it is
a null datatype now for where to go
ahead and use name which is a string
datatype and paste it inside here you
can see it says string inside the
browser if we were to use num1 it's
going to see we have a uncaught whoops
let's actually insert the right place
it's going to tell us it is a number
data type and if we were to use the
second number we have up here which is a
integer it's going to also tells us a
number but it is in fact a integer
datatype even though it does say number
because it is essentially a number but
it's an integer does that make sense
now if it were to take the next one
called a boolean and insert it inside to
type off save in you can see we have a
boolean now we were to take this one
down here where we set it equal to one
it's going to tell us it's equal to a
number because essentially it is a
number it's not going to look at the
Herbal named just tell it that oh well
the variable name has pool in it so it
has to be a boolean it's actually going
to go and say it's a number but if you
were to use this in a condition inside
JavaScript which again we haven't talked
about yet you can use one since 0 to
define true and false so just know that
it's still a number data type but you
can use it as a boolean as well now if
we were to use the variable called hey
you're going to see we get undefined
which we already did inside this example
here so this is what we have when it
comes to data types inside JavaScript
and these are different types of data we
will be using in a different exercises
and you know scripts that we can write
using JavaScript when we create some
different examples and it's just a good
idea to know how to write these sense
you know graphing double quotes around
string and knowing how to escape
characters is a really good thing to
know about when it comes to JavaScript
so I hope you all enjoyed and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
