to create a table inside our database
and in this episode we're going to talk
about how to insert data into our table
now the way we're going to do this is
going to be done the exact same way when
we do actually get to the PHP code part
later on where we're going to you know
for example create a sign-up sheet where
people can type something in sign up on
your website and insert data into the
database now the code we're going to
write in this episode is going to be the
exact same coders they're going to use
when we do actually get to do that using
PHP code so it's very important you guys
memorize so at least try to remember the
code we're going to write in this
episode because we will actually be
using this again so what we're going to
do here is we're going to go ahead and
take a look at the table created in the
last episode using SQL code which is
called post and as you guys can see we
have no data inside this table so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to go back
to my PHP lessons you know database the
main part of it at least and then I'm
going to go to my SQL tab in here we can
write another line of SQL code so let's
pretend for a second that were inside a
forum inside a website and we're going
to the create post section on this forum
but we can actually type something in it
could be you know a subject the content
and the date and that sort of thing
so well let's actually take a look at
the post structure that we did actually
create in the last episode if you do
actually open it up in a new tab here
and go to structure you guys can see we
need to have an ID we need to have a
subject a content and a date so what I'm
going to do here is I'm actually going
to go back to our SQL code writing part
and I'm going to write insert into and
then we need to select the table that
we're going to insert data into in this
case it's going to be post because we
actually created that one in the last
episode so I'm going to write posts
space parenthesis open and closed space
values space parenthesis and we're going
to write semicolon at the end here so
now we have the basic set up to actually
start inserting data into our table
called posts and the first parenthesis
we have here it's actually going to be
the part that
tells us at least tells the database
which part of the table we're going to
insert data into so as you guys can see
like I said we have an ID we have
subject content and date now the ID is
actually also incremented which we acted
in the last episode meaning that it's
automatically going to increase itself
by 1 so because this one is automatic we
don't actually need to insert data into
this one it does that all by itself so
all we need to worry about when we
insert data is to subject content and
date so if I go back again we can
actually say well the first one is going
to be subjects comma content comma and
date so now we can actually go into the
values and type in the value we want
into our rows women to go into the
columns call subject constant and date
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
go into the values parentheses I'm going
to write single quotes and inside here
I'm going to write the first piece of
data which is going to be the subject so
let's say we have a post and the subject
of this post could be this is the
subject okay so after this one we're
going to write the content I'm going to
write single quotes now I'm going to go
ahead and open up a website called leap
some dot-com which has a bunch of
fill-in text and this is just random
gibberish from based on
I think Latin so I'm just going to go
and copy some random filling text that
I'm going to you know paste into our
content in here like so and afterwards
at the very end here I'm going to go
ahead and say comma and now I need to
write the date now when it comes to the
date we did actually decide that we
wanted hours as a date-time format as we
have down here in the type which means
that we're going to have it as well
let's actually go ahead and write single
quotes first first we need to have the
year which is going to be in our case
2015 or these late 2015 - and let's say
it is the 14th of November so I'm going
to say 11
that's 14 space and now we need to write
the time because we did access a
date-time format so right now it is 1638
where I'm sitting like so then we need
to write the milliseconds as well which
means that it is going to be I don't
know zero one doesn't really matter in
this case but now that we have this we
can actually go ahead and submit this so
forward to just copy it so we have it
copied just for safety we did actually
talk about a separate document in last
episode where we you know have all this
stuff saved if we did actually insert
into the database you know just in case
we need to write it again it would be
quite annoying to write all this again
so now I'm going to go ahead and go down
here which says go I'm going to hit it
and it says one row insert it so now
connect to go into my post in here and
as you guys can see we have an ID as one
because it's automatically going to be
inserted we have a subject we have the
content and we have a date so now that
we have this we have one piece of data
inside our database and like I said the
code we just used inside our SQL is
going to be the same code we're going to
use when we do actually get to insert
data inside the code of a website so
when we write our PHP code
well actually going to be referring or
we're actually going to be writing SQL
code inside our PHP code which then runs
the SQL code from PHP into the database
and does something with the database
depending on the SQL code we wrote
inside the PHP code so if that sounds a
bit confusing right now don't worry
about it we will actually get to do it
and when we actually do it it might be a
little bit more simple than from what I
just said at this moment so I hope you
guys enjoyed this episode this is
basically when we're going to focus on
in this episode so hope you guys enjoyed
this episode and I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
