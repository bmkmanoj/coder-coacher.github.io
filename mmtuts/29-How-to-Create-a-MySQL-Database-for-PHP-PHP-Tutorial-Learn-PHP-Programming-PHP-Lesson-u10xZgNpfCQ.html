introduction to databases which means
we're going to talk about what exactly a
database is and we're going to talk
about which tool we're going to use to
actually create a database now I know
some of you new people who's never done
databases before databases might seem a
little bit scary in the beginning but I
want you guys to realize we're not going
to do anything really complicated with
databases we're just going to learn the
basics for you guys to actually create a
database and use it inside a website so
having said that let's actually talk
about what exactly a database is now
let's say we have a website and inside
this website we need to save information
meaning that we might have a signup
system where people can go and create a
user account now in order to create a
user account they need to go in and type
in the first name last name username
password that sort of thing and after
they've done that and they hit sign up
we need to save the information of that
person who just signed up now in order
to do that you need to have a database
because inside a database we save all
the information regarding what the user
just did so when they do actually log in
we can go into the database fits the
information and use it inside our
website to actually you know check if
the login has actually been correct now
the way we're going to create a database
is through something called PHP myadmin
and if you guys to actually have xampp
installed but you guys should actually
have because we've been using it for the
past many episodes you will have PHP
myadmin
installed on your computer already so
with xampp
actually running you know the Apache
MySQL servers you're going to go into
your browser go to your ul and type
localhost backslash PHP my admin' and
then you're going to come into this
website here now this is where we create
databases and as you guys can see I do
actually have quite a few over here in
the left side well I don't have quite a
few I just have a couple more than you
guys have and we're going to talk about
the panel here for this episode and
we're going to talk about how to
actually create a database so as you
guys can see we have a menu at the very
top here
that has a lot of buttons in it the one
we're interested in at least in the
beginning are the one called databases
and SQL now we do also have an export
and import over here which will actually
be relevant for later but for now let's
just go ahead and stick with databases
and SQL now on the left side here we
have a list of all the databases you do
already have created inside PHP myadmin
now there will be some here as a default
like I said there's going to be a couple
but just go ahead and ignore those for
now because you won't actually be using
them now to create a database we need to
go to our databases menu up here in the
top once you're in here we can actually
go down where it says create database
and type in a database name now a tip
for you guys don't use big letters and
don't use dashes go ahead and use small
letters and underscores if you have to
do something so let's actually go and
create a database here I'm going to call
mine PHP lessons now you guys can call
whatever you want you just need to
realize that if you call something
different than what I do here when I do
actually want to refer to the database
and I say you know type in PHP lessons
you guys need to type in the name of
your database instead so after I did
actually type this in I'm going to click
create so once I click create you can
see no tables found in database and then
we can actually create a table down here
you'll also notice that our new database
is actually added to our list on the
left side here called PHP lessons now
this is the one we're inside right now
so as you guys can see we have no tables
now the way databases work is that we
need to create tables and each table is
going to store information regarding one
certain thing so we might have one table
that stores information regarding you
know the user first name last name
username password email that sort of
thing and we might also have a table
that stores information regarding posts
let's say we have a forum inside a
website now in order for the use of tax
to go into the forum and write a message
they might need to write in the subject
of the message and actual message and
the date the message was actually
written and who wrote it now that sort
of information we also need to save and
that
typically goes into a table for itself
called maybe foreign posts or something
so in the next episode we're going to
talk about how texts to create these
tables and once you have created the
tables we can actually start going into
our coding again and try and go into our
database and fetch the information from
the database and learn how to actually
insert data into the database that's
also important but we're going to do
that in the next couple of episodes so
for now just go ahead and you know get a
little bit familiar with PHP myadmin
which is the tool we're going to use to
create databases and I do want to
mention that a lot of you know online
hosting companies where you buy a domain
name they will actually be using
phpMyAdmin for a lot of their databases
so PHP myadmin is a really good tool to
get familiar with and it's you know a
lot of them are very similar but PHP
myadmin is the most used one so get
familiar with this one if you have to
get familiar with one of them so I hope
you guys enjoyed this episode in the
next one we're going to talk about how
to execrate the tables so if you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
