episode I'm going to be talking about
how to hook up a Playstation or a xbox
controller to your computer now
sometimes you have games that you buy
either on Steam or you have it on disk
or something and it's not quite
optimized for the PC or maybe just want
to use a console you know controller for
your games on the PC you know whatever
your reason is I'm going to show you
guys how to hook it up it's very easy to
do so you know it's not complicated at
all even though some people want to make
it seem like it's complicated what
you're going to want to do is get a
program that is called motion joy game
pad tool okay and it's the one I just
opened up here now you're going to go to
this website to download it it's called
motion joy comm slash download and I'm
going to go ahead and leave the link in
the description so you guys can go and
get it when you go in here they will
update it sometime so you know right now
the newest version is the one called
zero point seven point one zero zero
zero okay testing so when you scroll
down there's could be a lot of versions
you know that gets older as you scroll
further down you're just going to
download the top one in this case like I
said you know zero point seven point one
that's one you're going to get it is a
32-bit and 64-bit in all so you know
whatever computer with whatever your
computer is running on you can just get
it download it install it okay after
you've done that and open it up it
should look like this okay
what you need to do first is you need to
have a controller ready in my case I'm
using a Playstation controller and you
need to have a USB just a very simple
USB it can be the one that comes with
your PlayStation when you get it it's
one of those regular USB and then on the
other side you have one of these let's
see if I can get it focused it's very
dark but it's a very basic plug is to
want to use to hook up your controller
to your PlayStation when you want to
recharge it okay it's very basic you
take this one and you stop it in your
computer like so and
inside your joystick like so and there
should be a little sound okay says now
it is hooked up your computer might have
to install the drivers software for it
first just let it finish after that when
you inside this program you're going to
go to drive manager after you hook up
your controller go to drive manager just
going to close down and open up again
with a new window in this one you're
going to want to go ahead and choose the
one you have hooked up in my case is to
one called
port number severs use your three okay
it actually has a check mark on the side
here that says you know you can use it
for motion joy I check it off and then
say load driver takes a second you're
going to want to wait for it okay and it
actually says here is completed okay so
go back to profiles and now when you get
here you're going to want to choose you
know depending on what game you're
playing in my case Dark Souls the one I
want to play for the PC it's made for
the PlayStation or the Xbox controller
and I know that I have an PlayStation
controller doesn't matter you can still
choose to one down here let me just go
over them really quick the three bottom
ones are the ones you're going to be
interested in well it's basically all
the presets for the different
controllers you can get the first one of
the third ones from the bottom is the
one for PlayStation 3 the second one is
the Xbox 360 controller and then you
have a custom default where you can
actually you know tell it which buttons
should lead to what on the computer so
in case like in like probably 90% of the
cases you won't even need to have to
customize it but in case you do you go
in there and you do it that way okay now
for Dark Souls for my example I'm going
to choose the one called
xbox 360 controller emulator I know it's
a PlayStation control it doesn't matter
you can still use it the same way the
plate the Xbox one has hooked up all the
PlayStation buttons the same way as it
is on the PlayStation you want to play
Dark Souls on the PlayStation don't tell
me why I don't know but it works the
same way you check that one off here ok
then you say enable and then if you
click vibration test
is actually vibrating right now I can
put it on the my desktop so you can hear
okay I'll test it again
it's working so that tells you that is
hooked up and it's not working all you
got to do now is start up your game and
it will work okay the same way as had
you opened up the game on the
PlayStation or the Xbox so that's
basically how you do it just open up the
game
don't close down this window okay you
need to have this program open the
motion to your gamepad tool have it open
while you play the game otherwise your
controller is going to get unhooked
again okay so that's basically it
there's nothing else to tell you guys
it's very simple to do if you don't know
like if let's say you play Dark Souls
there's another issue with the game for
like you can't save the game unless you
have it hooked up to the Microsoft gamer
games for Windows Live Network I have
another video where I tell you guys how
to fix that issue go ahead and take out
the description there should be a link
there for that too okay so thank you
guys for watching and I hope to see you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
