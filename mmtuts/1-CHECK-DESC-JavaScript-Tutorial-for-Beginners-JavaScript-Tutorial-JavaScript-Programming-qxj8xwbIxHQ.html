something called JavaScript which is one
of the basic programming languages you
want to learn if you want to become a
good front-end developer now javascript
is something that goes together with
HTML and CSS which is something you
should know by now so if you don't know
HTML CSS I recommend you guys go back
and learn about it first before you
start learning about JavaScript now to
give you guys an understanding about
what JavaScript actually does because I
remember back from when I was studying
how to become a web developer a lot of
people question what exactly javascript
could do inside a website so the very
basic way to explain is is that when you
learn HTML it is basically when you put
objects inside a website actual physical
things well digital physical things and
CSS is what determines how these things
should look like or how they should be
placed inside a website and JavaScript
is what determines how the behavior of
these things are going to be like
meaning that if I were to do something
inside the website whether being
clicking or scrolling or moving my mouse
cursor over something then JavaScript
tells the website that it has to do
something when the user does that
specific thing you know any kind of
input
now JavaScript should not be confused
with PHP because javascript is front-end
only which means that whenever you do
something with JavaScript that makes
changes to the website actual physical
changes then the changes are not going
to remain unless you have PHP involved
into it
PHP is a way to make a website more
interactive by actually making the
website remember stuff and JavaScript is
simply a way to change behavior on a
website now for the next couple of
episodes we're going to be talking about
some of the basic principles of
JavaScript and JavaScript is very
different from HTML CSS not just in the
coding language but also in the way
we're going to use it because HTML CSS
has kind of a similar way that it works
and it's kind of hard to explain when
you haven't actually done JavaScript
before so in the next couple episodes
I'm going to
I to show you guys maybe a couple of
examples of JavaScript and then we're
going to start learning about them and
actually learning how to do JavaScript
from beginners to advanced so if you
guys enjoyed this little introduction
here and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
