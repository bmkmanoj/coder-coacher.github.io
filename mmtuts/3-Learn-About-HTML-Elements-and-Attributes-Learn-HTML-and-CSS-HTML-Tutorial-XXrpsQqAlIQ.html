set up new project one one to create a
website and we also learn how to create
a new page inside the website so in this
episode I'd like to talk a bit more
about the tags to create it in the
previous episode and the different types
of text we have inside HTML so when it
comes to tags inside HTML we also call
these HTML elements and when it comes to
elements we have two different types we
have regular HTML elements and then we
also have empty elements now in the
previous episode we talked about opening
and closing tags and these are in fact
the regular HTML elements we have inside
HTML in some cases we also have empty
elements which attacks it does not have
a closing tag like the meta tag we
created in the previous episode which
has information regarding the characters
who want to use inside the website so as
you guys can see when it comes to HTML
we have text that has opening and
closing tags and text that doesn't have
closing tags now if you guys were to ask
them well how can we tell which ones
need and doesn't need a closing tag well
it's just one of those things you learn
along the way as you start programming
HTML and there's not really a way for me
to teach you guys which one does need a
closing tag before we actually start
using them inside our lessons here so in
the previous episode we also talked a
bit about the different tags to be used
inside the front page of a website here
which is called index of HTML so as you
guys continue the previous episode we
created a pair of HTML tags it basically
says that all the content goes in
between these tags will be part of the
HTML document we can actually move this
out which is a tip that I recommend for
you guys so we can actually see the
hierarchy inside the website so whenever
we have stuff going inside a pair of
text like the HTML tags then we want to
move out the content once by clicking
tap so we can actually see that this
goes in between these two tags here and
as you guys can see that actually do the
same in the previous episode inside the
head tags where we moved out the title
tag and the meta tag because they go
inside the head tag and just to refresh
it for you guys in case you forgot the
head tag has information in it that we
don't actually visibly see inside the
page when we do exit open up the web
site inside the browser such as the
title of the website which pops up
inside the tab at the top we also have
meta information which is information
regarding the website that we don't
actually see inside the website such as
which character type we want to use we
also have links that go to other
documents in case you want to
the stylesheet which is actually where
we can design all the elements we have
inside the body tag down here and the
body tag is actually what defines what
actually needs to be seen inside the
website so all the content we put in
between the body tags will in fact pop
up inside the website and be visible so
as you guys can see words actually go
back to the website we do actually have
hello world because I wrote it inside
the body tag now when it comes to these
HTML elements we have quite a few of
them inside HTML we're not going to
cover all of them in this episode we're
just going to cover the ones we have
here and then maybe just a cover more
distance or got some examples but when
it comes to HTML elements we also have
something called attributes and we
actually used an attribute in the
previous episode up here inside the meta
elements as you guys can see we included
a char set which is equal to some kind
of value which means that we have an
attribute called char set which is
basically just a way to add extra
information inside these tags which will
then use for different things such as
that they want to add extra
functionality to this tag here then I
can actually go ahead and add extra
attributes to it so let's actually go
and go down inside the body tag and
create another tag called a paragraph
tag now a paragraph tag is the proper
way for us to actually insert text
inside the website so the paragraph tag
will create by just writing P and then
tap and then as you guys can see we get
destroyed cut for the paragraph text
inside HTML so inside these tags we can
actually go and say something like hello
world or this is text or something else
and then you could go back inside the
browser and refresh the browser you guys
can see that the styling or these two
design slightly changed when I clicked
the refresh button and that's because
right now because browser set default
styling when it comes to some tanks like
the paragraph tags if my teens to design
when you insert tags around the content
so what we can do is you can actually go
back inside the file and I can go inside
the paragraph tag at least inside the
opening tag and then include a couple
attributes if I want to so I can exit go
and give it something called the title
which is equal to double quotes and then
I could say something like this is some
websites content
then afterwards actually saved this go
inside the browser refresh and then
hover my mouse cursor on top of the text
you guys can see get some text inside a
little pop-up that says this is some
website content so the attribute tags
just simply adds extra information or
extra functionality inside the website
now to give you guys an example of this
let's say I want to style this text I
can X go and use something called a
style attribute inside the paragraph
text I'm going to say style it's equal
to Delta quotes then I can actually
start creating CSS code inside the style
tag here so we want to change the color
of the text I can say color call 1 red
semicolon save it then go inside my
browser so you guys can see that now the
text turns red so just to show you guys
a couple examples of attributes inside
HTML these are some of them that we
could actually use and there's quite a
few attributes inside HTML but we're
just going to go and focus on these two
in this episode now so we do actually
move on this lesson C will actually talk
more about attributes and HTML elements
that you will need to use inside a
website such as a menu or a title inside
your website but we're going to go and
talk more about these text if you have a
social now so this is basically one to
show you guys in this episode in the
next episode we're going to talk more
about how to insert text inside a
website hope you guys enjoyed and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
