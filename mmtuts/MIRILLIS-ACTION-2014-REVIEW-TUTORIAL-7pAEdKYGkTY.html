this one I'm gonna take a look at but
really it's action screen recorder and
the reason I'm doing this video is
actually because I do have an older
version where I was sort of comparing
fraps to marilla's action that are
upload to YouTube and you can't really
rely on that video anymore because it's
getting really outdated there's a lot
newer versions out there of both fraps
and melilla section and I still see a
lot of people commenting on that video
and it kind of frustrates me because
that's an older version and a lot of the
mistakes that action or fraps had back
then has been fixed by today so I sort
of wanted to do an update I wanted to do
like a 2014 review and get all excited
here and show you guys what kind of
features has been added and what box has
been removed and stuff so this is go
ahead and jump straight into it here as
you guys can see I'm actually using
fraps sorry not fraps marilla's action
to record my screen right now and as you
can see there's actually two sections to
it you have to the left section here
where you have all the videos to record
it you have the right section over here
which shows you all the different
settings for it and up in the corner you
should have the frames per second
counter which shows how long have you
been recording and stuff okay so let's
just go out and start with the little
recording icon up in the corner here the
little frames per second counter one
difference between fraps
and action is that action tells you how
long have you been recording which i
think is so good because if I'm
recording something I need to upload to
YouTube if I like to upload 15 minutes
videos and I don't like to record 20
minutes
or something like that I can see exactly
when I need to stop the video it is so
nice I think so you know having that
little thing up there really helps you
compared to fraps now if you take a look
at this dashboard here you can actually
see that over here the left side you can
choose where do you want to save your
videos now this is where to save it raw
footage not when you export it okay you
can actually when you record something
like this video here if I go down to the
bottom here you can either preview it by
playing it inside or loose action or you
can choose to open the output folder or
you can actually export the file which I
don't really get because you can
actually take the raw footage put it
inside a editing program and just use
you don't need to export it so I don't
know why they have it down there but
there must be some sort of you guys out
there who have an idea about why you
should use export so I'm just gonna
leave that for now if you do decide to
upload your footage directly to Facebook
or YouTube you can do that too down here
so that's a kind of a nice feature I'll
be on the right side let's just go ahead
and take a look at the menu up here you
can have the video recording setting
live recording setting audio recording
setting benchmarks setting screen shot
setting and the regular settings and
then up here you can actually see what
sort of version am i recording with
right now as you can see it's one point
nineteen point 2.0 and I am the one
licensed for this okay so you're not
being said about the version let's just
go ahead and dive straight into the
video recording settings here now as you
can see it actually shows me what button
do I need to click in order to start
recording up here you cannot change that
here you actually do need to go into
settings and change it where it can get
a little annoying but it's okay because
I don't mind going into the settings to
change it down here you do actually have
the recording mode am i recording the
applications or games am i recording
desktop or do you want to record a
certain section of my screen now fraps
does not have that feature I need to
point that out if you do want to record
with fraps you can only record the full
screen for that down here you have the
file format you can choose avi or mp4
now I have it on a VI not because I like
avi but because avi is the only format
it will allow you to record a 1080
pixels okay if you choose mp4 you have
to record of 720 pixels you cannot go to
1080 now that did have a older version
of mirillis action screen recorder where
you can choose another kind of mp4 and
it would actually allow you to record a
1080 I do not know why they removed it
again maybe it crafts for some people
maybe did something it shouldn't do but
you can't do that anymore
down here you can choose the video frame
rate there's so many settings in here
now you cannot type in a customized
frame rate you want to record that like
you cannot fraps but it has everything
from 15 I think till 120
so you don't need more or less than that
now one thing I need to point out here
is that if you do decide to use your
footage for YouTube
no matter the frame rate you require
that when you upload to YouTube YouTube
will make your recording 30 frames per
second okay so if you choose 60 the only
difference is gonna make us that it's
gonna make your the amount of space that
your footage take up and your hard disk
it's gonna increase that it's not gonna
do anything more than that
so of learning to YouTube you don't need
more than 30 frame ah 30 frames per
second down here you can choose the
duration how long do you want to record
now I did not take this one off because
I would like to just record infinitely
until I run out of space on my hard disk
if I do so but he can actually choose
how many hours minutes seconds do you
want to record as soon as you hit that
record button down here you have
something called use perfect video
Matt's mode now if you just do regular
video game recording or desktop
recording you don't need this on it's
only used for special circumstances and
I don't remember what those are but you
can actually click this little icon here
it will open up and tell you about it
you can also just go through the website
and read what it is down here you have
the record system sounds which actually
means that do you want to record the
sound that is coming out of your
computer let's say you're playing a game
do you want to record the game sounds
then you need to make sure you have that
checked off because if you have that
checked off or like not ticked off then
you can't hear anything from the game so
you do need to make sure you have that
one checked on then he can allow it from
multi-channel audio recording now the
reason I do not have that one checked
off is because I am not recording my
microphone inside the mirillis action
screen recorder I do actually use
audacity when I record my sound and then
I merged it into my video afterwards
because I have bad experience with using
screen recorder for recording sound
mainly because I don't I don't have the
option to customize it as much but you
can choose it if you do not want to
spend a lot of times customizing your
audio afterwards you can just record
with your screen recorder if you go to
the live settings here there's actually
two menus down here and I'm not going to
show you the left one because it
actually shows some personal information
that I do not want you guys to to get
your hold off so I'm just going to show
you guys the right one he
now in here if you do pay extra and yes
I did say you do need to pay extra to
get this feature here this is the only
feature you need to pay extra for by the
way you can actually do live streaming
now there's another program called
OBS that you can download open
broadcasting software I think it's
called that you can use instead of this
and it's free so there's no reason to
get this feature at all but you can get
it and it's basically just recording and
you know which format you want to record
that and then do live streaming and
actually give you the option here of if
you want to also save the footage that
you record instead of just live
streaming it and not you know saving it
anywhere so it's not that important
because it's not that good so I'm just
going to move on here inside here you
have the audio settings you can actually
choose the duration for the audio
settings just like you could with the
video you can choose the output format
if it's valve or mp4 audio now I usually
choose wove because I like it better
when I have to edit it down here you can
also choose you want multi-channel audio
recording just like you could in the
video section and you can also choose if
you want to record silence now what that
means is basically that let's say you're
doing a gameplay and you're not always
talking the moments that you're not
talking the microphone will cut off and
not record anything now I don't really
see why you should not have that one
checked on cuz you know record the
silence is pretty much what everyone
does nowadays so you can't just leave it
on and just leave it there and down here
you can actually choose if you do not
want to record with the microphone if
you always want to record with the
microphone or if you want to be able to
hold down a specific button in order for
it to record so I'm just gonna leave it
at not record going over here to the
benchmarking settings we have basic
benchmarking there's not a lot of
options in here and this shouldn't
really be you can take off the duration
and just say how long do you want to
benchmark and then you can start it down
here or you can just click the whatever
start/stop benchmark recording preset
button is this f11 it says but I don't
really use benchmarking that much so I'm
not going to get too much into it over
here we have two screenshot settings I
don't use this a lot either but just
really quickly the file format they have
BMP PNG and JPEG okay down here you can
choose what area do you want to do the
screenshot at now you can either choose
the entire desktop or if you're like me
I have two different monitors you can
choose desktop one that's up to over
here in the regular settings you can
actually see that we have the general
settings here but I can actually choose
the language and it does actually have
quite a few languages you can choose
from which i think is pretty nice
over here you can choose the application
to always be on top when you do open up
other softwares let's say I would mob
audacity here now as you can see
audacity went on top of my real attacks
and screen recorder window if you check
that one off the mirillis action will
always be on top no matter what I don't
see why you need to have it on but you
know you can choose to if you want so
down here you can choose if you always
wanted to take for updates with that
thing should be on because I always want
to have the latest one you can also
choose to start the application minimize
to trace and when you actually do start
off the program you don't see it in the
window like you do here but it actually
just go down in the in the bottom of the
screen and go down there you can also
decide if you want to hide the eggs in
window and desktop recording as soon as
you start recording which as you can see
I don't have because it's not hidden but
you can actually hide it as soon as you
click the start down he can also choose
if you want to like show action window
when desktop recording is finished which
basically means that when you hit stop
recording the action window will pop up
here and you can straightaway export or
whatever you want to do and the bottom
here you can actually enable action
remote control which by the way I do not
know what is I should probably have read
into that but I do not know what that
one is there's so many features in here
I do not know all of them so you have to
bear with me if I go into the video
settings here you can access it if you
can choose the quality now there's low
normal and high quality don't go for
high because the only thing if you
choose normal it is as good quality as
any other screen recorder out there is
it is as good quality as you see right
now on the screen well you guys can see
it because you're seeing the video but
as I am watching the screen that's how
good quality it is when I choose normal
you don't need higher the only thing it
does is this add egg
sir gigabytes to your raw footage okay
so just choose normal you don't need
more than that then he have the bid rate
mp4 which I don't know what is sorry
guys
but you can actually change it here you
can also choose the input range and
there's two different kinds of options
here now I don't know what it could
range is either sorry guys but I bet
there's a lot of you hardcore recording
screen nerds out there who knows what
that is so you can always google it then
here you can choose to use multi core
recording and I do have that one on
multi core recording is called and you
can also - - you can also choose to
record the mouse cursor as you record as
you can see you can actually see my
mouse cursor which i think is pretty
important when I'm doing the review but
you can actually check it off and then
you guys can't see it anymore so you can
also choose to visualize the mouse
clicks so if you check that one off when
I click you can actually see either like
circles coming out from my curse or
something like that so it's just going
to visualize every time I click so you
guys can follow easier then the bottom
here it has a really nice feature which
is overlay graphic settings basically if
you have some sort of logo or something
like that you want to put on top of your
video you can check that one off choose
a file and choose where to put it
okay now going into the webcam settings
you can actually do the same thing here
you can actually choose to put the
webcam on top of your recording when
you're recording I do not use that
because I do not use my webcam for
recording I actually use a professional
camera but you can actually choose that
in here just to show you guys actually
can I do that this is I'm recording I'm
going to test it out let's see you can
choose to not record always record or
record on button down okay
I'm gonna choose just do not record
right now and if you see down here can
actually choose to webcam you want to
record from I can either choose do not
record or the webcam that I do have here
then you can choose the video size like
how big do you want your webcam or face
cam to be and then he can actually add
another webcam which I don't see the
need for but you can actually do it so
let's go ahead and see it appear view on
I do not know if this is gonna screw up
my recording so I'll just try it and I
well you guys can see me
but uh yeah it did not screw up my
recording good good good but you can
actually see you can actually see where
you're recording your webcam you can
adjust it you can move it around stuff
like that so going into the sound sorry
the microphone settings here you can
actually see that you can choose which
audio device to record from this is if
you do choose to record on a microphone
on top of your footage okay so you can
choose if you want to use my
professional microphone that I'm using
right now or if I want to choose my
webcam microphone which I'm not going to
because it sucks down here you can
choose the volume you can also choose to
record microphone into separate audio
tracks which by the way is really useful
like I said I use audacity to record
because it gives me an option the option
that I can actually customize it more
when I have to post edit it but if you
do this you can actually just use this
one instead you don't need to use
audacity I'm only using audacity because
I'm really comfortable with it and I
have never tried to speak to before so
it kind of scares me a bit down here you
have two system sounds which means that
you know which you know speaker or like
when you record a gameplay for example
if I have more speakers or more head
headsets put into my computer which one
do I want to record the sound from so
I'm just gonna put up a default down
here is one heck of a nice feature
it's called audio balance now if in do
you choose to use your microphone to
record voice over as you're doing game
play you can experiment a bit here and
actually choose how much microphones did
you hear compared to gameplay sound
which so many screen recorders lack I
cannot tell you how important this
little feature is and how few screen
recorders actually do have it it is so
awesome if I did in fact not choose to
do extra stuff and actually edit my
sound afterwards I'm done recording this
feature would be so good for me to use
so having this thing here's a big plus
down here there's something called AAC
bitrate which by the way sorry guys I do
not know what is something about
kilobits per second I would guess that
the more kilobits per second the better
quality but the more space it takes up
that's my guess
up here we do have the HUD setting
you can choose if want to hide the hut
settings during desktop recording I
actually have that one checked on
usually but since I want to show you
guys to the frame rate counter up in the
corner which by the way I do hope that
I'm showing you guys I have that one
checked off okay then he can also choose
to not record the hut in games and
applications now if you're doing a
gameplay video and you want to other to
youtube if you do not want other people
to see the little icon up in the corner
it shows the framerate and how long
you've been recording just check that
one on because you don't need to show
people that down here you can choose to
hide the HUD on action startup which
means that basically you can't see the
hot up here in the corner when you start
acting up now I don't I'm gonna I want
to see it so I'm just gonna leave that
one off and down here you can actually
choose where to show the HUD settings
the hot positioning so you can choose in
the middle Corner corner middle go on a
corner and up or down and if you do - ah
if you do change this as you can see it
does not change right away you do
actually need to shut down the program
and start it up again before this change
takes into effect over here we have the
export settings and this is what I was
mentioning up here you actually have the
raw footage stored option went down here
when you choose to export it down in the
bottom here you can choose where to
export it to so this is also very
important one to use if you do actually
choose to export your photos every time
and here you can choose to use Hardware
excellent hardware acceleration for
video encoding which by the way I don't
know what that is
I only have one option here so there's
nothing much I can do about it
down there you can also choose if you
want to export the mouse cursor which I
believe if you take that one off like
don't take it on if you do have your
mouse cursors showing in your recording
and will actually take it off if you
export it I'm not sure I haven't tried
it before but that's my guess the same
thing down here with the export mouse
clicks visualization when you click and
you have that one on which shows where
to click you can also choose not to
export that down here we have the upload
settings if you do upload to YouTube
you're probably gonna need to type in
your password and username so it can
actually upload so you don't just upload
to someone
I'm account and you can choose that it
always remembers your password you don't
have to do it every single time you can
also automatically split the files into
parts which is a really nice feature if
you are a youtuber and you don't want
more than 15 minutes to be on each
episode you upload you can check that
one on and will only upload 15 minutes
at a time last setting I want to mention
here is the hot key settings hid in here
is actually where I need to go if you
want to change the hot key for video
recording audio recording benchmarking
screenshots blah blah blah etc if you do
want to change them you do need to just
you don't need to click it if I click it
nothing happens but you need to hover on
top of it and click another button and
then it changes okay
very basic that's pretty much what I had
for the dashboard now I want to talk
about a couple of the features that has
been added or improved over the time
with this software at the moment if you
do want to record on a Windows 8
computer you cannot use fraps for
desktop recording you can use it for
game play recording but on Windows 8 you
cannot desktop record which I'm doing
right now I'm a realist action however
if you're on Windows 8 you can use
Windows recorder desktop aa bit my
tongue desktop recording so that is a
huge plus to mirillis action I'm not
saying that
fraps will never be able to Windows 8
desktop record that's not what I'm
saying I'm saying right now as I
uploaded this video fraps cannot record
the desktop okay so right now I would
say action screen recorder is - leading
screen recorder at the moment for
Windows and it's just such a shame that
fraps does not record the desktop and I
know they will have to fix it otherwise
they're gonna pretty much get outrun by
all the competitors but it will probably
be added in the future now another thing
I want to mention here is that if you do
record gameplay if you use action scream
recorder now it will not crash your
games at least I have not experienced it
yet to be crashing my games if you go
back a year to some of the older
versions of marilla's action
yes it will crash a lot of your games
and sometimes it wouldn't even start up
my open up action scream quote it
wouldn't even start there has been so
many bucks
in the past stuff that didn't work
you couldn't even open the software all
of that has been fixed now at least in
this version it has been fixed and I'm
so happy because my leading screen
recorder right now that one I'm using
for all my gameplay all my desktop
recordings on YouTube at the moment is
from action so really hands off action
for really improving the software's so
much that it's so good
another thing is that if you're actually
recording something and your game
crashes and you don't get to click that
stop recording button I have not
experienced yet that my files get
corrupted when that happens
fraps does not do it either it doesn't
recur up the dealer but action used to
actually corrupted and it doesn't
anymore
which I experienced on my computer at
least but other than that I don't think
there's a lot more differences if I had
to recommend a screen recorder I would
recommend action cuz it is I think it's
better I use the fiber thing I did
actually use play cloth screen recorder
to record this tutorial of this review
my first time I went through this review
this is actually my second time
recording it and play cloth screwed up
my recording so I'm gonna do another
review on play cloth it's not gonna be
nice but I will in fact review it the
reason I do have play cloths can record
is because if you do actually have a
game that you have to remember all
screen recorders will lower your
framerate as soon as you start recording
a game it will lower your frame rate
does matter which one you're using but
some screen recorders lowered less than
others and play cloth screen recorder is
really famous for not lowering the the
frames per second that much that's why I
have it because when I have my old
computer I desperately needed it to
record some of my gameplay now that I
have a better computer I don't need play
claw at all but that's for another time
so I hope you guys find this useful
don't forget to leave a like or
subscribe to me that would be very
helpful and I hope to see you guys later
