talking about something called upper
Raiders inside PHP and in this episode
we're just going to focus on the type
called arithmetic operators now as you
guys can see I did actually echo out
five inside my code and inside my
browser we didn't have five if I go back
to my code and say five plus five the
plus symbol is actually what we call an
arithmetic operator so it's basically
you know math operators the views inside
math and that sort of thing so right now
we can actually add five if i refresh we
get ten so we can use plus symbols we
can use minus symbols we can also divide
by writing by class you can also
multiply by writing multiplication or
what you call its star and we have two
more that I want to talk about so we
also have one called a modulus and a
modulus is when we use percentage so
basically what this does is that it goes
in and say okay we have five divided by
five and how much do we have left over
so if I were to save this refresh my
browser you guys can see we get zero
because right now five divided by five
has no leftovers if I were to change the
five to an eight instead we should
actually have three inside our browser
because you know 8 divided by 5 is 1
into the 8 and then we have 3 left over
so if we go to refresh we get 3 now we
also have one called a exponentiation
which is when we use multiply multiply
in between them instead so this is
basically when we say let's just go and
change this one to 5 when we say 5 to
the power of 5 you know when you have 5
and then you have a small 10 in the
corner inside your math equations and
then it says you know 10 to the 5 so if
you were to say 5 to the power of 5
refresh we get 3125 if you were at you
know if we were to just say to you'll
get something like 25 which is right
here so these are some of the basic
arithmetic operators we have inside PHP
and this is really all we're going to
talk about this episode in the next
episode we're going to cover something
called an assignment operator so we guys
enjoyed this one and I'll see you guys
next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
