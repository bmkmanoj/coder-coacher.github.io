a vlog episode since it's been quite a
while since the last one and a lot of
things has happened since the last vlog
episode so I thought I would do an
actual video and upload it to YouTube
since I've been using my community tab
inside my channel to notify all my
subscribers but I know not everyone is
using the the community tab inside you
know YouTube channels so I wanted to
make an actual video explaining what
exact has been going on with my life
throughout the past couple of weeks in
the past couple of months since as you
can see a lot of things as teens if
you've been following my vlog episodes
from time to time so just to sort of
update the people who hasn't been
following this channel for what the past
year or so what happened was I moved
into an apartment with my girlfriend
that was on paper affordable but when we
moved in it became apparent that it was
way more expensive than we initially
thought it was going to be so we lived
in an apartment that was too expensive
to live in and because it cost money to
moved to new place we also couldn't
afford moving out of the apartment to a
new place so we were sort of in a rough
situation because we didn't have any
money to do either those things and then
we came home with sort of a drastic
solution to it which was to move to a
camper and live in it which is not
really something you do in Denmark which
is where I live
it's sort of seen upon as a weird
solution for people who are sort of
bankrupt but we decided to do that
because it was the cheapest solution for
us if we wanted to work doing the jobs
that we wanted to do which in my case
was to do YouTube full-time and when you
want to do YouTube full-time and you
you're not that big yet and because
teaching channels on YouTube usually
don't earn as much as other channels on
YouTube that was sort of the solution we
came out with so for many months we
lived at a camper and there was a couple
of issues that sort of started appearing
which was the fact that in winter time
it's very cold in a camper second of all
the camper we lived that at least the
camping spot we were at
a lot of water problems when I was
raining and it was a lot of snow so each
time we came out from the camper we sort
of went into a pit of water which was
not really that fun each time we had to
go you know shopping or anything like
that inside the city so there was just
in general a lot of issues with it such
as they closed down the water supply to
mention something they closed down the
showers they closed off the hot water so
we had to go down to the city to get
showers and such so we were sort of at a
spot what we just couldn't take it
anymore but we couldn't afford moving
anywhere but what ended up happening was
that the campus bought the place we were
staying at that allowed for us to move
our address to the place because we need
to have an actress at the place you live
they allowed for us to move the address
to the place and they've been doing it
for a couple of years for all the people
living there because we weren't the only
people living there and suddenly we got
a letter saying that they had to go to
court because apparently they were not
allowed to let people live there
permanently with an address and
everything and here in Denmark we have
free health care and what comes with
free health care is that you have to
have your doctor at the same place that
you have your address so if I have an
address in the city I was living in I
needed to also have the doctor in that
city so we had sort of an issue here
because we couldn't just move our actors
to a family member and still live in the
camper which we were permitted to do if
we wanted to so we did actually need to
move away from the camping place and
then what ended up happening was we were
actually allowed to move into this place
which is actually well I can't I can't
actually talk about this place because
it's sort of a sensitive area still it's
sort of lock in bad luck that I'm I'm
living here with my girlfriend now so
it's sort of sensitive and I can't
really talk about why I moved here but
the fact is that one the thing I want to
mention is that I do actually have a
place to stay now and as you can see
this also involves having an actual
office where I have proper sound
isolation I have a lighting
things so connected start doing this
channel in a professional way not inside
a camper because I did actually use to
have a tent outside the camper when we
were living at the camping spot that
were sort of insulated and everything
and it was just it was it was doable but
there was a lot of planes and cars and
stuff driving by the tent all the time
so he could hear the microphone from
time to time and I had to stop recording
and then I had to start recording again
all the time
now something want to do in the future
with my videos here on the channel is I
want to actually include my face
with the face cam inside my videos to
make it more personal because one thing
I want to do with the channel is to make
it more personal so you feel like I'm
actually talking to you and we have eye
contact if that makes sense so I want to
add my face cam to the videos and in a
way that is not you know taking up a lot
of space but just to make it sort of
personal so I hope that is something
that effects the videos in a positive
way so I'm just gonna test it out and if
it doesn't really work out then you know
I tried it so it's gonna be something
I'm gonna do for next couple of videos
at least so besides all that I just want
to just take out the last 30 seconds or
so saying thank you for all the support
you've given me on YouTube and
supportive the fact that I wanted to do
this full-time it's not something I was
a lot well allowed it was not something
I was permitted to do before because
it's not really a lucrative business to
do YouTube at least as a job and the
support you guys have given me and all
the you know that they use and the
subscribers that's been coming in
throughout the past couple of months
have been huge and the channel has grown
quite a lot in a short amount of time
since I've started doing this full-time
and it's only because YouTube works in
the fun way if I put content out there
that you guys like and you like the
videos and you watch it and don't get
bored by the content it effects my
videos in a positive way and I show up
more often when people search for videos
and the only reason I can pop up on
search feeds
is a direct result of you guys liking to
watch my videos so it's something that I
really appreciate that I'm getting this
really positive feedback on my content
so I just want to say thank you for the
support you've given me so I think this
was pretty much what I want to say in
this video I hope you guys enjoyed and I
will be seeing you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
