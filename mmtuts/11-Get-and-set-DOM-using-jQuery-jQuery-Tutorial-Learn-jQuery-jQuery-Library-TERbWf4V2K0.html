manipulation inside jQuery and Dom
manipulation is something use quite
often either in JavaScript or jQuery so
it's very important we know how to
update or change the dumb inside jQuery
or JavaScript so before we get started
I'd like to explain what exactly the
dump is so you guys who don't know what
it is notice exactly what we're getting
into here so when it comes to a website
like the one I have here which is just a
basic example we can actually go ahead
and update some of the content or the
styling or the structure of the website
without having to refresh the browser
and that's because right now we have
some information regarding this page
here saved inside the dump such as the
text or the HTML code that is around the
text all of this is being saved or
stored inside the dump and what take we
allow for us to do is actually change
this so we can actually update whatever
the content is inside the website so
what I could do it just to serve as an
example of the dumb is that I can
actually right click on any kind of
element inside the website and go down
to inspect which is a developer tool
that we have inside most browsers I can
click it and then you guys can see we
have basically the Dom now inside of
here you can see HTML code we can see
scripts you can see the console down
here that tells us if we have any kind
of errors inside a website or something
else and we have the styling over here
in the right side so words actually go
in here and click on something change it
click enter you guys can see we change
the content inside the website which is
because I went inside the done and
changed some of the elements now there
are some differences when it comes to
them like we can say that this developer
tool is exactly like the dump because
sometimes it changes in some rare
examples but just to make it very simple
the developer tool very close to
represents what we have inside the Dom
so inside the text editor you guys can
see we have a pair of script tags which
right now has nothing inside of it
except for the document ready function
we have in jQuery we also have a couple
of paragraph text and hit the bottom
which are the two paragraphs you guys
saw inside the website both of these
have AIT sets you test 1 and test 2
then I have an input down here at the
bottom that says test three as an ID
which means that we can actually grab
these using the IDs which is why I gave
them an ID we also have a couple of
buttons at the bottom that allow for us
to do something when click the buttons
what I would like to do in this episode
is when I click the first button for
example called
text then I would like to show what is
inside the dumb when it comes to test
one which is going to be the content
that is inside the paragraph tags so the
dumb methods we have inside takers are
very good ways for us to get data or
content or change data and content or
structure inside our website undergo
just by doing something like clicking a
button so how are you going to add my
jQuery code I'm going to say want to
have a selector I'm going to select the
button down here that has an ID set to
button 1 and then I want to have a quick
function so we do something when we
click this button down here now inside
the click function I'm going to say we
have a function that it's going to grab
another selector we're going to create
another selector which is going to grab
a ID set to s tag test 1 and then I
would like to get the text that's inside
this paragraph here so I'm going to say
dot text parentheses semicolon and this
is basically going to get the text we
have inside the dumb when it comes to
the paragraph here now I'd like to
actually alert this so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to say we have a alert
function and put this inside the alert
like so and just kind of close off the
semicolon after the alert so now we
should be getting the text inside this
paragraph here so we're to go back
inside my browser refresh and then click
text you guys can see we get the actual
text from inside the paragraph now if I
want to grab the text and the HTML
inside the paragraph what I can actually
do is if we were to actually make this
bold down here just to give it some HTML
inside the actual paragraph
actually get the HTML and the text from
the dumb
so we next go back inside our function
here and say we want to actually we can
just go and copy this paste it down and
say when we click button number two
which will be the HTML button here we
want to get the HTML from inside the
test too so we're going to change it to
test2 and say HTML instead so we're
going to go back inside the website
refresh and then click the button you
guys can see we get the HTML tags we put
inside the paragraph together with the
actual text so now we can actually get
both HTML and the content now if I were
to go back and start my code here and
say well I also want to get the value
from inside the input I'm going to copy
what we have up here and change it to
button 2 which means that we're going to
get the input value and then inside my
alert I want to say I want to get test 3
but not the HTML I want to get the value
so going to say VA L so now if we were
to go back inside my website refresh and
actually write something inside the
inside the input click input you guys
can see we get the actual value from
inside the input so this is how we can
actually get data from inside the dumb
inside a website now the next thing we
need to talk about is how to actually
change data inside the dom because now
we just can't data but we also want to
set data so if I were to go back inside
my website here I can actually go ahead
and change that to take root functions
here so instead of a loading stuff I
would actually like to change what I was
inside test one so we're going to say
they want to grab test 1 and then
afterwards you want to just delete the
last parenthesis and then I want to
change the text inside test 1 so we're
doing basically the same thing as we did
here except for inside the text function
how I'm going to change the string into
something else I'm going to actually
write something inside the parentheses
so we're going to write this is the new
text
it's amazing mark or something
then we're going to save it and then
when I click the button you guys will
notice that the text up here changes and
we do that because we changed to dumb
and I can actually show you guys an
example of it if we were to inspect
elements you guys can see we have the
lorem ipsum da listed immense if we were
to click the button let's actually move
it over so we can actually see it to
stuff and click it you guys can see we
change that inside the developer tool
which is in fact showing off the dump so
if I were to go back inside our website
here inside the text document can also
change the HTML inside our done so who
were to go down do the exact same thing
down here I'm just going to copy what we
have up here paste it in change test2
and change the HTML and then change it
into something like let's say you want
to have it gold but italic I can go and
do that as well like so I can actually
go back inside the website refresh then
click the button and you guys can see it
changes into italic which is quite nice
now the last one down is going to change
any kind of inputs or text areas you
might have inside a website so if we
were to go down and just copy paste one
more time
change it to test three change it to Val
and then change the inside of you to
something like new input data of
something now if we were to go back
inside the website I connect to go ahead
and write something inside the input and
then when I click the button here you
guys can see that it changes into the
text that I wrote in here so this is how
we can get and set the dumb inside jqm
rule in fact we're doing more when it
comes to manipulating HTML using jQuery
so if you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
