banners inside bootstrap when it comes
to banners we need to make sure we
follow the formula the bootstrap
provides in order for it to become
responsive when we want to see it on
cell phones and tablets so this is what
we have so far since the previous
episode where we talked about how to
create a navigation inside bootstrap now
before we get started on creating
banners there's one shorter thing I want
to fix which is the right now we do X
have some content inside the body tag
and it's actually hiding behind the
navigation so because we made the
navigation fixed so when we do actually
scroll it stays at the top all the
content inside a website jumps up behind
it so we need to fix this first so
inside my website what we have so far is
inside the head tag we have all the
links that we need to know to get
bootstrap including our own stylesheet
that's down here and inside the body
tags we have the navigation at the top
here and we have the content inside this
class here called container fluid so
what I want to do is we want to wrap
container fluid inside another wrapper
which is actually going to be the one
that contains all the content so you can
push all the content 50 pixels down to
where we don't have the navigation
showing anymore so inside the body tag
I'm going to go and create a section tag
inside the section tag I'm going to go
to make sure it wraps around the entire
content I'm going to move down below or
div tag whoo everything out so it looks
nice and inside the section tag I'm
going to go and create a class this
class I'm going to go and call main -
container do bear in mind this is not a
bootstrap class is this one that I
created myself because they're going to
go inside my stylesheet and style this
container we can actually push all the
content down so I'm going to go ahead
and go at the bottom of the stylesheet
I'm going to go to include the class
called main container and I'm going to
go and say get padding - top and set it
to 50 pixels because that's the height
of our current navigation so if I save
it refresh the browser you guys
considered now we can see all the
content so now we can get started on
creating our banner so inside our
website inside the index file I'm going
to go ahead and go inside my main
container
now inside the main container I'm going
to go and create this banner and there's
a couple of ways we can do it because
there are two types of banners inside
bootstrap now the two different types of
banners depends on what kind of banners
we actually want inside the website one
is being that you just want some kind of
text content and the other one being
that you want some kind of background
image or background color behind the
content so I'm going to go to start out
by creating another container just like
the one we have down here which right
now is container fluid meaning that all
the content inside the container goes
all the way from the left side of the
screen to the right side now when it
comes to the in show banner I do not
wish for the banner to go all the way
from left to right I wanted to have a
fixed width inside my website so right
before the other content of my website
I'm going to go and create another dip
box I'm going to give this one a class
and I'm going to go ahead and call it
container just so we don't get all the
content going from left to right now
inside this container we're going to
create a dip box this dip box we're
going to give a class and we're going to
go ahead and name this class Jumbotron
which is the first type which allow for
the content to be inside an image or
some kind of background color so after
doing this we can actually go ahead
insert some content inside this
Jumbotron I could for example put in
that h1 tag which is what makes sense
because inside the intro banner of any
kind of website you would want to have
some kind of h1 tag so I'm going to go
and say this is a intro header of my
site then I'm going to go and include a
paragraph underneath it which I'm just
going to go ahead and insert some kind
of mumbo-jumbo text so I'm going to go
and go inside my browser I'm going to
jump to a website called lips um calm
which generates some kind of random room
if some text I'm going to go ahead and
copy it like so and paste it inside my
paragraph tag again you guys can write
whatever you want inside the paragraph
tag I just decided to put some random
text in here so I'm going to save it
refresh my browser inside my website and
as you guys can see now we get this
Jumbotron now right now doesn't look
very pretty and after I showed you guys
the other type of header you can create
we're going to go ahead and take this
Jumbotron
and style it so it looks nice and then
we're going to take this website in
front of me and we're going to go to
redesign the gallery down here we're
going to go and change it slightly so it
looks nice which means that in the
future when I create more bootstrap
lessons we have something that looks
kind of nice and doesn't just look like
templates okay so the second type we
have if you go back inside the code it's
a banner type called page header so
right now we have a Jumbotron we can
execute and say page - header and now
you guys will notice that it changes
from this you know banner looking thing
into some text that doesn't have a box
around it so as you guys can see this is
more of a text-based header and I think
this one is supposed to go all the way
from the left side of the screen to the
right side so I think we'll have to
include a container fluid instead of
just a container if you want to use this
type because it doesn't look very good
when the line down here just kind of
stops and starts so what we're going to
do now is we're going to go ahead and go
back into the Jumbotron by going back
refreshing and now we're going to go
install the website I'm going to start
out by creating the styling for the
jumbotron and then afterwards if you
guys want to follow we're going to go
ahead and restyle some of the stuff we
have inside this website here okay so
going into our code file here I'm going
to go ahead and wrap my container that
has the jumbotron in it inside another
wrapper I'm going to go to move it out
and right before they did that has to
contain a class I'm going to go and
create an article now article inside
HTML if you guys remember basically says
that we have some kind of content that
belongs together so we're not talking
about an actual article we're talking
about content that belongs together so
this h1 tag down here has a paragraph
tag that supports this h1 tag okay so
this belongs together so I'm going to go
ahead and take the closing article tag
I'm going to move it right underneath
below the closing div tag of the
container class and now we have some
kind of article wrapped around it I'm
going to take this article I'm going to
go and give it a class now the purpose
behind is is that I want to be able to
target all the content inside this
Jumbotron so basically I'm just doing
here is I'm wrapping some kind of
container around this section of my
website so I can target all the divs and
paragraphs and eight
tags that might be inside this class
here we're going to go and call this one
index - intro just to give you some kind
of name so now I can actually copy this
index that's intro go into my style
sheet at the bottom here I'm going to go
and paste it in and then I can say well
we have this index - intro and I want to
make it 100% in its width so it goes all
the way from left to right and again you
could be using the bootstrap contain a
fluid class but if you do this it's not
going to go all the way to the edge of
the screen there will actually be a
slight gap right before you hit the wall
of the website so because I want this
just to be a background color which is
like grey and need to make sure it goes
all the way from left to right so I'm
actually going to create a dip box
that's not part of bootstrap and you can
do this you don't have to create
bootstrap elements all the time as long
as they'll mess up the blue sub
structure so I'm going to go and give
this one a width as 100% I'm going to go
ahead and set a background color we're
going to set this one to hashtag f3f3f3
so get a light grey color I'm going to
refresh my website and as you guys can
see now we get this Gray's background so
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
go ahead and style the actual Jumbotron
right now we do actually have a small
padding right underneath the jumbotron
banner so we need to remove that padding
by actually styling the Jumbotron itself
and yes you can actually go in and style
the bootstrap elements so I'm going to
go to copy the index intro paste
underneath my styling instead we don't
want to target index intro but the
Jumbotron class that's inside this one
so now I can actually go inside the
styling and remove the padding that's at
the bottom I'm going to say padding and
set it to zero pixels now what you guys
will notice is that the content does
actually shift all the way to the left
side of this banner now you guys can
really see it maybe I should actually
make this one some kind of color so
let's actually give it a background
color just to have something right now
for you guys to see if it were to
refresh you guys can see that now we
removed all the padding's around this
banner now we do also have a margin so
we need to remove that as well so right
now you guys can see the red part is the
jumbotron and anything around
is the actual container or the article
that we wrapped it inside of so I'm
actually going to go ahead go into my
code and say other than the padding
being zero I also want the malting being
zero like so and refresh the browser now
you might be asking why do we still have
spacing underneath the text underneath
the jumbotron when removed all the
margins and padding's well right now if
we were to look at the text you guys can
see that we also have a margin going
below the text so we need to make sure
that either we remove that margin or we
give the jumbotron some kind of height
to avoid there being some kind of
spacing below the text that actually
gives us this background color
underneath or on top of the jumbotron
because we don't want that so I'm going
to go and go back inside my code and
instead of removing the margin of the
text I'm actually going to go ahead and
give the jumbotron a different padding
than the default one we've got inside
bootstrap so right now set it to zero
but I do actually want to have some kind
of spacing so I'm going to go and say we
want to have 100 pixels from top and
bottom then afterwards I want to give it
60 pixels from left and right meaning
there right now the text is going to get
pushed out on both sides 60 pixels and
it's going to get pushed from the top
and bottom 100 pixels so if i refresh
you guys can see we now get some spacing
so what I want to do here is since I
don't have any kind of spacing on top of
or below the Jumbotron is I want to
insert an image as a background now it
did actually download an image that I
entered inside a root folder which is of
a person sitting on a computer typing
some stuff and then there's some spacing
on the left side of the image for the
text so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go and go inside my styling and
instead of giving my Jumbotron a
background color I'm going to go and
give it a background image I'm going to
go to link to the image again if you
guys want to download the image you can
go and download it in the description of
this video here I'm going to go ahead
and say we have a image folder that has
an image called jumbo tron dot JPEG and
then I'm going to go ahead and give this
image a background size like so
and we're going to go and set it to
cover to make sure it covers the entire
banner at all times afterwards I'm going
to set a background to no-repeat because
you don't want the background to repeat
over and over if i refresh the browser
now you guys can see that now we'll get
some kind of image of course right now
the text also jumps into part of the
image that I don't want it to touch
because the text kind of fades away when
we have dark colors underneath the text
so what we can do now is we can actually
fix this not by creating some kind of
padding on the right side of the text
but by using the bootstraps grid system
which is why it's so awesome to use
inside websites so if I go back inside
my code and go inside my index file and
if I were to go inside my Jumbotron down
here I connect to go inside the
Jumbotron create a div which has a class
called row just like we did with the
gallery a few episodes ago I'm going to
go ahead and give it a class's row and
then afterwards we're going to go and
define the columns inside this class so
I'm going to go into inside this row
class here we're going to go and say we
have a div that has a class set to call
- SM - six because I want to have two
columns inside the jumbotron meaning
that I can actually split the content
into 50 50 % so I'm going to go ahead
and copy this one below it like so I'm
going to take all the content I have
down here with the text copy it delete
it and put it inside the first column
I'm going to go to move it out so it
looks nice like so and if I were to
refresh the browser you guys can see
that now it actually jumps to the side
so we can actually get this type of
header that responds to the width of the
browser now we can actually go ahead and
make this one slightly bigger because
you don't need to cut half I do actually
think we can cut a little bit more so
let's go back inside the code so instead
of 6 and 6 because we have 12 grits
inside one row I'm going to go and say
we have 8 and instead we have 4 inside
the second column so I'm going to
refresh and as you guys can see now it
skips over a little bit so now we have
some kind of banner which actually works
inside our website if I were to go
inside my inspect
mode and change it to some kind of
device you guys considered now the
header adjust to the device I can exit
go and scroll down and you guys can see
it looks somewhat nice now another thing
about the text because right now because
we're using a Jumbotron the text
automatically adjust inside our website
so right now we do get a very tiny
header and I would like to change the
size of it so I'm going to go ahead and
go back inside my stylesheet I'm going
to go inside a Jumbotron just going to
go ahead and copy the path here delete
all the content inside of it and save
the one to style and h1 tag inside this
specific Jumbotron so I'm going to go
inside the styling say we have a font
- sighs I'm going to go and set it to 50
pixels I'm going to go and refresh the
browser there we go and now you guys can
see that we changed the sizing of the
header and everything else around it
adjusted to it meaning that you know all
the padding and the length of the banner
everything adjusted so if we were to go
ahead and go outside of my developer
tool that it still looks somewhat nice
again the actual length of the text
right now you guys can see that a single
word down here which might not look very
nice inside a website but we can always
change that by either adjusting the size
of the text or including or removing
some of the text inside our banner so
now that we talked about how to style
the banner I'm going to go ahead and
talk about resizing or readjusting the
styling for the rest of the website
because right now we have three huge
images down here and I want to have six
across instead of three I want to Center
this text down here so I'm going to go
inside my index file and I'm going to go
and do the same thing as we did to the
jumbotron part where we wrapped it
inside an article so I'm going to go and
copy this so we can actually target the
styling inside the below section which
I'm going to go ahead and call a gallery
so right before we have to contain a
fluid I'm going to go and put the
article inside of here I'm going to
change the class to index gallery I'm
going to go to close off the article
right underneath this tip box like so
then I'm going to change the number of
images we have inside this article at
this gallery section so I'm going to go
ahead and say we have not three but six
images inside the
tip class down here called rope so I'm
going to copy it and paste it so we have
three more images then I'm going to
change the number inside our column
class so we don't have four all the way
across because now we need to divide 12
by 6 which is going to be two like so so
if I go back inside the website you guys
can see it now we get six images going
down here so now I want to style the
text inside my gallery so I'm going to
go back inside my stylesheet and at the
bottom here I'm going to go ahead and
copy what we have called index intro I'm
going to call this one index gallery
instead and then so you want to width at
100% and the background color is going
to be white so instead of saying if 3 F
3 F 3 I'm going to say F SS which is the
white color then I'm going to go ahead
and copy this paste it underneath here
and set it inside the index gallery we
have a piece of text which right now is
an h2 tag which is the one we have here
called hello world and I want to send to
this text so I'm going to say text - a
line and say Center then I'm going to go
ahead and copy this text underneath here
and say we also have a paragraph tag
inside the index gallery and I want to
do the exact same thing I want to Center
it inside the website so we'll go back
you guys can see the nonce Center so
what I can do now is I can actually go
ahead and create some spacing on top of
the index gallery class we have up here
because right now there's not a lot of
spacing right before we get to the hello
world so we almost touched the banner up
I don't want to do that so I'm going to
go inside my styling of the index
gallery and say we have a padding at the
top which would be around 30 pixels I'm
also going to go and include a padding
at the bottom and I'm going to go and
say we have 60 pixels now you might be
asking why I'm giving it these specific
numbers if I go ahead and refresh you
guys can see the now get some spacing if
it were to say that we have the body tag
of our website which is the entire body
and give it a specific background color
you guys will see why I gave it this
padding so I'm going to say they have a
background color and I'm going to go
ahead and set it to red just to give you
guys some kind of idea
I want to refresh you guys can see then
when the next content start underneath
the gallery we also want to have some
spacing below the images and when the
section actually stops so now you guys
can see you've created some spacing
using the padding so I'm just going to
go and go back inside my styling and say
we don't have a red background inside
the entire body but instead we have a
f3f3f3 color so I'm going to go and save
it refresh and as you guys can see now
we have these sections here again if I
were to actually resize this entire
thing by saying we want to do it inside
a cell phone you guys can see we get
something that's quite responsive it
looks very nice inside a cell phone of
course we could actually give this
gallery images some kind of title maybe
a description but it's very easy to do
inside bootstrap so this is how we
create banners inside bootstrap and I
hope this wasn't too long for you guys I
wanted to show you guys how you could
actually style some of the bootstrap
styling so we have inside bootstrap so
you don't have to stick with the
specific styling of bootstrap now
remember when you do actually touch the
styling inside bootstrap you need to
make sure that you're doing stuff that
won't actually destroy the
responsiveness when you look at this
inside other devices so we guys enjoyed
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
