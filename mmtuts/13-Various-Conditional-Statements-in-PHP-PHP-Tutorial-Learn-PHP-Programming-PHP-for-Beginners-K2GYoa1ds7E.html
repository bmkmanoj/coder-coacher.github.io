about something called if-else and else
if statements inside PHP and these acts
is something going to use quite often
when you do actually write PHP code
inside a website so let's actually go
ahead and talk about a coding example
where we do actually write out the code
and then afterwards I'll explain to you
guys how we can use this inside a
website so as you guys can see right now
we do actually have a variable called X
which is equal to 1 now underneath here
we're actually going to go ahead and
write our if-else statements so
basically the idea behind if-else
statements is that we can say if
something specific is true then do this
if something else is true then do this
instead so we can actually go and write
an if statement by saying if parentheses
curly brackets so basically inside
parentheses we're going to put we're
going to put the condition which needs
to be true in order to do whatever's
inside the curly brackets so inside the
parentheses we can actually say if
variable X is the same as 1 you know is
equal to 1 then right echo string let me
say Daniel is very handsome now if this
is true which is actually is right now I
can actually go inside my browser
refresh and you guys can see it does
actually say Daniel is very handsome
now let's say that X is 2 or something
else it doesn't have to be 2 it can be
anything other than 1 right now it's not
going to do anything inside the browser
because we're only checking if this is
true then do this now in order to do
something if something else is true
other than what we wrote in here we can
write what is called an else statements
where we say if anything else is true do
this we can actually go ahead and take
the echo just kind of copy it put it
down here and we can actually say Daniel
is very ugly
which of course wouldn't actually be
true but let's actually say we have
Daniel is very ugly down here so in this
case we would actually go inside the
browser and you guys will see it does
xs8 Daniel is very ugly now this is all
good and fun but let's actually say we
want to check if there is more
conditions other than the if statement
that needs to be true in order to do
something else we can actually write
something called an else if statement so
if we actually go in between the if and
else statement we can actually move the
else statement down a little bit you can
write something called an else if
parentheses curly brackets and then this
works essentially the same way as our if
statement so if we do actually coffee my
X variable up here inside the if
statement but the inside my else if
statement and change this one to two we
can actually write something you know we
can echo out something else instead of
danos very handsome you can say Daniel
is kinda handsome so in this case since
it's actually equal to two up here in
the X variable it will in fact say
Daniel is kinda handsome so it can
actually change this variable up here
back and forward you know to actually
change the text now you might be asking
well what can we actually use this for
inside a real website well let's
actually say you have a login system
inside your website and you're locked in
now based on if you're locked in or not
we can actually go in and check is
Daniel in fact locked in okay he is so
if he is locked in we can actually go
ahead and echo out a maybe an image a
profile image up in the corner of the
website because he is in fact logged in
kind of like when you're on Facebook if
you're actually logged in you can
actually go to a user page that's your
user page so these are certain ways we
can actually check the sort of thing now
we can also if you want to add more
statements you can actually go and just
copy the else--if statement
and paste it below here many times and
change these from you know three four
blah blah blah and then we also have the
default one saying else you know if
anything else other than all these
statements then do
this down here so these are the basic
ways you can do you know basic checks
with if-else if and else statements now
if you actually have a lot of statements
we can also write something called a
switch and we'll actually talk about
that in the next episode so for now I
hope you guys enjoyed this episode and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
