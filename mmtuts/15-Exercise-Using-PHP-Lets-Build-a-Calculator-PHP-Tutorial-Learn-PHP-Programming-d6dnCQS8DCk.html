about how to actually make something
inside the browser using PHP code
because in all the past episodes all
we've talked about is all the
fundamentals in PHP but we haven't
actually done anything yet we can
actually use inside a website so my
thought was for this episode we're going
to try to build a calculator inside the
browser and yes I know a calculator is
not the most interesting thing to build
but it's a really good exercise for you
guys to get into the mindset when you
code PHP code because PHP is very
different from HTML and CSS so if you
guys follow along this episode and just
kind of write code with me you guys
should get the hang of PHP pretty
quickly
so as you guys can see right now I do
actually have a regular HTML 5 set up
inside a front page called index of PHP
and this is document we're going to
start working from now you guys should
already know how to set up a document
like this because you should know HTML
CSS before you go into PHP so we're just
going to go and get started now inside
our body tag we're going to start
setting up our calculator and my thought
for the calculator was that we're going
to have two inputs where we can actually
write numbers in and then after the
inputs we can decide with the drop down
what kind of you know calculation we
want to do if we want to add or subtract
multiply or divide and then we're going
to have a button where we calculate so
we hit the button and then X it
calculates it for us so the first thing
we need to create in order to actually
have a PHP calculator it's a form so I'm
going to go ahead and open up a form
inside by PHP inside my HTML code like
so and the first I'm going to create
this an input now the first input is
just going to be a regular text type
input so we're going to set the type as
text and then afterwards we're going to
go ahead and give it a name because when
we use PHP code and we need to use it
together that forms we need to use names
inside the inputs to actually refer to
those inputs when we call PHP code so in
this case we're going to call the first
one num 1
now we're also going to include a
placeholder just so we have something we
connect to see inside our browser so I'm
going to set the placeholder as number
one so after we save this I at least
after we create this we're going to go
ahead and copy it paste it below and
then I'm just going to go and change the
name to num2 and then i'm going to
change the placeholder to number two so
after we have this we can actually go
ahead and refresh our browser just to
see what we have so far and as you guys
can see now we have two input fields so
we can write something and this is good
for now but we actually need some more
stuff in here now the next thing we're
going to include is a you know like a
drop-down web connects you select if you
want to add subtract multiply or divide
so the way we're going to do that is by
creating something called a select now a
select is essentially just where we go
in and give it a couple of options for
the drop-down so inside the select tags
we're going to go ahead and say option
like so and then we're going to go and
give the first one the name add at least
the you know we're going to write add in
between the option tags then we're going
to copy the option tags just about maybe
four more times five more times I think
and then we're going to change the first
option to none then we're going to
change the third one to subtract the
fourth one we're going to say multiply
and the last one we're going to say
divide so now that we have these we can
actually go ahead and get the select one
a name because like I said but you need
to give it a name to refer to it when we
use PHP code so I'm going to go ahead
and give it a name inside the Select tag
the name in this case we're just going
to go ahead and set as operator like so
now that we have this we can actually go
and refresh the browser so you guys can
see now we have a drop down we can
actually you know select one of these
options here so the next thing we need
to do is include a button because we do
actually need to be able to actually hit
something and calculate so the
underneath the select button we're going
to give it a break because we need to go
down to the next line and
button and down here we're just going to
go to add a regular button now inside
the button tags we're going to go ahead
and say calculate so we know what this
button does and inside the button tag
the tag itself we're going to go ahead
and give it a name as well so we're
going to set the name as submits
afterwards we're going to give it a
value as submit as well and then we're
going to go ahead and set a type as well
which is going to be equal to submit as
well I'm saying as well a lot of times
here but it really is a lot of repeating
in this one so after we have this you
guys will notice that we can now write
something in here let's actually go
ahead and write five in the first one 10
and the second one we can say add and
calculate now what you guys will notice
is as soon as we hit calculate up in the
URL after our you know actual URL we're
going to get a question mark and after
the question mark we have num1 equal to
five and number two equal to ten and
operator equal to add and submit equal
to submit so this is all the information
we need in order to calculate and this
is essentially how we pass on
information with PHP because we usually
use the UL to do this sort of thing so
what we need to do now is actually go
down and write PHP code that goes into
the URL and fetches this information and
does something with it based on what's
up here so if we go down to our code
underneath the form we're going to go
ahead and start writing stuff so we need
to open up the PHP tags like so now
before the PHP tag we might want to add
maybe some text that says you know here
is the answer
so we can actually you know let people
know that the answer is going to be here
so in between the form in the PHP tags
I'm just going to add a paragraph and
say this but maybe the answer
is : and then we can actually start
writing stuff inside the PHP tags now
the first thing we need to do is
actually check if we did actually hit
the submit button because if we haven't
hit the submit button yet and we're
already checking for answers inside the
URL it's going to give us an error
message because there's nothing inside
the URL if you have an execute anything
yet as you guys can see up here so we
need to first check if the calculate
button has actually been hit so the way
we're going to do that is by going into
our PHP code we're going to go and say
if so we're just going to go and write
an if statement here then we're going to
say inside the parentheses if is set
which means that if this has been said
already meaning that if we did actually
hit the button parentheses again and
inside the parentheses we're going to go
ahead and check for submit so we need to
go up into the URL and if there is in
fact a submit that's equal to submit
then it needs to do this kind of code
down here so inside our parentheses
we're going to say variable on the score
gets because we're actually taking for a
get method now we didn't actually talk
about get and post method in PHP before
we did talk about in the HTML CSS series
but basically when we use a get method
into the URL like pass an information
into it we can actually see the
information up here in the UL like we
can right now if you use a post method
we can't actually see the information in
the URL but it's still there so in this
case we can access seed information
which means that it's a get method so we
need to ask for get method then we're
going to put brackets single quotes and
in between here we need to ask what kind
of information from the UL we're
actually getting in this case it's the
one that's called submit as a name so
I'm going to go ahead and write submit
so now we're actually asking if this is
actually been set so we can actually go
inside the if statement and start typing
stuff so the first thing we're going to
do is we actually going to go back into
the URL and get the rest of the answers
that we've typed in before
or so we can actually go ahead and
create a variable and let's just go
ahead and call this one result one we're
going to set equal to whatever is inside
the URL which has what did we call num1
as a result so we're just going to go
ahead and copy our get method up here
paste it down here and of course change
the answer from submit to num1 then
we're going to copy this line paste it
below a couple of times change the
second line from result to a to result
two and change the from num1 - num2 the
last one down here we're going to call
operator and then we're going to go and
ask for operator because we did actually
set our select up here to operator as a
name so now we've done this we actually
get the different answers from the URL
itself so the next thing we need to do
is actually to tell it what to do this
information if we get a certain type now
we can do this in two different ways
either we can use an if statement or a
switch statement in order to do
something to results and since we did
already use an if statement here I think
we should actually try and use a switch
so down here we're going to create a
switch like so great parentheses curly
brackets and then we need to tell it
what we're actually trying to get inside
the switch here so in this case we want
to get the operator like so and put it
inside our parentheses because we're
actually checking for the operator you
know if we did actually add we need to
do one certain thing with the addition
if we actually subtracted we need to do
something else with the actual
calculation so inside the switch we're
going to set up a case I'm going to go
ahead and say that if the case is equal
to add then it should do something well
actually the first one we have is
actually the one called
none so we should probably take that one
that one first
so if the user did not select anything
it should do this so I'm going to go
ahead and say if they did not select
anything I'm going to echo out
error because they do actually need to
select something but we could actually
just say you need to select a method
like so so if you didn't choose anything
you need to actually select the method
and of course we do need to set the nun
as a string so the next one all right we
do actually need to add the break as
well I forgot that like so so now we can
just sort of copy this one paste it
below a couple of times we need four
more I do believe and then we're going
to set the second one as add with a big
a we're going to set the third one as
subtracts we're going to set the fourth
one I do believe it is as multiply let's
actually get rid of that thing is letter
will t apply there we go and the last
one is going to be divided so now we
need to actually calculate inside
instead of echoing so in this case we're
actually just going to go ahead and say
echo and then we would like to take
result one and say plus result two like
so this is basically all we need down
here we're actually going to go ahead
and just copy the echo for the rest of
them like so like so and like so so now
we just need to change the plus symbol
to a minus on the second one the third
one we're going to change to a multiply
and the last one is going to be divided
so now depending on what kind of
operator we choose inside our form it's
going to choose one of these switches
and the reason we need to set you know
the numbers is so that when we do
actually choose the switch or like a
case down here it needs to do something
with information that we typed in so now
we can actually go to our browser if I
just go ahead and go back so we don't
have anything you guys conceded if I do
actually go into number one and click
five
number two click 10 and then go into my
drop-down and say I want to add them I
can actually calculate and you can see
we get 15 I can also go in and add 20 if
I want to and 34 and maybe multiply and
you guys can see we get 680 so this is
how we can build a basic calculator
using PHP code and this is going to give
you guys a really good idea about how we
use PHP code inside a website again
calculators not very exciting to build
but it's a really good exercise to show
you guys how we use if statements and
how you switches and that sort of thing
when we build functions inside a website
so hope you guys enjoyed this episode we
would like to start talking about I
think we'll take a couple more examples
for next couple episodes just to show a
couple of other ways we can use PHP code
at least with the stuff we've learned so
far we do actually need to learn a
couple more things regarding you know
fundamentals of PHP but in order to you
know just to give you guys some examples
so you guys don't get too bored I'm
gonna go and spend a couple more
episodes sharing gasps some other stuff
so if you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
