about how to create a form inside a
website and before we actually start
creating the form I'd like to talk to
you guys about what exactly you can do
with the form at least what it's used
for typically on a website so if you
were to take an example here if I were
to go to a website that has a contact
form at the bottom we need to type in
your name your email and message and
then click send that's an example of a
form another example is if you go to
website has a login system and you can
type your user name and password and
then click login that's also a form so
what I'm trying to point out here is
that even though a form is written using
HTML and CSS a lot of times you're going
to have to need to know a little bit of
PHP or JavaScript to actually do
something with the form now having said
that don't skip this video because once
you do actually get to the point we need
to use this stuff it's very valuable to
notice ahead of time ok you need to not
a creative one before I actually need to
start using it having said that as well
back when I was studying and I had to
learn about you know you know contact
forms inside HTML CSS it really wasn't
that difficult to Google how to create
the PHP code for a contact form and use
it together with the form I created
inside HTML it really doesn't take that
long time to do so you don't have to
know PHP and JavaScript to actually do
something something with the forms a lot
of times you can Google your way to
answers so having said that let's
actually go and create something so
underneath our table box let's go ahead
and copy our subsection called table box
and paste it below here after we pasted
it down here we're going to go ahead and
change the name from table - box to form
- box and then we're going to go ahead
and delete the table in here because we
don't need that far form I'm going to
save it I'm going to go to my stylesheet
and then I'm going to go ahead and copy
my styling for the table - box paste it
at the bottom and just simply change the
name now we're not going to change any
styling and you could argue that it
would be easier just to you know keep
the styling as table - box even though
it's inside a form and you know you
could do that but I just like to have a
different styling for each section
even though it's the same styling so
going back to our index file we can
actually start creating the form inside
our wrapper so in here the way we create
a form is by writing out the tags form
you need to have opening and closing
tags in between here is where we create
all the different inputs that we need
inside a form and like the button and
that kind of thing so let's take an
example if I want to have a text area
that I can write in like a short text
area where I can type my name like my
first name and last name and maybe if I
want a you know like an optional choice
we like what do you call it like you
know we can choose one or two answers by
checking it off you can also add that
inside a form and if I want to add
something like a text area like a huge
text area we can also add that into a
form so if I were to go ahead and start
up by writing opening tag input we can
actually start creating an input which
is a text area inside this form so we're
going to say input space then we need to
write what kind of type of input it is
because there's many different types
we're going to set this on equal to
quotation marks and set it to text so
right now we're saying we're creating an
input and it's a text input meaning we
can type text in here after this we're
going to go ahead and give this one a
name now the name works kind of the same
way as when we give a name to a HTML tag
for example with classes and ID's the
only reason we are not the only reason
but one of the main reasons we use names
is so that we can pinpoint which input
we're talking about so inside this input
we're going to say name equal to
quotation marks and the first one we're
going to set to first as in first name
after this one we can just go ahead and
close it and that's simply all we need
now I need to mention also you don't
have to write first it doesn't stand for
first name we can write whatever you
want in here I'm just writing first
because that makes sense to me
okay so you guys can write first name or
whatever you feel like in there so
having written this let's actually go
ahead and copy pasted below
like so save it and go ahead and look at
it inside out browser so as you guys can
see we do actually get two input fields
down here and the thing about these is
that right now if I use the word to go
to my website and see these text inputs
they wouldn't actually know what to type
in here like what do we want them to
type so there's two ways we can include
some text in here to tell them the first
one is called value and value is
typically not used to put inside a text
area like this to show people but let's
just go ahead and write one out
so we're going to write value equal to
quotation marks I'm going to set this
one to first name then I'm going to go
ahead and go down to the next one we
have down here and I'm going to go ahead
and change the name to last because it's
the last name we want down here and then
instead of value we're going to say
placeholder like so equal to quotation
marks I'm going to set this one to last
name now what I'm going to do now is I'm
going to show you guys the difference
between using value and placeholder if
you go to the browser and refresh the
website you guys will notice that the
first name if I type inside the text
area I can actually delete the first
name text in here and right on top of it
I like right with it which is not really
ideal for one a user for but the last
name which was the placeholder we can
actually just click in here and then
it's grayed out the text in here and
when I start writing just simply deletes
whatever's in there so having said that
the value is typically not used for this
kind of thing the value is used when you
want some kind of preset value you need
to send on into whatever you know script
like in PHP or Java Script that has to
handle this form so when you want
something to happen sort of form you're
telling it what the bio needs to be so
we're going to go ahead and just replace
the placeholder up here well not replace
the placeholder but replace the value
with the placeholder save it and refresh
our browser because this is what we want
to have after this I'm going to go ahead
and go at on the next line
our second input I'm going to add a
break which I don't know if we talked
about before but just you just simply
write it out by writing BR inside the
HTML tags and then you get a break what
jumps down to the next line after we
have to break let's go ahead and include
another kind of input so that's right
opening code input and instead of
setting the type as text let's go ahead
and set it as something called radio so
I'm going to write R a do
and afterwards C I'm going to go and
give it a name now the name here we can
just go ahead and call gender for
example so now we can actually we're
going to write a you know we get two
options either you can write male or
female and you have to choose one of
them or at least you know it can only
choose one of them when you submit this
form so after the name we're going to go
ahead and say space then we're going to
set the value equal to quotation marks
and the first one is going to be male
now I have to be close off this one once
that you actually submit the form and if
I have chosen this input it's going to
send the answer to the handler as male
but if I were to go ahead and save this
and refresh my browser you guys will
notice that we don't actually get any
text outside this check mark I can click
on down here I don't know if you guys
can see it's kind of tiny but there's a
check mark down here like a circle I can
click on and it doesn't actually tell me
what you know like why I need to click
this circle so going into my code I'm
going to go ahead and after my input
right male save it refresh my browser
and as you guys will see we now get male
and I can actually see oh okay yeah I am
a male so I'm going to click this one
now we're going to code and include
another kind of radio button because you
know why would we only have one if we
need some options so I'm going to go and
save this one or like copy it and then
below I'm going to go and write another
break because we need to jump to next
line and then I'm going to go and paste
it in once more then I'm going to change
the value to female and just simply
write female on the other side as well
now you might be asking
how does it know that these two inputs
go together well that's because we have
the same name inside here both of them
are called gender which is why it knows
that there can only be one of these
chosen so if I go in and refresh my
browser you guys will notice that we get
male or female if I were to click male
and then go down and click female you
can see that the little tap icon I like
the little circle in there changes we
can't have both of them chosen at the
same time so now we have this one we can
actually start creating something like a
button so underneath here actually let's
go ahead and create a text area first if
we want to create a text area we just
simply write text sorry we need to open
up the code write text area and close it
off here and then need to close the text
area as well like so then we're going to
go ahead and write in C we're going to
give it a name because you want some
kind of name for the text area so
there's a name equal to quotation marks
and then we can say message in case I
want to write some kind of message save
this and then underneath here we're
going to go ahead and create a button so
I'm going to go ahead and say button and
you want to make sure you have an
opening and closing tag as well just
like the text area and inside the button
we're going to write type equal to
quotation marks and then just go ahead
and say text
sorry not text submit because that tells
it that once we click this button it's
going to submit the form so you might be
asking why didn't we include a type
inside our text area that's because it's
already expecting it to be text so we
don't actually need that so if I were to
go ahead and save and refresh my browser
you guys will notice we get a text area
but wait we do actually need to include
a break because we want it to jump down
to the next line like so and just kind
of include it after the second input for
the radio type and after the message
text area box refresh again you guys
will notice we have a text area box
that's a lot a lot larger than these and
we can actually go ahead and drag it to
become very big you can also eliminate
this with styling so
don't worry about this if you don't like
it and we get a button down here but
right now the button doesn't say
anything inside of it so let's go and
include that so going inside our code in
between the button tags let's say submit
like so save it and refresh our browser
so now we get submitted inside the
button so what we can do with this form
is like I said once we do actually hit
submit we wanted to do something because
right now if I were to go ahead and
click Submit
it just jumps back to the front page so
what we want to do here is we do
actually want to tell it what it needs
to do so if we go back into the code and
go up into a form tag at least the
opening form tag and say space we need
to tell it two things first of all when
you tell it to tell what kind of action
we want it to take and we need to tell
it what kind of method we wanted to use
so the action is simply pointing towards
another document or another script that
needs to handle the form that needs to
make it do something and the method
tells it how we want to pass it on so
first of all let's go and write action
equal to quotation marks and then say we
wanted to go to a webpage called I don't
know let's just go ahead and call it
form dot PHP now remember like I said it
has to be a PHP script or JavaScript
script that handles the form so right
now I'm just going to go and pass it to
a PHP form which we haven't created yet
we're going to create it together
afterwards I have to tell how I want to
submit it and now I could explain what
the method does and I will actually do
it but it might not be as relevant for
you right now but let's just go ahead
and write it out so you write method
equal to quotation marks and we're going
to go ahead and write post in here now
you don't have to write in big letters
like I did here you can also write it
with you know uncapitalized letters but
that's just how programmers usually do
it now there's two different methods you
can either write post or you can write
get
the difference between the two is well
it's kind of hard to explain without
making it too complicated for you guys
since you just start out with HTML CSS
but once you submit the form it's going
to go to the web page so I like the file
we create call form the PHP and it's
going to take all these values we typed
in here if I were to go ahead and type
in my contact form here if I were to
write my first name last name mail and
write some kind of comment down here
like a message and click Submit
you guys will notice that up inside our
UIL up here we do actually get index dot
HTML question mark first which is the
name of our first input equal to
whatever I just wrote in there and last
equal to whatever I wrote in there and
gender equal to mail and message is
equal to whatever I wrote in there so
these things up here is going to be
passed at least all the values once we
actually submit the form are going to be
passed using the URL and then inside our
form that PHP we're going to go up into
the URL and get this information and use
it for something that's how you pass on
information in a form so the post and
the get method simply states that if we
use post method then the browser won't
actually be able to tell up up in our
URL what the information is if you use a
get method then we'll write it out
clearly as daylight what exactly we
typed in here so for security reasons if
you were to write in a you know username
password and that kind of thing you want
to use a post method because it's safe
if you use a get method you typically
deal with information that's not really
that important in case hackers get you
know the hand of it so right now it's
not really that important that we have
all these so let's just go ahead and
write get that way you guys will also be
able to see what we actually get passed
on so after having done this we have a
contact form but least not a contact
form but we have some kind of form so
now what we're going to do is we're
going to go and create a new file call
one dot php' and we're going to do
something in here again like I said this
is the HTML part you don't technically
need to know this stuff this is PHP
we're getting into here but I just feel
like you guys should know about it and I
know this episode is getting a bit long
so let's just go ahead and jump into it
so create a new file here I'm going to
go and save it inside my root folder as
form dot PHP I'm going to save it and
now when I click Submit it's going to go
to this site or at least this file and I
need to tell to do something so we need
to open up our PHP code by writing the
opening Arrow question mark PHP then go
down a couple lines and then write
question mark
closing arrow and whatever goes in
between here is going to be PHP code so
the first thing we're going to write is
first of all we need to go and get the
information inside the URL let's
actually go ahead and submit a form here
so if we were to go back to my front
page like so go down to the bottom and
fill in this contact form I'm going to
write Daniel that's my first name I'm
going to write Nilson that's my last
name
I'm going to write up a mail then I'm
going to say hi this is a message and
then I'm going to submit it and now
you'll notice that we get into a
completely new clean form at least a
clean page called page now sorry form
that PHP with all the information I just
typed in inside the browser inside the
URL so now we need to actually go fetch
these informations inside the URL so I'm
going to go into my code inside my PHP
code I'm going to go ahead and say
dollar sign then I'm going to go ahead
and give it some kind of name what we're
doing right now so creating a variable
and we're going to go ahead and create
it and call it first as in first name
I'm going to set it equal to whatever we
get from the URL so I'm going to go
ahead and say dollar sign on the score
gets because we use the get method
brackets
single quotes and then I'm going to go
ahead and write the name of what we just
wrote the name of inside our input in
our form in this case it was called
first going to close it and then I'm
just going to go and copy paste this one
down a couple of times for the last name
then we're going to get one for our male
or female then we're going to get one
for the text area so here I'm going to
go ahead and change my variable name to
last on the second one as well it was
called the same thing in our names I'm
just going to call last inside here down
on the next line we're going to go ahead
and say well we had a gender variable
I'm going to go ahead and just paste
gender inside my get method over here
because that's what we named it as well
then on the last one we're going to go
ahead and write message and just simply
write message in here as well so now we
have each information from the URL and
renamed it these names over here the
left side so now I can actually use
these for something so if I want to go
down on my next line in a and actually
want to write out what it was we typed
in in the last window I like in the last
page when we fill in the form I can go
ahead and write echo and then I'm going
to go ahead and echo out either one of
these variables who created up here I'm
just going to go head and take the first
one which is the last name save it if i
refresh my browser now you guys will
notice if you get this dipper is and the
reason we do that is because once you
use a PHP code you do actually need to
set up something called a server or like
yeah you need to set up some servers to
actually see it inside your browser and
right now we don't actually have it set
up but if I were to actually have a
server set up I didn't actually think
about this ahead of time if I were to
have a server set up it would actually
print out Daniel inside here and not all
this gibberish so I'm just going to zoom
in for you guys so you can access see
this is what's written out it would
actually say Daniel and if I were to
just go ahead and go back in here and
just echo you know Daniel then I'm going
to go ahead and include my last my
gender my message it would actually
print out all the information we wrote
from
Paige so map asking what can we use this
for well let's say I want to send an
email which is done by a function in PHP
called mail like so I can actually start
typing in either what we need to type in
the who it needs to be sent to we need
to type in who what the subject is of
the mail we need to type in the message
and we need to type in headers like you
know who is it from and that kind of
thing so you know using these
information we just got from the form we
can actually pass it in here and tell
you know who send it and who we sending
to and what is the message and that kind
of thing
and then send an email to some person so
that's essentially what a form does at
least one of the many many many hundreds
and thousands of ways you can use a form
using PHP and JavaScript this is one of
the ways you can use a form and I'm kind
of sad about not having set up a server
so I can actually show you guys this but
if you guys wanna learn how to do this
stuff I'm going to well right now as I'm
making this episode there's not a PHP
lesson available inside the website that
you guys might be watching it on or my
youtube channel and at some point in the
future I will have all kinds of PHP
tutorials so this will actually start
making sense if you guys follow that one
so hope you guys enjoyed this episode
again this is how you create a simple
form let's actually go ahead and refresh
our page here we go this is how you
create a simple form and do something
with it I hope you guys enjoyed even
though like I said it is a bit
complicated to use this only using HTML
CSS and I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
