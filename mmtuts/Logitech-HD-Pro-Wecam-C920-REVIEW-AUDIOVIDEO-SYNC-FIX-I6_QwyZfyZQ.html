one I'm gonna take a look at the
logitech HD pro webcam c920 which is a
really long name to pronounce but we're
gonna take a look - webcam up close to
see how it looks like physically and we
can do a comparison between the webcam
and a real camcorder so you guys can see
just to kind of see what the difference
in quality is like and we're also gonna
take a look at the software it came with
the webcam and at the end here we're
actually gonna take a look at an issue
that some of you guys may have with the
webcam which is that the audio in the
video does not synchronize update on
recording now we sort of have all dis
emplace let's go ahead and take a look
at the quality of the webcam as you guys
can see it looks very nice it is full HD
1080 pixels and you can actually do
quite a few things you can actually zoom
in so you guys can see a little bit more
of me not seeing the background and
stuff I got it does come with a lot of
neat features and when you take a look
at the difference between the camera the
webcam and a camcorder you guys can
actually see it the quality is quite
nice I mean the camcorder will probably
be a little bit better but still the
quality of the webcam is very nice for
the price that you can get it at it is
so good that you could actually use it
from time to time instead of a camcorder
if you do need to upload something on
YouTube now the quality of the webcam is
actually good enough just to throw it
out there that if you guys wanted to use
a green screen behind wherever you're
gonna do it with the green screen can
actually be removed easily with the
webcam also and that really says
something about quality of the webcam so
if we take a look at the webcam up close
you can actually see that has a very
nice design it is rectangle in shape and
it has blue LED lights in the side which
i think is a really nice touch you can
actually clamp it together here and you
can actually put it on top of a surface
so I can just dance somewhere you can
adjust it to every single monitor out
there with the with the clamp down here
and it does stuck on to the monitor
another really nice thing about this
webcam is that if you have a tripod it
actually has a hole in the bottom we can
screwed on to the type on a tripod and
use it as a camcorder if you want it to
be raised a little bit higher than the
monitor so now let's go and take a look
the software that came with the webcam
in the software is called a lot
check webcam software and as you can see
it looks very simplistic it is not very
confusing to look at like some of the
webcam recorders out there are we do
have a main menu let's go ahead and go
back there this is what you see when you
open up the software the first time you
can choose to quick capture you can
choose to use a webcam gallery down here
in the bottom you have a couple of
buttons that features different things
now if you have if you want to use this
webcam for Skype I did actually
experience that Skype did not pick up
the webcam when I open Skype up by just
opening Skype I did actually need to
close down Skype and open up Skype
inside the webcam software and then it
worked so if you guys have issues with
Skype this might help fix it for you
let's go ahead and go back into the
quick capture and as you guys can see as
there's a very nice little transition
where everything like moves into place
up here we have the actual capture let's
actually go ahead and adjust the
lighting cost of lighting in there we go
the loop capture screen here is very
nice to look at we have a little button
down here I can switch from photo to the
deal we also have the report button in
the middle here we can actually click it
and it counts down from 3 to 1 and then
reports and then you can choose not to
see the control panel over here if you
want to can go online and download
effects with this software and you can
actually choose it over here now I do
not have any effects on me right now
because I don't find it necessary to
have it thanks but you can do that if
you want to down here in the bottom you
can actually see all the content that
you've recorded or taken photos out I
say all content you can see I have both
my photos over here my video recordings
photos videos now I don't know what
motion videos are if I try to record on
selected motion videos it just up
straight into the videos again so I'm
not quite sure this is over here on the
right side we have preferences and help
and down here we have the controls so
you can actually you can actually zoom
in and zoom out if you do not want to
see all the background stuff it's
actually going to zoom it in because I
want you guys to see me up close we do a
couple of tests here in a second so if
we take a look at the control panel here
you can actually see that we have the
name of the webcam we're using and
underneath it we have to name them to my
reform we're using with the webcam now
I'm using this produce a USB microphone
to record my audio on the side but you
can actually choose to also record with
the same microphone with the webcam
instead of actually using the microphone
built into the webcam but you don't buy
them at webcam for the audio you buy it
for the video quality which by the way
is fantastic so down here you can
actually mute the microphone where some
acts are going to choose to do here on
the side here we have the zoom in and
zoom out panel that I'll show you guys
you can actually choose when you zoom in
to adjust it if you think you want a
little bit more to the left or to the
right so I'll just keep it here
underneath you can actually choose the
resolution you want to require that
right now I'm doing 1080 pixels which of
course I'm going to do because that's
the highest quality can also choose 720
pixels 480 and 360 pixels underneath it
here you can actually make it follow
your face which I do not know how you
activate because I've never been able to
check it on underneath it here you have
the right sound now this is the stereo
it actually comes up stereo dis webcam
and you can actually choose to uncheck
the stereo so it's just mono which is a
nice little detail down here we have to
something called right lights which is
basically when you check it on it adjust
the settings let's say that exposure and
gain and stuff for that it adjust some
of the settings by itself the only
little problem I've found by using these
settings not to show you guys in a
second is that if you check it on and
you go into the vent settings so you can
see everything is set on auto but
everything is on auto you can actually
see ooh you know the framerate is not
very good right now it's not very smooth
if you take it off I'm just really
quickly going to go ahead and take
everything off here save it it looks a
lot smoother than it did before so what
I notice is that when you check this off
it actually improves the video quality
so underneath here we have the audio
auto focus I have it on right now and
I'll actually test it for you guys
a little bit funny but I actually want
to make sure you guys knows exactly how
well it focuses as you can see it
focuses very fast back out back in
focused again move back counts go back
in now my experience with webcams
and the focus is that if you buy a
Microsoft webcam and a mat and you have
the Microsoft software installed it has
a very hard time focusing anew even if
you're just sitting still it keeps
focusing in and out it gets really
annoying
it has also way too much contrast and
it's recording which i think is kind of
over the top this webcam is very simply
can adjust all the settings very easily
than we actually off to check the
autofocus because it's focused now so I
don't need to have it on auto if you go
into that men's settings here it has
very nice settings to use for the webcam
if I go ahead and check as you guys can
see I checked off the right light which
make sure which means that I can now
take off all the auto functions I can
actually play the exposure I can play
with the gain as you guys can see I
can't believe the brightness the
contrast to call intensity why pounds
now all these things of the thing about
webcam software's is that sometimes when
you can adjust the brightness and stuff
it doesn't look very good when you try
to adjust it this webcam has very nice
image when you try to readjust it which
i think is a really good thing I don't
know why it's moving by itself maybe
it's still enough so I don't know but
you can actually if you do think that oh
you know oh my god it's way out of focus
and it's saved like that you can just go
ahead and right-click on the right
lights I'll take it again go into
advanced settings check the auto off and
now it's smooth again it has a good
frame rate so that's the way to fix that
little issue if you do not think you
have good frame rate so if you go ahead
and take a look at that vent settings
you can actually see we have the webcam
control which is the same as we have out
of the side panel here so we don't
really need to look at this and for some
reason every single time you go in here
it actually R takes it off focus goes
all the way over so it's basically the
same settings there if I go on
Advanced Settings we had the exposure
gain brightness all that good stuff at
the bottom here we have a an option of
turning off something called anti
flicker now anti flicker is basically
when you live in a certain part of the
world you were lighting inside your
houses you know your lamps and stuff
they go at a certain frequency and in
the US I believe it's 60 Hertz in Europe
it's 50 Hertz now I don't know what
Australia and all that stuff is but I
know where I lived it's 50 Hertz so if
you record with your webcam and you see
flickering with the lights I can
actually try and show you maybe if it
does it no it does not but if you have
flickering you need to change it to the
Hertz that you require that you have it
at and in your country so that will fix
it for you over here you have the image
orientation we can choose to have it on
normal a mirror which is kind of nice
and then you have the device info here I
do not want to change my settings whoops
adjust it here there you go now we also
have up here the Preferences if I go
into preferences it open up another
window here are two screens when you go
into preferences you have the general
settings quick capture second settings
gallery settings and update settings
inside the general settings I'm not
gonna get too much into it it's
basically stuff like you know keep the
webcam software on top of all the
applications stuff like that be going to
quick capture however you can see you
can actually adjust the audio settings
for the microphone input level just kind
of neat little thing to do now here we
have the audio quality and the video
quality where you can actually choose
what quality and rapport that now it
does say if you go in and change the to
a lesser quality that is gonna decrease
the file size it's a webcam and it
doesn't really record that large file
sizes so keeping it at the largest file
size if I'm record for half an hour it
only comes up with 500 megabyte which is
nothing compared to a video file and it
is 1080 pixels which is quite nice for
that file size so keeping it at
looseness will give you the largest file
size and the best quality plus it
doesn't compress in the video afterwards
which can be an issue so
down here at the record audio with most
into text and video I do not know what
that is exactly
you can also show make make it so that
it doesn't show the countdown toggle
when you start recording so yeah I'll
show you guys here I'll just go ahead
and do this three two one and it counts
down and then you can actually turn it
off by going into the caption settings
so we'll go back in there and we're
going to find it click up here so yeah
down here we can also choose to take the
LED control off and on which is the blue
lights to be have on the camera if you
go into the gallery ups and you do want
to change the video folder and the
photos folder because right now when you
install it the first time it's set as a
preset to save all your videos and
photos on your main drive which is not a
good thing
at least I think it's not a good thing I
don't like doing it on main drive I'd
like to have it on my other drive so I
can't you know so I don't take up
unnecessary space up here we have the
updates we can actually check my updates
and stuff so now go dump the software in
the webcam review I thought over
actually so you guys have fixed on an
issue that you guys may have with the
webcam after you're done recording with
the software which is that the audio and
the video does not synchronized after
you're done and I looked at the internet
for 12 hours and I came up with solution
for two different reasons that this
might happen and we're going to get him
to both of them but the first thing you
guys need to do before you do anything
is actually to find out if your footage
is unsynchronized right after you're
done recording drop footage or if it
gets unsynchronized when you import it
into a video editing program because
believe it or not there is actually two
different places where this can go wrong
and the which of you know check this is
simply to do a recording of maybe five
minutes just let the camera play and
just sort of like count it down three
two one
say three two one and see if the audio
is synchronized with the movements wait
a couple of minutes do this again and
then take the raw footage when you're
done here you go in and you say okay I
would like to open what my output folder
which is this one for me and then I
double click it and I check if the
footage is actually working or not okay
if it is not synchronized then you need
to do to fix
that I have for you first if it does
synchronize but it unsynchronized is
when he input it into a video editing
software they need to do fixed number
two with us which I'll show you guys
afterwards okay so the first fix we need
to let take a look at here is let's say
you've record a raw footage and is
unsynchronized in the raw footage what
do you need to do here is go to
preferences first go to a quick capture
now there's two reasons that your video
gets unsynchronized inside the raw
footage which is that first of all it
compresses the video after you done
recording and second of all the
framerate gets dropped when you have a
lot of other settings put on so first
thing you need to do is actually go into
your webcam software preferences go to
quick capture go down to audio recording
quality and video recording quality and
make sure that it is the highest quality
possible whenever you choose a lower
quality it compresses it when it
compresses it will spruce up the footage
and like I mentioned interview you
there's really not a large difference
between looseness and standards so just
go ahead and choose looseness okay so go
ahead make sure you have this selected
in here next thing you need to do is
actually go into your control panel and
make sure the right sound is checked off
make sure the right light is checked off
and autofocus is ticked off go into
advanced settings make sure that auto
down here is checked off and auto down
here the white balance I did actually
experience that you could have on
without it messing up so I'm just going
to leave this one on but go ahead and
make sure all the other stuff is set off
because it will actually my framerate is
so good right now because I have all
these things stuff as you guys can see
it is super good which is a thing that
you need to have one thing I didn't did
see that some people needed to do in
order to still fix this if they still
have an issue after telling all this off
is that you need to change the
resolution to 720 if 1080 is too much
for your computer it can be because your
computer cannot pull it I don't know
what kind of computer you have but
fixing it can happen when you change it
to 720 pixels instead for some people so
let's take a look at the issue that some
of you guys may have when you import it
inside a video editing software and then
unsynchronized now I have a very easy
explanation for why this happens for you
guys and don't get scared away that I'm
using premier because it doesn't matter
what editing software you're using it's
the same issue but just that you do not
have the right codec installed on your
computer now don't get scared away it's
not as complicated as it sounds it's
very easy to install this coding ok what
you need here is the QuickTime codec and
the way to install that is by going
online going to Apple's website and go
to QuickTime and then installing the
latest version of QuickTime Player when
he installed QuickTime Player
it automatically installs the codec
inside the video editing software that
you need okay now if this does not quite
fix it yet what you also need to do is
you need to make sure that you convert
your video clips because when you when
you have the footage directly from the
webcam software its mp4 files it comes
out with right what do you need to do is
convert this to MOV files and don't
worry you don't need a video converter
for this all you need to do is take the
footage click it change the tins to
format from mp4 to MOV like this now
some of you guys missing whoa whoa whoa
whoa you can't do that but it's actually
ok cuz this mp4 format is quicktime
format the MOV format is also quicktime
format when you change this and it will
come up with a warning you just say yes
it does not screw it up I can still
import it into my software and it works
I can still play it here this was too
short test we did before ok
so it will be synchronized now and I
promise you guys that this is not one of
the issues it might be something other
than that which might have them do with
the computer you're using I don't want
to say oh you have a bad computer which
is why it's not working but I'm not
quite sure why it would not be working
this is not fix it for you so I hope you
guys found this useful please do leave a
like if you did and I hope to see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
