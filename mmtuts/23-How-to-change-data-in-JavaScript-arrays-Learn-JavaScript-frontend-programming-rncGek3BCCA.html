how to delete and how to replace data
inside an array in JavaScript and as you
guys can see inside my document here I
have very basic html5 set up I have a
paragraph tag that has an ID as test so
inside my script tags the first thing
we're going to do before we can actually
do any of this is we're going to go and
create an array so I'm going to go and
say we have a variable which is equal to
names that is equal to brackets and then
inside the brackets we're going to go to
add just a couple of data so I'm going
to say we have a string called Daniel
then I'm going to say we have one called
John and then I'm going to go ahead and
say we have one called
Jane and then at the end here you want
to make sure we add a semicolon so
inside this array here we have a couple
of pieces of data now what I want to do
here is I want to show you guys a couple
of methods we can use in order to delete
data insert data and how to replace some
of these data here so what we can do to
start with here is I want to make sure
we actually get the data inside the
browser so in order to get it out inside
the browser I'm going to go and say we
have a document dot get element by ID
parentheses and inside the parentheses I
want to make sure we have tests set to
the ID then afterwards we want to save
punctuation inner 80 ml is equal to a
variable called names brackets and then
inside the brackets I want to say 0 so
what we're doing now is we're getting
the first piece of data inside the array
which means that we start from 0 meaning
0 1 to the end of right now I'm going to
get out Daniel inside the browser
so we're going to refresh the browser
you guys can see we get Daniel so what I
want to do is I want to try and take out
one piece of data from this array here
so inside the code in between where we
created the array and where we spit it
out inside the browser I want to create
an array function called pot so I want
to say we have names dot pop parentheses
so what I'm doing here is I'm going to
go ahead and pop out the last piece of
data we have inside this array here
meaning that right now for to actually
go inside the browser
the data inside the array called gain
would actually be spit out from the
array meaning that if I were to refer to
Jane inside this array here by writing
too we would get something called
undefined as you guys can see so right
now we don't have gain inside the array
anymore because we popped it out now we
can actually go ahead and include a
variable here called maybe X which is
equal to names dot pop the function and
go inside the output we have down here
and change it so we instead spit out X
and what do you guys will notice is that
we actually get gained because right now
the data we pop out from this array is
now set equal to X which in this case is
going to be gained because it's the last
data inside disarray so what we can do
here is we can also go ahead and say
well what if you want to pop out the
first result which is Daniel in this
case we can go ahead and instead of
using pop we can go ahead and use
something called shift now if we use
shift in this case like I said we're
going to be taking out Daniel because
that's the first data inside the array
so everything is going to shift down one
data meaning that right now forward to
actually print out X inside the browser
because X is equal to the shifted
elements we'll actually getting Daniel
if we were to actually print out the
array then Daniel will not be inside
this array here because we took it out
so now there's only two pieces of data
in here so what we can do next here is I
can actually go ahead and show you guys
how to insert data at the end and at the
beginning of the array by saying okay
well instead of pop which was the first
one that actually deleted something from
the end of the array I can go ahead and
say we have something called push so if
I say push then inside the parentheses
here I'm going to go ahead and say we
have some kind of data so let's say we
have something called frida which is
another name I'm going to go and push it
inside there Rader's called names
meaning the right now forward to
actually go inside the browser we would
actually see the array right now has a
data at the end of it called freedom so
what I can do now is I can actually show
you guys to actually inserted another
piece of data inside this array up here
because as you guys can see right now we
have three pieces of data in here and
because I went ahead and used the push
function down here we actually inserted
another piece of data inside this array
meaning there right now we should
actually have four results inside
DeRay meaning that if i were to print
out eggs inside the browser we're not
going to get the data we have in here
called freedom we will actually get the
number of items you have inside the
array up here so if I go and refresh the
browser you guys can see we get four so
that means we have four pieces of data
right now inside names now let four want
to add something in the beginning of
this event instead of putting it at the
end of the array I can actually go ahead
and use something called unzipped
now unzipped is very similar to shift
which was the one we just talked about
but instead of taking away a data from
the beginning we're going to add a piece
of data at the beginning so I'm going to
say on shift now if we go ahead and test
this by saying that we set X equal to
what we just did here with the unsafe
function I can go ahead and go inside
the browser refresh and as you guys can
see we still have four pieces of data
which is because right now inside this
array up here we still have four pieces
of data because it just inserted a piece
of data at the beginning so now we
talked about how to insert data and how
to remove data from an array at least
when it comes to the end of the array
now the next thing we're going to talk
about is how to replace some of the data
we have inside the array based on where
inside the array is positions so what I
can do here is I can actually go ahead
and comment out what we have down here
because you don't need to assign a code
and instead I'm going to go ahead and
say that we have our array called names
brackets then I'm going to say well
let's go ahead and replace the first
data inside this array which is 0
because we count from zero one two I'm
going to go and replace this data with
another name called Nick now by using
Nick like so I can actually go ahead and
try to print out names inside the
browser just going to go and refer to
the first piece of data down here called
zero and now I got some notice we don't
get Daniel anymore we actually get Nick
so if I go refresh you guys can see we
now have Nick so in order to replace
data we can just simply refer to the
data at least position inside the array
and then simply set it equal to
something else like I just did here now
the last method we're going to talk
about is something called splice now
splice inside the other script is when
we go inside an array and say ok let's
start from some
I like John which is number one inside
the array and we can decide if you want
to insert data what John is or we want
to replace John with another piece of
data and we can do this with a unknown
amount of data now to demonstrate let's
actually go ahead and remove what we
have here with nick and uncomment the
variable X we have down here so what I
can do is I can actually say well we
have names I'm going to say splice then
inside the parenthesis I'm going to go
ahead and delete Freda
now the first data tells the browser
width index number inside the array we
want to start with so right now for
where to write one it means that we're
starting at John because we start at
zero one two now the next piece of data
or this the next parameter in here tells
us how many pieces of data we want to
delete at John so forward to write zero
we would not delete John we just simply
insert whatever data that comes after
this zero down here inside the
parenthesis inside where we have John
inside the array so if I were to say
comma and say for example frida and like
I mentioned we could actually decide any
kind of number of data we want to insert
what John is so we can actually go and
just add more comments behind it and we
can just add as many pieces of data as
we want to it's just going to get
inserted what John is inside the array
so we were to say we also have Bella we
would now have two pieces of data
inserted what John is so for were to go
down inside my document get'em by a D
and say well let's actually go ahead and
print out names if I go inside the
browser refresh you guys can see we get
Daniel Frieda Bella
John and Jane so right now we do
actually have five pieces of data now
we're going to go in and change some of
the numbers for example let's say we
want to actually remove John when we
insert these pieces of data I can
actually write one meaning that we were
going to remove one data from inside of
here which is going to be done because
that's the one we're pointing at I'm
going to have my browser refresh and as
you guys can see John is now gone
if I were to go back and change the
number from one to two
Jane would now also disappear inside the
array
so so this is how we can insert the lead
and teens data from arrays inside the
other script hope you guys enjoy it and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
