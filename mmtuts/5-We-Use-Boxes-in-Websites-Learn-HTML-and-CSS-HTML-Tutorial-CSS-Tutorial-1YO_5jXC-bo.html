containers inside HTML and the reason I
want to spend one episode talking about
containers is because usually we'll make
a website we split all the content into
boxes and this is something that we can
kinda tell on a lot of websites so I
thought today we're going to talk about
you know how we split up the content
inside websites so I'm going to go ahead
and go into my browser here and I did
actually find three websites that we're
going to look at just so you guys can
see what I talk about when I talk about
containers because it was to look at the
website I have here which is just my
basic website that just has a piece of
text inside of it you guys can see we
can't really tell that anything is
inside boxes so let's actually going to
take a look at three random examples
that I've found and the first one is
something called night people now inside
this website here you guys can kind of
tell that we have a bunch of content we
have a logo we have a navigation we have
a logged in and then we have some
content down on the page here now one
thing I want you guys to pay attention
to is that when we go to a website we
can kind of divide all the content into
boxes now right now we were to take a
look at this website at least the front
page when we enter the website for the
first time you guys can see we have an
entire video playing in the background
here with some content inside the video
now we can actually do is we can
actually go and say that well we have
one big box here with a video net and
inside this box here we have more boxes
so we have one box for the header which
is the part up here with the navigation
and logo and the login buttons all of
these are inside one box that are
grouped together so we can actually have
content that goes together inside a box
for themselves then we have some text
down here that says we unite
construction business blah blah blah
which is also going to be inside a
separate box for self so everything
inside a website is inside boxes if were
to scroll down you guys can see that the
box with the video and it actually
disappears and we have another box that
has our sectors inside of it so we have
an entire box here that has a white
background with another box inside of it
that has content such as a header has a
piece of text and four different links
inside of it
so if we keep scrolling down you guys
can also see we have a map this is also
a box that has a map inside of it and we
have a sidebar in the left side which is
also a box that has content inside of it
so everything inside the website is made
out of boxes it would take the next
example here you guys can see we have a
hit at the top here now it's a bit more
clear to see that we do have a box
inside at the top of the website here so
we have a logo we have a navigation and
the login button and all of this is
inside a very white box that has all the
content if we were to go a bit further
down you guys can see that a video with
a bit of content on the right side here
which is also inside a box inside this
box that contains the video so again
everything is inside boxes so all these
websites here that I'm looking at even
though they might seem complicated all
the content are going to be put inside
boxes so if I were to go inside the code
of my website here you guys consider
right now we don't actually have any
boxes inside the code right now meters
have a paragraph and the way we can
create boxes inside our code is either
using HTML elements which we talked
about in the previous episode for
example if you have a article which
right now is actually a box that does
not have a purpose inside the browser so
an article would actually have related
content inside of it so article does
have a specific purpose for which
content should go inside of it inside
our website now if I want to create a
box that has no purpose inside the
website that I can just use any place
that I want to group content together
such as the paragraph down here and
maybe if I were to create a h2 tag that
has this is the title and then the
paragraph then is going to be you know
whatever text belongs to the title if we
want to group this together inside a box
so I can move around the content using
styling which we're going to talk about
in the next episode because notes
actually tell the browser where we want
the content we need to style our code
inside the website so right now it would
just save this you guys can see that the
text is just going to be up in the
corner and if I want to move it around
such as centering it or changing the
text or doesn't look this boring
to do it using CSS and we call that
styling the HTML so we're not going to
talk about that yet we're going to do
that in the next episode but if we were
to put this inside a box I can actually
go ahead and create something cold and
div now it's div like I said it's just
an empty element and I can actually go
ahead and take my tags here and put them
inside the div so right now we have this
grouped inside a box and we can actually
go ahead if I want to move around the h2
tag and the paragraph inside the website
I can just go ahead and style the div
tag here with like I said we do using
CSS in order to move around the content
inside of it so if I were to go back
inside one of the websites we looked at
for example you could say humankind's I
can go ahead and scroll down into some
section and set the website such as this
one you guys can see you have some
content on the left side and we have
some content on the right side if I want
to take a look at what we do actually
have inside the website I can actually
go ahead and right-click which is a
small trick that I can actually show you
guys no to see the code of any kind of
website and this is not something that
you can block anyone can go to your
website and see the code at least the
front-end code that we code using HTML
CSS so in order to see this code we can
right click on the website for example
want to see the code of this specific
section here I can right click on it go
to inspect and then you guys can see we
get this small window here with code
inside of it and this is actually the
code inside the actual website at least
when it comes to the front end part so
what I can do here as you guys can see
when I hover on these different sections
inside the code is that it does actually
highlight the code or at least the
constant that I hover on inside the code
so we want to see that as well as you
guys can see this specific section here
with the two different constants you
guys can see that everything is inside
one box if I were to go inside this div
here which you guys can actually see
this is actually the tip box that I
showed you guys so what to go inside of
it inside my tool here we can actually
see that this content in here is split
up into more boxes so we have the left
box and if we were to go here we have
the right box so we can actually see
what is actually going on inside the
front end code when we
use this developer tool inside any kind
of browser so as we continue this course
you I'm actually going to show you guys
how we're going to use these boxes such
as dip box or some of the other HTML
elements inside our website so we can
actually split up the content inside
these boxes that I'm talking about so if
you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys next
