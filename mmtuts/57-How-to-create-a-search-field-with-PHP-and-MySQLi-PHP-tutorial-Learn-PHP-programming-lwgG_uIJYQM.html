search field inside a website and this
from the gas requested of me so we're
going to do that today and as you guys
can see running from here I have a very
basic demo that we're going to build
today now what do you guys want it was a
way to search for content inside your
website I got a lot of requests from you
guys doing you know searching for images
or articles or users so what I'm going
to do today is I'm going to search for
articles inside this website here now
before you guys start asking well you
know what about searching for images
well the way we're going to do today is
the exact same way if you were to search
for images or users or posts or
something you might have inside a
website it's the exact same way you're
going to do it so doing it this way it's
also going to teach you how to search
for images if you were to do that so
before we get started coding I want to
show guys what exactly we won't be
building inside my website here inside
the demo I have a search field at the
top where you can type something in and
so it for it inside my front page I have
the title of the page which right now's
the front page I have all the articles
inside the website listed underneath
here and as you guys can see I only have
two articles inside my website and I
could easily do more but just for the
example here I thought two would be
plenty so the idea here is that me as a
user inside this website here let's say
I'm inside a really beautiful website
which doesn't look as ugly as this one
but it hasn't searched we let the top of
the page now what I want to do here is I
want to search for something inside this
website now what we're going to search
in is going to be up to us right now I
just set the limit to you know being
searching for articles inside the
website and the only thing you guys need
to do in order to actually you know tell
the website what is it actually search
for whether it being you know content
inside pages or articles or images it's
going to depend on what you have inside
your database and what you allow for
people to actually search for again
we're going to get to that when we do
the coding but just to let you guys know
you can do whatever you want so what we
have here is two articles and I want to
search for maybe the title of one of
these articles maybe I want to search
for some kind of recipe so I'm going to
type recipe inside the search field and
I click search and then we get one
article now do you notice that you can
actually click this article because this
is the search page and we want to know
what exact is inside this full article
now right now our next step and it you
know a lot of text inside the article if
there were a lot more text and you just
want to give people you know a preview
and then when they click the article
they can see an entire article then this
is the way to do it so what I did here
was I allow people to actually click on
this article and it opens up an article
page that has the full article inside of
it okay now of course we should have a
menu inside this website so we can
actually go quickly back to the front
page or have the search field available
at the top inside the header I didn't do
that for this demo here but it's
basically just the same concept so I
could also go inside my search field and
say what if I want to search for a and
author inside one of these articles I
could actually search for Daniel do
notice I'm not typing Daniel with a big
D but they're also down here does
actually have Big D when i click search
it still finds the article inside the
search page so we're going to go ahead
and make sure that the user connected
search for the title the content the
date it was actually posted and the user
who posted it okay so we're going to do
a pretty decent search field that's not
really complicated but you know still
complicated enough so we can actually
get decent results out of it so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go ahead and
open up our page you know this is the
actual page that we have created right
now inside my coding document there's
nothing inside the index file other than
just the basic HTML file setup inside
this website here the first thing we're
going to do is create a database
connection so what I'm going to do so
I'm going to go and create a new
document I'm going to save it inside my
root folder I'm going to save it as DBH
dot PHP notice I'm not creating any kind
of sub folders for you know database
files or that sort of thing so if you
guys want you can just go ahead and do
that you don't have to do the directory
exactly as I'm doing it now inside this
database file I'm going to go and open
up a PHP code and I'm going to go and
create a database connection so I'm
going to go and say we have a variable
called Khan
I'm going to set it equal to my sqli
on the score connect parentheses
semi-colon and we could just create
variables up here let's actually go and
do that so we're going to create a
variable for the server address so we're
going to say DB server or we just server
because it doesn't really make sense to
say DB server equal to localhost like so
I'm just going to copy paste this a
couple of times so we're going to say
four times so we have four of these
inside the second one we're going to go
ahead and say we have a username we have
a password and we have a database name
now we're going to go ahead and change
the actual values of these variables
we're going to go out and state a user
name is going to be root because that's
the username for my local host we're
going to get the password to nothing
because that's the password from my
local host again if you guys have
different values in here you guys need
to change it according to your database
my database name is going to be DB PHP
search just to give it some kind of name
that matches somewhat what we're going
to do in this episode again you guys can
name it whatever you want to I'm just
giving it this name here inside my
variable connection down here I'm going
to go ahead and include these parameters
or these variables which has created
inside the function so we're going to
say we have a server we have a username
we have a password and we have a
database name like so so now we have a
database connection and we can actually
go and include this connection inside
our front page so I'm going to go to the
top here I'm going to open up my PHP
tags like so and we're going to say
include single quotes DB eight dot PHP
so now I have a database connection at
the top of our page now the next thing I
want to do is include a style sheet
because
so we'll need to include a statute at
some point just to make it look somewhat
nice inside the process so we don't look
at something really ugly that
potentially will work but you know it
looks somewhat nice so I'm going to go
and create a new document I'm going to
save it inside the root folder as well
call it stylist CSS and I'm going to go
ahead and link to this down seed inside
my index file so underneath my title
inside my head tag I'm going to go and
say we have a link which is a style
sheet the type is @ x /c SS and the
hyper reference is going to be style dot
CSS so just a very basic link so now
that we have this one thing I would like
to do in order to make this easier when
we have to create this website is create
a header the PSP file and take all the
header content and put it inside this
one file because then we can just link
to it which makes a lot easier if you
have to make changes so I'm going to go
and copy everything from the beginning
body tag I'm going to delete it then I'm
going to create a new document paste it
in and save it in some a root folder as
header dot PSP inside my index page we
now need to link to head of the PSP so
we're just going to go and copy the
include tag we have it on top of the
head of the PHP file paste it in and
instead say we want to include the
header dot PHP so now by doing this we
automatically get the head of the PSP
inside the next file and we
automatically get the database
connection inside the header meaning
that we're linking to both of these so
now that we have this we need to go
ahead and start creating the actual form
we're going to use in order to create
this search field
the very first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to go and say we have a form
I'm going to open up the form tags and
we have an input which is going to be a
text type the name is going to be search
and we're going to go and I'm a
placeholder called search like so
and now we have that the next thing you
need to create is a button so I'm going
to go underneath here and create a
button that's going to have a type set
to submit and I'm going to go ahead and
give it a name called submit again you
guys could potentially name it something
differently than just submit because
it's not really a good name for it we
could call it submit search let's
actually go and do that so we're going
to say submit search inside the form tag
we're going to go and tell it which kind
of action we want and we need to set a
method so I'm going to say action which
is going to be the document to reload
once we click the submit button or the
search button which is going to be a
file called search dot PHP again search
the PSP is going to get a search page
that we load up with all the search
results inside the website once you do
this we need to make sure we include the
method which I'm going to set as a post
method like so and that's basically what
we need for the search form now the next
thing we need to do is actually get all
the articles inside the website showing
inside the front page now right now we
don't have any articles inside our
database we don't even have a database
yet so the next thing we want to do is
create this database I'm going to go and
go inside my database which is my PHP
myadmin
again you guys should know how to do
this by now if you don't then there's a
tutorial at the beginning of this series
here showing you guys how to install PHP
myadmin I'm going to go and go into PHP
myadmin go to databases on the top here
I'm going to create a new database and
just to check what we called it inside
our DPH the PSP you call the DB PSP
search at least I did so I'm going to go
ahead and copy this name inside my
database create the database and now we
have the database but without any kind
of see a pulse in it so to create these
tables I'm going to go ahead and go
inside the SQL tab up in the top here
I'm going to click it and then we need
to create the actual tables and the
articles that goes inside the tables
again there's other ways to create it
inside PHP myadmin I think it's good
practice to type it in manually inside
the SQL tab up here so we're going to do
that so inside this field here
going to go ahead and we'll fit them all
I'm going to consume into the gas can
actually see it the next thing we're
going to do is when we go and create a
table sometimes I say create space table
space I'm going to say article which is
going to be the name of this table space
treinta C's semicolon then inside the
parentheses we're going to go ahead and
write in all the different columns we're
going to add inside the table so the
first one is going to be an ID we're
just going to be a unique number for
each article that's actually inside this
table so we're going to set this one to
a integer type which has 11 different
numbers inside of it then we're going to
say space not null space primary key and
then we're going to set it to our two
underscore increment which means that
each time we get a new article inside
this table it's automatically going to
increase the ID by one comment the next
one we're going to get is the title of
the actual article now I decided to name
this a bit differently so we should
probably not call this one ID we're
going to go and call it a underscore ID
the a just stands for article so there's
nothing special about the a it's just a
way for us to name the actual columns
inside the article table so I'm going to
go and create a new column down here I'm
going to call it a on the score title
I'm going to set this as a vodka type
I'm going to set the limit inside the
parentheses to 256 again you guys could
choose to set this as a text type if you
wanted to then there's no limit on the
actual characters they can actually type
for the title I'm going to set this one
to not null the next line I'm going to
go and create one called text which is
going to be the actual content of the
article so I'm going to say not test but
text like so I'm going to set it to a
text type because we just want it to be
an infinite amount of text then we're
going to set it to not null comment next
line now I'm going to go ahead and copy
the second column we created called
title paste it in underneath here and
we're going to go and change the title
to author so we can actually get the
name of the actual person who
wrote this article now the last one
we're going to do is the date so we do
actually need to get a date for the
actual post so we're going to set a
underscore date again the reason I'm
doing a underscores because if I were to
just write dates it would actually
highlight a different color which means
that we're actually doing one of these
types over here so by writing a
underscore we avoid getting this weird
color so this type is going to be a
date-time format which is a very
specific format that has to look like
the date-time format inside SQL and
again we're going to get to that once we
create the insert statements to actually
insert articles inside this table the
next thing I'm going to do is set it to
not null and now that we did this we can
actually go ahead and create all the
different inserts we need inside this
table here let's like to go ahead and
create a the actual table by saying we
want to click go underneath here and as
you guys can see now we have a table
called article if I go inside the
article you guys can see that we have no
data inside the actual article we just
have the rows in here so I'm going to go
ahead and go inside my database again
I'm going to go to the top where we have
the SQL tab and then we're going to go
ahead and insert the actual articles so
I'm going to say insert into article
which is the table we just created I'm
going to go and say parentheses values
parentheses semicolon I'm just going to
go to move down values there so it looks
a bit nicer a bit more structured so we
can actually see what's going on and
inside the article parentheses up here
I'm going to go and insert the column
names of article so the first one we had
was the ID we don't have to insert that
inside article here because it's auto
increment it we don't need to do
anything with it so the second one was
the title of the actual article so going
to the a underscore title comma space
then we're going to say a on the score
text which watch the second one then
we're going to say a on the score author
comma a on the score date then we're
going to go to move down to values I'm
going to go ahead and insert the values
inside these two things here now I do
actually have two text next to me here
all the different texts are used inside
my demo I'm going to go ahead and leave
a link in the description in case you
guys want to have the exact same text as
me
maybe you don't you can just write in
your own values I'm just going to go and
use the same text as I used in my demo
so inside the values I'm going to go
ahead and say we have a I'm going to go
and say single quotes and inside the
single quote is what we're going to
insert the actual value of the actual
title of the first post or the first
article so I'm going to go ahead and say
we call this 150 great summer recipes
which I like I just said I just copied
from my text next to me comma single
quotes and then the text inside of it
was there are many recipes you can
create for the summer which involves
grilling boiling frying and toasting I
know it doesn't really make a lot of
sense the text but you know it's just
some kind of text we can have inside of
here now the third value is going to be
the author name so I'm going to go and
say comment space and we're going to
write single quotes inside the single
quotes I'm going to go and say we have a
admin because why not let me just insert
any kind of name one or two it could
also be my name or Susan or something
space and then the last one is going to
be the date time and remember the date
time has a very specific format that we
need to insert so the first thing is
going to be the year going to go to say
2017 - then we're going to go and set
the month which is going to be 11 - then
I'm going to say 25 which is going to be
the 25th of November I'm going to say
space because now I need to insert the
actual time and not the date so we're
going to go ahead and say we have 12
which is the hours : we're going to go
and set the minutes to 23 :
and then the seconds so we're going to
go and say 11 so this is what we need to
insert now I'm just going to go and copy
what we created here paste it underneath
it and I'm just going to go ahead and
change the second insert to something
else again I have all the text next to
me here so I'm just going to go and copy
in the values I'm going to go and insert
into my database here so the second
title is going to be a series of
computer software you know just add
something and the text is going to be
the following I'm just going to insert
it here like so in this article you
learn
about some of the software used on
computers disable basic software more
advanced software used by developers as
an example I'm going to change the also
down here to Daniel Nelson which is my
name
you guys can type in your own name if
you want to and I'm just going to going
to change the data over here so it isn't
the exact same date now again because we
have seconds over here the likelihood of
an article having the exact same name
and the date is going to be very
unlikely which is going to make sense a
bit later when we do actually need to
open up back to the article inside a
separate page so we need to make sure
that any article in here does not have
the same title and does not have the
same date okay having said that the
articles could have the same names but
it should not have the same date done so
I'm going to go and insert this data
inside my database I'm just going to go
and say go and as you guys can see we
get no errors inside my article we have
two columns down here I'm just going to
zoom out for you guys that we have two
rows in here with the stuff we just
inserted okay so now that we have some
data inside the database we can actually
start spitting it out inside our front
page and this is all the data we're
going to use in this episode like I said
this could be a table that had something
recording images for the users it could
be something regarding posts or maybe
user data you know the actual users
listed inside the website so you can
change this into whatever you want to it
doesn't have to be an article like I did
here so going back to our coding here
I'm going to go and go back to the index
file and the first thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to go underneath the form
and I'm going to go and create a h1 tag
which is going to have the actual title
of the actual page so I'm going to say
this the front page just have something
I'm going to go underneath here I'm
going to create a h2 tag that says all
articles and then we need to actually
list all the articles underneath here so
I'm going to go and go underneath and
create a dip box that will contain all
the articles that we get from the
database which in this case is just
going to be two articles and I'm going
to go ahead and give this div a class
because we will need to style this at
one point so I'm going to set a class
attribute and I'm going to set the name
to article - container inside this
container we're going to go and open up
our PHP code
with a couple of PHP tags and inside the
PHP tags we're going to go ahead and
write a select statement in SQL that
would go into the database and select
some data so I'm going to go and create
a variable call it SQL so the equal to
double quotes and we're going to go and
say select all from articles I think it
was article in single and not plural
yeah it is and now that we have this
we're just going to close out this line
of code underneath it we're going to go
ahead and actually run this line of code
inside the database and get some kind of
result from it so we're going to go
ahead and say we have a variable called
result I'm going to set it equal to
MySQL I underscore query parentheses and
inside these parentheses we first of all
need the connection for the actual
database which we include it inside out
header inside the DBA to the PHP we call
this variable come combat and then we
need to have the actual SQL sentence or
the SQL statement that we need to query
inside the database which is up here so
I'm just going to copy in my variable
called SQL and now that we have this
we're going to go ahead and check if we
had any kind of results from this select
statement so underneath a I'm going to
go and say they have a variable called
query results with a big bar just to
make it somewhat neat it's equal to my
SQL i underscore num underscore rows
parentheses which is going to check how
many rows of results we get from this
quarry up here now if the query up here
was written correctly we should get two
results from the database because there
are two articles so I'm going to go and
say that we should actually run the
result over here and see how many
results did we get which would be two by
now underneath iam going to create a if
statement like so and inside the if
statement I'm going to go ahead and say
well if we had some kind of results from
this check up here that were above zero
meaning that we had some kind of result
then we should run whatever code inside
the if statement
and the code inside the if statement is
going to be a while loop that simply
keeps spitting out all the different
articles we have inside the database so
as long as we have results from the
database it's going to keep spitting it
out like so inside the condition we're
going to go ahead and say that we have a
variable called row which is equal to my
SQL I underscore fetch underscore s sock
parentheses which is going to be the one
that contains all the data from the
actual results inside the database so
I'm going to go and say we have a quarry
up here that we run called dollar sign
result and I'm going to insert it inside
the parentheses of this dollar sign row
down here so now that we have this we
should essentially get all the results
in the database and now I just need to
tell it what we need to write inside the
website so the first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to go to an echo some
kind of string which is going to be a
dip box that contains all the stuff we
get from the database I'm just going to
go and close this one off as well like
so and inside this dip box we want to
write a h3 tag which is a head of three
I'm going to close it off as well
like so and inside the h3 we need to get
the actual data from the database that
had the title of the actual article so
I'm going to go and say well now we're
switching from a string to PHP code so
we're going to go and say double quotes
to cancel out the echo string and inside
the double cross I'm going to say
punctuation two times because now we
want to write some kind of PHP code and
we're going to go and write dollar sign
row brackets and inside the brackets
we're going to go ahead and write the
name of the actual column they want to
spit out in this case is called a on the
score title which means that now should
actually get the title inside our front
page if it were to just go ahead and
copy what we have here pasted on
underneath here like so I'm going to
golden tint it from title to text so we
get the text from the article we're
going to change the h3 tags to simple
paragraph tags because it looks better
and I'm going to go and copy this one
more time actually two more times the
second one is going to have not
but the date and the third one is going
to have the author like so so now we
should be getting some kind of results
inside our index file if we were to go
inside my index page refresh you guys
can see you get some stuff in here first
of all we have a search bar up here that
we forgot to include some kind of
sections at the button we're going to do
that but we get the front page we get
all the article title here and get each
article from inside the database this is
one article and this is the second one
so now we need to style it to look
somewhat nice and when we start is we
don't need to sell anything else inside
the website because we're just going to
reuse the same styling so just to get
over with we're going to do that right
now inside my form we're going to go and
give it some kind of text first we're
going to say search inside the button
here just we have the text refreshed as
you guys can see now get the text up
here inside my stylesheet we're going to
go and start off by saying that we want
to have some kind of styling for the
body because we need to change the
background color the entire website just
to make the articles pop out more so
we're going to say if you have a body
tag curly brackets and we want to set
the background color to hash tag f3f3f3
semicolon then we want to set all the
font to Arial of some sort so if we get
some kind of text that doesn't look very
ugly so I'm going to set the font family
to Arial and then we're going to go to
style one of the classes we created
inside our index page which is the one
called article container which is going
to be the one that contains all the
Articles that spit out from the database
so going back inside our style sheet
we're going to say article - container
curly brackets and inside the curly
brackets we're going to set it with -
900 pixels we're going to set a
background color to white
which is going to be FFF and we're going
to go ahead and set a padding just to
get some you know some kind of border
around all the articles so it doesn't
touch the side of the browser so we're
going to say padding I'm going to go
ahead and set it to 30 pixels just to
have
kind of border underneath the article
container class we're going to go inside
the article box you know the one that
contains the actual post inside our
index file well we didn't actually
create that yet so let's actually go and
do that inside the div tag inside the
wild statement here we're going to go
and give it a class name so going to set
equal to single quotes I'm going to go
and call this one article - box then
we're going to go install this one so we
can get some you know some spacing away
from the articles when they list
underneath each other if you guys see
inside the website you can't really see
when the first article stops and when
the next one starts so we need to create
that spacing so going to say they have a
class called article that's box we're
going to set a padding bottom to 30
pixels we're also going to go and set a
width to make sure that the width of the
article goes all the way to no the left
side and right side of the article
container actually I don't think we
actually need this but you can just
write it just to have it so now that we
have this let's actually go ahead and
style the input and the button we have
inside the search field so I'm going to
go and say we have a input inside the
website it has a padding which is going
to be 0 pixels from top and bottom and
20 pixels from left and right just to to
make sure the text when we type inside
the search field doesn't touch the sides
of the search field so inside the input
here we're also going to go and include
a new width we're going to set it to 300
pixels we're going to set a new height
which is going to be 40 pixels and we're
going to go and set a font size to 22
we're going to go and copy this and
we're going to go ahead and do this for
the button as well so we're going to say
instead of input we're going to say
button and we're going to go and remove
the padding because we don't need that
we're going to go and change the height
to 44 pixels because the input is going
to have a default border that we don't
have inside the button so we're going to
go and include a height that's slightly
higher just to make it match up the
weight should not be 300 because that's
way too much we're going to set to 100
and this is basically all the styling
need for an entire website let's
actually go and refresh the page and as
you guys can see it changes the entire
page layout so now we have the articles
down here that are actually separated so
we have some spacing in between and we
can access you the textbooks on what
nice now the next thing we need to do is
when we do actually go inside our code
or inside the website inside our index
file and we click search inside the
search field something needs to happen
we need to go in to the search page
which is the search that PHP file we
included up here and do something with
the actual search string that we typed
inside the search field so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go and
create a new document I'm going to save
it in some a root folder and I'm going
to go and call it search dot PHP again
this is just a search page where we're
also going to have all the code that is
related to the actual search function
now the first thing we're going to go
and write in here is going to be the
title of the actual page so I'm going to
go and say to have an h1 tag just like
with this inside the index file where we
created the front-page tag here so we're
going to go and write we have a search
page underneath the h1 tag we're going
to go and include the article container
then include it inside the front page
because you need to have some kind of
container for all the articles or if you
actually get the search results so why
not just use the same one again you guys
can change it if you want to this is
just my demo so I'm going to do it this
way when it comes to styling now inside
this file we also need to make sure we
include the header the PSP because the
header has some information we need to
attach the actual database connection
and the style sheet so we're going to go
and go to the top of our site here and
we're just going to go and copy what we
have inside our index file up here and
paste it at the top so to actually get
the entire header so now we should
automatically get the database
connection and the link to the
stylesheet inside the article container
we're going to go and start writing some
PHP code so I'm going to open up my PHP
tags close them off again and inside the
PHP tags the first thing we're going to
do is when go and create a each
statement that says if we actually
clicked the submit
button from the search form so we did
actually call this one submit test
search I believe so we're going to say
inside the if statements inside the
condition is set parentheses dollar sign
underscore post brackets and inside the
brackets you want to search for submits
- search like so so now if we did
actually get to this webpage and we did
actually click the search button then
it's going to go and run the code inside
the if statement inside the if statement
we're going to go ahead and create a
variable which is going to be the
variable that contains the information
we typed in inside the search form so
we're going to say we have a variable
called search I'm going to set it equal
to my sqli on the score real underscore
escape underscore string and I'm doing
this
at least this function here because we
want to make sure when they use to type
something inside the search form that
they don't try to do any kind of SQL
injection inside our database so we need
to make sure that the data we get from
the user is safe anytime we get anything
from the user we need to make sure we
escape some kind of weird characters
inside what they typed in because we
don't want them to mess with our
database okay so inside of here inside
the parentheses we're going to go and
include the database connection which
was variable con comma and the second
parameter is going to be the actual
thing that the user typed in from the
index file or inside the index page so
we're going to go ahead and say they
have a dollar sign underscore post
brackets and then we call this one let's
actually go and see what we called it we
called it search so we're going to go
and say we have a post method called
search like so so now that we got the
actual search words that the user typed
in let's actually go ahead and go
underneath here and type the SQL
sentence we're going to go to inquiry
inside the database because we need to
actually search the database for what
the user actually typed in so we're
going to go and create a variable we're
going to call SQL for the equal to
double quotes
closer with a semicolon now inside the
double course we're going to go and
create a select statement we're going to
say select now I'm just going to go and
say we select everything from the
article table inside the database you
could just say you want to search for
the title or you know something else we
do actually to make sure include from in
here there we go and after you get the
table name that we actually want to
search then we're going to go and create
a where statement because we're going to
tell it that we want to search a
specific column for the keyword that the
user typed in inside the search field so
the column I'm going to go out and check
here is going to be the one we called a
on the score title so first of all we're
going to check if the title from any
kind of article inside our article table
it has the keyword that you use to
search for now typically in the past we
would actually go and set it equal to
single quotes and then the actual
variable up here we called search like
so but because you want to search for
part of the title you know for an actual
keyword and not the entire title name we
need to do a slightly different so I'm
going to go and say we don't want to set
it equal to instead we're going to go
and write a keyword called like so we're
going to go and say we have some kind of
word that needs to sound like something
inside the title now in order to do this
we're going to go and say single quotes
and then we need to type the actual
search word they want to search for now
before we do this you need to actually
include these percentage symbols around
the variable name so we're going to go
and write two of them and then copy the
variable name inside in between these
percentage signs or the symbols so now
that we did this we're now checking the
title if it has any kind of key word
like the word the user typed in inside
the search field okay now this is not
enough because we also want to search
the text inside the article so what I'm
going to do here is I'm going to go and
say space one say or we have I'm just
going to copy this we have here a
another title but we have a text inside
this article that is like the search
that the user actually searched for
so we're just going to go and keep
copying this and again if I didn't want
the user to search for the author then
I'm just not going to include the author
inside this you know string we're
creating here now I'm just going to go
and keep copying this I'm just going to
go and say we have an or statement I'm
going to copy it afterwards or paste it
in afterwards I'm going to change the
text to author I'm going to copy it in
again or paste it in again I'm going to
change it from text to date so now we're
essentially checking everything inside
the article for the search word that the
user typed in okay so now that we have
this we can go ahead and run the actual
SQL statement inside the database we're
going to actually quarry it inside the
database so we're going to go and say we
have a double sign result that is equal
to my SQL I underscore query parentheses
and then we're going to go and say we're
going to go ahead and take the database
connection which is called dollar sign
come comma and then the actual query or
the actual SQL sentence we're going to
query inside the database which is
dollar sign SQL so now that we did this
we need to check again if we had any
kind of results so I'm going to go and
say we have a variable called query
results without the s and with a big are
equal to my SQL I on the school num
underscore Rose parentheses semicolon
now inside of here we're going to go and
get the result because you need to take
the result that we have up here if we
have any kind of results from the result
variable we have up here so if there's
any kind of articles that matches what
we search up here then it's going to go
ahead and fetch them okay well at least
check how many of them there are because
there can be more than one result which
is a neat thing about doing it this way
so not only have this we're going to go
and create an if statement now this if
statement inside the condition is going
to check if the curl result has more
than one or more than zero results from
the database because if there are no
results then we need to give some kind
of error mess
so going to say if it's greater than
zero then is to do something inside the
code here if there's no results that
we're going to go and create an else
statement that says there well we just
need to echo this out like so there are
no results matching your search like so
so now we have this kind of error
message we can go ahead and go inside
the if statement and write the code that
we need to know to actually get out the
results so what I'm going to do here is
I'm going to go ahead and say we have a
while loop and again we're doing this
very much like we did in the front page
we're just going to go ahead and insert
the results inside a variable called row
so we're going to say dos on row because
we're only running this code if it is
actually haven't result and if we do
we're going to insert it inside this
variable here so we're going to go and
say it is equal to my SQL i underscore
fetch s sock parenthesis and again we're
going to go and check the result up here
and get all the data from the database
inside the while loop we're going to go
ahead and copy what we have inside the
index file then we've created this echo
that had you know the actual dip box
with the data inside of it so I'm just
going to go and copy it insert it inside
my while loop here and save it so now if
we were to go inside my website refresh
it and search for something I can go and
search for any kind of keyword to have
inside these articles so if I say we
want to search for summer which is down
here I can write summer search and now I
guys can see we get a search result ok
we could also go ahead and echo out if
we were to go on top of the body call it
the actual check here that if we have
any kind of results from the check up
here to Tex how many rows we got we can
actually go ahead and copy this variable
go underneath the if statement say echo
there are space then we're going to go
and say we have a PHP variable called
core results punctuation double quotes
results actually space and dem results
because then it's actually telling the
user how many results there are from the
actual search they made we're going to
go and copy this or save this go inside
our browser refresh and as you guys can
see it says there are one result so not
only did this let's actually go and
create the actual article page that
opens up in a new page when you click
the actual article down here so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go ahead and
go down to our echo inside the actual
article that it spits out and echo out a
link around the actual div that links up
to the actual article so I'm going to
say we have a anchor around the dip box
so I'm just going to go to open up the
anchor tag before and close the anga tag
right after we're going to go and set a
hyper reference inside the anchor tag
which is going to be equal to single
quotes and inside the single quotes
we're going to go and link to a page we
haven't created yet called article dot
PHP then we're going to go and say we
want something else inside the URL so
we're going to say question mark and now
we need to decide what exactly is going
to go and use in order to open up a
specific article from our database now
when we did actually create the database
I mentioned that we needed to make sure
that there were no titles or dates that
matched up with another article you know
you know one of these could match up but
not both so we can't both have a date
and a title that matches with another
article because when we want to open an
article we need to make sure we open up
the article that has a specific title
and a specific date so I'm going to go
and say after the question mark here
that we want to open up an article that
has a title set equal to the result we
get from the database called title down
here so I'm just going to go and copy
the code remember you want to close off
the string and open up PHP code and then
afterwards you want to open up the
string again so we need to double quotes
around it I'm going to paste it in like
so and we do actually need to take this
single quote in front of it here in
front the equal sign delete it and move
it behind the actual PHP code here so we
have double quote single quote at the
end here okay so don't mess up double
quotes in single quotes need to look
like this
after this after the double quote and
before the single quote we're going to
go ahead and say and/or the ampersand
symbol we want to have a date that is
equal to the date down here so again I'm
going to go and copy the date and paste
it in right before the single quote and
right after the equal sign like so so
now we're going to go and create the
actual article page so I'm going to open
up a new document I'm going to save it
as article dot PHP and inside of here
we're just going to go and copy the
index file so we're just going to copy
everything from here and paste it in
we're going to go to the top and we're
going to go and delete the search form
because I don't see why we should have a
search form inside the article page so
let's just delete it I'm going to change
the name from front-page to article page
and I'm just going to go ahead and
delete the h2 tag it because you don't
need to say all articles so now we just
have the article container and we need
to make sure we select an article that
has the search criteria we typed in
inside the link we just created now just
to show you guys if you go back to our
front page i refresh the site if I
search for summer click search you guys
can see we now have a link if I click
the link you guys can see it open up all
the articles inside our database this is
going to limit it because inside the URL
right now does actually have the
parameters that we can use node to
narrow down which article we want to get
from the database so going back inside
the article the PHP file we're going to
go ahead and go inside the PHP text
before you start doing all the code here
and I'm going to go ahead and get the
actual data from the URL so I'm going to
say we have a variable called title
which is equal to and we're going to go
and copy a piece of code inside our
search field which was the one that
prevented users from actually messing up
our database which is up here inside the
search variable I'm going to copy it and
paste it right after so now we need to
change the sir criteria from search
inside the post method to
because when we created the the actual
link inside our search page you guys
consider the title equal to the title so
the title here is the keyword before the
equal sign okay so just to make sure you
guys understand this is not going to be
a post method as well this is going to
be a get method because when we go
inside the browser we can actually see
the search result inside the URL meaning
that this is going to be a get method
not a post method because the post
method we can't see inside the URL okay
that's the difference between the two so
now that we have this one we can
actually go and copy it paste underneath
here and change it from dates or from
title to date and change it inside the
get method as well so now that we have
this we can actually go inside our
select statement we want to select
everything from article where a
underscore title the column is equal to
single quotes then we want to get the
variable called title and a underscore
date is equal to single quotes dollar
sign date so now we should only be
getting one article from the database
okay so now that we have this I do
actually think we're done so let's
actually go ahead and go back to the
website go back to the front page so to
test is let's search for something else
in summer let's like to go to search for
Daniel because we have the name down
there I'm going to say Daniel okay we
got one article which is nice let's
actually go back again and search for
the dates because I want to search for
any kind of article that's written in
2017 so I'm going to say 2017 and now
you guys can see you get to article
results and it does access a there are
two results okay I can go out and click
on one of these articles and as you guys
can see it opens up one article inside a
separate page depending on what's inside
the UL so this is how we can create a
search field inside a website now again
this is a basic example of a search
field I hope you guys found this useful
and it wasn't too long and I'll see you
guys next time
