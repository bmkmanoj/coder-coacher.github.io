how to write something on the screen
inside the browser and in this episode
we're going to talk about what a
variable is
now a variable is something you're going
to use quite a lot in PHP essentially
what it is is when we take a name and
set it equal to something so to kind of
give you guys an example of a variable
let's actually go and write one out so
we're going to write dollar sign which
means that now we're creating a variable
and then we need to give it a name now
in my case I'm just going to call it
name as a name and as you guys can see
it did actually turn green because it's
recognized as a variable inside my code
editor now now we have a variable called
name and we need to set it equal to
something meaning that right now I'm
going to set it equal to a string called
Daniel and just to refresh it for you
guys remember every time we put
something inside quotation marks it's a
string inside PHP so right now we have a
string called Daniel which is set equal
to name if it were to save this refresh
my browser you guys to notice that
nothing happens and that's because right
now we just simply said that this is
equal to this with an X you tell it to
write something on the screen so if we
go down to the next line and say echo
variable name and then refresh my
browser again now you guys will notice
that it did actually write out Daniel so
what we can do here is we can actually
go ahead and just give you know a
variable any kind of you know maybe a
calculation or a you know a string of
text like we did here or even you know
functions we can create all kinds of
things instead of equal to a name and
then reference to it later on we want to
use it for something now why would we
want to use this though well let's say
and I'm just giving you guys a small
example here but let's say I have a line
of text called Daniel is a handsome
fellow now if I were to write this out
on the screen like so but I'd you know
I'm kind of thinking to myself but what
if we have a text input inside our
website where people can write something
in it
and decide for themselves who is a
handsome fellow so I want them to be
able to change the variable depending on
what they write in an input so what we
can do is we can simply delete Daniel
and because this is seen as a string we
do need to separate it from PHP code
meaning that if I were to echo out
variable name because variable name is
PHP code and this is a string we need to
put in a separator meaning that we need
to write dot or punctuation in between
the PHP code and when the string starts
I'm going to save this and now you guys
will notice that it prints out Daniel is
a handsome fellow because name is that
equal to Daniel if it were to remove the
punctuation mark you guys like to see
that we get an error message so we do
need to make sure we put this in here
when we do combine PHP code with strings
now this was basically what I wanted to
show you guys when it comes to variables
but since I mentioned that so many times
I think I should show you guys how to
write an input you know create an input
and echo out the sentence here depending
on what name you write inside the input
on the website it's just a nice thing to
know so you don't have to follow along
here you can skip the next episode if
you don't don't want to learn this I'm
just going to show you guys how to do it
so let's say I have inside my body tag
outside the PHP tags a form which we did
actually learn about in our HTML CSS
lessons so if you don't know about forms
yet I do recommend you guys go back and
learn about it so inside the form tags
I'm going to just create an input and
actually have it inside my form tags
there we go now this input is going to
have a name equal to and this name is
going to be name or I could actually say
person just so we don't have name
written everywhere and I'm going to go
out and set the type for this input as
text because it is text essentially now
what I'm going to do here is I'm
actually going to go ahead and save this
and inside perform I have to set a
method and an action well we can't we do
actually not have to set an action but
we definitely need to set a method so
actions are usually used when you do
want to pass this information to another
document but since we're going to stay
on the same page we're just going to use
method so we're going to use a method
called gets which means that now once I
do write something in the input and hit
a button called submits it's going to
take this text that I wrote and pass it
into the URL and again we're going to
learn about that in a future episode but
just so you guys can see an example now
let's go ahead and save this and refresh
the browser so right now you guys can
actually see that it says you know I can
write something and submit it if I
submit it you're going to notice that in
the URL
it says dollar sign person is equal to
blah blah blah blah
what I just wrote so what we can do here
is we can we can actually go down to the
variable and set dollar sign name equal
to whatever we write up inside the input
field so right now I can actually set it
equal to dollar sign underscore gets and
then I'm going to create the brackets
and inside the brackets I'm going to
write single quotes then I'm going to
write the name that we gave the input as
a name so right now we call the person
I'm going to save it so right now name
is that equal to dollar sign underscore
get which means that it's going to get
this thing from the URL and pass it into
this you know here which means that name
is now equal to what we wrote inside the
input and then we're going to take the
sentence down here we're just going to
take name and put it into the sentence
so if i refresh we're probably going to
get an error okay we don't because I did
actually have something up here from
before but if I want to go back to the
previous page we do actually get an
error because right now we didn't
actually write anything yet so now this
is error message because variable name
is not set yet because we didn't
actually write anything is a handsome
fellow so would you actually to write
something get rid of this Arum we can
actually write something else
won't show an error and it won't
actually show anything until we actually
submitted but for now let's just go
ahead and do it like this I'm just going
to write Jason again because Jason is in
fact a handsome fellow and submit it it
now says Jason is a handsome fellow so
this is just an example of how you can
pass variables into something like this
and how you can use it on you know just
a teeny tiny examples and really
variables are used in so many powerful
ways and this is just a really really
basic example of how he can use it so
hope you guys enjoyed this episode this
is really all I want all I wanted to
show you guys in this episode so in the
next step so we're going to talk about
this a little bit further and do
something cooler so hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
