episode we going to talk about how to
prepare a document to connect you use
bootstrap inside our websites so as you
guys can see right now I do actually
have a very basic index that HTML file
with very basic html5 code inside of it
so this is just the very basics of a
html5 website layout when you get
started you know creating a website so
what we're going to do in this episode
is just basically importing bootstrap
inside our document so we can actually
use the code that bootstrap provides
inside the HTML CSS in JavaScript that
we need to use and we do that by getting
what's called a CDN which is content
delivery network which means that we're
going to go ahead and link to you know
all the bootstrap code which is laying
online somewhere and we do that instead
of downloading the actual bootstrap
files since there's more benefits from
using this CDN Network okay so a CDN
network is very easy to set up and what
we're going to do here is I'm going to
go to open up my browser and inside my
browser we're going to go to type get
bootstrap comm now inside get bush comm
we're going to go ahead and go up to the
top where it says get started I'm going
to click it and as you guys can see we
now get some different options in order
to download bootstrap now inside this
page you'll notice that we have quite a
few options when it comes to downloading
bootstrap but the one we're going to
focus on is the CDN Network so I'm
actually going to go ahead and just go
down to where it says bootstrap CDN and
I'm going to go ahead and copy all the
code we have in here so I'm just going
to click on the copy button there we go
I'm going to go inside my file and I'm
going to go inside my head tag and I'm
just going to paste everything in now
I'm just going to go ahead and move
everything out so it looks you know some
kind of neat nice like so and what we
have here is basically the first one up
here it's going to be the bootstrap CSS
and this is the CSS we're going to use
when we setup a bootstrap website so
instead of having a separate CSS
document that has all the bootstrap code
in it we're just going to go and use
this CSS document that is online instead
of having a physical file so I'm going
to go ahead and just keep this blogger
code here then we're going to go down to
the next one where we have an optional
theme which means that we can basically
no use some kind of pre-made theme that
we can use inside our push that website
I'm going to go and delete that for now
since I don't think we need it we're
going to make our own theme and the
second link down here at this the second
piece of code is the latest JavaScript
version of bootstrap meaning that this
is all the Java code the booster
provides us so if we do special
JavaScript stuff inside bootstrap you
know stuff that's meant for bootstrap
now we're going to go and keep this code
as well the last piece of code we need
is jQuery we're going to go a new
sticker inside our built here because
day curry is a very good language to use
when you want to use JavaScript I should
mention if you have never done j-curve
before since I did say in the beginning
of my series here that jQuery is not a
requirement you don't need to know
jQuery before we get started I'm just
going to go and include the a curry
since we will probably in the later
courses when it gets more advanced we're
going to start using some JavaScript and
jQuery so just to have it here when we
start out I'm just going to go and
include it from the beginning so we're
going to go inside our browser I'm going
to go to jQuery comm which is takers
website I'm going to go ahead and click
on download jQuery
now inside jQuery here we get some
different options what I'm looking for
is not downloading a physical copy of
jQuery that we're going to include
inside our root folder just like with
the bootstrap files we're going to go
ahead and use a CDN Network so I'm going
to scroll down to where we have using
jQuery with CDN I'm going to go and
click on this link down here that says
code dot J query comm which then takes
us to all the different versions we have
of jQuery we want to use Cakery CDN now
we're just going to go and use the
latest one which is take root three
point X I'm not going to download the
uncompressed version because we don't
need to edit the code I'm going to go
ahead and copy the minimize version so
when we do actually click this link as
you guys can see we now get a piece of
code that we can just include inside our
own documents I'm just going to go and
copy what we have here or you could just
simply click the button over here says
cover to clipboard then go back inside
my document
and I'm just going to go ahead and
include the jQuery right before we load
the minified javascript like so just
going to move it out so it looks nice
well let us actually do that so now that
we have all the files that we need we
can actually get started using bootstrap
so this is basically all I want to show
you guys in this episode in the next
episode we'll actually start creating
some stuff inside our body tag and
actually get started using bootstrap so
if you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
