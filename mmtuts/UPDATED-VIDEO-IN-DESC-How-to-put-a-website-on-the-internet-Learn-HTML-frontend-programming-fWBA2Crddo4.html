talk about how to actually upload a
website so we can see it online and
before we talk about how to actually
upload the site I'd like to talk to you
guys about what is required in order for
you to actually upload the website so if
you take a look at the website we're
going to upload you guys can see that
this is the template we've been building
in the past many episodes and even
though it does look very pretty I think
this is a good example to show you guys
how to upload a website so right now
this website you guys can see here it's
access it on my desktop it's not online
it's actually sitting on my desktop on
my computer and order to get it online
we're going to need a couple of
different things the first thing we need
is a domain name and a domain name is
essentially what you type into the URL
in order to show something so if you
type facebook.com or youtube.com that is
the domain name now the second thing we
need is something called an FTP platform
or an FTP software which you use to
actually upload your files to your
domain name now the first thing we're
going to do is we're actually going to
go to a hosting company where you can
buy a domain name and the one I
recommend is the one called one that
come now there's a lot of hosting
companies out there and some are better
than others some are really bad some are
really good
now my favorite hosting company is the
one call one that come the do you guys
can see right here and the reason I like
this company is because it's both simple
to use one dot-com and they have really
good customer service now if you do
actually sign up to a hosting company
and you use one come I highly recommend
you guys click the link in my
description of this video because if you
do go to one that come using that link I
have in the description and sign up you
guys going to get three gigabyte extra
space for free on your server because
once you do sign up you can choose
between 15 gigabyte 30 gigabytes 60 120
all the way to 2 terabyte and if you do
actually use my link you're going to get
3 gigabyte extra for free which means
that if you sign up for 15 gigabyte
you're going to get 18 gigabyte which is
good so once we're in here in order to
actually buy a domain name you're going
to have to go up into the search field
up here type in something for example if
I type in mm toots it's going to give me
different options here if I want
dk1 calm org now that DK is already
taken because that's my domain name if I
were to type in something else like mmm
toots ASD you can see that we have all
of these available to us so we can just
choose one so if I choose the one called
calm it's going to take me to another
page where I can active buy this domain
now buying a domain is going to cost it
quite a bit more the first time you buy
it and then from there on out when
you've actually bought it then it's
going to cost you roughly I think $10
maybe a little bit less than that a
month to actually keep the domain so
right now you're actually paying forward
twelve months and you're paying for
setting up the website for the first
time so for the whole year is going to
be one sixty four corner in my case
which is about two hundred something
dollars I believe
no no not two hundred that's way too
much it's about 40 something dollars so
it does cost quite a bit to set it up
the first time now once you've actually
bought the domain and you registered it
down here and you're done then you're
going to have to wait till you receive
an email now there's three emails that I
should point out you're going to get one
email which is a fact or you know like
that shows you what you've bought the
second email shows you your login
information for the control panel up
here so if I do actually go to my
control panel and lock in you guys can
see I did actually blow up my
information because I don't want you
guys to see it if I do actually login up
here I am going to get to my control
panel where I can control all the
different things about my domain that I
want to control now I'm also going to
blow out some stuff in here because I
don't want you guys to see it but in
here you do actually get quite a few
things that you can choose now the one I
want you guys to pay attention to is the
one called SSH and FTP which is a menu
we have down here if you click it it's
going to tell you that you need to set a
password for your FTP
if it's your first time go ahead and do
that and then just go ahead and stay in
here for now now the last email you're
going to receive is an email that's
going to tell you to go to a host master
sites I don't know if it's called
hostmaster on other countries but here
in Denmark we have a company called DK
hostmaster which takes care of
registering all domains inside Denmark
so if you're in the US right now you're
going to get an email saying you have to
go to another kind of company and
register your domain name so if I go to
my DK hostmaster site and of course like
I said this is if you live in Denmark
this is how it's going to look like
you're going to get an email that tells
you to go here which has a user ID and a
number you need to use to actually log
in and logging in you're going to have
to then register your domain name you
won't actually see your website to the
actual register it so it's important to
do this once you get the email once
you've done that we can actually get
started on uploading the site I should
also mention that it takes a couple of
hours for your website tax with you
visible so if you did actually go in and
register your domain name you uploaded
your website to your domain and all that
good stuff and you still can't see it
you should wait a couple hours before
you can actually see it now going back
to my one they've come you can see we
did actually go into the FTP information
in here and if the P information you're
going to need once we download this
program called FileZilla this is a FTP
platform which is not something you have
to have you can actually go into a
dashboard inside your one that come and
upload your website straight away in
there but it's much more annoying and
complicated than just downloading
FileZilla and setting it up really
quickly so once you download a file
Cilla you're going to get this program
which is going to tell you a lot of
different well there's a lot of
different windows in here and might be
overwhelming to start with but once you
have this open you can go to file site
manager and in here
you can create a new site down the
bottom here and just kind of type in the
name of your website at least your
domain name once you created your new
site you're going to go over to the
right side and fill in the information
we found from our one that come if the P
information so there's a couple of
things you need to pay attention to we
need to host we need the port we need to
use the name for logging in and
eat the password so going back to one
calm you can access it right now - s my
host is this right here it says my
username is this right here it says my
port is down here and then the password
is what you chose when you did actually
go in here the first time and chose a
password now of course I blowed some
stuff out for you guys here because I
don't want you guys to go into my
website but once you have this
information you're going to go ahead and
put your host up here you're going to
put your port over here you're going to
say - username oh I need to mention if
your login type is set to anonymous you
need to choose normal then choose your
username or like put it in here and then
choose a password and put it in here and
then connect and once you connect it
it's actually going to give you this
little window down here with some stuff
in it if it's your first time uploading
to your new domain you're going to have
some default files in here which you can
just go ahead and well I shouldn't tell
you guys to just lead everything because
depending on the hosting company if you
use one that come your folder is going
to have some fascinate like an index
file that kind of thing and you can just
go ahead and delete everything if you're
choosing another hosting company you're
most likely going to have some folders
in here like I do have right here this
is actually I just logged into my FTP
from another hosting company I have
called domain direct so I'm actually not
showing you guys how to upload to one
that come right now well you need to
type in information I just told you and
then you can do it but once I actually
upload to Surrey guys we can get this
online I'm going to be using domain
direct which is a not as good company
for hosting as the one that come one but
I have all my FTP information up here
and I did actually choose it I locked
into my domain that I got from domain
direct which is called gain portfolio TK
and once I accessed my domain I do
actually get some folders and you guys
depending on the hosting company you
sign into will maybe have these folders
as well or something different but you
will have some folders so you need to
look into these folders and see which
one of them carries the information of
the website that you're seeing right now
when you do register website the first
time you type in to the URL address the
website it's going to give you some
welcome to one that come message or
something and that's actually the files
that are going to be in inside your fold
on here as a default so look into these
folders see if you can find those files
and then then you'll know that this is
where I need to upload the root folder
to if you're using one not calm you just
need to upload a root folder are these
are stuff inside your root folder
directly to the directory here
so because my hosting company here
domain direct tells me I need to go into
my HTTP Doc's folder to upload I'm going
to go into this folder in here I'm going
to go ahead and take my root folder and
I'm going to go ahead and take all the
files we have in here
and paste it in here so right now I'm
uploading it as you guys can see and I
do have one heavy file down here which I
don't know what is it might be a video
so once I do actually have all this
uploaded I can go to my URL and actually
type in TN portfolio but DK and see my
website so now it's actually online this
is how you upload a website and it's
actually very well the first time it
might be a little bit complicated but
once you've done it once it's very
simple to do and you guys might be
asking some questions about you know you
might not be able to find some
information inside you one that come
dashboard but I need to mention that all
hosting companies are different so if
you want to find your FTP information
some companies like one that come puts
it out really easily for you to just
find it and some companies make it
really difficult for you to find it if
you can't find it go ahead and contact
them and ask them for it and they'll
send it to you but this is essentially
how you upload a website so I hope you
guys enjoyed this episode and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
