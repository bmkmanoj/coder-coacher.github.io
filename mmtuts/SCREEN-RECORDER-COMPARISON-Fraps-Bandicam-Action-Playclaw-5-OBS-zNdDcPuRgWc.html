video that's sort of going to compare
different counts of screen recorders to
kind of give you guys an idea about
which one would be the best one for you
to purchase now before we actually get
started on this I do want to mention
that I realized that a lot of people
have a love/hate relationship with a lot
of screen recorders some people like you
know using fraps some people like using
bandicam but the truth about screen
recorders is that they're good for
different purposes some screen recorder
is really good for gameplay recording if
you're doing gameplay for YouTube some
screen recorders are really good for
desktop recording if you want to do
tutorials for YouTube and that sort of
thing or just you know tutorials for
teaching a class in case you're like a
school teacher something different
screen recorder set different purposes
now I do have five different screen
recorders that we're going to look
through and I purchased for them and one
of them is free so the first one we're
gonna be taking a look at here which I
will by the way gives kind of like a
pros and con thing I don't like using
pros and cons for different screen
recorders and different equipment in
that case but I will give you guys some
different points that I'm going to talk
about for each screen recorder to give
you guys an idea about what kind of
features they have and how stable are
they and you know what main features
should you be using these screen
recorders for so first of all we're
going to be taking a look at bandicam
now bandicam is actually the latest
screen recorder I bought and as you guys
can see the user interface is very
simple it does not have a ton of
customization but it does have what you
need in order to do desktop and gameplay
recording you have different kinds of
menus over here and decide different
taps of different settings up in the top
here you have different kinds of
recording modes which are you know
gameplay recording and desktop recording
and you can actually choose different
kinds of regions of a desktop you want
to record it's not just fullscreen you
can also make it into a region thing
only you can choose different kinds of
like if you want to take a screenshot if
you want to you know go to the output
folder in that sort of thing then you
have the start and play as you guys can
see I'm actually using bandicam right
now to record with for the desktop for a
good reason because it seems to be very
reliable when it comes to test
recording now I'm also going to be
talking about some of the features that
it might have bandicam from what I can
tell does not have live streaming in it
some some screen coders do have live
streaming if you want to do stuff at
which this one does not from what I can
tell I might be wrong I haven't looked
into it that much but looking at the
menus and different things here I can't
see any streaming now it does also have
a very nice overlay when you do actually
turn it on forward let's say game play
that sort of thing it has a little FPS
counter up in the left corner which I am
pretty sure you can move around in here
if you actually do go in here and check
out some different settings so you can
actually you know you can see your frame
rate actually recording which is a very
nice thing that pretty much all
screaming coders do have on them you
have different kinds of coding options
if you go into video you can see that
has formats down here now
I'm going to say for you guys who do buy
a screen recorder it's a very good idea
to keep you know the latest update of a
screen recorder
sometimes updates have a tendency to
 up and excuse my friends it's going
to up your recordings because for
some reason the latest update had some
sort of buck in it but it's a good idea
to keep the latest update because you
will get the latest format options for
the screen recorder so by looking at the
encoding settings you can see that if
you can choose inside bandicam right now
and I'm saying right now because you
guys should probably take a look at when
I uploaded this video it might be
outdated it might be pretty new now you
can choose avión mp4 and one general
rule I have about every single screen
recorder out there that you might be
purchasing do not compress your footage
when you record stuff for various
reasons if you compress your footage
which is when you record okay when you
record stuff with the screen recorder do
expect to you know for the recording to
be taking up a lot of space on your hard
disk if you try to if you try to take a
format setting in here for example if I
take mp4 and go down here and if I do
decide to record with like motion JPEG
or something like that it will not take
up at
a space in a computer but it's going to
do something called compressing of your
recording which is the biggest cause for
recordings to become out of sync and for
videos to get sped up or slowed down
randomly during the recording which is
the most annoying thing to be sitting
with and post-editing after you're done
recording so for the love of God do not
compress stuff in any screen recorder
when you record some screen recorders do
not have the option of choosing to
compress this one does and I would
highly recommend you stay away from it
so as you guys can see that the file tab
up here we have different video settings
down here like the file the size you can
actually choose different types of
screen sizes for it you can choose you
know the if you want to have sizes which
basically means you're having the
resolution of it which I would not
recommend because it doesn't look very
good when you have different kinds of
options here we also have an FPS counter
down here that goes from actually some
kind of weird things that you can choose
one frame per second which I could not
imagine you would actually choose you
can choose 23.976 which seems kind of
random to me because why would you
choose something like that when it has
24 right underneath it you can do all
the way up to 120 now I would not see a
recent one in 20 because 60 is smooth
enough and YouTube maximum takes 60
frames per second so you know it has to
fit FPS amount you need for basic
recording for both desktop and game play
down here it has different codecs like I
showed you guys before now these for the
four top ones right now are compressed
so I would not recommend using them I do
have a tutorial on my channel if you go
to my channel and search for bandicam
that shows how to record with something
called lose less mode which means that
you're not compressing your footage
which will fix sync problems now these
two down here does not compress your
footage but they are kind of screwed up
so the one I'm using right now is an
external codec that I got from somewhere
else which is a brilliant feature of
bandicam you can actually take outside
codecs and applied inside bandicam it
an awesome feature down here you have
audio settings just one thing I want to
throw out there I would recommend you
use PCM for recording not the MPEG - one
l2 because it is much better to use for
post editing that sort of thing so like
I said some of the issues with this
software is that footage have a tendency
to get out of sync but like I said I do
have a fix for it on my channel which is
surprisingly the only fix I've been able
to come up with you know if you search
on YouTube and Google I have not been
able I have not been able to find any
thing anywhere online coming up with
this solution that I have on my channel
which I hope will help you guys out who
do accept rob troubles with it because
it's the worst thing in the world to
have a screen recorder that creates out
of sync footage or just to get sped up
you know it's so annoying my personal
opinion about bandicam
is that it is right now my favorites
like I said everyone has a love-hate
relationship with screen recorders right
now bandicam is my favorite I like that
you can record in loose less format so
you get big file sizes that does not get
out of sync I have not experienced
auto-sync footage from it since I change
the codec in both gameplay and desktop
recording none ever which is good it
even does this little count up here that
says how many gigabytes have you used in
this recording so far and how many
gigabytes do you have left in your space
as you guys can see I have quite a bit
of space do buy an external hard disk
when you do decide to do you know
recording with the screen recorder like
I said expect large file sizes you
should go for large file sizes because
it should take up a lot of space with
record looseness get at this external
hard disk so we're going to jump into
the next screen recorder here and I'm
just sort of going to drag this to the
other side of my other monitor here to
get it out of the way we are going to be
opening the screen recorder called and
release action so real this action here
is my second-favorite screen recording
is actually the one I used all the time
before you spending camp and some people
might be getting some sort of pattern
right now where they say oh my god
this guy has no clue what he's talking
about
why is he not mentioning that fraps is
the best screen recorder out there and
don't worry we're going to get to fraps
and we're sort of going to get an
opinion on why I do not usually use
fraps for my stuff so the you know the
user interface here is the most
complicated user interface I've seen on
a screen coder so far from what I've
it's not the most complicated is
actually the second it's the most
complicated from a purchase screen
recorder let me say that it's the most
complicated user interface from a
purchase screen recorder I've found so
far now it does come with different
recording modes we have the game play
recording we have desktop recording and
again you can choose a active desktop
region which is very nice I do not know
why it's saying that I'm recording right
now which is it's probably going in and
seeing that I'm recording with bandicam
and it's sort of taking it as I'm
recording this is how it looks like when
you do regions on the desktop it's kind
of being a weird and stuff right now I
actually have no idea I have to close
this data again okay so we're back
inside
marilla this action I did actually need
to like force it to shut down because
it's somehow doesn't like when I'm
recording with bandicam next to it while
I'm having another screen recorder open
but this is not an Asia run into before
so don't take this as a bad thing for
release action now when it comes to
murder this action like I said it does
have quite a advanced user interface if
you call that it does not take long to
get to know but compared to other screen
recorders out there let's take fraps for
example fraps is very simplistic this
one might get a bit complicated me I
love the user interface I like when I
can go in there and tweak all the little
things because if I have issues with
this software usually I can go in and
tweak a little thing and it'll fix it
now right now after the latest update
however I did run into a problem which
is that my desktop recording in here
have a tendency to get out of sync that
is not a good thing like I said is one
of worse things you can experience you
have really nice recording you think oh
my god you know I'm just going to put
this into post-production and there's
going to be an awesome video and you see
it's out of sync it's the worst feeling
in the world when you do stuff for
YouTube so right now I have so
an issue with it which is why I bought
bandicam but before that I had no issue
issues with this one some people do have
issues with mirrorless action I need to
mention that when I go online I see
quite a few complaints about this
software which I have not experienced
myself
besides the auto sync issue that I got
off the latest update it has different
kinds of file formats down here you can
choose avi mp4 and it just included mp4
nvidia and inc which is the Leie well is
not the latest update but maybe two
updates to go to included it now the
reason they included that I think is
right now you can record AVI and you can
actually record with 1080 pixels if I go
in and choose mp4 you can maximum to 720
pixels if I then go down and choose mp4
in the video and the Vinc you can again
choose 1080 pixels but if you go down to
the framerate you cannot choose 120
which again I wouldn't see why you would
want to choose it but it's just kind of
I noticed this thing and it's kind of
weird that it's it's restricting you in
different ways depending on what you
record with but like I said choose avi
because and before has a tendency to
compress stuff and you can choose 1080
pixels you can choose every kind of
framerate you want to choose in here you
cannot make a customized framerate but
you do have some pretty nice ones to
choose from which don't say twenty three
point nine point something so it's quite
nice you know this one has a tendency to
sort of change to codecs from time to
time like sometimes the mp4 nvidia
living will be there and sometimes in
the next update is going to disappear
again and so it's not very stable right
now but it's a it's been very reliable
in the past so I cannot say anything bad
about this one I have a good love
relationship to this one if I would say
so now my personal opinion about it it
does create like I said if you want to
record loose less it does create large
file sizes and if you choose avi 1080
pixels it will create large file sizes
but the quality is amazing I like the
quality in here it's good I never
experienced crashing a game using the
screen recorder neither the bandicam
which is a good thing because I do have
screen recorders whoo
when I it they just don't like certain
games and when I start up the game and I
have a stream coder on
it crashes the game this one does not do
that so this one is very nice to to use
now with the different menus up here you
do actually have live streaming which is
very nice because there's other
software's that gets quite advanced when
you need to set up live streaming this
one is very easy to set up it's very
good-looking when your stream with it
you can maximum record 720 pixels I
should mention that it doesn't go about
that but it is it is very nice to use
it's very simple let's just go ahead and
jump into the next one which is going to
be play cloth screen recorder will take
fraps and OBS last because I think
that's the big ones this one does the
app there you go
looking at the user interface I know a
lot of you guys are going to be yelling
at me saying oh no windows 8 theme
personally I like Windows 8 the theme at
least I don't like the user like the
user interface of it but I like how it
looks and I kind of like the interface
here the only problem I have with this
is that if I need a certain function
let's say I want to do desktop recording
hmm
where do we find desktop recording well
we have streaming over here which it
does have which is a nice feature I have
not tested it out yet so I don't
actually well it does say enable here
only available in H okay so only a pifo
option twitch YouTube okay so it does
have different kinds of things here I
don't know if that I think this is free
I don't think I need to pay for this I
forgot to mention marilla's action you
do actually need to pay a monthly fee to
stream this one you do not now if I want
to do desktop recording where would I
find it encoding look there's nothing in
here saying anything you do actually
need to go down to general settings and
turn on desktop recording it'll be up in
the corner now desktop recording here is
very unstable for me I don't know about
all the pcs or Macs for that sake but
desktop recording and just regular
recording inside games is very unstable
for me in this one it just doesn't
I don't know if this is a new screen
recorder if you know just still trying
to figure things out but this one is
like play qualified just doesn't work
for me I bought it because I heard that
it was supposedly very CPU friendly
meaning that it does not take up a lot
of CPU power to use which will usually
drop your framerate while you're
recording games and that is a good thing
there's nothing more annoying than
running a game and then you turn on the
screen recorder suddenly your frames
could drop 20 points which is just
terrible
I bought this one because it was
supposed to be CPU friendly but
everything else doesn't seem to really
work for me it does have a lot of
overlay features I need to mention that
it does have FPS clock CPU GPU image
recording statistics stopwatch text
timer teamspeak webcam it has all these
kinds of overlays which is kind of
Awesome it just doesn't run very safe on
my computer it might crash again it
might unsynchronized it it might speed
up my footage it might come out as
corrupted it it's kind of crazy and
personally I would not recommend this
one at the moment after they update it
after they get some stuff fixed you
could you know end up with a really
stable thing because it doesn't really
seem that complicated but it's just not
it's just not working for me right now
the different codec settings we should
probably go over those you have these
five settings at the moment that I'm
saying at the moment because these also
change from time to time depending on
the update you have this funky feature
down here called video for Windows
unknown which I don't see why I would
call it that I don't know if this is
sort of a testing for them to run or
what this is but it does have different
distance mp4 formats down here then it
has m JPEG like which I guess is motion
JPEG and which is compressed by the way
fast up here is also a compress feature
I think it might not be I'm not sure I
haven't really looked into this program
because it's just not working for my
computer but it does have these
different counts of coding settings you
can choose framerate down here I guess
you can write in a customized one I can
try I guess you can
which is kind of nice but I don't really
know you can choose compressing threads
down here it has these kind of funky
features which I think it needs to be
kind of a technique to actually be using
if you're a person who has never touched
compression threads before on that sort
of thing I don't know how useful this is
going to be for you so I'm just going to
go ahead and leave this screen recorder
for now and just jump to the next one
because like I said it is just not
working out for me the second last one
we're gonna be taking a look at is fraps
and like I said fraps I saved the pic on
flash because a lot of people out there
gonna be saying hey you need to get
fraps for recording it is the best I I
have a different opinion on fraps I'm
not saying it's a bad recorder I
actually really really like fraps the
interface is very simple as you guys
consider user interfaces very simple I
do not like how simple it is it does
have a lot of features that are lacking
I don't see any streaming features in
here I don't see any customized codecs
settings it what do you call it it
already from standard runs at a
loose-leaf format of some sort of
encoding settings I believe it's mp4 it
runs at which is good if it's loose less
I'm not sure but I need to mention that
even though it's running mp4 now so I
think it is very stable it when you
record stuff it doesn't get out of sync
when you play stuff and suddenly the
game crashes while you're using it it
doesn't screw up your footage it doesn't
corrupt it now if you want to record at
desktop recording you know tutorials
that sort of thing if you're running
Windows 8 you're going to have troubles
running this thing because last time I
checked on my laptop which is Windows 8
it can't record Windows 8 it just can't
record the desktop so you might have
some issues there I don't know if they
updated it by my by now I don't know if
they're gonna update it later but at the
moment I don't think it's working out
for Windows 8 so just a little hint for
you guys out there rats might be really
good for gameplay recording it's X
than for gameplay recording but not as
much for desktop recording now I do want
to mention on my laptop fraps does not
seem to be crashing any games when I use
it on this computer which is my
stationary which is a pretty high-end
stationary it has a tendency to crash
some games like oh well I can't really
mention anyone with specific right now
but I know that if you try any Call of
Duty games it has a tendency to screw up
your mouse sensitivity so it does it is
quite heavy on your computer compared to
other screen recorders and it does go in
and interrupt some of the other regular
computer features like the mouse and
that sort of thing but it is very
reliable and stable on pretty much most
games pretty much all games it does come
up with large file sizes it is very
infamous for coming out with large file
sizes which is a good thing because like
I said looseness is good so we just have
basic general settings FPS movies
screenshots there's not a lot of options
in here really I don't know what else to
get into with this software other than
saying that it like I said if you're out
for game play stuff fraps is pretty good
for it so let's just go ahead and jump
back to the next one which is OBS which
is the last one I'm going to take a look
at OBS is free you do not need to pay
money for this one but it is very
complicated if you're not used to this
kind of screen recorder I do want to
mention though that for ice cream a free
screen recorder it is probably the
best-looking quality I've seen out there
on you know gameplay recording and
desktop recording for as create a free
screen recorder if I were to like I'm
very picky about my quality on YouTube
if I were to somehow get all my screen
recorders broken and the only one
working is OBS I will still be using OBS
as a last resort I would not say okay
I'm not going to upload anything till I
get my screen recorder fixed OBS is
excellent in quality it is just kind of
a pain in the ass to set up I had to
look up the tutorial on how to go into
settings and set up my encoding options
which looks like I'm not much of a tech
geek enough
to understand what my max bitrate need
to be yet I don't know what kind of code
and well I know what kind of encode us
setting I should be using but I'm not
sure what CBR panning is enable CBR
padding I'm not sure what that is custom
buffer size I don't know what that is so
there's a lot of stuff in here that you
should probably look up a tutorial on on
how to set it up like I did in order to
get this set up on what is actually set
up it is quite easy to use this one is
mainly used for streaming for like twits
and that sort of thing and it's free you
don't have to pay a monthly fee for
streaming and it's actually very
excellent at it as soon as you get it
set up like I said you can also do just
regular recording down here then you can
preview your recording down here just to
see how it looks like before I actually
get started you can actually see
everything in recording inside the
window that's going to open up in here
I'm not going to turn on the recording
right now because I'm actually recording
with bandicam so it might interfere but
you can't actually go in here and just
see a screen of what you're recording so
you can actually preview it as you're
doing it which is quite a nice if you do
actually need to set up a game play that
you're going to be doing with this
program you do actually need to go down
and do these special kinds of scenes
down here like as you guys can see I
have different modes depending what kind
of recording I'm about to do if I do
gameplay plus webcam which is a game
play thing you do actually need to go in
and set up every single individual game
you will be playing with the software
you actually do need to turn on the game
go into settings and you know like the
sources down here and set up a game like
right click and add game capture and you
get give the game at a blah blah blah
name and then you open it up and then
you need to find the game they'd have
open here which is kind of a painful
process every single time which gets
quite annoying but once you actually get
it set up it seems to be very stable I
have not experienced out of sync out of
sync stuff with this software so I could
recommend this one as a free option for
all the freeze free screen recorders
I've seen out there this one is the one
that I could recommend based on
reliability and quality so now I need to
I need to mention a couple of things
with these screen recorders personally I
think the bandicam at the moment as it
stands is the best one for if you're
both going to be doing game play and
desktop recording if you're only
planning on on game play I could
recommend either mirillis action
bandicam or fraps all three of them are
excellent at game play recording like I
said even though mirillis action does
have problems right now
it does seem very stable when I do game
play recording not as much an undead
stop recording but gameplay wise it does
seem very stable and I like the customer
station that has same thing with
bandicam I like the customization it has
now when it comes to desktop recording
either use I would say OBS as one of
them even though it's the free one use
OBS because it seems staple on it or use
bandicam fraps like I said is mostly for
game play there's like for example the
Windows 8 issue it's just a big issue
for me if it does not work on a certain
platform it's automatically a strike for
me I don't use it for desktop recording
because it seems unstable for doing that
specific task so like I said there's no
specific screen recorder that's better
than others it really does depend on the
purpose you're using it for so my
recommendation is bandicam as it is
right now it's not my favorite it's just
the one I recommend right now if I have
actually said bandicam was my favorite I
did actually mention to say in the
beginning of this video that it is just
my recommended right now with the
updates and everything from all the
screen recorders so I hope you guys did
find this very useful I hope I got into
as much as I could I did not want to go
past half an hour which I'm about to
reach right now so hope you guys got
enough information to actually make a
decision here as it is right now when I
uploaded this video down at the time
because like I said a year from now this
might be outdated and who knows play
clock could be the newest hottest screen
recorder that's the most reliable and
awesome quality looking stream record
out there so everything changes every
month so hope you guys find this useful
please - leave a like if you did it will
help other people see this video if you
you actually think that it's useful
enough other people to see and I hope to
see you guys later
