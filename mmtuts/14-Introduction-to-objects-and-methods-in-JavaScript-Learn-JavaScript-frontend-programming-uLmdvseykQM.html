about objects inside JavaScript and in
the previous episode we talked about how
we could actually create an object which
is basically just a variable that has
different properties inside of it and
how it could actually create these
properties and then afterwards write it
out inside the browser okay so we have a
variable up here called person which is
the object name and then we have the
different properties such as first name
last name eighth and hair color now the
way we write that out inside the browser
just to recap it for you guys is by
writing the object name and then
followed by a punctuation and then the
property so in this episode we're going
to talk about how we can create methods
inside an object and a method is
basically just a function that's inside
an object for example person up here now
what that means is that let's say I want
to write out the full name of this
person here but instead of having two
let's actually go ahead and comment or
remove the common from this document
right down here instead of saying person
dot first-name we're gonna say person
dot first name plus double quotes space
plus person dot last name which would
essentially give me the person's first
name followed by a space and then the
person's last name so ever were to
refresh the browser you guys can see it
says Daniel Nelson but this is too much
code to write what if we could make this
more simple by creating a method inside
variable person which means that we only
have to create this method once and then
we can just simply you know write out
the method that we have inside the
object so if I were to go into my object
up here and say well we're gonna add one
more thing or one more property inside
this object or one more method because
it is a method we're gonna say comment
next line and then we're going to go
ahead and create the name of this method
so I'm gonna go and say full name then
we're gonna say colon space function
parentheses
curly brackets so right now we just
create a very basic function inside our
objects and before we actually wrote
function we just gave it a name as full
name and then we said : just like we did
in the previous properties do bear man I
didn't give the function a name so we
didn't actually say you know full name
in here as a function name because you
already defined that right here in the
beginning so inside here I can go ahead
and create some kind of value or some
kind of you know function in JavaScript
so if I were to go in here and say we
have this objects first name and last
name and I want to write them out next
to each other I could actually go ahead
and document dot write parenthesis then
I'm going to go ahead and refer to the
object that or the property inside this
optic called first name and because
we're already inside the object we can
actually point one step up to the optic
way inside of by writing this this
basically means we're referring to this
optic were inside of okay we can also if
you want to just write person but since
this is shorter I'm gonna write this
punctuation and then we're gonna say
first name so if I watch actually go
ahead and refer to this method inside my
objects it would actually write out the
first name of this object so if I were
to go in and just copy what we have down
here
you know the plus space plus and then
add this last name it does exactly the
same thing as what we do down here but
because I wrote this inside the object
if I want to ever access this let's say
I have multiple places inside a website
I want to access the full name of this
person or this object I only need to
write a very short piece of code to
access it so what I can do is I can just
go ahead and write out a person
punctuation full name
parentheses because it is a method it's
not an property so we need to write the
parentheses afterwards and let's
actually go ahead and take the browser i
refresh and it says exactly the same
thing now if I were to actually go in
and delete the last name just to show
you guys it only comes up with the last
name so this is a pretty cool way of
doing this so we only have to write the
code once inside our website and this is
one of the really cool things about
optics because we write all these
different information and you know
values but we all need to write a small
piece of code once to refer to the
values to be having one place so we
don't have to write the same values
multiple places inside the website so
let's say I want to change the name of
Daniel to Steven then I just need to
change the one place and because I'm
referring to this object inside my
website it automatically changes the
object everywhere inside the website
which is kind of cool now just one more
thing because I know some coders have a
habit of you know doing it this way that
I'm doing it right here while I'm active
document writing inside my function I
just want to point out that this does
work you know actually document writing
inside a function to get this written
out inside the browser like this but the
preferred way of a lot of coders is
actually by returning the value instead
now we haven't actually talked about
returning so I'm gonna go ahead and just
delete some of this we have here
so now just basically remove the
document right and the parentheses that
went around everything so instead I'm
gonna go ahead and write return space
and then it returns all this information
here do bear- still have the semicolon
at the end here now if I were to save
this because I'm returning the value
it's just gonna return it but it's not
gonna you know I'll put it inside the
browser so even though I refer to this
method in here if I go refresh you guys
can see there's nothing so this is
actually where I will go down and say
Documents dot write parenthesis
semicolon and take this reference to our
method and put it inside our document
right like so now if i refresh you guys
can see we get the full thing out inside
the browser so this is how we can create
functions or methods like they're called
technically inside an object and of
course this is a very basic example we
could also write something first if you
wanted to we could actually create a
string that says the person's name is
then we want to make sure we actually
have a plus the name of this person so
if I go ahead and refresh you guys can
see it says the person's name is Daniel
Nelson okay again very simple example
you can do very complicated things with
these sort of information right now
we're just using a person as an example
for the object but it can do very
complicated calculations with this let's
say a shopping cart and set a website
where you have different you know
mathematical equations that need to run
in order to calculate the total amount
for the cart then you could use
something like an object to to figure
this out so like I said in the future
we'll be doing a lot of different
objects because we will be using it for
more advanced stuff in JavaScript so
hope you guys enjoyed I hope this wasn't
too confusing or too overwhelming
because like I said it is something we
will be using so if you guys enjoyed and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
