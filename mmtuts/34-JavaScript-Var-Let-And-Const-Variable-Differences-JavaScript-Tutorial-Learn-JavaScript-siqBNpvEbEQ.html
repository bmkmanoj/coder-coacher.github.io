step so we're going to learn about some
new variables we got inside the other
scripts now in 2015 we got a new version
of java script called es6 which also
brought along some new variables that we
could use inside our javascript code now
these variables have different
functionalities when it comes to what
they do as variables and in this lesson
I'm going to explain some of the
differences so as you can see I have
three variables inside my main latias
document here called vah let's and const
now the reason that we got these new
variables is because there's a couple
issues when it comes to the VAR that
we're used to using inside Diavel script
and the issue is to have something
called hoisting when we create functions
or scripts using javascript that makes
it possible for us to get errors when we
create the scripts and this is why we
now have let and cons because they go in
and fix some of the issues that var has
in it now you might be asking why do we
still have ba you know why not just
change it and make it into the same
functionality that let has or Const has
well because it has a slight difference
in the way that it is used we can't just
go in and change my two to have the same
functionality as let does today because
it might cause issues with already
existing websites that uses bar and that
right now works so if the people behind
JavaScript suddenly were to just change
it then we might get a lot of issues
with a lot of websites so when we got
new variables we had to call it
something else in order to not get these
errors with existing websites out there
so let me go ahead and explain what
exactly hosting is because we need to
understand what exactly the problem is
before we can know why these are better
than using Val so let me go ahead and
delete what we have here and instead
create a function that I'm gonna call
example parentheses curly brackets and
then inside this function here I'm just
going to create something like a for
loop and I'm just gonna go and change
some of the values we have inside of
here so we say ice less than 10 we're
going to add one each time we loop
through this for loop and then we get
some kind of output in
side to loop here nom - I'm not gonna
output anything because we just need
this as an example and what I'm also
gonna go and do here so I'm gonna cut
and create a if statements so I'm just
gonna say them if statement that says if
X is less than 20 then run whatever's
inside here and we can actually go ahead
and assign another value we can say we
have a BA which is called Y that is
equal to 30 or something now I'm just
gonna go and declare X because we
haven't declared it yet by using the VAR
keyword so on top of the if statement
I'm going to say we have a declared X
variable which is equal to 10 now if I
were to go ahead and console.log some of
the information that we have inside this
function here you guys will notice that
if we were to console dot log some kind
of information at the top here if I were
to take variable I and console.log it
here and then also do it down at the
bottom here we should get two pieces of
information inside the console inside
our browser now what I would expect
there to be would be to have some kind
of uncaught reference error because
right now we have an accident I until we
get down to the bottom here so we should
get an error in the first one and then
the second one down here is going to
have a value because after this for loop
we will have an I declared that has some
kind of value inside of it or if what's
going to take a much simpler example
here it's going to take X which also is
being declared down here in the middle
of the function so the top one should
not have any reference to any declared
variables called X now if we were to go
down to the bottom here and actually run
my example function go to my browser
refresh you will notice that we get two
values we don't get an error which we
did actually expect we get an undefined
which is the first console lot and then
we get 10 which is correct because the
second one does actually have a variable
called X that is equal to 10 so why do
we get undefined
now undefined means that we already have
the variable declared but we haven't
given it a value yet meaning that what
this function is censored
tells us is that we have a variable up
here at the top called X like so but we
don't have that so why do we get
undefined well that's because we have
something called hoisting now what
happens inside any kind of function
leveled elements such as a function here
is that if you were to have any kind of
variables such as eye x and y then it's
going to automatically declare the
variables at the top of this function
level meaning that what I wrote here
let's actually go ahead and just delete
the console locks what I wrote here is
the exact same thing as writing the
following I'm going to write la I dot X
dot Y so now I declared I x and y at the
top here and I can actually go ahead and
delete what we have down here with the
Declaration so I'm going to delete the
the VAR keyword like so this is the
exact same thing as the previous
function we had where we didn't have
vadik letter to top you manually and
this is an issue because if we were to
later on in this function here use I
again then we're going to be messing
with the same I variable as we used
inside this loop here now what I would
like to do is I would like to keep this
I variable at value inside this loop and
if it were to accidentally later on
create a second I variable then I would
like it to be a new variable that isn't
the same as this one up here so if I
were to actually go ahead and create
another for loop down here that also has
I inside of it then it's the exact same
thing as writing this which is going to
be a problem because now we have you
know more than just one variable I and
if suddenly becomes this huge mess that
we want to avoid so what we can do
instead is if we were to just go back
here to the original function we had
without all the console logs and the
declarations and such then what I can do
instead is I can go ahead and use BA and
change it out with let's now by doing
this then we don't have what we call a
function level variable which means that
you know it
gets too clever at the top and then can
use the inside the entire function
instead I can only be used inside this
for loop and X well can be used anytime
underneath this declaration up here so I
could actually reference to X down here
because we declared it not inside a if
statement again we call it a block level
variable so if you were to go inside the
if statement where we declared Y then I
cannot reference to Y down here because
it's inside this block here which is the
if statements okay so we can actually
avoid getting all sorts of errors which
is some huge improvement when it comes
to JavaScript now let me actually go
ahead and run this code here and say I
want to do the same thing as we did
before with the console lock so I'm
gonna say console dot lock at the top
here and I'm going to go ahead and log
out X just like we did before and then
I'm gonna just copy it paste it at the
bottom here and I'm going to console log
X one more time now what should be the
effects here because in the first
example we did expect it to say
something like uncaught reference error
because we don't have any extra
reference to appear in the first one but
instead we got undefined so what we
should actually get now is what we
expect to get oops we do actually need
to write it out down here there we go so
now we run the function you will see we
get a uncut reference error because x is
not defined and this is what we want to
get because we get more control over the
code that we have inside our website
which is much better than using bar now
you might be asking me well why still
we'd even use var when we have let now
that will essentially replace the usage
of bar now right now at the moment as
I'm making this video it's not a hundred
percent of all browsers that support the
new es6 javascript version so you need
to be aware of the fact that some
browsers can't use let yet but again if
you were to go inside and check which
browsers does actually support it then
it is pretty much all of them today I
mean there's not a lot of process that
don't support it so I would in my
projects to start using a let instead of
using Val
because it makes sense now we also have
a
second new variable which is called
Const now the difference between let and
cons is that Const
takes up less resources inside the
browser if I were to go ahead and define
that we have something called Const that
couldn't delete what we have here I'm
going to create a Const variable or just
a cons because we don't call it variable
anymore called
X which is equal to 10 now this is going
to take up a lot less resources than if
we were to use let instead but we can't
change the variable later on if we were
to go ahead and say that X is now equal
to something else
let's say 20 then we're going to get an
error inside the browser if were to
actually go ahead and run this you can
see that we get a uncaught type error
because we can't assign any value to a
constant variable which is what we're
trying to do here so we should only be
using Const if we have variables that we
know are not going to change later on
and to be honest I think it's much easy
just to stick with let's again there's
some people who would argue against what
I just said but personally when I create
projects using javascript I just sort of
stick with let because I don't want to
get any kind of errors when I try to
change the values inside my variables
here now another thing also want to
mention if you were to create a constant
object which we talked about previously
I can actually go ahead if we were to
create an object here and say we have a
value such as X which is equal to
something like 10 and I also have a why
that is equal to something like 20 then
I can't change this object and make it
into a new optic so if were to go ahead
and say we want to change X down here
into a second object that might have 20
and 20 then again I'm going to get a
error but what I can do is I can
actually change the individual values
inside the object because the object
here is a constant variable but the
values inside the object is not so what
I can actually do is I can say that X
dot X which means there were referencing
to the X inside the object here is going
to be equal to something else like 20 if
I go back inside the browser you will
notice that we do not get an error
message if we were to actually
console.log dot log the the object here
like so you'll actually notice that we
still get the object but the values have
changed and we can do this because the
individual values are not going to be a
constant okay so I'm just throwing that
out there so you don't think it can't
change anything about these constant
variables if you were to use it like an
object or maybe instead of function into
a variable we can actually do that by
creating you know like a function like
so we could actually do things in here
and again it's going to be the same
thing like the object so this is the
differences between using BA lit and
constant and in the future in this
episodes we will be using let instead of
BA and I will probably get questions
from people later on when they start
noticing that we're not using variables
but instead let's if they jumped in
later on this course here but it's
something that I think it's a really
good habit to get into them we need to
make sure we get new methods and
functions and variables for example out
there and we need to start using them to
make it a habit for other programmers to
see it inside something like tutorials
when it comes to Java scripts so in the
future we will be using let's instead of
variables so hope you guys enjoyed I'll
see you guys next time
