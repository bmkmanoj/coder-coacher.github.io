something called superglobals inside PHP
and basically a superglobal is when we
have a variable that has already been
created for us inside the PHP code
itself so I do actually have a couple
examples up here I have five examples
out of many because there's actually
quite a few out there but these are the
five that I want to talk about in order
to you know actually have us be able to
do something with PHP code like creating
a login system so these are the ones who
need to know about in order to do that
sort of thing and these are the ones
that we're gonna focus on the next
couple of episodes now actually getting
pretty close to be able to actually
create something inside PHP like I said
a login system I keep using that as a
reference but we can for example create
that after the next couple of episodes
so talking about superglobals we can
actually go ahead and take the first one
up here for this episode called Global's
now the basic idea behind Global's is
that we can actually go ahead and refer
to any kind of variable inside the
global scope no matter where we are
inside our document whether we're inside
a you know like a global scope or inside
a local scope so as you guys can see you
do actually have a variable here called
X which is equal to five which is inside
the global scope and I have a function
down here that has a variable inside of
it called Y which is equal to ten and
this one is inside the local scope of
the function so let's say I want to call
on this variable up here called X inside
the function now the typical way we want
to do it is to actually go in and you
know create some kind of variable inside
the parentheses like called X which
would then refer to this variable X up
here when we actually call it out so
instead we can actually go inside the
function and say we have a what you call
a global a global x' with an S behind it
brackets quotes or single quotes doesn't
really matter and then you're gonna
write the name of that to a variable you
want to use inside this function now
doing it this way would actually you
know it's not quite the same as putting
in the variable up here into parentheses
because in that you can actually change
the variable inside here when actually
call it out later on if you
if you go back to the function episode
we have in our series here you can you
know see then we can actually change the
name of the variable in here and call
out another variable using just a
function
now using Global's like this you will
always refer to the same variable
outside the function so if I were to
type the name of the actual variable I
want to call on in here I can actually
say X because right now this variable up
here is called X the dollar sign is just
a symbol that means that this is a
variable so the actual variable name is
X so if I go ahead and say you know X in
here and if I actually watch will echo
it out I can actually do that as well
so I'm gonna echo out Global's X and
then I'm gonna call the function down
here so I'm just gonna go ahead and
write something because that's the
actual name of the function go inside my
browser and you guys have Steve you got
five because right now I'm calling a
superglobal called X which is out here I
haven't actually called it inside the
parentheses and we still get an answer
out of it so this is the way we can use
for example a super global like Global's
inside our code and sometimes think it'd
be quite nice to have something like
this but I would not recommend using it
you know all the time because you know
this is for a different purpose than
putting you know a variable inside the
parentheses you don't use it for the
same thing and like I said you guys can
go back and look at my functions episode
to see you know why you want to use it
inside here but this should only be used
in special cases and you you guys might
have a reason to actually use it but
don't use it as a substitute over simply
calling a variable inside the
parentheses so I hope you guys enjoyed
this episode and next one we're going to
talk about something called post and get
super Global's and this actually really
important for you to know if you want to
create like a login system or something
again I'm using a login system as a
reference here you know as an example to
tell you guys you can actually start
creating this sort of thing once you
start learning these sort of things but
you will actually be able to you know
pretty soon create a login system even
though you might not right now see how
it's possible you know with all the
stuff we've learned so far but I hope
you guys enjoyed this episode
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
