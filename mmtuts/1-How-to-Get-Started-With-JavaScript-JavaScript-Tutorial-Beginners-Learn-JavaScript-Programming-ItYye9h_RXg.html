the first episode of how to program
JavaScript in this first lesson you're
going to learn what exactly javascript
is and how it functions inside websites
now javascript alongside HTML CSS is one
of the 3 core technologies that make up
content inside web sites meaning that
it's expected that you already know HTML
and CSS before we dive into this course
if you don't know HTML CSS then I do
have a course that teaches these as well
in my channel and I will go ahead and
link them in the description of this
video if you're interested in seeing
them at the beginning here the first
thing I want to talk about is the fact
that there are many other jobs too
related libraries frameworks and service
operations of JavaScript and for people
who are new at javascript these can all
be a bit confusing take you and react
for example a very popular libraries
that help make writing JavaScript easy
and faster we also have frameworks such
as angular and angularjs which are used
to simplify building advanced web
applications with JavaScript and then we
have platforms like no des which allow
JavaScript to run like a server-side
programming language and these are just
to mention a few now these are all huge
areas by themselves and we won't be
covering them in this JavaScript course
but in the future we'll have separate
courses teaching these as well if you're
interested so just to make it clear in
this course here we will only focus on
the core Java Script language ok now
there's one more thing I want to mention
which is something that some of you
might think is silly for me to say but
because I've received multiple comments
from people I just want to clarify this
Java and JavaScript are not the same
thing the only thing that is similar
between these two languages is that they
both have Java in their names
okay so don't get confused but these are
mix them together the next thing I want
to explain is how content is actually
displayed inside a website because in
order to understand JavaScript and how
it works this is something that they
need to know in order to become better
at developing using javascript
now when a website is loaded into a
browser it is done so in three different
layers the first important layer is what
we call the content layer and this layer
consists of the website content and the
HTML wrapped around it the second layer
is the presentation layer which consists
of CSS that is applied to the HTML in
order to make the website prettier and
the third players what we called intro
active layer this layers what interacts
with HTML and CSS to change what he can
see and do inside a website now the key
difference between these layers is that
the first two layers are loaded when the
page loads while the interactive layer
continuously runs in the background the
website in real-time both when and after
the page is loaded this means that
JavaScript can make changes to the
website at anytime without needing to
refresh the browser now within the next
couple of lessons you will learn which
tools are needed to write JavaScript as
well as how we can install extensions to
these tools which I just want to point
out it's not required but makes the
development process a lot easier as we
get started coding to other scripts so
if you don't want to use extensions then
you're free to skip that video so I hope
this video gave you a basic
understanding of what JavaScript is if
not they don't worry about it within
these lessons I'll both show and help
you understand what it can do using
javascript so if you enjoyed this lesson
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
