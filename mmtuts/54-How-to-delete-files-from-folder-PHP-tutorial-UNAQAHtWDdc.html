files from a root folder inside your
website so as you guys can see inside my
index the PHP file have a very basic set
up inside my body tags I have a form
which goes in and activates the file
called delete file the PHP and this is
going to be the file that we activate
when we want to delete some kind of file
from a root folder now inside my root
folder if we were to take a look I had
two files in here I have an index of PHP
file which is one we have in here and I
have a folder with a file called cat the
jpg now this cat that JPEG is the one I
want to delete once it do actually click
the button so what I can do in here is
we can go ahead and create the file
called delete file the PHP which is
going to delete the cat image so I'm
gonna go ahead and open up a new file
I'm gonna save it as delete file dot PHP
and inside this file the first thing
we're going to do is we're going to go
ahead and open up the PHP tags so inside
the PHP tags we just need to include two
things and you to include the path to
the file want to delete and we also need
to include the function that actually
goes in and deletes the file so the
first thing we're going to do is we're
going to set a variable called path
we're going to set it equal to double
quotes then semicolon and then inside
the double quotes we're gonna write
uploads at least in my case because my
image is inside an uploads folder
forward slash cats dot jpg so right now
we just include the path to the image
that I wanted to delete or encase the
file you guys want to lead from your
root folder and afterwards we just need
to activate it so inside PHP we have a
function called unlink which is the
function that we use in order to delete
files from our root folder so if we were
to go ahead and write unlink parentheses
and then include the path inside the
parentheses we now have the function and
goes in and deletes the image now
there's one more thing we can do because
what if we get an error message when we
want to find the image we can actually
go ahead and write an if statement like
so and inside the condition we can
include the unlink function we have down
here
like so delete the semicolon and in
order to take we get an aeronaut we can
include an exclamation mark from the
unlink function so we check if we did
not manage to unlink this file up here
then right this error message down here
so we can actually echo a string called
you have an error or something and then
under the if statement can write an else
statement that goes in and writes a
success message if we actually delete it
the file I'm just gonna copy the echo
here and say you have deleted your file
like so and this is basically what we
need in order to delete a file now what
we can also do if you guys don't want to
have you know some kind of success
message is you can also go ahead and
write a header function so we can
actually go back to the original page
and just get some kind of success
message inside the URL so we can
actually go in the header function right
double quotes location colon index dot
PHP question mark delete success so now
if I were to go back inside our browser
refresh and then delete the file you
guys can see right now inside the UL at
least from what I can see it says delete
success if I go inside my root folder
you guys can see that now the cat image
is gone and that's because it just
deleted the file so this is how we can
delete files from a website and if you
guys are interested in how to upload
files as you how to do that in episode
62 so if you guys want to see it you
guys can go back in my videos so this is
how we can delete files is very simple
of course we can do more complicated
stuff let's say it or not extension of
the file you want to delete let's say
you allow users to upload all sorts of
images to your website whether it being
JPEGs or PNG images then what we have
here it's not gonna suffice because
right now we said that it has to delete
a file called jpg but if we don't know
the type of file they want to delete
then we need to do it slightly different
so we're gonna talk about how to do that
next episode so if you guys enjoyed and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
