our next episode and how to program to
your script
now in this episode I'm going to talk
about something called conditional
statements within JavaScript and this is
something used quite often in any kind
of JavaScript up the case you might
create inside our code so the basics of
a conditional statement is that we can
take a block of code and only run it if
a certain condition has been met and
this is what a conditional statement is
so the way we can create them and by the
way there's three different kinds we're
going to talk about in this episode the
first one is going to be what we call an
if statement so we can create an if
statement by saying we have if
parentheses curly brackets and then
inside the curly brackets we add the
code that we want to execute inside the
website if the condition is true so we
can do anything from just running one
line of code to running a huge chunk of
code if you want to so for this example
I'm just gonna run one line of code
which is going to be a console log so
I'm gonna say console dot log
parentheses curly bracket not curly
bracket semicolon and then inside the
console log I'm going to go ahead and
say well I'm just gonna write out if
because this is a if statement so what I
can do is inside the parentheses say I
want some kind of condition to be true
or false before we run this code inside
the website so what I can do as you can
see we do have two variables up here one
called X that is equal to ten and one
called Y that is equal to 50 so inside
the if statement inside the parentheses
and go ahead and use a operator called a
comparison operator so compare X to
something else to see if it's true or
not so what I can do is I can say we
have X and if X is equal to 10 then I
want to run this inside the browser now
we did talk about assignment operators
in two episodes ago I believe we talked
about it being a equal sign so we say X
is equal to 10 which is assigning it a
value when we want to check if they're
equal to each other then we use two
equal signs inside our condition here
because we can't just use one because
then we're assigning X equal to 10 which
doesn't make sense so we need to use two
now we can also go ahead and check if X
is not equal to ten by writing extra
Mesa market set at the equal sign which
is again just the opposite so let's go
ahead and just use the first example you
would say is X in fact equal to ten and
see what happens inside the browser if
we were to go inside the browser you can
see that it says if inside the console
because right now the first statement
here is in fact true so it's going to
print out if inside the console so if we
were to change sex to something like 20
then X is not going to be equal to 10 so
for were to go inside the browser
refresh then you can see we have nothing
inside the console so this is how we can
do one specific condition now what if I
want to check for more than just one
condition inside the if statement well
we can do that as well using something
called a logical operator now when it
comes to logical operators we have three
different kinds we have the one that we
talked about a few seconds ago where we
just added a exclamation mark this is in
fact a logical operator because we're
checking is they're not equal to each
other now we can also go ahead and say
we want to add another condition which
is also a logical operator and what we
want to do is you want to check is X
equal to 10 or is something else
equal to something else so we can do
that by writing the pipe symbol and
adding two of them it's going to be on
the keyboard somewhere and it's one of
those buttons that are kind of kind of
hard to find any keyboard so if you
can't find and try to look up on Google
where you can find it it's called the
pipe symbol so you can go and check it
out on Google if you want to so what we
can do is we can also say is Y lesser
then 20 and by doing this we're saying
that one of these has to be true in
order for this code to run inside the
browser now right now X is not going to
be equal to ten because it's equal to 20
and Y is not going to be lesser than 20
because it's equal to 50 so just to test
this out inside the browser let's
actually go ahead and change X instead
of equal to 10 so one of them will at
least be true so right now for were to
go inside the browser you can see that
we still have the if statement showing
inside the console here because one of
them is
in fact true now if I want to check if
both of them has to be true then we can
go ahead and switch out the pipe symbol
with an ampersand simple or two of them
in fact so right now we're checking is X
equal to 10 and Y lesser than 20 because
right now it's going to be false because
one of them is not going to be true so
what I can do is I'm going to change Y
up here to 10 so that inside the browser
we now get if because now both of them
is in fact true so this is how it can
use these specific logical operators
inside our code now what if I want to do
something if this condition down here
fails like for example running a
alternate piece of code then we can go
and do that as well so right now if one
of these were to change so we say is y
lesser than 20 I'm just going to change
Y back to 50 because right now this is
not going to be true inside the process
of what to go ahead and refresh it you
can see that it's false so what I can do
instead is I can run something called an
else statements now an else statement is
not going to have a condition using
parentheses it's just going to be else
and then curly brackets because it's
just going to run this code if the
condition before it does not has not
been met so right now we can go in
console log and again we could write a
bunch of code if one two I'm just going
to console log something simple so we're
going to write else just to know which
specific statement we're running inside
the code here so right now for where to
go inside the browser you can see that
we get else inside the condition here
inside the console so what I can do now
is I can go and say well what if I want
to have another condition because right
now we just have one if statement in
here that takes for a specific condition
inside the parentheses what if I want to
add more different outcomes well what I
can do is I can add a else if statement
by saying else space if parentheses
curly brackets just like before and then
you can see we have something that is
very identical to the if statement
except we just have an else and
one of the if word inside the statement
here so what I can do isn't just go
ahead and add another condition inside
the parentheses so I can say just had a
phone call from a salesman so inside the
else if statement we could for example
say they we want to write a condition
that's called is x greater than for
example fifty then go ahead and run
whatever's inside the else if statement
so we can go and copy one of the
constant locks and just paste it in and
change the two L's
if so one thing that's important about
this specific condition checking here is
that when you put this inside the
browser and the browser loads the code
is going to start at the top meaning
that it's going to check the if
statement first and if the if statement
is true then it's going to ignore
everything else below it because it has
already met one condition that is true
now if it were to be false and it's
going to continue to the next one then
again if this one is going to be true
then it's going to ignore whatever is
below the specific condition and just go
ahead and run that specific condition
inside the browser so the order that you
put these condition in are going to be
important depending on the application
that you're building okay now the last
thing I'm going to mention here is the
fact that we can in fact add many of
these behind each other if you want to
so if I want to have more conditions in
between these statements here I'm just
going to copy to else if statement and
paste it in one more time and I can do
that as many times as I want know to get
as many conditions as I want inside this
specific block of conditions here
another thing that's also important to
mention is the fact that right now you
can see that I did actually put the else
if statement and the else statement
right after the last code of the bracket
from the previous statement we can also
if you want to put it like this inside
our code and it's not going to break
anything
but because this works sort of as a unit
that is taking for these conditions and
they're sort of belonging to each other
it is a habit inside JavaScript that we
put them like this after each other
inside the code just to give you a tip
on proper coding habits here so in this
last example when untains a bunch of
things inside the code just to make it a
bit more exciting so as you can see we
have two new variables
one called tender and one called age and
the gender is equal to a string not a
number and this is just to show that we
can use any kind of data type inside our
conditions we don't just need to use
numbers because it used all numbers in
the last example here so what I did is I
created a piece of code that when I
hadn't checked if the gender is equal to
male or female and how old the person is
when they enter the website so what we
can do is first of all it's going to
check is the gender equal to male if it
is it's going to check if the age is
greater than or equal to 18 if the
person is in fact greater than 18 or
equal to then it's going to console.log
you are a and then the name of the
gender which is male and above the age
limits else if the person is below 18 is
going to constant lock sorry dude and
it's going to do the same thing for the
women inside the website so below he is
going to check if the genders female and
then afterwards if the person is above
18 or equal to 18 and then it's going to
say again you are a female and above the
age limit oels sorry lady and you can't
answer the website or whatever you might
want to do inside the website and then I
created a last L statement because it's
just a good habit to have an else
statement in case something goes wrong
inside the condition that just write
something default inside the website so
right now it's saying can't figure out
your gender and I notice all the memes
about being many different types of
genders but in this example it is just
two genders inside the website so and so
this is just to show that we have you
know we can do all sorts of things with
these conditions here one thing I want
to point out is that did in fact create
a greater than equal to which is another
type of comparison operator which we
didn't talk about I do think in this
episode now just to mention the last few
comparison operators we have inside when
it comes to conditions I'm just going to
show them really quick we have the one
that we talked about previously which is
equal to so right now we're checking is
the eight equal to 18 and right now at
XV false with a sex each answer to 18
which means the right now it would
actually return as true but what we can
also do is we can go and check is it
equal to 18
and is it equal to the same data-type so
right now eight is in fact equal to 18
but what if I were to change it into a
strain but it's still going to be 18 but
not an integer datatype so right now age
is still going to be true
because we're just checking if the
number is the same but if I also want to
check for the datatype then I add a
third equal sign because now it's going
to check these two for data type and
number which means a right now it's
going to be false so this is how we can
do this specific thing and again if you
want to take if it's not equal to then
we just replaced the first equal sign
with an exclamation mark which we talked
about with the logical operators and
besides that we just have the you know
lesser than or equal to greater than or
equal to and so on and so on and so on
so so this is pretty much one want to
talk about when it comes to conditional
statements within Java scripts now there
was quite a lot of information in this
episode so don't worry about it if you
can't remember everything about
conditional statements we will get more
into it in later episodes when we start
using what we learned in actual projects
using Java Script so don't worry too
much about it if you can't remember
everything in this video it was quite a
long video because I decided to cram
everything into one video instead of
creating a bunch of small videos so I
hope you guys enjoyed I'll see you next
