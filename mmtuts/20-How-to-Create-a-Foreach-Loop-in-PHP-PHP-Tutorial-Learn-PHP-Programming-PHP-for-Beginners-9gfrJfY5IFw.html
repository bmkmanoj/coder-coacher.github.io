about something called it for each group
which is the last we're going to talk
about of all the loops we've been
talking about for last three episodes so
when we talk about it for each loop it's
a little bit different than the rest of
the loops we talked about because of
where each loop deals with something we
call an array now an array we haven't
really discussed yet but just to give
you guys a very brief explanation of
arrays as you guys can see I do actually
have one written out here and basically
an array is when we have a bunch of data
which has been combined into one
something like an variable like we have
here so right now I do actually have a
variable which I called array which is
equal to an actual array which has
different data inside of it so usually
we just have array equal to one string
or something or like a number in this
case we do actually have multiple
numbers inside one but a variable so so
now that we have the array in here we
can actually start talking about the for
each loop now I'm just going to give you
guys an example here underneath where
I'm going to create a for each loop by
writing for each space parentheses curly
brackets now for each loop basically
says inside the parentheses that we need
to refer to an array which we're going
to loop through as we actually you know
loop through this thing in here this a
function called it for each and what
we're basically going to do is every
time we mention another variable which
we create inside our loop it's going to
spit out a piece of data from this array
which we created up here that we're
going to refer to so inside the
parentheses I'm going to go ahead and
write the name of my array or the array
we're gonna use in this example called
array I'm going to say s and then I'm
going to give it a name of another
variable which is going to use inside
the loop and we haven't created this one
yet but we're going to do it once we get
inside to loop itself so I'm going to go
ahead and create a variable called we
can just call it loop data and inside
the loop itself we can now start writing
something so what I'm going to do here
is I'm actually going to go ahead and
since we have names up here inside the
loop I'm going to say echo string
an inside here I'm going to say my name
is space afterwards I'm going to go
ahead and say dot variable and then I'm
going to refer to the variable we
created up here called loop data because
each time we use loop data it's going to
go through this array and loop out the
information so if I do actually go ahead
and write this like so and go down to
the next line actually we don't need to
go down to the next time we can just go
ahead and add a break after here because
we do want to have a break in between
what we're writing here so we have
everything listed underneath each other
so if I do actually save this refresh
the browser you guys will notice we get
my name is Daniel my name is Jane my
name is Jacob and a really cool thing
about for each loops is that we don't
have to you know increase some kind of
number each time in order not to create
the infinite loops that you might be
able to create into other examples so in
here it's automatically going to start
looping as soon as the array doesn't
have any more you know variables like
data inside of it so we can actually go
ahead and you know just include another
couple once in here just going to paste
them some more who can say John and Mary
Ann Mary Ann air you can say Mary Ann
and as you guys can see it just
continues looping out the rest of the
names so this is how a for each loop
actually works and there's not really a
lot more to it now we talked about a lot
of different kinds of loops now and you
guys might not be able to see the
purpose of each one of them like in a
real life example but at some point we
will be using these loops individually
for some kind of experiment or you know
a little workshop we're going to do at
some point so for now we talked about
the loops and we can actually start
getting started on talking about some a
couple of other things that we need to
know before we talk about databases but
soon we can actually start getting into
databases because in order to create
something like a you know like a locking
system or a sign-up system on a website
we do actually need to know just a
little bit about databases so soon we
can actually start creating some really
cool stuff inside a website so if you
guys enjoyed this episode and I'll see
you guys next time
