answer a question that I get quite often
inside my JavaScript series inside this
YouTube channel now the question is
regarding document.write because for the
past many episodes up in using
document.write in order to give you guys
some examples of how to do JavaScript
now i'm one of the first episodes i gave
you guys four examples of how you could
actually write stuff inside the browser
but it seems that a lot of people get
hung up on the method document right
because I used it quite often inside my
series here and use the node to actually
create stuff inside their website so
basically the question that I want to
answer in this episode is when should
you use document right now right now I'm
using document right inside a function
called test1 and when it comes to
creating content inside your website for
example using a function like this so
basically when I click this div up here
that has an on click event as test1
which is this function down here it
should create some text called Freda
inside my website now when I use talk on
write known to do this document write is
a function that we use in order to test
stuff mainly when it comes to JavaScript
which means that right now for were to
click under step up here all the content
from my website is going to disappear
and the only thing we're gonna see is
fleeta
to show you guys an example here this is
what we have inside the code where we
have the box you know this is the
website content and when I click this
text down here
I insert frida but as you guys can see
all the text and all the boxes and stuff
gets deleted and that's because
document.write is mainly used to test
stuff when you use it inside functions
like this now we talked about another
method called inner HTML which is
actually the one that you guys should be
using if you want to insert text or div
elements or you know any kind of HTML
elements inside your website using an
on-click event or something else so in
order to show you guys the difference
between using document right and inner
HTML I'm gonna go ahead and comment out
the test one function here and instead
uncomment the other function I created
underneath here called test2 and
basically what this one does is that it
goes in and gets our
i D called test which is inside out give
up here that has the content of our
website and basically it inserts the
text reader inside this dip box instead
of document writing it we're actually
putting it inside an HTML element now
what the difference here does if I go
ahead and hint on click event to test to
is if I go ahead and refresh my browser
and I click the text down here it
inserts Frieda inside this HTML element
and replaces the content inside of here
so the basic idea here is that you
should not be using document right when
you do actually want to create an actual
website we've been using it so far just
to test and I just want to make that
clear because I've seen some people ask
me in the questions you know regarding
document right because it deletes stuff
on a website so if you want to do stuff
where you insert text or insert HTML
elements inside your website you should
be using inner HTML instead so I just
want to clarify that in this short
episode hope you guys enjoyed now see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
