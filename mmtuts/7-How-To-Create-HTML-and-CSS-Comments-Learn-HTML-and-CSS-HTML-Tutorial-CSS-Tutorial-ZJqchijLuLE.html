comments inside of HTML and CSS and the
reason what to do this is because
sometimes if were to create a lot of
code inside your website it can be kind
of tough to know what is what inside the
code if you do not create small comments
for yourself so you can actually see
what the specific code does so let's
actually go ahead and take a look at our
front page here which is our HTML file
and inside the body tags you guys can
see that I have an h2 tag and I have a
paragraph tag now what I can do if I
want to create a comment inside HTML is
that I can go ahead and go until by h2
tag and I can say less then exclamation
mark - - and now you guys can see
everything after the comment tag here
turned gray and that's because right now
all of this down here after the comment
tag is a comment so what I can do is I
can actually go out and say we want to
create a comment that says this is the
main content and then I can close off
the comment tag by saying gasps -
greater than so right now as you guys
can see we just closed off the comment
tag and right now the only comment is
going to be the text in between the tags
so now we talked about how to create a
comment inside HTML but what about
inside CSS so four words are going to
set my style sheet which is up here you
guys consider to have a bunch of code
inside the file here which is because in
the previous episode we talked about
something called a reset style sheet so
a bunch of this code here is actually
not my code it's actually some code that
we need to have before we start up a
website so I want to tell by commenting
where my code starts inside this file
here so at the top here we do actually
have the reset styling so were to scroll
down to where my code starts which is
right about here then I can go
afterwards here and say that I want to
create a comment by saying forward slash
and then the star symbol or the
multiplication symbol then I can go
ahead and say my code just to kind of
illustrate this is my code then I can
say star symbol forward slash and now we
ended off the comment as well so this is
basic 101 - sir guys when it comes to
commenting inside HTML CSS which is in
fact really important to do when you
create big projects
if you don't create comments you can't
follow which code does what inside the
website so it's really important that
you note down what code does what so
this is basically what I wanted to show
you guys today I hope you guys enjoyed
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
