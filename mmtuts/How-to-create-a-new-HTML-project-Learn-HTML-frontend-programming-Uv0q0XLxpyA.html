talk about how to get started on a
website and like I said in the last
episode I really need in order to get
started is the text editor so the one
I'm going to be using is the one called
sublime text which you guys can see here
it has very nice and big letters I can
zoom in and out so you guys can see what
I'm writing and this is all you need to
get started now before we actually do
get started on writing code I think I
should explain to you guys what hTML is
and what CSS is because I know some of
you guys might be completely new at HTML
and CSS so I'm going to explain to you
guys why this we need to learn two
different kinds of coding languages in
order to make a website so HTML stands
for hypertext markup language and CSS
stands for cascading style sheet hTML is
what you physically see on the web site
at least if you have to put it in very
you know bold terms it is what you see
on the website when you see text images
boxes navigations you know everything
you see on a website is HTML at least if
it's a pure HTML website it is CSS is
what styles or what determines how these
elements should look like how great the
distance should be between them you know
what colors should the background be all
the styling of the website is done
through a CSS sheet when you have a
website you have multiple HTML sheets
unless you have just one big front page
you know if you have more sub pages you
have more than one HTML sheet if you
have a huge website you can have one
style sheet to control everything you
know all the different elements and how
it needs to look like on all the pages
you don't need one style sheet for each
page you can do it that way I don't
recommend doing it that way and that's
just some people recommend do different
style sheets per page I see it as a
really dumb thing to do because there's
a lot of cons of doing it that way
but later on it's going to be much
easier if you do it as one page so
that's so that's the way we're going to
do it here so once we have determined
what HTML and CSS is we can actually get
started on it so before we write any
code we do need to save the project
somewhere and it's very important and I
see this often on
people who just get started on HTML and
CSS is that they will make a folder put
all the HTML and CSS files in there and
every time they use images of videos or
whatever they put on the website they
just go ahead and link to it from the
computer somewhere now I need to make
this clear if you're using anything like
images or videos or fonts or something
like that you need to have it inside
your root folder that's what we call the
folder we have all the you know the
whole project ik project then you need
to put everything inside this folder do
not link to stuff on your computer
somewhere because once you need to
upload the stuff to a server it's going
to be a hell going through all your
different HTML sheets re linking
everything because oh well you can't
really you know upload it if it's on
your computer and not inside your
project so make sure you don't have it
inside your computer somewhere you need
to have images and videos inside your
project folder so what we're going to do
here is we're going to right click
somewhere on our computer or at least
you know create a new folder and in my
case I'm just gonna call this one root
folder so you guys can see what it is
called you guys can call whatever you
want the name of your website you know a
kinky name you can do whatever you want
you can write something in you know in
the folder name and we'll use it as a
root folder now Dubey in mine I do
actually have a root folder somewhere
I'll call this one root folder too from
a previous tutorial I did do bear in
mind that once you have a folder it's
going to look bigger than mine because
I'm using a bigger monitor so
everything's gonna look a little bit
small on my screen so just you guys bear
in mind everything is going to look more
even websites depending on your screen
resolution websites will have different
sizes so everything is going to look
just a slightly smaller on my screen so
don't freak out if it doesn't look as
big as mine so once we get started on
this we do have a root folder we can
actually start coding so I'm going to
open up our documents we're going to
create a new file by either going to
file and say new file or if you're using
sublime text you can go up double
up in the top part here okay we just
need one file so once we have one file
which is untitled if you're using
sublime text you need to actually tell
it what kind of code it is because right
now if I'm typing is going to be white
if you want color to see what kind of
code you're writing either need to save
it as a certain type of file or you can
go down in the bottom right corner and
choose what kind of code you're typing
at the moment so what we're going to do
is we're going to go ahead and hit ctrl
s or command s if you're on Mac or go to
file and save as and save it inside your
root folder so I'm just going to go
ahead and put it inside my root folder
on my desktop which should be right here
and this is very important this file
we're creating right here is going to be
an HTML file and it has to be our front
page because we're going to name it
index dot HTML you have to call it index
dot HTML if it's the front page you
cannot call it something else you cannot
call a front page HTML you can't call it
home that HTML because once you upload
it to your server it will not know which
one is your front page a server does
automatically assume that index dot HTML
is your front page save it so now we
have a HTML sheet but we don't have any
code yet and now we're going to go and
create our CSS sheet so I'm going to
double click up here to get a new
document or you can go to you know file
new file and I'm just going to go ahead
and save it straightaway into the same
root folder and now what you can do is
you can either right click and create a
new folder actually let's go and do that
create a new folder and call it CSS or
something so we know that this folder
contains CSS files inside here we're
going to go ahead and save our file as
style dot CSS now you don't have to call
it style that CSS but if you want to get
into WordPress later on or some others
of other CMS system a lot of CMS systems
like to call their style sheets for
style that CSS not style sheet CSS but
style the CSS so it's good to make it
into a habit to just call
this straight at you know straight ahead
I saved it and now we're essentially
ready so that's all we're going to talk
about in this episode in the next one
we're going to actually write something
since we have everything set up and
we're ready to go and then we'll
actually get into learning a bit of code
so hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
