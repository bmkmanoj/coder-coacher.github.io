about superglobals inside PHP and for
this episode we're going to talk about a
couple called post and get superglobals
now these two superglobals are used for
many things inside PHP and yes you will
be using these quite often when decode
PHP code now the basic idea behind post
and get superglobals is that you can
pass information into the URL and use it
on another page so to give you guys an
example
I did actually create a very basic form
down here which you guys allowed to make
by now because you do actually need to
be at least a bit capable of doing HTML
code inside our PHP lessons here so as
you guys can see my form is very basic
it has a input inside of it that has a
couple informations inside of it for
example we have a type which is hidden
we have a name which is equal to name
and have a value which is equal to value
now also have a button down here which
is basically just a submit button that
does something with this form when I
press it now inside my form tag you guys
may see that I put something in here
called a method now a method basically
tells our submit button what to do with
the information right now I set it to
get meaning that it's going to pass it
in to the URL and we can see it inside a
URL now if we were to set this one as
post it's still going to pass it into
the URL but we can't actually see the
information inside the URL so if I were
to go back to my get method and click
the button it should tell us that name
is equal to value now we could of course
write anything in here one and two I'm
just going to write name and value so we
know what they are so if we go into my
website here and do actually pay
attention to the URL up here when I do
actually hit the button because when I
press it it's going to say you know the
actual URL question mark name equal to
value so now that we have this
information you know we could basically
say that name is equal to Daniel instead
let's actually go ahead and do with that
that might make more sense so I'm going
to say name is equal to Daniel I'm going
to hit this button like so now we can
actually take this information from the
URL inside this page or in another page
if we want to and you
the information to say oh you know the
person who just typed his name in is
Daniel so this is the basic way we use
post and get methods you know using
actual forms like this you know to pass
information with them and you will be
using these quite often because if you
were to create something like you know a
login system you might want to type in
your email or username and a password
and you need to be able to you know do
this in order to actually use login
systems so to show you guys the post
method if I were to say post in here
instead like I said it's going to be
hidden so if i refresh my browser and
actually go back to the previous page
you guys can see when I hit the button
it's not going to tell us anything
inside the URL but just to show you guys
that it's still up there let's actually
go ahead and go inside my PHP tags up
here and actually echo out and of course
this code I'm about to write we're going
to talk about the next couple of
episodes for now just go ahead and
follow along on what I'm doing here you
don't access to write it out so I'm
going to go and say variable underscore
post brackets and inside the brackets
I'm going to write the name of the name
of the input so in this case its name so
if I do actually echo out the name of
the post method we just used inside the
URL you guys will see that's we get
Daniel because we're just echoing out
the name inside the URL which we can't
see right now but it's still there
because Daniel does actually exist in
here now again if I go back again and
change this one to a get method again
just to show you guys refresh let's
actually go back to the previous one
there we go if I were to actually hit
the button you can see name is equal to
Daniel and for some reason we get some
memory error mistake here ah okay yeah
we do also need to change the what do
you call it the method up here so it has
to be Dulles and underscore gets because
we're changing it back to a get now so
when i refresh we get Daniel because
name is equal
- Daniel so this is the basic way post
and get methods work and you might
actually be able to see a purpose behind
this because a lot of the PHP stuff we
do in these episodes you know we don't
really see the purpose behind it when
you learn the first time but once you do
actually get to use it you might see the
reason behind it
now DS actually some you can actually
see the reason behind hopefully so with
this lesson in mind we will actually be
ready to actually start creating some
cool stuff I hope you guys enjoyed this
episode and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
