episode on how to code PHP now before we
get into the back to a coding part or
really quickly want to talk about what
exact the PHP is and what it can use it
for inside a website so right now since
you guys already here in the red to
learn about PHP I want to mention that
it's really important that you already
know HTML and CSS if you don't know HTML
CSS it's gonna be a little bit difficult
for you to follow along on some of these
lessons so if you don't know it go ahead
and go back learn about it first and
Derman turn to a PHP lessons here now
having said this a lot of people are
also going to tell you that you need to
know JavaScript before learning PHP now
while it's true that learning JavaScript
makes it easier to understand PHP in the
beginning it also goes the other way
around if you learn PHP first and then
learn JavaScript it also becomes easier
to understand JavaScript so you don't
need to know JavaScript before getting
into PHP the minimum requirement is that
you know HTML and CSS so now that we
talked about what you need to know
before getting into PHP let's actually
talk about what PHP actually is as you
guys can see it a text arrived my screen
here the PHP stands for hypertext
preprocessor and essentially what PHP is
is what we call a back-end programming
language or what you might call a
server-side programming language so what
he can do with PHP is you can make your
website more dynamic right now if you
were to only know HTML CSS you could
create a website where you can go ahead
and click on a couple of links and read
about stuff maybe put a video in there
or some images but what if you want to
make more dynamic and make users able to
do something on your website let's say I
want to for example have a login system
where people can go and sign up you know
a user account and with that user
account when they do log in they can go
to a forum which you might also have on
your website and post something now in
order to have this you're going to need
to have a database and a database is
used for posting or D storing all these
posts and users that might be signing up
on your website so if you don't have a
database you can't save any information
on your website now in order to connect
the website to the database you're going
to need a server-side language and
a lot of them out there and the one
we're going to be focusing on is the one
called PHP now PHP is the same thing
WordPress is written in it's also the
same thing that Facebook uses and it's
an awesome tool when you get started on
you know learning server-side languages
so it's not one of the difficult ones
now what you can do with PHP like I said
is you can make your website more
dynamic you can also insert stuff into
databases you can get stuff from
databases you can you know create
cookies you can create sessions which
you use when you're to actually lock in
on a website you can do a bunch of
awesome stuff and it doesn't always have
to be something related to a database
you can also do stuff on your website
not connected to a database but you need
to have at least server access when you
do you know do something PHP which we'll
talk about the next couple of lessons
because we do X need to set up the local
server on our computer before we can use
PHP and it's really easy to do it's not
a you know it's not difficult at all so
in the next couple lessons we'll talk
about how to actually set up the local
database I just want to mention that PHP
can for some people in the beginning be
a little bit difficult to learn and the
reason it might be a little bit
difficult and the same thing goes for
yeah JavaScript JavaScript and PHP are
very different you know the concept
behind them are very different from HTML
and CSS that's because you need to think
about coding in a little bit different
way that you would with HTML CSS so
don't don't get stressed or frustrated
if you don't quite get PHP in the
beginning because everyone who started
learning PHP will in the beginning feel
like they're learning a bunch of stuff
which doesn't really make sense in the
beginning but later on a promise it's
going to make a lot of sense and just
keep following the lessons and you will
understand PHP in no time so now we
talked a bit about PHP what I can
actually do in that sort of thing
I just really quickly want to mention a
the actual process of creating a PHP
document when you have a PHP document if
I were to actually go ahead and save
this empty file I have here as something
dot PHP
we can actually go ahead and write both
HTML code JavaScript code jQuery XML you
can do a bunch of different code inside
our PHP file which is actually why a lot
of times
later on when programmers they you know
after they learn PHP they don't you
don't really see them creating HTML
files anymore they are always going to
be creating PHP files and just writing
the HTML inside the PHP files so I just
want to put it out there you shouldn't
get frustrated if you don't quite
understand the beginning everyone has it
like that in the beginning so as we do
it later on and we remove further in
these lessons you will learn you know
PHP and become familiar with it and it's
going to come as a second nature if you
do actually practice it so I hope you
guys will enjoy these lessons I don't
really have anything else to talk about
when it comes to introducing PHP I think
I did actually cover most of it so like
I said in the next couple episodes you
will actually learn how to set up the
local server and then we'll actually get
into PHP so if you guys enjoyed I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
