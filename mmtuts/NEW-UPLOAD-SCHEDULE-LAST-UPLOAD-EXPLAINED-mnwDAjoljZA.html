update just to kind of keep you guys
updated about the video uploaded
yesterday which might seem a bit
different to some of your people
since the uploaded yesterday is not
really new cost inside attitudes for the
past couple of months I have been had
some time to you know a bit of busy like
I said in a previous video and I have
some time to think about what exactly
was going on inside human troops like I
said in the previous video that is not
on my channel anymore and I decided
about a year ago to take this channel to
a more serious place meaning that I'm
going to look at my content in a more
professional way than I used to in the
past whereas almost Hoffy
meaning that a lot of the content was
not as prepared as it should have been
when I actually created it recorded and
uploaded into the channel here so I had
quite a bit of time since I have been
uploading anything to look at the
channel just to kind of see what was
inside the channel and take a look at
which you know which videos were doing
the best inside the channel and which
videos had arrows inside of it which
ones could be improved both in quality
and just in general the preparation that
I should have put into the video before
I created it as you guys can see
yesterday I uploaded a video which was a
locking system tutorial that I did back
in episode 39 back in my PSP series
quite a while ago I think about one and
a half years ago I made the the old
video but there was errors in it and a
lot of people at least at the moment
here right now have exams when it comes
to students so because people are having
exams and their use in my video in order
to get good grades I couldn't allow
myself to have a video with errors
because I said I want to do it right and
I want to have my constant be
professional so I decided to not take it
down because at least login system video
right now if I look at analytics inside
my channel is the most sort of like the
most popular video inside my channel so
I didn't want to take it down before my
new video gets some more
what do you call some more C
optimization on YouTube
and gets pushed up in the search
rankings and then by that time I'd like
to take down the old video so I'm
solving the process to redo some of the
old content which is not going to take
up all the uploads you know all the
future uploads from now on and ahead of
time but it will be something that's do
alongside with new content meaning that
right now I might be uploading a new
content on for example J curry or a TX
or something like that or JavaScript
which I'm doing right now and then I
will switch up the content and upload
some real loads of older content because
I want it to be as good as it can inside
the channel now I know this is going to
upset some of you guys because I know
some of you are looking to looking
forward to some of the new content
inside some of the courses and you've
been waiting for quite a while now since
I haven't really done anything for about
two months
other than upload three videos so before
continuing this becomes a bigger channel
than it is right now which again already
right now it's huge compared to what I
actually expected back then which is
also I didn't do it as professionally
back then when I create the content in
the first place right now the challenge
is getting really big and I want to make
sure the content is also up to standard
when it comes to what I think the
challenge should be at a professional
point of view there will be some real
clothes and I know some of you guys
might not like that it's a chance that I
have to take in order to make sure the
channel is as good as it can be I did
actually get quite a lot of positive
feedback on the video from yesterday or
two days ago I think was yesterday
uploaded again I have so much stuff
going on my daily life right now I can't
even keep track of the days I'm really
happy that some of you guys didn't
completely destroy the video with
negative feedback because I was really
scared that without this video being up
first that some of you might not
understand what was going on since I
uploaded old content now fun fact the
video that I will yesterday the login
tutorial it's actually the video that I
got 20% of all my subscribers on my
channel which is a huge thing on just
one video when I have out I'm not sure
how many videos that may be up about 200
so 20% of all my subscribers that
actually came here from login justice
system tutorial is a huge thing which is
why it's so important for me to get that
especially that video done right so I
uploaded it yesterday and got good
feedback so I hope that you guys will
bear with me when it comes to me
uploading all content updating some of
my cons and I'm actually my HTML series
is actually the oldest series and even
though hTML is sort of basic a lot of
people who are studying right now is
actually watching the HTML series more
than any other courses except for the
PSP one of course because that's one has
the most episodes in but it's the most
actually one of the most popular courses
inside my channel which are really
updated not as much in the code but just
because I was not prepared to do
anything more professional with it when
I create the content so it didn't come
as as good as I wanted to turn out that
these are competitive right now with
different eyes it didn't turn out as
good as I wanted to and again I have
different equipment that has some sound
padding which is inside my my new office
and I want to make sure the content is
actually sounds good as well I don't
know if you guys can tell but if you go
back to the old videos I have a
different energy in my in my speech I'm
more energized and I'm talking fast and
I actually look at some my HTML videos
especially the gallery video inside a
smelters and thinking Jesus Christ then
you're speaking so fast people can't
even follow you inside that video so I
want to redo some of the content that
heaven will be normal speaking voice
that people can actually follow and have
some structure in it now I also had some
time to look at the content that I
wanted to upload to my channel like what
sort of content and
of the schedule should be like because a
lot in the past at least for the past
couple of months now I have been telling
you guys about a lot of different ways I
wanted to upload such as comes out with
one video every every day during the
whole week and it's going to be Monday
it's going to be PSP and Tuesday's
JavaScript and which I couldn't follow
because of my pizza period now so that
plan sort of drops I tried a new thing
where I said I wanted to create a bunch
of the like bunch of different courses
with all the basic videos done and then
from there on once I had all the basic
videos just the next course and thinking
back on it I have a pretty solid idea
about how I want to do the channel now
since I had too much to think about it
the way I'm going to do the channel just
so you guys are aware of it is that I'm
going to plan specific days that will be
constant uploaded to the channel that is
going to be hopeful including maybe two
days a week where there's going to be
regular tutorial lessons and then one
day at the end what is going to be some
sort of project then there's going to be
a fourth day where my do some sort of
tasks that you guys could do so I'll say
we need to make a full page menu that
opens up when you do something using
jQuery which is very basic but since
it's something that I teach inside to
take your series it would be fun to see
submissions from you guys that I would
be allowed to show off inside the
channel just get some feedback and show
it off to see what different people have
been doing to sort of give some kind of
community going and see so you guys can
see more of me and I can see more of you
guys so it doesn't become this great
thing when just some question one just
some kind of voice behind a tutorial but
just says a bunch of stuff and it
becomes very unperson 'el when I do the
video I would like to do some more
interaction with you guys which is one
of the feedback that I got from the
previous video because a lot of people
said that it's really nice to see your
face and there I am and I got quite a
few comments saying that I look like
Elon Musk what makes is some I'm not his
son I think it's sort of weird because
it's no matter which the tour
or video I have on my channel there's
going to be some kind of comment saying
that so no I'm not feeling my stuff and
I dunno I'd say because why not a lot of
my tutorials it sort of became a joke on
some of the videos I'm trying to cut
down on it so I don't see it as much
again it's a thing because thing is not
my native language I'm going to say
something like it costs Minot or like
somebody says when they talk it sounds
kind of funny so when you're not
english-speaking you might say something
weird like that that's basically what I
want to say I hope you guys can bear
with me on the upload schedules I still
have sort of a busy period now I
actually have a job interview in two
days from now two days from now and
which is a teacher job so my turn it
might turn out that I have to teach you
know like front-end design to students
in like I'm not sure what kind of gray t
call them in the US but like guess high
school high school or like college I'm
not I'm not entirely sure because it's a
bit different here but at least I have a
job interview which I don't know how
many people that are might end up
getting a job which is something that
would like to have because right now
instead of having a bunch of jobs that I
have to work on the side which dresses
me out I'd like to have just one stable
job so I can focus on YouTube and get
content out so hope you guys enjoyed
this video I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
