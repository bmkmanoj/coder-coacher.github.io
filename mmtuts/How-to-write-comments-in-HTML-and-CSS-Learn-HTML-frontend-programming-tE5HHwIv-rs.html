about how to comment inside our code and
we should probably talked about this a
little bit early on so just go ahead and
talk about in this episode now when it
comes to commenting you might have
different reasons for doing so for
example maybe I wrote a piece of code in
here that I don't want to forget in the
future so it could actually come down to
code and then use it as a reference for
later or maybe you have a section that
starts somewhere for example maybe I
have the beginning of my main content
down here I could actually write a
comment saying main content and have it
inside a comment tag so doing it this
way would actually know that okay so
this is where the main section starts so
when it comes to writing the actual
comments depending on the coding
language you're writing you're gonna
have to comment in different ways so if
I'm inside a HTML file for example let's
say I want to comment up my navigation
the way to do it is to write lesser than
acceleration mark - - and as you guys
can see all my text here from the data
the comment opening tag everything after
that turns into this gray color meaning
that this is going to be a comment so of
course we don't want the rest of our
website here to be a comment so we have
to end the tag as well so after the NEB
tag I'm gonna go ahead and write - -
greater than and then you guys can see
that we do actually get everything
wrapped inside a comment so that's how
we do it inside a HTML file I'm just
gonna go ahead and erase this because we
don't want to comment out our navigation
so if we were to go inside our
stylesheet we have to do it a bit
differently if I were to comment out
using HTML comments you guys can see
that nothing happens so if I were to go
inside an a stylesheet the way to combat
out stuff is by writing backslash
multiply and then you guys can see that
we do get a comment now to close it
again you're gonna have to write x / so
just the whole thing reversed so
everything that goes in between here is
gonna be a comment so this is how we
come it out stuff inside our code and I
do actually use commenting quite a lot
when I do my code
well when it comes to the stylesheet I
do use comes a lot but I haven't really
made it a habit to use that a lot inside
my program of PHP or HTML files but it
is a really good idea to use comments so
you know exactly what starts where and
it's just to have that that's really
good to have from the beginning so if
you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys
