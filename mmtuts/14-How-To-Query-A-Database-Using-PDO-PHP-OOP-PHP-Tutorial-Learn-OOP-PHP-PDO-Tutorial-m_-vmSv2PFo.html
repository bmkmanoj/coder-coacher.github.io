connect to the database using PDO and in
this lesson you're gonna learn how to
query the database using PDO so what we
did in the previous episode was we
created a basic DP 8 class which had a
database connection inside of it using
PDO and what we're going to do today is
I'm going to create a second class
called user because inside my database I
have a users table that has two users
inside of it and what I want to do here
is I just want to select the data from
inside the database and spit it out
inside our website now inserting and
updating database works the exact same
way as selecting so we're not going to
get into all the different different
ways we can query the database you
should know that by now so what I'm
gonna do here is I'm going to go inside
my index page and I'm going to include a
second document so I'm just gonna copy
paste and the second document which is
going to be the bottom link is going to
be called user dot Inc the PHP now
according to the MVC model which we
talked about in the previous episodes we
have a user that Inc the PSP which is a
class that handles all the connections
to the database and then we have a
second class called view user that takes
care of actually showing the data to the
user inside the website now just for the
sake of this episode I'm just going to
do both of them inside the user class so
don't get confused by the fact that I'm
getting data inside the user class and
also showing the data inside the user
class ok so I'm gonna go and save this
and then I'm going to create a new
object of the user class which we
haven't created yet but we well in just
a second so I'm going to say we have an
object that is equal to new user and
then we're gonna go ahead and run
another method want to do is to create
the user class called get all users
again we haven't created these yet but
we will in just a second so what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to go
ahead and create a new document I'm
gonna go and save it inside my include
folder I'm gonna save it as user dot Inc
the PHP
then we want to open up the PHP tags so
can actually write PHP code in here and
then I want to create the user class so
I'm going to say class called user that
extends to our DPH class because we need
to actually connect to the database so
we need to extend to the database class
that has the connection in it
DB H with a Big D curly brackets and
then inside the class if we can go and
add the methods that we need to use in
order to get the users and actually show
it inside the database so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to create a public
function or public method called get all
users which is the one we refer to
inside the index page so now what we
need to do is you need to actually
connect to the database and get the data
that we want to get which in this case
is going to be the information under
users inside my database now there's two
ways we can do this the first way is if
we don't have any kind of variables that
we need to insert inside our query
meaning that if you want to select all
from users where use ID is equal to
something that the user provided inside
the website then we need to do it in a
different way than if we were to have no
variables inside the connection now I
don't have to but it's much faster to do
it this first way I'm going to show you
if you don't have any variables okay so
the first way is by creating a variable
called as TMT which stands for statement
which is going to be equal to and then
I'm going to point to this connect
method which you have inside our
database connection if you go back
inside the database class you can see we
have the method right here where we
connect to our database using PDO so I'm
going to point to that specific method
and then I want to say we have a query
method like so semicolon and inside the
query we're going to insert the the
statement that we want to EXCI query
inside the database so in this case here
I'm going to say we have a select
statement I want to select all from
users which is my user
inside the database then underneath here
we can just simply create a while loop
and inside the parameter of the while
loop I'm just simply going to create
dollar sign row which is going to be set
equal to the data we get from the Corre
inside the database so going to say
variable is TMT then we want to fetch or
run the fetch method and this is
basically all we need to do so inside
the while loop I can just simply echo or
return some kind of data so if we were
to say something like variable UID which
is the username it's going to be equal
to dollar sign row brackets then inside
the brackets we can say we want to get
the UID column data so which in this
case is going to be John I'm pretty sure
then underneath it we want to actually
return the variable UID so we can
actually get it when we do actually call
on the method like so and then if I were
to go back inside my index page we need
to make sure we do actually echo out the
method called get all users I'm going to
say echo and then if we were to go
inside my website refresh you can see we
get John if what axis zoom in so you can
see it so this is how we can get data
from inside a database using PDO now if
you do actually want to run a query that
does require parameters which in most
cases if you were to create something
like a login system you will need to
have inside your query then we're going
to do it slightly different because we
need to make sure we include prepared
statements when we connect to the
database otherwise our connection is not
going to be secure so what I'm gonna do
here is I'm gonna go back inside my code
and I'm going to go back inside my user
class then I'm going to create a second
method because I just want to create a
new one with another example I'm gonna
call this on public function and I'm
gonna call this one something really
long something like get users with count
check because what I also want to show
you guys in this example here is how can
actually get how many results
from inside the database now there's a
couple of ways we can get the amount of
rows that we did actually get using our
quarry the most efficient way would
actually be to do it directly inside our
course statement you know inside
deselect all from users where blah blah
blah but in this example I'm going to
show you guys how to do this using PHP
code so the first thing I'm going to do
inside this method here is I'm going to
create the two variables which are going
to have the information that the user
would actually have submitted to this
method in order to get some kind of data
from the database such as locking in I'm
doing this because it would be much too
complicated to create an entire login
system to test this out so we're just
going to create two variables here
called first of all ID which is going to
be equal to 1 which is the first use of
inside my database and then we're going
to create a UID variable which is going
to be equal to John because that is the
name of the first user inside the
database or his username underneath here
we're going to actually create the
actual query so going to say we have a
variable called statement or is TM T
which is equal to variable dis which
points to a method that is either inside
this class or inside a class that we
extend to so we're going to run the
connect method from inside the DBH class
so going to point to connects
parentheses and then afterwards we're
not going to point to a Cora method
instead we're going to run a prepare
method that we have inside
object-oriented programming and the
prepare method is going to have the
actual query inside of it so going to
say select all from users where ID is
equal to question mark and UID is equal
to question mark and of course do you
need to wrap this inside quotes now the
question marks right after the equal
signs are going to
placeholders because we're using
prepared statements again if you guys
don't know about prepared statements I
do have a tutorial that shows how to use
prepared statements in my regular PHP
course okay so you can go back and watch
that one if you're a little bit confused
about prepared statements then
underneath iya I'm going to take the
data that we have up here called one and
John and insert them instead of the
placeholders inside the query here and
again you should recognize this if
you're familiar with prepare statements
so I'm going to say we have our
statements that we have up here and I'm
going to run a execute method and inside
the parentheses I'm going to say
brackets and then insert the data that
we have up here so I'm going to say we
have an ID comma and then a UID and
paste it in and what you're going to
notice is that prepared statements
inside PDO is a lot easier than using it
with MySQL I which is a good thing
because we don't want to write too much
code when we create applications now the
next thing I want to show us how we can
actually get the number of returned rows
from inside a quarry so what I'm going
to do underneath here is I'm going to
create an if statement and inside the if
condition I'm going to say we have our
statements and point to a method called
row count parentheses which is going to
count how many rows who returned from
inside the query now we don't actually
need to check if it's greater than or
equal to anything because if you don't
have any rows then this is not going to
return anything which means the right
now we're actually doing a boolean which
is a true or false statement so if we
had any kind of result then it's gonna
go and run the code from inside the
curly brackets else it's gonna do
something else okay now I'm just gonna
go ahead and leave out the else and
instead we're gonna go ahead and create
our while loop just like we did on the
above method we created before so we're
gonna say wow something is true curly
brackets then return dollar sign row
brackets and then we want to return the
UID of the user
and then inside the condition of the
while loop we're going to say we have
dollar sign Rho which is equal to the
statement and point to fetch like so if
I were to go back inside my index page
and change from get all users to get
users with count check then I can
actually go inside my website refresh ah
so did actually get an error message and
it seems that I did not spell execute
correctly so we need to change that so
we'll go back inside the code inside
users and then go ahead and say execute
like so and now we have John and this is
basically how we can get all the users
from the database using prepared
statements together PDO as well as take
how many rows of data we got from the
query now that is one thing that I
accidentally skipped past which is
something that some of you may ask me
about which is the fact that inside the
first method we created that simply got
all the users from the database I only
had John output inside my browser and I
do actually inside my database have both
a user called John and another one
called Jane and we didn't get both of
them output inside the browser now the
reason for that is that inside might get
all users method I returned the user
from inside the while loop instead I
would actually need to go in the lead to
return and instead of saying Urd equal
to I would echo then replace the method
from inside the next page and then you
can see that we get both users so the
practical approach it would actually be
to return an array of data instead of
echoing out the users inside the while
loop okay so if you guys enjoyed I'll
