upload images and files into a website
and this is actually something that's
really easy to do inside PHP now when I
say upload images and files I'm talking
about all types of images and all types
of files you might have inside our
computer such as JPEGs gifs PNG s or PDF
files or text files it can be all sorts
of files and it really depends on what
you want to allow the user to upload
into the website so as you guys can see
the only thing I've done so far has been
to set up a very basic index to PHP file
the only thing I have in here is a very
basic html5 set up and what we're going
to do here is we're going to go ahead
and take this from scratch and just
create everything from the form that we
need to use in in order to actually
upload the files and then we're going to
create the script afterwards that
actually uploads the file to our website
now before we start I should also
mention that there's two ways to upload
files to a website you know images and
text documents and that sort of thing
either you can upload to a database as a
blob elements or you can upload directly
to the root folder of your website now
in this episode we're going to learn how
to upload directly to the root folder
since I think this is the better method
to use so the first thing you need to do
is inside our body tags we're going to
go and create a very basic form now the
form is going to be what we used in
order to actually select the file from
the computer that we want to upload into
the website so I'm going to create a
form I'm going to go ahead and set a
couple of parameters inside the form
tags the first thing you need to do is
to set an action inside the form tag
because we need to tell our form where
we need to go to in order to load the
script that needs to upload the files
and images to the website so the action
one asset is a file name called upload
dot PHP now this is a five we haven't
created yet but we will create in just a
second the next parameter we need to set
is a method so I'm going to go ahead and
say method equal to double quotes and
I'm going to set it as a post method and
this is something we have to do when we
want to upload images and that sort of
thing we need one more parameter and
this is one we haven't talked about
before because we haven't really needed
to to use this parameter and it's
something called Inc type and this is
something we need to have inside the
form tag in order for this to actually
pass it on to our upload
PHP file so we need to say Inc type and
we need to set it equal to something
called multi-part form data so I'm going
to say multi-part forward-slash form -
data so now we should be able to pass on
images and other types of files in to
upload the PHP now the next thing we
need to do is to set an input inside our
form tags so I'm going to say input and
we're going to set the type as a file
because we need to pass on a file and
when we do set the type as file what you
guys will notice is that when we go into
the website we're going to get this
button we can click on in order to
select the file from our computer so
this is basically what this input does
so if we go ahead and name this we can
just go ahead and call it file as well
because why not and if you go ahead and
load our website you guys can see we get
this button here I can click it and then
I can browse my computer for files so
it's pretty simple to do so if I go back
to the website we need to also make sure
you create a button so when we do
actually click something something
happens so a Save button and I'm going
to go ahead and set the type as submits
I'm going to set the name as submits
inside the button we're just going to
write something like upload image or
upload file doesn't really matter let's
actually go ahead and say upload because
I don't want to confuse you guys because
it is all types of files its images and
text documents we can upload or PDF
files so what do we want to do so we're
just going to say upload so now that we
have this this is all we need to have in
order to get started on uploading stuff
to our website now what I want to show
you guys first is the right now inside
my root folder as you guys can see I
only have this document called index to
PHP now when we upload a file we will
need to tell our PHP scripts where we
need to upload the file to so before we
create that upload the PHP file I would
like to create another folder inside my
root folder which I call uploads just so
we have a folder we can upload stuff
into so now that we have this we can
actually go ahead and go into our text
editor and create a new file now inside
this file
just going to go and save it first I'm
going to call it upload dot PHP and just
save it directly inside my root folder
so now that we have this we can actually
go ahead and start writing the code that
will fit the image or text file from our
form and then upload it now when we do
this we can set a bunch of parameters
that needs to check in order for this
file to get uploaded and it really
depends on you guys how many you want to
set
it's basically error handlers which
means that we can set a limit for the
file size we can tell we can tell the
script which type of document you want
to allow for the user to upload you can
do a bunch of stuff in here and we're
just going to go ahead and go through
all of them in order to you know just
give you guys a bunch to choose from
inside the applet the PHP file the first
thing we're going to do so we're going
to go out and tell every want to start
writing PHP code so we need to create
the PHP tags and then inside the PHP tag
the first thing we're going to do is
create an if statement because we need
to check if we did actually click the
button inside our form in order to
submit the image so we're going to say
is set parentheses then we're going to
write a super global called dollar sign
underscore post because we use the post
method inside our form we're going to
say brackets and say that the name we're
checking for inside the post method is
submits because we used submit as the
name inside our button so if we click
the button then it needs to run the code
in here and this is where we want to
start uploading the file now the first
thing we need to do in order to upload
the file is we need to get the
information of the file so the first
thing we're going to do is create a
variable we're going to call a file set
it equal to a super global called dollar
sign underscore files and files is
actually a new super global we haven't
talked about before which basically gets
all the information from the file that
we want to upload using an input from a
form so we're going to say we have
dollar sign underscore files brackets
and then the name of the file at this
now case is file because inside our
index page we did actually name the file
file so now that we have this we need to
extract all information from this file
such as the name the size of the file
and what kind of file type it is so
underneath here we're going to create
another variable
we're going to call a file name we're
going to set it equal to the super
global call files again that has the
name of file and then we need to tell
which information from this file we want
to extract and the first one here we
want to get the full name of the file so
I'm going to say brackets again then I'm
going to say single quotes name now if
you're asking about why we need to write
name in order to get the name of the
file if I were to print our this file we
have up here by saying print underscore
our dollar sign file and then run it
inside the website you guys can see as
soon as I select some kind of file
inside my computer upload it we get an
array so we get name which is equal to
after effects and this is a associative
array which we talked about two episodes
ago so if you guys are confused about
the names here you can go and watch the
episode first now we get name which is
equal to the name of the file we have
type which is equal to a txt file type
that we have inside PHP called image
slash something we also get a temporary
name which is equal to what we have here
which is actually the temporary location
of the file because right now we haven't
uploaded the file yet so it's saved
somewhere temporarily on our computer
before we actually upload it then we
also get an error that checks if we did
actually get an error uploading this
file right now it says 0 which means we
didn't get an error if it says 1 then we
got an error we also get the size of the
file here so we get a bunch of
information and this is the information
need to insert into our variables so the
first thing we're getting is the name so
if I go back here and just kind of
delete Pindar as you guys can see we now
got the name let's actually go ahead and
copy this paste it underneath there a
couple of times because we do need to
have about five I think it was and then
we're going to change the names so
instead of file name we're going to save
file TMP name
which we then also going to change over
here instead of name we're going to say
TMP underscore name which is like I said
the temporal location of the file which
is actually pretty important when we do
actually need to upload the file the
next thing we need to add here is the
size of the file so we're going to say
size and again we're going to change it
from name to size inside the brackets
the next thing we need to add is the
error if we do actually get an error
then it needs to stop uploading the file
sometimes the error here's the name
inside our practice as well and then the
last thing we need to check here is the
type of file we get so we say type then
we change it to type inside the brackets
so now we get all the information we can
get from this file we uploaded here so
now that we have all the information of
the file the next thing we can do is we
can tell it which files we want to allow
to upload into our website because let's
say I want to upload a profile image to
my website and I want only to have JPEGs
inside the website then I can tell that
I want to allow JPEGs underneath here so
that's the first thing we're going to do
so now we're going to go ahead and
create a variable we're going to call
the file ext4 extension set it equal to
a function called explode inside PHP
because right now we want to take apart
the name we have up here because right
now as you guys can see the name is
equal to the name of the file dot jpg so
what we want to do is we do actually
want to explode the name by the
punctuation and get these two different
names here so inside my code again
inside the explode tags we're going to
tell it that we want to explode you know
take apart this certain string from the
punctuation and then the second
parameter is going to be the actual
thing we want to separate wherever there
is a punctuation mark and want to do
that with the file name so we're going
to take the file name and insert it
inside or explode so now we do actually
get two pieces of data we get the first
part which is the name of the file and
then the second part which is the
extension underneath here we're going to
go ahead and set another variable we're
going to say file actual
Extension we're going to set it equal to
another PHP function called string to
lowercase and that's because right now
if I were to upload a file that might
have big letters after the punctuation
so instead of jpg in small letters it
could actually be jpg as capitalized
letters so we want to make sure that
every time we want to check for these
sort of things we always make it
lowercase before we start checking it so
we're going to say STR Co Lowi ER
parentheses and then inside the string
to lowercase we want to get the actual
thing they want to make into lowercase
so what we want to get is we want to get
the second data we got from the explode
up here because we don't want to get the
file name we want to get the extension
which is the second piece of data so
inside the string to lower we're going
to say ends parentheses which is also a
PHP function it gets the last piece of
data from an array which we do actually
get when we explode something we get an
array from it which in this case is
going to be our extension so we're going
to go ahead and say dollar sign file
extension so now we basically have the
extension from the file we just uploaded
now the next thing we need to do is to
tell it which files you want to upload
or allow for people to upload inside our
website so underneath here we're going
to create an array which has the
information inside of it of the files
extensions we want to allow inside the
website so we're going to say dollar
sign allowed set it equal to an array
parentheses now inside this array we're
going to tell it which type of files we
want to allow inside the website so the
first data I'm going to write in here is
a JPEG jpg now the second file I want to
allow is jpg because we do actually have
more than one type of extension when it
comes to JPEGs the third file I want to
allow in here is going to be a PNG image
like so so now basically just listed all
the different file types I want to allow
that's actually going to allow PDFs as
well just for this example here like so
now the next thing I want to do here is
now check if the file is actually
allowed to get uploaded inside the
website if it has the proper extensions
so underneath here we're going to go
ahead and write another if statement
inside our current if statement that we
have going on in here now this if
statement is going to go ahead and check
if any of these extensions we listed up
here is inside the variable we created
called file actual extension so if the
jpg is inside this variable up here then
it is allowed because it's inside this
array down here so inside the if
statement what we're going to write here
is we're going to write in underscore
array and inside this one we're going to
say parentheses and then inside the
parentheses we first of all need to tell
it what the variable is that has the
thing we want to check for so we're
going to say we have dollar sign file
actual extension then the second
parameter is going to be the array that
we want to check if this string actually
exists inside of it so we're going to
say aloud now if this is actually true
if this extension is inside the array
then we want to run this if statement
here now if we do not have this
extension inside the array then we want
to give an error message so we're going
to say else curly brackets then we can
echo you cannot upload files of this
type so now the person will actually get
a message if he does actually upload a
file that we don't allow inside the
website now inside the if statement the
next thing we need to check for if there
was any kind of errors when we uploaded
the file because we did actually check
if we had an error inside the file
information and if there was no errors
then it's just going to go ahead and
pass on with the next piece of code so
I'm going to write an if statement
inside our if statements we're going to
go to insert our dollar sign file error
variable and then we're going to go
ahead and set it equal equal equal to
zero and the reason we're putting it
equal to zero is because we want to
check if we had no errors uploading this
file as you guys can see inside our
array if you go down into error which is
right down here then it's equal to zero
which means that we had no errors
uploading this file right now so we're
going to go back into our file
and inside our if statements actually no
after the if statement going to create
another else statement because if there
was an error message here you want to
make sure we put an error message so I'm
going to go ahead and copy my echo down
here and then I'm going to say there was
an error uploading your file so now that
we have that we can actually go back
inside our if statements and the next
thing we can take for is the file size
so I'm going to say if and then inside
the if statement I'm going to say we
have dollar sign file size and then
we're going to go ahead and check if
it's lesser than a certain number so
right now we can actually go and say it
has to be less than 500 kilobytes for
example so I'm going to say 5 0 0 0 0 0
so now it's less than 500 kilobytes or
if you guys want 1 megabyte because some
people do actually think this is quite
tiny we can always say 1 million
kilobytes so now if the file size is
lesser than 1 million if I go back to my
browser you guys can see my file size
right now is actually not anywhere near
that big it's only 64,000 something it
will actually allow for this file to get
uploaded so now if it passes this thing
then we do actually get to the part
where we do actually upload the file but
before we do that need to write another
else statement because we want to write
an error message if there was an error
with this if statement so I'm going to
say echo your file is too big inside the
if statement then we can start uploading
the file and before we do that we need
to make sure that when we do upload the
file it gets a proper name because right
now for were to upload for example a
file called test dot JPEG to my uploads
folder and then someone else later on
uploads a image that has the exact same
name test a JPEG it will actually
overwrite the existing image inside my
uploads folder meaning that the other
user who upload an image will get his
image deleted so in order to prevent
that we're going to go and create a
unique ID which gets inserted or this
replaced
with the actual name of the five when it
was uploaded so instead of it being
named test a JPEG could actually get
named something like you know a bunch of
numbers dot jpg so what we're going to
do is we're going to go ahead and say we
have a new variable which is going to be
equal to the new name of the file so
we're going to save file name new we're
going to set it equal to a function
called unique ID so we're going to say
unique Q I D parentheses now inside this
function here we're going to go ahead
and create single quotes comma true
which creates a unique ID based on the
microseconds that were actually in right
now in current time format so we don't
just get a random number we actually get
a time format in microseconds which
becomes unique number that doesn't get
replaced at one point so we don't
actually get a chance of this random
number being the same as something we've
already uploaded so after we have this
we're going to go ahead and say we want
to add the extension of our file up here
so if it was a jpg file you upload it
we want to add the JPEG file type behind
our unique name because this is the new
file name if we don't actually put the
extension behind it then our file with
just because something without any kind
of extension which means that it's not
an image anymore so after we have our
parentheses we're going to go ahead and
insert the extension so we're going to
say punctuation we're going to say
double quotes because we want to add an
actual punctuation behind the name then
after double quotes we're going to go
ahead and say punctuation and then we're
going to go and copy the name of our new
file extension which is up here which is
the lowercase version called file actual
extension and put it behind our unique
ID we have down here like so if i zoom
out you guys can see we get one line of
code so now that we have the new
filename we need to tell it where we
want to upload this file to inside our
root folder so we're going to go ahead
and go down to the next line we're going
to create another variable and we're
going to call this one file destination
we're going to set it equal to the
actual destination that we want to
upload the file to which in our case if
we had to write a path inside our root
folder it's inside an upload folder
forward slash and then the name of the
file we want
upload which in our case is the new
filename we created up here so we're
going to go and copy the variable
filename new and insert it after uploads
here so we're going to make sure we
actually do this correctly because you
have a string and you want to insert the
filename new after the string like so so
if i zoom out you guys can see it looks
like this so now that we have this we
just need to do one more thing before
the file will actually get uploaded
which is to create the actual function
which moves the file from the temporary
location that we have up here into the
actual location that we wanted to become
uploaded to which we have right here so
on the next line we're going to go ahead
and create the function which actually
uploads the file which is called move on
the score uploaded file parentheses and
inside the parentheses we need to tell
it what a temporary location of the file
is and where the new location is so
right now if you go back up to the top
where we have the temporary file
location which is right here go back
down paste it in as the first parameter
comma and then tell it in the second
parameter where we want to upload it to
which is to file this nation right now
we just told it to upload the file so
what we can do now is we can actually
echo out a success message so if you
want to actually let's actually go ahead
and bring us back to the front page
index to PHP after we're done so I'm
going to say header double quotes
location colon and then we're going to
say index dot PHP and then just to make
sure we have actually uploaded the file
let's actually go ahead and add
something behind a URL so we can
actually see we uploaded the file so I'm
going to say question mark
upload success just so you have
something like so save it and now what
we can do is actually test if this is
working so if I were to go back to my
website refresh you guys can see once I
do actually click choose file select
some kind of image and click upload we
get upload success inside our URL up
here if I go into my root folder what
you guys will notice if I go inside my
clothes folder is that we have an image
in here which right now has the
following name I'm just going to copy so
you guys can see it this name right here
which is the unique ID we gave the name
when we did actually put inside in
milliseconds and then we added the
extension behind it so this is the new
name of the file now of course if you
want to upload profile images and have
them appear for the right user inside a
website you know when we're talking just
profile images we can't name it like
this like we just did here but in a
future episode I will talk about how to
do profile images using this method here
so we can actually get the right images
from a website when a user for example
gets locked in but this is how we
actually upload stuff inside our website
and I hope this wasn't too confusing for
you guys because it can get quite
missing when you have all these
different arrays of information inside
files so we want to do stuff with when
we do actually upload the file so hope
you guys enjoyed this episode and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
