I'm gonna show you how to avoid out of
sync footage using bandicam and there's
gonna be a quite short video because it
just needs to show this one thing inside
bandicam okay now if you get out of sync
for this bandicam what you need to do is
you need to go down to video settings
inside video settings there's a couple
of things you can do one thing it seems
to codec another thing is to set a
constant frame rate meaning that if you
record something and you loose a couple
of frames inside the recording then it's
gonna keep the frame rate constant
throughout the whole recording which
means that it's not gonna make it out of
sync and this is the one thing that
really fixes to outer sync issue now the
thing I'm talking about is that if you
were to choose any kind of codec I know
that there's something called external
codecs and you can actually choose
larger with lossless codec which is the
best one you can actually have if you
want good quality but because I don't
have a lot of space on my computer
that's not the one I'm using so using
one of the default codecs and no matter
the codec that you choose if you were to
go up to the frame rate go next to it
here with three dots click the button
then it can change it from the variable
framerate to constant framerate the
default one is going to be variable now
what this means is that if you were to
record a video and then you lose a
couple of frames then it's just gonna go
and ignore it and it's not gonna do
anything about it to make sure that your
video is constant with the framerate so
if you were to choose the constant
framerate then suddenly you're not gonna
have any auto sync issues anymore okay
now if you still have Auto sync issues
after you have done this using bandicam
then it is probably your audio recording
from an external software because this
should in fact fix the outer sync video
using bandicam so we enjoyed this video
and I'll see you guys next time
I'd like to say thank you to all the
people supporting me on patreon events
the next benefits such as lesson
materials then go ahead miss it the link
to do see on screen here and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
