about something called a HTML symbol
which is something that we're going to
talk about because sometimes when we
have a piece of text inside our code you
might want to type some kind of special
character or a special symbol and once
you refresh the browser it doesn't
actually show it so there's a way to get
around this and we're going to use
something called a HTML symbol so if I
were to open up my browser here you guys
can see we have our h2 element down here
now to give you guys an example of what
I mean if I were to go into my code and
add extra spaces in between N and intro
like so save it you might think that
we're going to get some extra spaces but
we don't actually get any space other
than just that one space it recognizes
so how do we get more spaces for example
well if we go in and look at w3schools
comm which is again an amazing site for
looking up this kind of stuff you can
see that we have something called
symbols now symbols are essentially
something you call entities you can type
into the code and then the browser will
interpret that as that specific
character you're trying to type so if I
were to go into my code and instead of
adding all these spaces here if I want
to add spaces what I can do instead is
add something called a entity so if I
type ampersand and be SP semicolon you
can see we get some purple text which
means that my coding software actually
recognizes it as code so if we were to
copy/paste this many times next to each
other instead of adding spaces if i
refresh my browser you'll notice that
we'll get some more space like so now of
course there's a lot of different
symbols and this site might not have all
of them I'm pretty sure it doesn't have
all of them because there's quite a few
so we can try it we can try and take
some examples see if I want to add a
copyright symbol you can actually see we
have one down here and the entity for it
is ampersand copy semicolon so if I copy
this into my code instead of all these
spaces and save it refresh my browser
you'll notice that now we get a
copyright symbol
so this is what we talk about when we
talk about symbols and like I said
there's a lot of material online where
you can just go and try to Google for
HTML symbols you're gonna get a huge
list of all these symbols well maybe you
know the name of the symbol you can just
kind of google html5 symbol well just
HTML symbol not html5 symbol and then
type the name of the symbol you want and
then it shows it too so this is what
we're talking about when we talk about
symbols and this is pretty important
because a lot of times you do want to
add extra spaces or something else which
you can't actually just type into the
code so if you guys enjoyed this episode
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
