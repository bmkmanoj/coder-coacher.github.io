cut out footage inside the timeline and
if you go ahead and bring out the second
clip that I input in the previous
episode you'll notice that we get quite
a bit more footage down in our timeline
you can have to go and play this and you
guys can see we now have 1 minute and 20
something seconds going on right now now
what we can do is we can actually go
ahead and cut this down in case they
don't want everything to appear inside
this timeline so if they have to scroll
down to perhaps then here let's say I
don't want the last part of it there's a
couple of ways we can size down or you
know cut away the back part of the clip
we can actually go ahead and just drag
it down to where we want it to be we can
also go ahead and use the cut tool or
eraser tool which is over here in the
side in our tool bar I can cut where I
want to cut the footage and just simply
click on the last part and delete it by
clicking delete on my keyboard another
way we can do this which is actually my
preferred way is that we can use this
one up here called mark in you can also
just click on your keyboard which is
faster and then you can mark out by
clicking oh so we can actually go ahead
and see if I do actually go down here
and I click mark in it then highlights
part of the timeline if I go back and
say okay I want to cut away the back
part so I have to mark out after I want
the footage to end and then I can go
ahead and say extract which is over here
now the cool thing about extracting is
that let's say I want to cut out a
middle piece I can actually go ahead and
say well I wanted to cut this part out
so I can mark in and then I'm gonna go
ahead and go ahead just a few more
seconds say mark out and then we can
execute either lift or we can extract if
I extract as you guys can see it cuts
away the part that I highlighted and
then moves in the footage if I say lift
you guys can see it simply lifts out the
footage but leaving the space in here
blank now one way you can actually move
the footage in is either you can drag it
in so it actually matches up or we can
go ahead and simply click on the
spacing as you guys can see it not
highlights and then I can click delete
so that's essentially how we can cut our
footage to make it fit whatever editing
needs we might have so if you want to
edit or you know to simply resize the
footage you can go ahead and do that in
a very simple way and premiere is pretty
awesome when it comes to actually
editing the timeline so I hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
