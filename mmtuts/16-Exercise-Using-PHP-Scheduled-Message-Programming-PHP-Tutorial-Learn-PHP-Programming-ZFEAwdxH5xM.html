using PHP code and I thought for this
episode we would try to build some text
inside the browser which tells us what
day of the week it is and if it's a work
day or weekend now I know that that
might not seem very complicated and it
really isn't but we will actually be
talking about how to write HTML code
inside PHP code which is something that
you're going to be using a lot in the
future meaning that this episode will
actually be quite worth a lot to you if
you don't know how to do this yet so
we're just going to jump straight into
it here as you guys can see I do
actually have my index file here I have
a basic you know startup HTML code which
simply says that we you know we're going
to write an HTML 5 front page and we're
just going to go ahead and start writing
stuff into the body here now inside the
body we're going to go and open up our
PHP code with PHP tags and in between
here we're going to go ahead and create
a variable now you guys can call
whatever you want I'm going to go ahead
and call this one day of week and I'm
going to go ahead and set it equal to a
function called date now date is a
function that's inside PHP already we
didn't actually create this it's already
existing and there's a lot of different
parameters you can put inside the date
parentheses and I do x have a link for
you guys to actually take a look at
which is inside w3schools com this
website by the way is really awesome for
looking up stuff so I can really
recommend you guys to go in here if you
don't know how to do something and learn
about it so in here we do actually have
a description of all the different
parameters being put inside you know
this function which will actually tell
us specific information about the date
we have today so right now we can
actually go in and see one called W
lowercase W I should mention because
there's a difference if you use
lowercase letters or uppercase letters
now the lowercase W will actually tell
us a numeric representation of the day 0
being Sunday and then 6 being Saturday
meaning that one is going to be Monday
then it's going to count up till 6:00
and then say 0
which is Sunday so if we use W inside
our date function and it does I set the
very top of this page I will include a
link to this page if you guys want to
look at it inside the description of the
video so don't worry about having to
googling for this but we're just going
to go ahead and say okay we want to use
2w you know parameter inside our
function so we're going to go into our
code and inside the date we're going to
include double quotes or single quotes
depending on what you want to use and in
here we're going to say W now if we go
ahead and just echo this out just to see
what we actually get from this I'm going
to echo out day of week refresh my
browser you guys from notice we get five
now right here where I'm sitting at this
very moment as I'm creating this
tutorial it's actually Friday which is
five because Saturday is six and then
Sunday is going to be zero and the month
is going to be one again so because it
says five we know that it's Saturday no
sorry
Friday I'm mixing up the dates now but
it's Friday today which is equal to five
so we can X go back into our code and we
can actually start writing a switch now
I'm going to go ahead and write a switch
here and you guys should know how to do
that by now so I'm not going to explain
too much about it other than we're just
going to start it up here now the data
that we're looking for you know that
we're actually checking for is going to
be inside the parentheses which is you
know the variable we created called day
of week inside the switch we're going to
go ahead and start creating creating our
cases so case number one it's going to
going to be okay so if day a week is
equal to one then do this so I'm going
to go and say okay if it's equal to one
we want to echo that it is Monday
because it is if it's one but it's not
today
so we do actually need to create another
case I'm just going to include my break
here really quickly so we're just going
to go and copy this case underneath here
whoops let's actually go ahead and do
that properly there we go so like so
like so let's see I'm gonna do have so
far we do actually need seven because
there's seven days in a week so we have
one two three four five six seven and
now we just need to change the numbers
remember when we get to Sunday we need
to change it to a cero so we're just
going to say 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 0 so I'm
just going to go and change the text in
here as well so we're going to say
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
Saturday and of course some day so now
if we actually go ahead and save this we
can actually go ahead and go back to a
browser refresh and you guys will say it
says it is Friday which it may or may
not be it in your case but at least for
me it is Friday so now we have two texts
going on but what if you want to include
some styling - this will include some
you know HTML tags to it now in order to
do that well first of all let's actually
go ahead and create some styling I do
exit from styling in here inside my
stylesheet and if you guys don't have a
style sheet yet I did actually include
one into my document here so you guys
should just go ahead and create some
styling inside a style sheet and you
guys can copy or just write your own
styling depending what you want to do I
simply start a paragraph tag in here and
we're just simply you know aligned it to
the center font size is a lot I change
the font family to Arial and I set a
margin to the top 30 8v8 which is view
height now going back to our code inside
our index file we can actually go down
to for example our Monday actually let's
actually take Friday because that's the
day we're on right now and inside the
double quotes and do bare mind every
time we want to write its ml code inside
PHP code you
have to write it inside quotes so I can
actually start writing tags in here for
example the P tag if I want to I can
also end my P tag which would should
probably do after it is Friday and we do
actually already have styling for the
paragraph in here we could also add
classes to this if you wanted to but
essentially if you want to create HTML
code inside PHP code you just need to
echo it out or print it or whatever you
want to do and make sure it's inside
parentheses so we need to treat it like
it's a string which is very easy to
remember so we just have a paragraph
here if I actually go refresh the
browser you guys will see that we
suddenly get a lot of text going on here
I can access to mount a bit where it
says it is Friday so we could actually
do a bunch of stuff here we could
actually start adding maybe a video that
covers the entire background that has
you know happy you know happy themed
stuff because that's Friday which means
that as we can soon or like really sad
videos going on the background if it's
Monday because we don't like Mondays so
this is essentially how we do this sort
of thing this is how to write HTML code
and yes you can write whatever HTML code
you write you want to write inside you
know PHP tags like this if you echo it
out so that's basically how we do that I
don't think I had anything else for this
episode so that's basically what I want
to teach you guys in this episode I'm
just gonna go ahead and end it off here
and I'll see you guys next episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
