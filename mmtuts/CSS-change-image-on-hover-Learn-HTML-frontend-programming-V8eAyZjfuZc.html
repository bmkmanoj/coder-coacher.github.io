adding a transition effect to our hover
effects inside the CSS file now I did
actually talk about a one-point adding
an image inside our new section and we
didn't actually do that yet as you guys
may notice we did actually mess around
with the background color of our news
image inside our new section and we
don't really have an image yet and I did
actually in an early episode comment out
the way to insert an image but I didn't
actually show you guys physically in
person you know how to do this so let's
go ahead and add an image and add a
transition effect to it so if I go into
my root folder you guys would like to
notice that inside my images I added two
pictures I added a cat with blue eyes
and I wanted to transition at least turn
the eyes into an orange color by adding
a second image inside my hover effect so
what we can do here is if I go into my
code and go down and let's just let's
just go ahead and comment out the
transition for now because I'd like to
add to transition at the very end to
show you guys that it works so let's
just go ahead and comment that out like
so now down in our hover effects instead
of a background color being red we're
just going to go and delete that one
because we don't need that and up in our
news image let's go ahead and delete our
background color so now we're going to
delete the comment for our background
image which is background - image colon
URL parenthesis and then we have well we
don't have the quotes you have the
single quotes in here but you could also
use double quotes and in here we need to
specify the path to our image so right
now if I want to take a look at my root
folder you guys will notice that I have
it inside a folder called image IMG so
if we were to go into my code and say
well we have a folder called IMG
backslash which means we're going inside
the folder and then I have an image in
here called
I don't actually know what I called it
let's just go ahead and look at that cat
dot jpg so I did actually mention one
episode did you use JPEGs pngs
all kinds of you know image files and
you can do that I just chose to use jpg
for this episode so we're going to go to
take our cat jpg and change it into cat
- hover the JPEG so in here we have a
image called cat dot JPEG then I'm going
to go and copy the code and paste it
below here inside my hover effects and
then I'm going to change it from caddy a
peg - cat - hover dot jpg which is the
name of my hover image so if I save it
now go into my browser refresh you guys
will notice if we don't actually get
anything why don't we do that okay so
did actually find out why we can't see
the image and I feel kind of stupid now
because this is an error that I did
actually run into earlier and wonder the
episodes and it's simply because I'm not
used to being inside as you know a
started folder inside my root folder so
do X need to tell it that were inside
our style seed so we need to go back a
folder by writing dot backslash on both
of these like so and now we need to go
inside a folder called image and I don't
know why I keep making this error but
let's just go and refresh our browser
and you guys won't notice that we get an
image so now if I hover with my cursor
on the image you guys will see it does
actually change color now like I said we
wanted to smoothly transition and I need
to talk about something which is just as
I refresh the browser you guys will
notice that there was kind of like a pop
where the image turned white and then
went back to the hover effect which is
something that happens when you go to
the to the page for the first time and
hover on the image for the first time
and it's when you switch out the
background image that this happens so
you can't actually avoid this by not
having the image like I just had it we
can actually use just one image for the
entire hover effect by having the images
put on top of each other and then simply
move their background image inside the
dip box instead now doing it this way
will prevent it from popping when we
hover on top the image but we won't be
able to add a transition to it since the
background image is slowly going to move
around inside the dip box
so the popping thing is something you're
going to have to live with doing it this
way if you want to add a transition to
it so going into my code let's just go
ahead and comment
or not coming out but remove the comment
to a transition save it
refresh our browser and you guys will
notice that the slowly turns orange once
our Burnett so this is a really nice way
to do hover effect on top of images and
it's just simply a nice way to do things
I think so this is essentially how you
enter the background image inside a dip
box even though we did actually go
through it without me really showing you
guys well we did with the logo but I
would like to show it with you guys with
the transition effect and a hover effect
and all that good stuff so I hope you
guys enjoyed this episode I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
