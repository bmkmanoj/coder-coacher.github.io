method when it comes to structuring your
layouts inside websites and this is
something that's quite me when it comes
to 2017 and it's something that's going
to fix a lot of the problems we have
with the traditional way we start to
layout inside web sites now the method
we're going to learn about is something
called CSS grids and it's something
that's going to hopefully replace the
traditional way we do layouts inside
websites now the typical way we would do
it which we still do today is that let's
say we take a website like the one I
made here in front of me as you guys can
see I have different elements inside
this website and on the top here have a
title I have a header that I have a
sidebar and the main content next to
each other and then I have a photo at
the bottom here now the way most people
set this up today is by having a HTML
file and we can actually show you guys
right here that has all the different
elements inside of it like the title the
header the main content the sidebar and
then the foot at the bottom here and the
way we need to structure it inside the
document is the exact where we want to
see it inside the browser mean that if I
want to put something next to each other
like the sidebar in the main content I
need to have it beneath each other
inside the code otherwise I can't put
these next to each other and we do that
using something called float and this is
where the problem is because let's say
that I want to make my website
responsive which today in 2017 is
something you have to do when you make
websites because this 2017 most people
use their phones or their tablets to see
websites so we need to make our websites
responsive and this is where the problem
is because let's say that I on my
computer inside the browser want my
website to look like this so I want to
have the title at the top I want to at
the header I want to decide bar I want
to have the main content and then I want
the foot at the bottom but let's say
when a person uses on a cell phone that
I want my footer to appear at the top
here next to the title maybe there's
some information in the footer that I
want to have in the top but today using
a traditional way of setting up
documents using HTML CSS it is not
possible to do this well technically we
can do it if you were to make a copy of
the folder inside of HTML file put at
the top here next
the header and then display:none when we
have it inside the desktop format and
then display:block when we have it
inside cell phone format but because we
do that we then have extra code inside
our document which is not healthy it
takes much longer for the page to load
and it just looks messy inside the code
so the way that CSS grid fixes this is
by telling the browser where we want the
elements to appear once we're inside the
different formats such as a cell phone
tablet or desktop and this means that
inside the HTML document it doesn't
matter where the HTML is compared to the
other HTML elements we have inside the
document so if I were to go back inside
my code it wouldn't matter if I put my
h1 tag here delete it put at the bottom
here right underneath the footer if I
save it go inside my browser and refresh
you guys can see it looks like saks same
way as it did before and this is
something that is incredibly cool when
it comes to CSS because today because of
the way that we built websites we need
to have some kind of new system that
allows us to put content exactly where
it needs to be without us being starved
using HTML nodes to define where we want
the elements to appear inside the
website so just to demonstrate what I
mean I can actually go ahead take this
website here and what you guys will
notice is they want to start minimizing
the screen you guys can see that the
content starts jumping around inside the
page so when I get down to the tablet
format you guys can see suddenly all the
content shift around inside the page and
the footer is not at the bottom anymore
it is at the very top up here I can also
size it down into cell phone format and
then you guys can see that all the
content can be customized inside the
browser using CSS and this is the part
of video where you guys start asking me
in the comments well we have bootstrap
now at the moment I can't speak for the
future but at least right now bootstrap
is based on the traditional way we do
layouts inside websites meaning that the
thing that bootstrap is trying to fix
for you is the exact same thing that CSS
right now can do for you without the
need of bootstrap except for bootstrap
cannot right now sift the content like I
showed you guys with the footer and put
it on top of the website when we have it
structured like this inside our HTML
page Busia
cannot do that at the moment maybe they
can future if they start incorporating
this CSS grid inside bootstrap but right
now we cannot do it unless we use CSS
grids so let's go ahead and go back and
just put the h1 tag at the top of the
page again and I'm going to serve as how
to use the CSS grid inside HTML and CSS
without the need of JavaScript because
JavaScript you used to be the way that
we would have to do this if you wanted
to footer to appear at the top instead
but now like I said we can do it only
using HTML and CSS so as you guys can
see inside my document I have a HTML
file which you guys can download inside
the description of this video as you
want to have this exact HTML file or we
can just go and copy it and put it
inside your own file the one thing I
want you guys to notice is that I have a
very basic HTML file and inside the file
here are just simply a link to a style
sheet which I'm on the side here and I
went ahead and delete everything inside
my style see it except for the reset
code that I created at the top here just
to get rid of any unnecessary margins
and padding's
and if you go back inside the HTML file
you guys will see that I have one div
wrapped around all the content inside
this page to your cold site so give it a
class called site and inside this div I
went ahead and inserted my h1 tag my
header my main my side and my photo tags
so these are HTML tags are going to have
all the content inside my front page ok
so what we do here is we use the tip
that I wrapped around the content called
site to define that this is going to be
part of a CSS grid the way we do that is
by going into our code inside the
stylesheet I'm going to say we style the
class called
site and then inside this class we're
going to say we want to display this as
a grid now inside this grid I need to
define how I want my layout to be like
and we do that using CSS by using a new
code that allow for us actually do this
called grid
- template - column colon semicolon and
then after the colon we need to decide
how many grids we want to have inside
the website going down we
basically so we're two above my website
here you guys can see I didn't actually
refresh the browser yet so you guys can
see the the old styling but the main
idea here is that right now inside the
browser we look at it you guys can see
that if we look at the columns only
right now we have two columns we have
this section here and we have this
section over here and the only reason we
have two columns is because I want the
sidebar and the main content to be next
to each other inside this format here so
what I need to do is I need to go inside
my code and say okay how large to want
my columns to be and it just so happens
that we have a new type of measurement
called fractions inside CSS which simply
says okay how much of a fraction of the
website do you want this column should
take up space so who were to say that I
want 50 50 % usually in the past you
would say 50 percent and then 50
percents
like this but right now using the new
measurements we can actually say 1 if
our space 1fr so now that I did this I
can actually go down to the next line
and define how many rows still want to
have inside this page so I can say grid
- template - rows and then inside here
just need to go back to the website or
inside the HTML file Graham when I
create the website here and say how many
rows to a want so inside my HTML file I
can see I have an h1 tag that I want to
go from left to right going to have a
header tag that I also want to go all
the way from left to right then have the
main content and decide which I want to
be in the same row meaning that this is
going to be one row and then I want the
photo to go left to right as well so
inside my CSS code I can actually say
that I want one fraction because of the
h1 tag then I want one fraction for the
header tag then I want one fraction for
the main content and the sidebar and
then I want one fraction for the footer
like so so now we create a grid inside a
website using CSS you can actually go
ahead and take the HTML elements over
here and tell the browser where we want
to put them inside the grid so I can
actually go ahead and go to the next
line here and say that we have a h1 tag
that has a classes page title and tell
the where to put it inside out grid
using CSS
so I'm going to go and say clearly
brackets now when it comes to placing
the HTML elements inside the grid we
have two different methods we can use
the first one that I want to show you
guys is the complicated one but because
it serves the concept of CSS grids a lot
better than the second method I'm going
to Sir guys this one first then
afterwards I'm going to show you guys
the easier method which you guys will
probably use in the future when you make
websites so in order to place the page
title inside out grid what we're going
to go and do here is define the column
that we want to put it inside of so I'm
going to say we have a grid gas column
and then we need to tell it which column
it should start at and which column it
should end that now when we create a
grid inside a website what we have right
now according to our code up here you
guys can see we have one frame and one
frame meaning that we have two columns
inside the browser now forward to draw
this on the piece of paper we have one
line then we have another line which is
one column and then you have a third
line to define a second column because
you have three lines inside the column
you need to tell it that we want to
start at line one and because I want the
page style to go all the way from the
left side to the right side it should go
all the way to line three because like I
said we have three lines inside two
columns and as you go from the first one
to the third one okay after what you
need to define a grid row like so and
the same way as with columns we need to
define the lines so because we have one
line then a second line which is one row
then a third line which is a second row
we need to tell that we wanted to go
from the first line to the second line
like so and now we're just going to go
to copy this and paste it underneath
each other a couple of times and then
we're going to change the second one to
masthead because that's the class of my
header over here we're going to change
the class of the third one to main -
contents like so we're going to change
the class the fourth one - sidebar and
then the last one is going to be footer
like so now inside the masthead we need
to change the grid column and the grid
row because it shouldn't be the same as
the title up here so inside the grid
column right now we want the header to
go from the left to the right side just
like the page title so we're not going
to change the column but the row is
going to change from the second line to
the third line inside the rules that we
have inside the website so we have one
line a second line which is where I want
the header to start and then have the
third line which is where I want the
header to stop so what we're going to do
now is we're going to change the main
content and say they want the grid
column to change because I want the main
content to the sidebar to be next to
each other so I want to sidebar and then
I want the main content on the right
side so we want to set the grid columns
to start at line number two inside the
columns and go to line number three then
inside the sidebar I want to start at 1
and go to 2 now we also need to change
the row so I'm going to say we start at
the third line to the fourth line and
then the same thing down with the
sidebar because they have to be in the
same row so we're going to say 3 to 4
and then the footer is going to be 4 to
5 now we don't need to change the grid
column because we also want the photo to
go all the way from left to right okay
so now I can go inside the browser and
refresh you guys can see that we have
the title at the top we have the header
then we have the sidebar with the main
content right next to it and then we
have to float it down here now with
words I actually put some colors on
these so we can I see what's actually
going on I did actually insert a couple
of divs inside my HTML file inside the
different elements so let's actually go
to Stanley's so inside my CSS file I'm
going to go to the bottom here and say
that we have a class called green which
has a background color set to 3 it has a
width set to 100% it has a height set to
1% and then we're just going to copy
this so we have all the other colors as
well which would be about 5 colors in
total so we change the second one to
read the third one is going to be blue
the fourth one is going to be purple
and the last one is going to be yellow
so now for were to go back and refresh
the browser again you guys can see that
now all the sections make sense
according to the layout we created
inside the CSS file so this was to
complicate a way of creating a layout
using the new CSS grid let's actually go
to make this a lot more simple by going
to the first one up here called the page
title which is the first element inside
a document and delete all we have here
and instead we say grips - area and then
we just define what the name is of this
area I'm going to go ahead and say this
is the index page
- title because it's the title of the
index page and now what a base if you
did is I just named this specific
elements so what I can do now is I can
copy this replace all these elements
down here and then change the name
afterwards so I can go up to my masthead
and say we have an index
- masthead I have a index - content and
then I have an index desk sidebar and
then an index desk footer so now we can
actually do is if you go back up inside
our main grid that we have up here
called class sites we can then go down
to next line and create another piece of
code called grit desk template - areas
colon semicolon and now we just define
the position of these different sections
down here inside the main grid up here
so I'm going to go and go down to the
next line say double quotes which is
going to be the first row inside the
grid and then I'm going to say we have a
index desc title and then on the second
column I want the index s title to also
be stretching all the way to the second
column so which is pasted in twice then
I'm going to go after the double quotes
then I'm going to go down to the next
line make sure you don't go after the
semicolon say double quotes and then
we're going to define the second row
inside the grid which right now is going
to be the index - masthead
I'm just going to paste it in twice
because it needs to go from the first
column to the second column then I'm
going to do the same thing here I'm just
going to go down to next line create the
third row which is going to be the
sidebar to index - sidebar and then the
content is going to be in the right side
so we're going to say index - content
then we want the footer so we go down to
the last row and say we have index
- footer and then just copy it one more
time like so if we go back inside the
website you guys are notice that looks
exactly the same way and doing it this
way it's a lot more simple than having
to try to figure out all the numbers
about well how many rows and columns to
the head inside the grid down here
inside you know shut it down inside my
CSS file so making the grid up here is a
lot more simple at least in my head it
is now you might be asking well right
now inside the website you guys can see
that all the content is going from the
left side to the right side what if I
want to have a reference at the website
well what we can do using the grid here
is I can actually say that if I want to
have white space inside anywhere of this
grid I can create it inside the CSS as
well without having to create a wrapper
so what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to go back inside my grid inside
the CSS file and say that I want to have
wide spacing in the right on the left
side of my website so I'm going to go
inside my columns inside the grid and
say that I want to have one more frame
on each side so I'm going to say one
frame and one frame so right now we have
four frames inside all four columns
inside the website and now I might be
thinking well what do we do about this
down here because right now we just said
that we have two columns inside this
layout now if we want to define a white
space inside this grid down here we can
actually go ahead and use the
punctuation space then on the right side
I'm going to do the same thing I'm going
to say space punctuation and then I'm
just going to copy this down and all the
different rows we have down here like so
so now if I go back inside the website
we refresh you guys can see that now
have white spacing now you might be
asking me well this is a lot of white
spacing we could also go back and not
one frame but instead say we want to
have 20% like so
go back inside refresh and I guys can
see we changed it or if you guys want
the rapid not be responsive because
right now would actually change the
distance here we could also go back
inside the code and say we want one
frame on the sides and in step two find
the width of the columns inside the
middle here and say we want to have 500
pixels and 500 pixels like so go back
inside the browser refresh and now you
guys can see it's actually fixed inside
the website just like a regular wrapper
okay now let's say I also want to have
some spacing in between these sections
here because right now the sections are
kind of touching each other what I can
also do in here is I can actually go and
add another piece of code inside the
echo grid that says grids
- gap colon semicolon and then I want to
set a gap to ten clicks lips now if I go
back inside the browser refresh you guys
can see we now have a gap in between the
sections so now that we learn how to
create a grid inside a website let's
actually talk about if we want to size
it down into a cell phone format and I
want the grid to actually change
accordingly what I can do is I can
actually go down to well this will
probably copy what we have up here I'm
going to go ahead and go down to the
bottom here and add a regular CSS media
query so we can say we have a hashtag
media screen space and parentheses curly
brackets and then inside the parentheses
we can actually define the width of the
browser of when it needs to change the
content so we're going to say I'm in
desk with colon should be 736 pixels and
now we're just going to go and paste in
the grid from the top here called class
site now before we continue I'd like to
talk about the one big issue that is
with CSS grids which is the right now
when it comes to browsers such as
Internet Explorer and Microsoft edge
they haven't fully incorporated the CSS
grid inside their browsers yet now
Microsoft edge
actually have this incorporated after a
couple of weeks after upload this video
hopefully but Internet Explorer is not
going to have this working inside the
browser so this leads to the question
what do we do about all the browser's
well when it comes to designing websites
a lot of experts are going to tell you
that you need to design for desktop
first and then afterwards focus on
making a responsive for cell phones now
other experts are going to tell you that
you need to focus on mobile first and
then design for desktops afterwards and
as you guys can see what I actually did
here was I included a media query that
has a minimum width as 736 pixels
meaning that whatever we put inside this
media cover here is going to be what we
see inside a desktop browser so when it
comes to my personal opinion I agree
that you should design for cell phones
first and then afterwards focus on the
browser's at least when it comes to
creating the code for the website now
this means the people who use Internet
Explorer when they see the website
they're going to see a website and cell
phone format inside the browser on the
computer and this is something that some
people think is a really big issue when
it comes to websites but then again have
you actually seen a mobile version
inside your browser inside your computer
because in a lot of cases in most cases
the mobile version of a website does
actually look a lot better than the
desktop version even if you're sitting
on a computer so one argument right now
is you were to use this right now inside
the websites is that it's not a
catastrophe people actually see this
website inside all the browser's because
it will still be viewable but just as a
sailfin format so the only thing we can
hope for is that in a few weeks from now
that Microsoft edge will actually
support CSS grids and I know this is
kind of a long stretch but Internet
Explorer hopefully should support this
in the future so not only pasted in the
code inside the media query down here
this is how we want the desktop version
to look like so I'm not going to mess
with this code in here instead I'm going
to scroll up to the top where we have
the mobile version which again we
designed for mobile first at least in
this tutorial here so inside the
template areas we can actually go and
change this according to how we wanted
to look inside a mobile version so I
could actually go and take the index
folder and move it up next to my header
which is up here now because it pasted
the photo next to the header up here we
can't have the foot on two places so we
need to remove
photo from down the bottom here in order
for the layout to work now what I'm
going to do instead of just deleting it
down here I'm just going to go ahead and
save one for sidebar to go from this row
to this row which means that the sidebar
now have extra space for the content
when it goes downwards I'm going to do
the same thing for the content and paste
it down here like so
so just remember we can't have the same
element multiple places unless we have
it going right underneath each other or
next to each other okay I'm going to go
and save it and actually I'm going to go
and remove the gap down here so I'm
going to go and delete it and then we
need to change the columns and the rows
of P because now we just made some
changes down here and we need to make
sure that it fits the templates we have
up here so I'm going to say that instead
of one frame and the side I would like
15 pixels I'm going to go and copy that
to the end here and I would like to have
one frame for the two Center columns
like so and I'm just going to keep the
template rows here because they are
pretty much like I want them to then I'm
going to save it go inside my browser
refresh and what do you guys will notice
now is that when I do actually go down
to cell phone format it changes the
layout to cell phone' and the footer is
no longer at the bottom of the page
which like I said using traditional
styling we wouldn't be able to do if you
weren't using CSS grids so even with
bootstrap you would not be able to
change the content in this matter now
there's two more things I want to teach
you guys before we end up this episode
which the first thing is that you can
actually put grids inside other grids
so right now forward to have a huge
content section down here you could
actually go ahead and insert a second
grid inside this box down here and just
change the layout inside this grid area
which is quite nice now the second thing
I want to show you guys is they're going
to put white space inside this content
so right now you guys can see it I have
to foot up here but what if I don't want
to photos would be there what I could
actually do so go inside my code and
just replace footer with punctuation and
then I'm going to go to the bottom here
and just insert the footer at the very
bottom instead so we're just going to go
ahead and say we want to have index
- footer like so and just make sure we
have the correct amount of columns so
we're going to go and say we want to
have the index footer or more and a
punctuation so go back inside the
browser
guys can see that we now have a wide
space inside our layout so we can also
do wide spaces so this was all I want to
show you guys when it comes to CSS grid
so hope you guys enjoyed this lesson
remember this is going to be something
that hopefully in the future is going to
be used by most programmers and the only
way we can get browsers to support this
is by actually using it inside of design
so right now like I said all modern
browsers do actually support CSS grids
except for edge which should get support
after a couple of weeks from now so the
only way CSS grids can become the new
standard within HTML CSS coding is if we
actually use it inside our web sites so
I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
