about how to make a menu of what you
might call navigation we're gonna talk
about where to put it I'm gonna talk
about how to actually make it so if we
take a look at our website you guys can
actually see we do have a header with a
black background and we have an image
inside of our header now what I had
imagined was that we're gonna create a
navigation which will start from the end
of the wrapper going towards the left
because that's just like a really basic
looking one and I don't want to do
something that looks really complicated
since this is I kind of see this as a
beginners tutorial series and it's
better that you guys know the basics
before we start experimenting with you
know some really fancy looking designs
for a menu and we can always make an
episode like that later if you guys want
to and then we can just sort of you know
do some really cool stuff with CSS but
for now we're just gonna create a very
basic one so inside our code the first
thing we're gonna do is we're going to
go ahead and actually remove the black
background color of our header so we're
just gonna go ahead and elite it here
from our header styling and the reason
we're doing that is because as you guys
may remember from the last episode we
did actually create a styling for every
single link on our website and we
decided to make all the colors of our
text black and if we were to put a you
know black colored text on top of a
black color background we can't actually
see what we're making so we just need to
make sure we don't have a black
background color inside our header so if
I go ahead and refresh the browser you
guys can see that right now it just
looks like we have a logo so what we're
gonna do now is we're going to go into
our index that HTML and we're gonna talk
about how to actually make the physical
navigation so you guys may notice that
we do already have a couple of navi-x
inside our header and this is where
we're gonna put our navigation now we do
actually need to go inside the nav tags
and create something called an unordered
list now I'm just gonna mention this
because I saw this in the beginning when
I studied back at you know my university
when people had to start making websites
and HTML CSS I noticed a lot of people
like to make menus by simply taking a
couple links and putting them next to
each other of course that's gonna work
but that's not the ideal way to do it so
what we're gonna make sure we do it the
right way so you guys can see how to do
it so inside our net tags we're gonna go
ahead and create this unordered list
which is essentially what you see when
for example if you have a word document
open and you make a bullet point a list
you know you're gonna have a couple of
lines going downwards with bullet points
on the left side and that's what an
unordered list is so we're gonna start
out by making one of those and you might
be a little confused now thinking you
know why do we need to make an unordered
list but we'll get to that a little bit
later in this episode so for now we're
gonna make a UL tag and we need to make
sure we open and close it inside our
unordered list we do actually need to
make a list item which is gonna be one
link inside our navigation and you do
that by creating a li tag like so and
then we can put some text in here so I'm
just gonna go ahead and put home as our
first link in our navigation and I made
it in you know capitalized letters
because that's apparently what's popular
right now and a lot of websites so we're
just gonna go ahead and do that so now
that we have our home tagged we can
actually go ahead and save this and
refresh our browser and you guys will
see we do actually have some text here
but just there's still a couple of
things wrong first of all we can't
actually click it and it won't do
anything
second of all it doesn't appear up here
where I wanted you know on the right
side the wrapper next to our logo
because it actually goes beneath our
logo so when it comes to positioning
objects I know you know on a website you
need to know that the order you put
stuff in inside the HTML sheet is the
order you're gonna see it on the website
because our logo is the first thing that
appears inside our code and then the
navigation is the second thing inside
our website the logo is going to be the
first thing and navigation is gonna be
the second thing underneath each other
so in order to put them next to each
other we need to include some styling
called float
now what float does is that it takes two
objects and looks at them okay if they
come right after each other and they
both have the float element to them
we're gonna put them next to each other
because they have to float next to each
other if you can say it that way so what
we're gonna do here is we're going to go
ahead and go into our styling
and because our navigation tags are the
ones that are right after our image we
just need to style the nav Tex so going
down at the very bottom of our styling
we're gonna go ahead and write nav space
open up the code with the curly brackets
and then we're gonna say float FL o
eighty and then we're gonna set to float
left actually no we're gonna set to
float right now because we have it set
to float right we do actually need to
tell every single item that floats next
to each other like every item on the
website that goes next to each other
have to float we can't just take the
object that has to go to the right side
and make make it float because it will
go to the right but it will not go next
to the object we want to go next to so
if I were to refresh the browser but
actually the text would not appear next
to the logo on the right side or
actually appears you know at the same
spot it is but just to the right
underneath the logo so we need to
actually also float the logo so inside
our styling we're gonna go into the
header image styling I'm gonna say float
left save it and refresh our browser and
now you'll see that the text is going
all the way to the right all the way to
the top and that's because our logo does
actually have some margin on it saying
that you know needs to have a certain
margin from the top but if we don't have
that margin that would actually be next
to each other so if I go into our
website again inside the coding and I go
down to our an HTML part so inside our
index.html we're gonna include the links
now so we're gonna go ahead and include
the anchor tags next to our text not
outside the the Li tags but inside the
Li tags I'm just going to include it
around our text so we also need to make
sure we include a path so right now when
you did to link to the front page
because that's where the home links to
so we're gonna say index dot HTML it's
gonna be the link and then we're gonna
go ahead and copy this line gonna add it
down just maybe like three more times
and then we're gonna change the text on
the second one
let's say gallery the third one is going
to be forum and the fourth one is going
to be contact and then we're going to
change the links so that the you know
the second one's called gallery that
HTML the third one is called forum that
HTML and the fourth one is going to be
contact that HTML now we don't actually
have these pages yet keep that in mind
but we will be creating them at some
point well at least some of them you
might be so if I save this and refresh
our browser you'll notice that now we
have been going underneath each other
now we can't actually see bullet points
but sometimes you will see them and then
you will actually need to remove them
inside the styling and we will make sure
to do that even though we can't see them
so you guys know exactly what to do if
they do actually appear so right now we
need to actually make it so that every
single list item you have inside the
menu go next to each other and not
underneath each other we need to include
some spacing between them and we need to
make sure they have the right font type
so if I go into the code again into our
style sheet I'm gonna go down underneath
our nav and I'm gonna start styling our
UL so we're gonna say we have a nav tag
inside our HTML inside the nav tags we
have a unordered list we have a ul I'm
gonna go ahead and make the curly
brackets and I'm just gonna keep it
empty for now so I'm just gonna go ahead
and copy this and paste it underneath
here and after ul on the second one
we're gonna include Li then we're gonna
copy paste again and put it underneath
here then after the L eye we're gonna
put the anchor tag so what we're gonna
do now is we're gonna go ahead and say
well we want our menu points to go next
to each other so inside the Li styling
which we have as the second one we're
gonna go ahead and say that we need to
display our menu in line - block meaning
that we want it to be in line with each
other going near to each other I mean
one and we want to make them into block
items meaning we can actually make
background color and make them into like
actual boxes we can click on so I'm
going to save this
and then we if we refresh the browser
you like to notice if i zoom in a little
bit that our menu items actually go next
to each other now we will include the
spacing as you guys can see we do have
some spacing but we don't have a lot of
spacing so it might seem that everything
right here is just one big line of text
so inside our coding again we're gonna
go ahead and go into our Li tags once
more say margin - left and then we're
gonna make a margin of about 20 pixels
save it
refresh the browser and we have some
spacing now what we're gonna do is we're
gonna go ahead and style the actual text
and in order to do that we need to style
the anchor tag so we're gonna go down to
the anchor tag which is you know what it
takes is inside of and we're gonna go
ahead and save fonts - family which is
the font type that you have you know
arial times new roman' that kind of
fonts and what you can do and I'm just
gonna show you guys we're gonna make
sure that it's gonna be Arial so in
order to get Arial we're just gonna go
ahead and write Arial some fonts will be
pre-installed on your computers Arial is
one of the fonts that will be installed
on every single computer you see out
there so arrow we can just go ahead and
write some fonts however if you were to
install a font from the internet
somewhere you can't put in here unless
you actually include the font into your
root folder so we're just gonna stick
with the basic font for now later we
will actually talk about how to include
funds but for now we're just gonna stick
with Arial
now just to show you guys if we have a
font that doesn't actually exist on a
computer and the person is actually
viewing our web site what you can do is
you can write comma and then we can say
Helvetica afterwards and then we'll
actually say okay if you do not have
Arial on the computer that's viewing our
website then we'll display Helvetica
instead of course these are like two
different fonts they look totally
different from each other but just to
kind of show you to show you guys that
you can actually do it this is how you
do it so I'm just gonna go and save it
as Arial underneath here we're gonna say
font size font deaths size set it to 14
pixels
underneath a we're gonna say color well
actually we don't need to do that
because we did access style our color
inside the anchor tag at the very top so
we're just gonna go ahead and keep this
for now so if I go refresh the browser
you guys can see it did actually changed
a bit and now what I want to do is I
want to take the entire menu and move
the entire thing downwards a little bit
I want it to be centered on my logo so
in all text is see when it's centered
just for now we can go up and say that
the nav should float left instead and
then if I were to refresh you guys will
see it actually goes to the left side of
the logo like I said when you put stuff
inside the HTML sheet if you put them
underneath each other in the code that
will appear underneath each other inside
the web site as well but if you float
everything left they will appear under
the left sorry on the right side of each
other all the time if that makes sense
so what we're gonna do here is we're
gonna go ahead and go inside our nabbed
well actually we're gonna go inside our
UL which we haven't started yet and say
margin - top and set it to maybe 34
pixels and see how much that is refresh
and as you guys can see we do actually
need about twice as much so we're gonna
say 64 pixels refresh and we almost have
it so we're gonna say 72 well maybe just
70 again a lot of the you know styling
has to do with a little bit of
experimenting so you get it just right
okay so did actually look like 72 what's
the way to go so I'm just gonna get go
ahead and say 72 and that looks right so
now I'm gonna go ahead and float it to
the right again so I'm gonna say float
right inside my nav styling and now we
have a navigation that's floating to the
right so if i zoom out to 100% again you
guys can see we do have some text over
here and we do have our logo so now we
can actually click them and it'll take
us two pages of course right now we
don't have these pages yet so we'll
actually say page not found but the home
button will take us to the front page so
this is how you create a navigation and
that's essentially all I need to show
you guys this episode
okay so as you guys can see it it
actually passed the video because I
realized as I was editing the video that
I forgot to show you guys how to remove
the bullet points so if you do actually
a bullet point showing next to the list
items the way to remove them is to go
inside your stylesheet go down to the
list item styling and then go down to
the next line and include a piece of
code called list - style and set it to
none and then save it and that's how you
get rid of the bullet points so now I'm
just gonna let you guys continue
finishing off this video in the next one
we're going to talk about how to
actually incorporate a different fonts
because I would like to use a different
font for the navigation before we get to
well started on this website so hope you
guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys next
