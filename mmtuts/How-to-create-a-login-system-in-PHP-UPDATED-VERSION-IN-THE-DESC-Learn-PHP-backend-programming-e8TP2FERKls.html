make a login system inside your website
completely from scratch
meaning that right now as you guys can
see the only thing I've done so far has
been to set up a front page inside my
index to PHP file now I have no
databases yet and I have no other
external files in this one so before we
actually start this episode I want to
mention what I'm expecting you guys to
know before you dive into this episode
now I do expect you guys to at least
know the basics of HTML PHP and PHP
myadmin which is going to be the
database system we're going to use for
this episode so now that we know this we
can actually go ahead and get started on
setting up the database we're going to
use in order to create our login system
so I'm going to go into PHP myadmin
and I have not created a database yet so
I'm going to go ahead and go to my
databases tab and create a database now
I'm going to go ahead and call this
database login tests because why not and
create it now inside my login test
database we need to set up a table that
we can insert our user information into
so I'm going to go ahead and make sure
my login test database is selected I'm
going to go to my SQL tab up in the top
and then we're going to go ahead and
create the table we're going to use for
this login system so I'm going to go
ahead and write create space table space
user because we're going to call this
table for user space parenthesis
semicolon and then inside the
parentheses we're going to go ahead and
set up the columns we're going to use
inside our user table now first of all
we do actually need to make sure we have
a primary key so I'm going to go ahead
and create a column called
ID now you guys can call whatever you
want I'm just calling this one ID
because why not space I'm going to
choose this as a integer datatype so I'm
going to say int parenthesis and I want
a maximum of 11 characters inside this
ID space we're going to set this one as
not null because we don't want it to be
empty and after not now we're going to
go ahead and set this one as primary key
you can actually spell that there we go
and the last thing we're going to add to
this is Auto increments Auto underscore
increment which basically means that
it's automatically going to add one to
our integer each time a new users added
so we don't actually need to
administrate the ID column inside our
user table so after the line here we're
going to say comment next line and then
we're going to go ahead and set in the
information we need to know about the
user when they sign themselves up and in
this case we're going to go ahead and
say that we want to know what the
person's first name is I'm going to
write first space I'm going to set the
data type as a watchout parentheses and
inside here I'm going to say I want a
maximum of 128 characters space we're
going to set this one to not null as
well comment next line now I'm just
going to ahead and copy paste this line
because I don't see why we should write
it again since we're going to write
pretty much the same thing and I'm going
to change the first name over here to
last so we can also go ahead and type in
the last name I'm going to go down to
the next line and paste it in again and
I'm going to change the next one here to
the username or UID which I like to call
it so I'm going to say UID and I'm going
to go ahead and just keep the 128
characters for now next line we're going
to go ahead and create the password so
I'm going to instead of saying first
we're going to say PWD and I'm going to
change the watch a to a thousand because
it is good to not have a limit on the
password because it allows more safety
now of course there's a limit on a
thousand characters right now but you
could essentially also set this one as
text if you do not want to have a limit
now I'm just going to ahead and set this
one to watch out because why not I think
a thousand characters is plenty I don't
think anyone is going to type more than
a thousand characters inside the
password so after this one I'm just
going to go and leave out the last comma
and say that this is the last line of
information we need to have of the user
so now that we have this we can actually
go ahead and go down to the bottom here
which this go
and run our MySQL query into the
database so now we do actually have a
table called user as you guys can see
and we have no uses inside this table at
the moment now we're going to go ahead
and create a user from our website so
I'm not going to do it inside the
database so we're going to go ahead and
go into coding again and inside here
we're going to go ahead and set up our
form for the signup system so we're just
going to go ahead and set up the login
form and the signup form inside the
front page because I don't want to spend
a lot of time creating a lot of pages
you guys can do that if you want to but
I'm just going to go ahead and create my
signup form inside the front page here
so inside my body tag I'm going to go
ahead and say form and I'm going to go
ahead and create the open and closing
tags now inside the form we're going to
go ahead and set an input now this input
here is going to have some parameters
inside of it I'm going to go ahead and
set the type equal to text I'm going to
give it a name because we do actually
need to pass on this information into
the URL and we need to name in order to
get this information using PHP code so
I'm going to set the name as first
because it's going to be the first name
you type in space and I'm going to go
ahead and set a placeholder so we can
access see inside the text area what
you're supposed to type into this text
field I'm going to set the placeholder
as first name on the next slide we're
going to go ahead and copy paste this
line here because I don't see why we
should write everything again and I'm
just going to go and change the name to
last we're going to change the
placeholder to the last name now for the
next line we're just going to go and
paste it in again and we're going to
change the name to UID which is two
username and we're going to change the
placeholder to use the name on the next
line we're going to paste it in again
and we're going to change the type to
password because this time we do
actually want the user to not be able to
see what they're typing in you know so
we get that star symbol by using the
typist password then the name we're
going to change the PWD
and the placeholder is going to be
password so now we have this we just
need to create a button like so and I'm
going to go ahead and right sign up
inside this button we're going to set
the button type equal to submit and now
that we have this we can actually go
ahead and see what we have inside the
website so far as you guys can see we
have a very basic signup system I can
actually go ahead and just include a
break in between them so we get
everything on a new line so after my
input the first one I'm going to add a
break symbol and just kind of paste it
down underneath all up like so if I go
refresh you guys can see looks a bit
nicer now these inputs right now don't
actually really work because when we hit
the button we haven't actually told it
what it needs to do yet so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go ahead and
say okay want me to actually hit that
button it needs to load another file
that we're going to create in a second
and run the code inside that file and
then after it has run that code it's
going to go back to our front page here
so inside my front page we're going to
go into the form tag we're going to say
space I'm going to say action which
tells us or tells the file what it needs
to run when we hit that signup button so
I'm going to go ahead and say it's going
to run a file called sign up dot PHP
which we haven't created yet but we will
and afterwards I'm going to set a method
now the method basically tells us what
kind of way we want to pass on this
information if you want it to be hidden
or visible inside the URL now because we
do actually have a password down here
and a username I don't think we should
be able to see it because it needs to be
hidden in case somebody's watching our
computer or some kind of error happens
so we're going to go and set this method
as a post method which means that it's
going to be hidden inside the URL now
just to remind you guys if you want it
to be visible you're going to set it as
a get method so now that we have this
you basically have all we need for this
form
and we can actually go ahead and create
our file at least the new file and save
it inside our root folder as sign up dot
PHP so inside this file we're going to
go ahead and open up our PHP tags and
inside the PHP tags we can actually
start writing the code which will
actually sign the person up inside the
database now we need one thing before we
can actually continue with the signup
form because right now we don't actually
have a connection to the database so
we're going to go to start by writing
that file first so I'm going to create a
new file I'm going to save it inside of
a root folder as well as DPH dot PHP
which stands for word database Handler
you can call whatever you want I'm just
calling it that and inside here we're
going to open up the PHP tags as well
now inside here we do actually need to
create the connection to the database so
we're going to create a variable called
con with two N's I'm going to set it
equal to a function called my SQL i
underscore
annex parentheses and inside whoops did
actually have an error here just going
to change it there we go and inside the
parentheses we're going to go ahead and
put in for parameters so I'm going to go
ahead and say double quotes for the
first one and I'm going to go ahead and
choose the server you want to connect to
now if you have an online server inside
a domain that you have online inside the
web you're going to have to go in and
take with your hosting company what your
server is called now in this case I max
using a local server inside PHP myadmin
so I'm just going to go ahead and set
this one to localhost afterwards we're
going to say comment double quotes and
the next parameter is going to be our
username for the database now except
that I'm using right now as a standard
has a username as root Roo T so that's
what I'm going to put in here now if
you're using something like map you can
still be using root as a username but
the password which is the next one we're
going to write here is going to be root
as well if you're using MAMP in my case
i'm using xampp which means that i'm
going to have no password in here
so I'm just going to leave mine Mt now
there's a lot of different connection
software out there we can connect to a
database inside your local server so go
ahead and check with that one which
password you're going to have to be
using inside your connection here so
afterwards here I'm going to say double
quotes and I'm going to go ahead and
write the name of my database which is
called in my case I do actually think we
call this one login test if I'm not
mistaken let's actually go and double
check it is called lock in test yes so
now that we have this we do actually
have all we need to actually connect to
the database now what if we do actually
get an error message when we try to
connect well we do actually need to tell
it to give us that error message so we
can access see what's wrong so I'm going
to go down to the next line and create
an error handler so I'm going to go
ahead and write if parentheses curly
brackets and inside the condition
parentheses here I'm going to go ahead
and say exclamation mark variable common
which means that if this actually fails
and we don't actually get a connection
then do whatever is inside the curly
brackets so inside here I'm going to go
ahead and write die parentheses which
kills the connection and inside the
parentheses I'm going to write a screen
which tells us what kind of error
message were actually getting when we
try to connect so I'm going to go ahead
and say connection failed colon space
and after the double quote I'm just
going to write punctuation and I'm going
to write a PHP function called my sq
sqli underscore connects underscore
error there we go so this basically
tells us an error message if we do
actually fail this connection now I have
never experienced failing the connection
before but it's always good to have it
here so after we have this we can
actually go back to our signup the PHP
and include the database valve so we do
actually have a connection going inside
our signup form so I'm going to go and
say include space single quotes and
inside here we're going to write the
name or at least a path to a database
file
now I'm just gonna write DBH dot PHP and
a semicolon at the end here so now that
we have this we can actually go ahead
and start writing the code to actually
get the information from the URL that we
passed on from our form inside our front
page so what we need to do here is we
need to create a variable for each of
the data we do actually have in the URL
so I'm going to write the first one as
first and setting equal to variable
underscore post because we're using a
post method brackets single quotes and
closer with the semicolon now inside the
single quotes we're going to go ahead
and refer to the name of the input field
that we created over here inside the
front page and in this case the first
one is called first so I'm going to
write first and I'm going to go and copy
this line and just paste it underneath
here four more times because we do
actually have four different pieces of
data we're passing on with the form so
I'm going to change the second one to
last the third one I'm going to go out
and change the UID and the last one is
going to be password or PWD so now that
we have this we do actually have the
information from the URL which you
passed on from the front page now let's
actually go ahead and test this so
underneath here I'm going to go ahead
and echo and I'm going to go ahead and
echo out our variables just so we can
see what's actually going on so I'm
going to go ahead and just echo out
every single one of them like so just
paste them in here it's always good to
check once in awhile when you do
actually do the sort of coding because
if you do actually code a lot of code
and then suddenly get an error message
it can be a bit more difficult to figure
out where the error actually is so you
should take your code once in a while to
see if you do actually get this
information from the form when we do
actually submit it so now that we have
this I'm actually going to go ahead and
just include a break as well so we can
actually see the information under each
other there we go it's going to copy
paste that down here
like so and I'm going to go and refresh
my browser at least refresh it and then
type in some information Daniel
Nelson which is my name I'm going to set
the username as admin because why not
and the password is going to be one two
three four when I hit sign up it should
actually tell me the information inside
sign up the PHP which you guys can
actually see up in the URL we do
actually have sign up the PHP chosen and
we get the information spit out on the
screen here so now we do actually know
that this information does get passed on
if we can actually start inserting it
into the database so now what we need to
do is we do X need to create a SQL
string which we can actually start
passing into the database by querying it
so we're going to go and create a
variable called SQL set it equal to and
then we're going to set equal to a SQL
string now we're going to go ahead and
create an insert statement so we're
going to say insert into and then we're
going to go and choose the table we want
to insert into in this case is called
user space and now we're going to write
parenthesis space values space
parenthesis so the first parenthesis
here are going to be the names of the
columns we're going to insert them into
the second parentheses are going to be
the values meaning the information we
did actually get from the URL up here so
inside my first parenthesis I'm going to
go ahead and write first comma space
last comma space UID comma space PWD and
do bare mind this is the information we
do actually have inside the database if
I go into my user table go to structure
we can actually see what we have in here
so I have first last use the ID and
password now the ID is auto incremented
so we don't need to worry about this one
it's going to fill it in automatically
when we do actually insert a user so we
don't need to worry about it
so going back to our code we're going to
go into the second parentheses and start
inserting data we got from up here now
you could just go ahead and write
straight away here but just so I can
actually see what's going on I'm going
go ahead and put our values to the next
line here inside the parentheses we can
actually go ahead and say double quotes
or sorry not double quote single quotes
otherwise we're going to cancel out
double quotes around us here we don't
want to do that so inside the single
quotes I'm going to put in the first
parameter or the first value which is
called dollar sign first I'm going to
say comma space single quotes then we're
going to put in the next value which is
last and then we're just going to go
ahead and do the same thing with user ID
and password there we go so now we do
actually have the SQL code which we want
to run inside the database so now we do
actually need to run it by writing
another line of code it's underneath
here I'm going to go and say dollar sign
result space equal to space and now need
to refer to the connection we created
inside our database file called variable
Khan so I'm going to go ahead and say
variable come and I'm going to punch you
a method call query we're just going to
query our SQL code into the database so
I'm going to go ahead and put our
variable SQL inside the parenthesis that
we want to query save it and now it does
actually work now we do also want to get
sent back to the front page once we're
done clicking the sign up button so once
it loads this page and goes to the
bottom and it's done all the code here
at the very bottom we want to tell it to
send us back to the front page so we're
going to go out and write header
parentheses semicolon because this is in
fact a PHP function and inside of the
parentheses we're going to say double
quotes location with the big L cool one
space and then we need to write the path
that we wanted to take us to so in this
case I wanted to take us to the index
page the PHP so now we do actually have
the code here working or at least it
should be working we haven't actually
tested it yet but if you go back to the
front page refresh the browser and try
and sign us up again
so I'm going to write Daniel I'm just
women few guys Nielsen admin that's fine
one two three four and then when I hit
sign up we get taken back to the front
page now if I do actually go into my
database you guys will notice that if
we're going to my user table
we now have a user in here called Daniel
Nielsen with a user ID as admin and a
password as one two three four and id is
automatically inserted as one so now
that we have one user in here we can
essentially just keep signing people up
and each time we sign up a new person
our ID is going to change by one meaning
that the next one's going to be two
three four and so on so on so on so now
we have to sign up system working you
can actually start making the login
system so what we're going to do here so
I'm going to go into my front page and
on top of the form you created I want to
create my login form up on top of here
so I'm going to write form and open and
close my phone tags and inside here I'm
going to go and create another input
actually we can just go ahead and copy
paste from underneath here so I'm just
going to go to copy the button I'm going
to copy the password and the user ID and
just paste it in here now we're going to
go ahead and change the text inside our
submit button to lock in because it
should not say sign up now we're going
to go head and include some breaks
underneath or in between our forms here
so do actually see the difference
between them just like three or
something and now that we refresh our
browser you guys can actually see that
we have two different forms in here we
have a login form and a signup form so
now that we have this we do actually
need to tell it exactly the same thing
which is one to do actually hit that
submit button of the login button we
want it to load another file that we
haven't actually created yet so I'm just
going to go ahead and copy our action
and method from below here put it inside
our form tag and I'm going to change the
action to lock in PHP so now that we
have this we can actually start creating
our login form and I'm going to go ahead
and open up a new document now connects
go into our sign up the PHP file and
just copy everything paste it inside our
new
here save it as login dot PHP so now
that we saved it we can actually start
making the differences that we need to
make in order to make this interlock in
file instead so we don't actually need
the first name and last name so we can
actually remove those because we only
refer to the username and password
inside our front page inside the form so
inside our SQL statement we're going to
change it from an insert statement into
a select statement instead so I'm going
to go ahead and say double quotes and
inside double quotes we're going to say
select all by writing star or
multiplication symbol from the user
table space where space our use ID is
equal to our variable called user ID
because we are actually referring to the
column called user ID down here and
we're just going to go and copy-paste
our variable user ID in here there we go
space and our column called password is
equal to single quotes the variable we
have over here called password so now
we're actually checking if there is one
row inside our database that has a user
ID and a password matching each other so
if you type in a password and a username
that does actually match it's not going
to lock you in so now that we have this
we can actually go ahead and run it like
we did down here what you have actually
done so far because we just copy pasted
but we need to do one more thing we need
to create an if statement that checks if
we're actually logged in properly
because if I type something wrong inside
my input field we don't want it to lock
us in so down here we're going to go and
make an if statement parentheses curly
brackets and inside the if statement we
first of all want to check if there's an
error message like if we did actually
not get signed in because you know
username and password did not match each
other
so I'm going to write exclamation mark
inside the condition and I'm going to go
ahead and set this one as dollar sign
row and set it equal to something called
dollar sign results
which points to a method call fetch
underscore s suck parentheses so now
we're basically saying that we're
creating a variable called Rho which is
equal to the results from the database
if we did actually get a result from our
SQL statement now the exclamation mark
goes in and says okay if this did not
happen like if we have no results from
the database then do whatever is inside
the curly brackets so inside here we
want to give an error message that says
echo a string your user name or password
is incorrect exclamation mark and now we
can actually go down and make an else
statement afterwards which is going to
happen if we did actually have a result
from the database so we're just going to
go ahead and copy paste my echo down
here and instead of saying username and
password is incorrect I'm going to go
ahead and say you are locked in there we
go
so now that we have this we can actually
go ahead and just check if this is
actually working so I'm going to go
inside my database or inside my website
not the database refresh the browser and
inside my login field I'm going to type
admin and I'm just going to type
something that's completely wrong I'm
going to click login and whoops we did
actually not do the correct thing why
did we not do the correct thing oh okay
yeah we did actually have a header down
here at the bottom which is sending us
back to the front page so I'm just going
to go ahead and comment that out so we
don't actually get sent back to the
front page because then we can access
see the text in here so I'm going to go
back refresh again and I'm going to type
something wrong again lock in and as you
guys can see it says your username or
password is incorrect so if I do go back
again refresh the browser and type the
right thing inside the login field one
two three four it says you are locked in
so now we have a login system actually
goes into the database and checks if we
do actually have this user in there
now of course right now we don't want to
have a text that says you are locked in
we actually want to have ourselves
locked in when we do actually hit the
correct thing inside our input field so
what I'm going to do here is I'm
actually going to go and delete our echo
inside the else statement and instead
I'm going to go ahead and create a
variable which is going to be a super
global called session now basically what
this is is we're saving a piece of
information inside something called a
session which we haven't started yet but
you need to make sure you have the
system running inside your website
otherwise you can actually see this
information so inside my else statement
I'm going to go and create a variable on
the score session brackets and
afterwards I'm going to set equal to
something now we're going to go and set
this one equal to the ID from our
database because the ID inside the
database is unique there's no other user
with the same IDs inside the columns so
we want to make sure we're using
something that's unique for every single
user so I'm going to set it equal to
dollar sign row which we did actually
set up here as you know the results from
the database are going to be called
dollar sign row and in this case we're
going to say brackets and inside the
brackets we're going to set it to ID
because now we're getting the ID from
database now inside the session brackets
we're going to choose a name for this
session so I'm going to say single
quotes and I'm just going to call this
one ID because why not so now when we do
actually if we were to actually echo out
session with this ID number then we're
actually going to echo out the ID of the
person who is actually locked in so what
we can do now is we can actually go
ahead and uncomment our header down here
and now we need to actually start the
session on every single page inside our
document now typically when you're
making a website you would have a header
the PHP which is on top of every single
page inside your website so typically
you would actually start a session
inside the header which means that all
your pages are automatically going to
have a session started inside their page
now because we're just not going to
bother with it in this episode I'm
go ahead and insert a session start
inside the pages we're using here so I'm
going to go into my front page go to the
very top and before any other kind of
code I'm going to go ahead and start out
by PHP tags and close it and in between
here we're going to go ahead and start a
session by writing session underscore
start parenthesis semicolon ow let me do
actually have the session start it and
I'm actually going to go and copy our
session start I'm going to insert it
into a sign-up the PHP at the very top
like so save it and inside my login the
PHP file as well at the very top so now
that we have this we do accept the
session started and do bear in mind this
session basically just allows for us to
actually remember at least the website
to remember the variables we put inside
the session variables down here so the
information we put inside this variable
we can't access it without a session
started so not only we have this we can
actually go ahead and save everything
make sure everything is saved and go to
a front page and echo out our session
variable if we're actually logged in so
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to go ahead and go underneath my login
form I'm going to open up the PHP tags
like so and inside the PHP tags I want
to echo out my session ID or my use ID
if I am in fact locked in so I'm going
to go ahead and create an if statement
parenthesis curly brackets and I'm going
to say if we have a session so I'm going
to go ahead and write variable on the
score session and I'm going to say
brackets single quotes ID then we want
to show whatever's inside the curly
brackets so I'm going to go an echo
double quotes and I want to echo out my
session ID so I'm just going to go ahead
and take the session ID well we don't
actually need to the double quotes then
so I'm just going to go ahead and echo
it out whoops there we go and now we're
going to go back into a front page and
see if we do actually get locked in so
I'm going to go ahead and make sure
we're inside our front page refresh
everything whoops oh we did actually get
an error message and I do actually know
why inside our if statement we do
actually need to set if this has
actually been set inside our website
then we want to do whatever is down here
and we do that by a function called is
set so I'm gonna write this sets
parenthesis and then I'm going to put my
session variable inside the parenthesis
so now we're saying okay if the session
has been set then echo this out because
otherwise it's going to give us an error
message if you didn't actually login yet
like so so now that we have this we can
actually go ahead and try and log in so
I'm going to go ahead and say well let's
actually go and write something else
because I do actually wanted to tell us
if I'm not locked in so I'm going to
write an else statement and inside here
wanted to echo you whoops are not locked
in there we go so now it's actually
telling us that we're not logged in if
we don't have a session variable set so
now it says you are not locked in so if
I do actually go up and type something
wrong inside my input field here it
still says you are not locked in because
I'm not locked in yet we don't have a
session variable so if I do actually go
ahead and type the right thing one two
three four login it now says that we're
locked in as user ID as number one which
means that we are right now locked in so
if I were to actually go ahead and go to
other kinds of pages like right now and
make sure that this session has been set
up inside my header then we will
actually be locked in on every single
page we're inside of inside our website
so this is basically how we can lock
somebody in and create a login system
now you might be asking well what about
you know if I want to display certain
content if I'm actually locked in well
then you're just going to go ahead and
use the if statement views down here
what we're basically checking if you're
actually
in like if there is actually a session
ID then do whatever is in here if you're
not locked in then do what's down here
so let's say you might have a user image
so like a profile image inside your
account then we don't want to show any
kind of profile images if you're not
locked in but if you're locked in you
could actually go ahead and echo out an
image that you have chosen for a user
account so this is basically how a login
system works now we do also need to
create a lockout button because we don't
actually have that yet so I'm going to
go ahead and go down underneath our well
let's actually go ahead and do it at the
very bottom here and I'm going to go
ahead and create another form which is
going to be a button just simply a
button that goes in and runs the
document that locks us out just like we
have a document that locks us in we want
to lock us out when we do actually hit
that submit button so inside our form
down here I'm going to say button and
I'm going to go ahead and write lock out
in here and inside the form tags we're
going to go ahead and set an action so
I'm just going to go ahead and copy
paste from on top of here like so and we
don't actually need to put an a method
because we don't actually have any kind
of information while passing on we just
need to run this one file that is just
going to log us out no matter who we are
as a person so once I had this I can
actually go ahead and just kind of
include a couple of breaks down here so
we have some distance between them and
then I'm going to go ahead and create a
new document this one is going to be
called lock out dot PHP and inside of
here we can actually go ahead and just
copy paste from let's take our login
screen here or like login file paste it
in and delete everything all the way
till the top except for the session
start now inside here works are going to
go ahead and copy our session start line
and paste it underneath here and instead
of session start we're going to say
session destroy
like so which basically goes in and says
okay so do X have a session and now
we're going to go ahead and destroy it
which means we're going to end the
session and lock you out now we do also
want to be taken back to the front page
again so I'm just going to go ahead and
copy our header code from one of the
documents like so and that's basically
it so if we go back to my front page
here
refresh the browser and hit the logout
button okay so nothing is really
happening let's go ahead and double
check with that actually write
everything correctly and we did not we
did actually set it to sign up the PHP
instead of lock in the PHP down the
action for our lock out form so I'm
going to say the lockouts dot PHP
instead so now it should actually be
work now it's a typo from my side so now
when I do actually hit lock out as you
guys can see you are not locked in so
now we can actually go ahead and you
know just try lock in again we're logged
in as ID number one lock out there we go
you can sign up another person as Jenny
and let's say Carl son Danny Carlton as
G n 21 and why not just one two three
four again so now when I hit the sign up
button as you guys can see I can
actually go up inside my login field and
type G n 21 one two three four and now
I'm actually gonna pop that access a
we're not locked in why are we not let's
double check whoa okay we do actually
have something going on in here oh okay
yeah that's because I kept hitting the
what do you call it the lockout button
when I did actually submitted each time
because it didn't change my path inside
my you know my lock out form so don't
you guys won't have this probably all
these empty files but we do actually
have Jenny down here but for some reason
we're not getting locked in let's go
ahead and double check that I typed
everything everything correctly Jen 21
one two three four oh there we go so now
we're actually locked in as you know ID
number seventeen because I hid kept
hitting that lockout button which didn't
actually lock us out so just you know
don't look at all these empty fields
that I've put in here I'm just gonna go
and delete them for now so we don't have
them and they're distracting us but this
is basically how we can create a login
system again try not to make any typos
like I did and essentially this is how
it works now of course we didn't create
any kind of error handlers inside our
website because what if there's already
a user inside our database that has a
user name as a certain thing now then we
don't want two people to have the same
user name so we need to make sure we
have these sort of error handlers that
checks if our user does actually exist
inside the database so we're going to go
and do that in the next episode for now
we're just going to go and keep it at
this so we guys enjoy it and learn
something about it and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
