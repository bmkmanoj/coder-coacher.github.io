how to make images responsive and how to
change the images using bootstrap and in
this episode we're gonna talk about how
to do kind of the same thing but using
videos instead so what I have here is
inside my browser and when I haven't
found one of the videos I have on
YouTube and I went ahead and copied the
iframe that we have inside you know the
actual embed tag from YouTube so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and
take this video using the iframe and
insert it inside our website which is
right here and instead of having images
I'm gonna go ahead and create a gallery
using videos instead so inside our code
what do you guys will notice in order to
get this responsive working using images
right now we just went ahead and took an
image tag and add it emits responsive
inside the class now when it comes to
video it's slightly different so what
I'm gonna do here just to show you guys
is I'm gonna go ahead and remove the
middle image inside the middle div we
have inside the middle column like so
inside this column in order to get
videos responsive we're gonna go ahead
and add a dip box now inside this dip
box we're going to go and give it to
different class names so I'm gonna say
class and the first one is going to be
embed - responsive
let's actually make sure we spell that
correctly like so and when it comes to
using the embed responsive I know we
call it embeds but you can actually use
this when it comes to iframe tags you
can use them when it comes to embed tags
video tags and object tags so you don't
have to keep it inside embedded elements
or embedded tags you can actually use it
whether it's videos or something else so
the second tag we need to have is what
we need to decide what kind of format we
want the video to be in now remember
when it comes to video formats we have
the very standard one called
sixteen by nine which is what we see
inside our television screens today but
we also have the most square format
which is called four by three so what
we're going to do here is because my
videos on YouTube are sixteen by nine
I'm gonna go ahead and say we have a
embed - responsive - sixteen by nine
like so just gonna make sure we move
this out so you guys can see there we go
and this is one we need to have in order
to actually make whatever's inside this
dip box responsive well we do actually
need to have one more class but you know
we need to have this dip box around the
actual elements so inside div tag we're
going to go out and add the iframe that
I copied from YouTube so I'm gonna go
and say we have a iframe which looks
like this and inside this iframe I'm
gonna go ahead and give it a class it's
an equal to double quotes and inside
this class I'm gonna go and say we have
a embed responsive item so we're gonna
say embed - responsive - item like so
now forward to go and refresh the
browser what you guys will notice is
that now we get the image replaced by a
video meaning that if I were to make
this you know normal size so we can
actually see what is in here inside the
gallery you guys can see we now have a
video instead of an image now we can
actually go ahead and just copy what we
have inside this column in here replace
all the images inside our code and what
you guys will notice is that we do
actually get a fully working gallery
only using videos like so let's actually
go ahead and make sure that this looks
correctly there we go and refresh and
then the last video
which is up here we're just gonna go
ahead and do the same thing like so and
save it so now we have three videos in
here instead of having three images and
we can actually play these and we'll
actually know do stuff in YouTube so
this is how we can actually include
iframes embeds videos and objects inside
bootstrap and how to tax and make them
responsive and even make a gallery out
of it if you want to of course you don't
have to make it into a gallery because
right now as you guys remember from the
previous episode the only reason we do
actually have a padding going around the
actual video is because the column it's
inside of right now has a padding so he
wanted to go from left to right side of
the screen then you need to make sure
you remove that padding using the
technique we talked about in the
previous episode so hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
