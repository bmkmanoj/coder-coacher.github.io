adding a hover effect on top of some of
our objects inside our new section so if
we were to hover on our new section down
here you guys can actually see that the
text does actually increase in size but
what if I want to add a transition
effect to it you know to kind of make it
smoothly transition into a larger font
size so maybe I wanted to have a delay
behind it so that the only changes after
maybe a second now not to do that we're
gonna have to add a transition effect
inside our style sheet so for this
example let's go ahead and actually
change the color of the boxes into red
when I hop on that instead because the
thing is going to be a little bit easier
to see once we do actually have the
hover effect so if I go into my style
seed and I find my hover effect which is
here this is the part that increases the
text size and I delete it because we
don't want to text increase in size we
actually want the news that's image to
change into a red background color
instead I'm just going to go ahead and
paste it below here and then change the
path a bit so we have class newsdesk
image instead of P at the very end here
so now we can actually change the font
size from 20 pixels because that doesn't
make sense we have a background that
needs to change into a background -
color red and save it so now if i
refresh my browser you guys would like
to see that no matter where I hover on
my new section it's actually the black
box that changes into red so now instead
of it suddenly popping into red we
wanted to smoothly transition so we want
to do that we're going to go into our
style sheet and you might think that we
have to change the styling or at least
add the transition code down in the
hover part at least the hover code we do
for the image but we actually do need to
put it into our objects which is Bement
manipulated into a you know hover effect
so instead of the hover effect down here
we need to go up to the new stats image
code and add the transition effect so
down below here in our code we're going
to go ahead and add the transition so
we're gonna go ahead and write
transition now this actually there's two
ways to do this either we can write one
line of code which gets pretty long or
we can write multiple codes which
changes each thing inside
the transition and we're going to do
both ways so I can show you guys how
it's done so we're just gonna go to
start with you know doing all the
different properties or the different
types of code that goes into
transitioning so down here the first
part of code we're gonna write is
transition - property like so : now I
should mention that transition is a css3
effect meaning that it's part of the new
CSS system so you might not see that you
know the color change them to blue when
we write it that doesn't mean it doesn't
work it's just because it's relatively
new and some code editors like this one
doesn't know that there's actually
supposed to be a transition thing or
like a CSS code so now what we can do
here is we need to specify what it is we
want to change now we could say what we
want the background color to change so
we could actually say back ground -
color now but let's go ahead and do it a
little bit differently because we do
actually want everything to change like
let's say I have a width and a height
and a background color and maybe some
text all of that needs to be changed
when I hover on that so instead of
writing them out individually like one
line of code for the background color
one ladder code for the text we can just
go ahead and write all instead and you
will actually see it turns blue so it is
accept this as an answer so now that we
have specified what needs to be changed
we can go down to the next line and say
well okay but how long do you want it to
take to change so we can say transition
- duration : and then you can either
write it in milliseconds or seconds so
if I wanted to change after you know
take one second to change I can write 1s
if I wanted to take you know one second
in milliseconds instead I can write I
believe a hundred or a thousand don't
laugh at me for this I do believe it's a
thousand so milliseconds and will
actually take a second to change now now
we've done this we can actually go ahead
and see what it does so far if i refresh
the browser you notice that it slowly
smoothed into a red color which looks a
lot nicer than having you know it
suddenly pop up
now one thing I should mention you can
also add hover effects are like
transitioning effects and hover effects
using JavaScript code and some of you
guys who may know about this if you do
it via CSS if I do this really quickly
with my mouse back and forward on all
the boxes you'll see that they don't
change because I need to stay on it for
to change where in JavaScript if you
hover on the object and go on and off
multiple times it's actually going to
start blinking as many times as you
hover on it and it's actually kinda it's
a fun thing so I usually like to use CSS
for this kind of transition effects now
that we have the actual transition added
to everything that we have changed and
we have a duration let's go ahead and
talk about the way we wanted to
transition because there's actually ways
you can change the way it smoothly
transition either by ease ease in ease
out ease in and out depending on how you
want to if you want to just like slow
the speed up and then slow down once it
gets to the end or how you want to do it
so let's go and add that piece of code
to so we're gonna right transition - and
then we're gonna go ahead and say timing
- function like so and then we can
actually write either east or we can
ride East desk in or we can write East -
out or we can write East - in desk out
or if you can write linear depending
what we want to do so if I write YZ - in
desk out I don't know if you can
actually see the change because I
sometimes have a problem seeing the
actual change but he actually notes and
doesn't like it kind of increases a bit
in size and then slows down again and
because of you know the duration of what
we're doing here we might not be able to
see it as well but that's actually
different ways you can add the timing
function to our transition the last
thing we want to add is a delay so let's
say I hover on it and I want to you know
it to take a second before it starts
changing I can say transition
- delay : and I can say one second so
now if we could refresh my browser again
you'll notice I'm gonna hover on it and
it's gonna take just a little bit of
time before start chanting I'll just
zoom in for you guys you can see a
little bit easier I have a net one
second and it changes so there's
actually delay I can I can say 5 seconds
and we're absolutely sure that it does
actually happen refresh 1 2 3 4 5 and it
changes okay now like I said this is a
lot of code to write just to do this so
let's go ahead and add a piece of code
which will just be one line and it's
much easier I think to do it this way
now we also need to talk about something
called browser compatibility because
this right here as you guys can see I'm
actually using Chrome right now works
inside Chrome but what if I were to use
a browser like Internet Explorer or
FileZilla or would you call it the not
FileZilla but Firefox or Pyrrha or
something else
this might not work because you haven't
specified the you know sometimes when
you use css3 code you can't just use no
browsers and we need to specify some
browser compatibility before will
actually allow it to happen so if I go
ahead and delete all this code we're
gonna go ahead and write the same thing
but in one line and then we're gonna
have two browser compatibility at the
very end so I can actually show you guys
how it looks like so here we're gonna
say transition : we don't have to write
anything else then we're gonna say how
long sorry what object are we gonna
change just like last time and we're
gonna go and say all space how long do
we want it to take to transition well I
wanted to take one second space how do I
want to transition it well I would like
for it to ease in dash out space and how
long do you want it to take before it
starts changing now I need to note that
you don't have to add all the parameters
I could easily go with just this but
just for the sake I'm doing this we're
just going to go ahead and add
delay to it as well so we're gonna go
and say two seconds so we don't have to
wait as longest time so if I save this
go into my browser refresh you guys will
notice after one second oh sorry
two seconds it's gonna start changing so
this is another way to do this now like
I said browser compatibility this right
here works in Chrome I'm actually not
quite sure which browsers does work in
we can actually look it up really
quickly if we go to this website here
which I don't move my other screen here
as you guys can see transitioning if i
zoom in for you guys doesn't work on
certain browsers well I don't quite know
which version of browser we're looking
at right now but we might have to add
some other transition effects depending
on the browser we're looking at and of
course we wanted to work in all browsers
meaning that we need to make sure we
have all the difference you know browser
compatibilities for all browsers so as
you guys will notice over here we do
actually have something called dass
WebKit - which is technically what do
you need to use for it to work in Chrome
but as you guys can see that actually
fixed that so we don't have to do this
inside this version of Chrome the same
thing with mocks which is fire Firefox
we also have Safari which is also WebKit
and then we have a para which is another
browser that some of you guys may not
know which is just an O so what we're
going to do here is we're going to go
into our code and then we're gonna copy
this code sorry
I just wrote something we're gonna copy
this code below here then before the
transition we're gonna say - WebKit -
and now it does actually work on all the
browsers that supports WebKit so if we
were to copy it is again the low a
couple of times I'm just gonna go and
change WebKit - mocks which is Firefox
and then - OH
which is a pyrrha so now it's actually
optimized for browsers and it will work
in all browsers so if I save this you
guys will notice that there's no chains
inside our chrome because it already
worked inside chrome but we're
absolutely sure now that it works in all
browsers okay so this is how you add
some system effects and like I said you
can change all these variables we could
also say with instead and it only
changes the width which is kind of nice
and this is essentially how we do it so
I hope you guys enjoyed this episode we
might talk about browser compatibility
little bit more in a later episode I'm
not sure about that yet but if you guys
want to we can actually talk about it so
hope you guys enjoy it and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
