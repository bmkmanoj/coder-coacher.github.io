something called events inside
JavaScript and the basic idea behind
events is that we can do something to an
HTML elements and in response to that a
piece of JavaScript code is gonna run
and do something inside the website so a
couple examples of events is let's
actually go and take this example I have
right here I have a navigation and I
have a tip box inside the navigation
just a small box now what if I want this
navigation to close as soon as I click
the div inside the navigation well we
have an event called unclick which
basically means that once I click on
this div then the navigation needs to
behave a certain way we also have hover
or on hover which basically means that
I'm gonna hover my cursor on top of this
element and then the navigation is gonna
close we can also say unload which means
that the element needs to load and then
it's gonna do something so we have a lot
of different types of events and there's
so many of them that I'm not gonna do
all of them I'm just gonna show you guys
a few examples in this episode but
there's so many of them that I recommend
you guys Google you know all the
different types of events you have in
JavaScript because there's so many of
them so to give you guys an example
let's actually go ahead and create an
event so right now I have this
navigation and I did actually link to a
style sheet and start this navigation
you guys can see it right here if you're
curious how it looks like a very basic
nav starting up here you guys can pause
the screen if you want to copy this down
and I have a nav div styling down here
so basically the dip inside the
navigation now this is how it looks like
you know we have a very basic black box
on the side here that's 300 pixels wide
and I have a red box inside of it and I
want to do something to this navigation
once I click this red box as you guys
can hear right now it doesn't do
anything so we want to create an event
on this red box now the way we're going
to do that is first of all we're gonna
go ahead and create a script tag right
at the bottom of of our document right
on top of the body tag or these are
closing the body tag we're gonna write
scripts we don't need that and inside
the script tag we're going to create a
function this function it's gonna be
written out like this we're gonna write
function then we're going to
and in this case we're gonna call it
toggle nav just to have a name for it
toggle nav to the big n parentheses
curly brackets so inside the curly
brackets is where we're gonna put our
JavaScript code you know whatever we
want to do once something happens to
this div so first of all let's actually
just go ahead and test this so I'm gonna
write alerts parentheses semicolon and
we're gonna go and say that it should
alert it works it works no secretary
right there correctly there we go
now what it basically does is that it
gives us a small you know window that
says it works if this actually works so
once we've done this and remember the
function is not gonna run until I
actually call in it because the code is
inside a function so this is not gonna
run as soon as i refresh the page it's
only gonna run once I actually call on
it so what we need to do now is create
an event because right now as you guys
can see i refresh the site nothing
happens I'm gonna go ahead and go inside
my body tag for example and create an
event called unload I'm gonna say unload
and the basic idea here is that once the
body has loaded it's gonna run some kind
of code and I can actually tell it that
I wanted to run talk a lab the function
we have down here make sure to include
the parentheses save it and assumes a
refresh the browser you guys can see it
says it works so we just created an
event we told it to wait till this
entire body had loaded to run this
function here now before we continue I
want to point out that unload only works
inside specific HTML elements for
example the body tag of would actually
work inside out because we just tested
it if I were to put it inside a image
tag that would also work inside a script
tag would also work but if I were to put
it inside a div tag like the one I have
down here is not gonna work so it's only
specific elements that you can put it
inside of and if you want to know more
about which specific elements you can go
ahead and google it let's use it the way
I do it so I just want to point that out
before we continue
now the next thing we're going to learn
about at least the next event is the one
called on mouse-over so I'm just going
to go ahead and delete this event up
here and we're gonna go ahead and go
down to our Dib tag and then we're gonna
say on mouse-over
equal to double quotes and then we're
going to go ahead and run this function
down here so if I were to go back to the
website refresh you guys can see I have
the mouse cursor right here as soon as I
hover the cursor on top of a div over
here it says it works I didn't click it
I just simply took my mouse cursor and
hovered it on top of it even do that
multiple times so I can just go and say
okay and I can do it again and we also
have one called
on Mouse out so if we were to say
instead of over we can say out I'll go
back refresh as you guys can see I go
inside the box nothing happens when I
take it off something happens so we have
specific events and certain behaviors
that needs to happen on certain you know
moments and my favorite one is the one
called unclick because that's the most
used one I think so if I go ahead and go
in and say unclick save it
refresh you guys can see that nothing
happens when I put my mouse cursor
inside the square but if I were to click
it something happens okay so this is the
one I want to use to make this small
interactive navigation here that I want
to show you guys in this episode so to
show you guys a real-life example of
using this let's say we have this talk
on that down here once I click on this
div I want the navigation box to go out
to the side and disappear from the left
side of the monitor okay so we want to
close to nav to the left side so what we
can do now is I can go in and see my
styling which says that right now my
navigation has a position as fixed and
it has zero pixels from the left so what
I could do is I could change the styling
of this navigation to have a minus 300
pixel to the left so because the width
is 300 it's going to go 300 to the left
and disappear now do also bear in mind
that I have a transition effect which
means that when I move it it's kind of
the same as a hover effect if you have a
transition effect it's gonna do it even
though it's JavaScript so if I were to
go back to my code go down to where we
have our token that function would say
it works I'm gonna go and delete the
alert I'm gonna go and say if you have a
document and inside this document we
want to get an element by ID so I'm
gonna say gets element by ID and do bear
in mind that I did actually use
capitalize letters inside the function
here you guys can see my capitalized e
we have capitalized B and I so because
this is a function I'm gonna write
parentheses semi-colon and inside this
function I want to say we have some kind
of ID inside this document here and
we're gonna call this one closed nav I
guess we don't actually have the ID yet
but we're gonna go and create it right
now
so inside the nav tag about HTML tag up
here I'm gonna say space ID equal to
double quotes on click oh sorry close
now not on click so right now we say
okay once we click on this div that has
this unclick function in it we want to
go in and get the element by ID called
close now which is this one and do
something to it and the way we do that
is by writing after the function down
here get element by ID right punctuation
which means that we're gonna go ahead
and do something else
and we're gonna go out and write style
which is a thing you can do inside
JavaScript where we basically change the
styling of this element now you can do
it in multiple ways you can just start
one thing inside the CSS we can stall a
lot of things and the way we're doing it
right now we can only style one thing
which we only need to do but I'll make
sure to make a separate episode where we
talk about different styling methods we
have inside JavaScript so for now we're
just gonna focus on doing one thing so
after the style tag we're gonna go ahead
and write dot and that basically means
we're jumping to the next thing
so we say we want to start something
what do we want to style and we want to
stand at left styling inside this ID or
inside this nav tag we have up here so
after right left I'm gonna say space
equal to space double quotes and inside
the double quotes I'm gonna go ahead and
write whatever I want to left to you
know change to after we click on it so
in this case I want to say or was it -
300 pixels now do also pay a minor terms
down to the next line because I have no
more space on the side here doesn't
matter and now if I were to go back into
the website refresh you guys can see
once I click it it moves out to the side
so what we can do now is we can actually
go ahead and make a function where it
actually opens and closes it depending
on what status is it's in right now so
what we can do is I can go ahead and say
well right now it only closes ed but
what if I want to open it as well once I
click on the box again now what we can
do is inside the script tag on top of
the function we can create a variable
we're gonna call this one let's say nav
status staff test there we go and we're
gonna go to set equal to true because if
it's equal to true then we have a
boolean going on here we have true and
we have false and right now I want the
status to be true because we do have it
open once I close it I want to change
the nav status to false and depending on
what the current status is I want to
either run this line of code I wanted to
run another line of code okay
so right now the nav status is equal to
true and it's outside the function which
means that this code is always gonna be
running inside the browser okay if I go
inside the function we can make an if
statement which we haven't talked about
yet I think but we will talk about it it
basically means that if this condition
is true then do this you write that by
writing if space parenthesis curly
brackets and then we're going to say
okay if whatever
inside the parentheses are true then run
this code inside the curly brackets so
we can say okay if nav status is equal
to true then do this in here so I'm
gonna go ahead and copy this line of
code delete it and put it inside the if
statements which again right now should
do pretty much the same thing as we have
going on right now inside the browser it
does the exact same thing now what we
can add to it is underneath the
document.getelementbyid e blah blah blah
we can say okay after it has done this
styling to our nap we can actually go
ahead and change the nav status variable
to false so now it's going to be equal
to false which means that once we click
on that it's also going to change the
variable condition up here so right now
if I were to go and copy this entire
piece of code here paste it underneath
here and change the if status to else if
which basically means that if this is
true do this else if this is true do
this okay again we haven't talked about
it but you can just go ahead and follow
it if you want to learn how to make this
closing navigation so I can actually see
what we can do with JavaScript so once
we have this we need to change the nav
status because right now we did actually
say okay now status is equal to true
once we click on the button it's gonna
change it to false so now to tell that
okay if naps that is equal to false it
needs to run this piece of code and need
to change the nav status back to true ok
so now we want to do is we want to
change the left styling to 0 if the naps
that is equal to false and we click on
the button so basically changing the
styling back to what we had up here what
we had left is equal to 0 so just
changing it back and forward constantly
so if we go back and refresh the website
I click it you guys can see it closes
now if I click it again it opens close
open close open ok pretty cool so that's
one of the basic functions behind these
events
and again I just heard you guys a very
very basic example of creating a
open/close navigation which is kind of a
cool feature if you want to have that
inside a website but we did talk about a
few things in here that we haven't
actually talked about it like the if and
else if statements here we will talk
about them pretty soon because you will
be using them quite often in JavaScript
but for now this is all I want to teach
you guys so if you guys enjoyed I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
