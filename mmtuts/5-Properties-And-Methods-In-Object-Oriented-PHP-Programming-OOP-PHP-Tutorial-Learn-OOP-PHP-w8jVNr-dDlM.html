create properties and methods inside
object-oriented programming when it
comes to PHP as you guys can see right
now I have a very basic class called new
class and there's no properties of
methods inside this class I also have an
index file that simply links to our new
class inside the new class documents but
we have nothing inside the index page
other than just a very basic item five
layout we haven't created any kind of
objects yet we just have a class so what
we're going to do today is we're going
to go and start up by creating a
property inside this class and remember
properties and methods is kind of the
same as creating variables and functions
inside a class now the difference here
is for example with methods methods our
class specific functions meaning that
the method or the function we have
inside the class is only going to do
anything regarding the class itself so
the same thing goes to properties the
properties inside this class is only
related to information regarding the
class itself ok so inside this class
here we're going to go and create our
first property so I'm going to go ahead
and say we have a public property we're
going to go and call this one data we're
going to set it equal to some kind of
string we're going to go and set it to I
am a property like so we're going to
close off the property and then what we
can do is we can go ahead and create a
function so after creating this property
here I'm going to go and go to the next
line and create a method which is like I
said essentially a function that's
related to new class now I'm going to go
ahead and create a public method I'm
going to go ahead and call this one
function and we need to give some kind
of name so I'm going to go ahead and
call this one set new property just to
have some kind of name parenthesis and
curly brackets now what I'm going to do
with this function here is I'm going to
go ahead and set and new string inside
data so it's going to go to delete the
old string in here and replace it with
something new so inside this function
here I'm going to go ahead and say we
have a variable called this which
references to this new class that we
have in here or the
class called new class and inside this
class we point to a property called data
and we do that by just simply writing
data without the parentheses afterwards
which tells the document that were
referencing to a property now afterwards
we're going to go ahead and set this
equal to something new now the new
string is going to be determined by what
we type in inside the function inside
the front page for example so I'm going
to go ahead and set it equal to a
variable called new data just to give us
some kind of name semicolon and the new
data is going to be included inside the
parentheses here so when we do exit
reference to this method here inside the
index page whatever text we insert
inside the parentheses is going to be
the new data inside data or the new
string inside data so having created
this method here let's actually go and
create a method that just gets the data
and spits it out inside our index page
so underneath this function here and
underneath this method I'm going to go
and say we have a public function that
has a name as get new property or we
just say get property because it doesn't
really make sense to get new and I'm
going to go and set the parenthesis and
curly brackets now inside this function
here inside this method we're going to
go ahead and say we want to return
variable this and point to data again
we're doing the exact same thing up
inside the previous method we're just
saying that we have this class and want
to point to data inside this class again
if you were to use this method up here
you would actually change the string
inside data which means that if we were
to use this after use the previous
method it would actually change the
result from the get property method
again we're going to test this in just a
second so I'm going to go and save it
and now we basically created one
property and two methods inside this
class do bear in mind that did actually
call this one set and I call this one
get data sax is something that is a
habit of people when they do opt to go
into programming that when you want to
change or insert data inside a database
you create set methods and if you want
get stuff from the database you call it
get methods so you write get and then
something okay you don't have to do it
that way
it's just the way people do it so now
that we have this let's actually go
ahead and instantiate this class that we
can actually do something with it inside
our index page now in some of the
previous episodes we instantiate the
class underneath the actual class by
saying we have a variable called object
because we're creating a new optics in
this class by instantiating it and we
said equal to new and then the class
name so it was a new class again doing
it this way is an option but if you want
to do it inside the index page that's an
option as well I'm just going to go
ahead and delete it or you know copy it
then delete it
go inside my index page and I'm just
going to go and instantiate it right
down here inside the body tag like so so
now we instantiate the class by creating
an object from it so now we can actually
use the information inside the class
based off this object here okay so this
is what allow force to access the
properties and methods underneath the
object I'm going to go ahead and
reference to the first method we created
which was the set data property or set
new property it's called so we're going
to go and say we have the object and
inside this object we have a method
called set new property parentheses
semi-colon and now inside the
parentheses we need to include some kind
of data so I'm going to go and set a new
string I'm going to say this is the new
data okay so now we just changed the
data inside of the string inside the
property called data and call it
something else right now it's not
I am a property anymore okay so for
watch actually get the function down
here get the method called get property
on the knees the line of code we've
created just now we can go and say we
have a object called object and inside
this object we have get property
parentheses semicolon if I were to
actually refresh the browser you guys
can see we get we get nothing because we
need to make sure we do actually echo it
for
I did actually forget that so let's
actually go ahead and echo the second
one like so and see what it says so this
is the new data again if I were to
delete the first method it's going to go
ahead and to inspect to IOM property or
we could actually go ahead and say well
we want to echo the property before we
change it as well as after just going to
go and make sure we create a break as
well then so we're just going to say we
have a regular HTML break and then go
ahead and see regards to new data so
this is how we can create properties and
methods inside classes and how to
actually use the classes and the
properties inside the class now just to
show you guys an example of why uptick
go into program is so powerful when it
comes to objects properties and methods
let me show you guys another example
right now we created a object which is
an instantiation of new class and right
now we're actually changing the data
from the property into this is the new
data and spinning it out inside the
browser now because a class is a
template you know some kind of blueprint
that we can use inside our code we can
actually go ahead and create more
objects based off one class so if we
were to go back to my index page and say
well right now we have created an object
class here let's actually go and create
a second object and call this one object
too so now we can actually go ahead and
use the same blueprint you know the same
class and create different data based
off it so right now based off the first
object we change the string to this is
the new data and what we can do based
off the second object is just take the
same blueprint and create a second piece
of data so I'm going to go and copy the
text here and then change the name from
object one or just the object here to
object - we need to make sure we change
it both in the first line and the second
line so now what we're basically doing
here is we're creating two different
properties and two different methods
that are based off the same blueprints
inside the class who creator's so these
things will actually produce different
data from the same blueprint okay so
what
can do is we can actually go and change
the string to say this is a user called
Daniel and then the second one is going
to say this is a user called John so now
if I go back inside the browser and I
refresh you guys can see we get this is
a user called Daniel and this is a user
called John so now we're creating two
pieces of data based off the same
blueprints which is one of the reasons
object-oriented programming is so cool
so now we learn how to create properties
and methods and how to actually spit
them out inside the browser hope you
guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys next
