talk about some different HTML tags we
can use inside an HTML file so in the
last episode we did in fact use a div
tag and we used a P tag and then we
wrote some text inside of it now we're
going to go ahead and clean out
everything we did from the last episode
because that was essentially just kind
of a example to show you guys what you
could do inside a body tag which we have
over here so we're going to go and clean
this out so I'm going to go and delete
this one line we have I'm going to save
it and then I'm going to go into my
stylesheet and delete everything in here
because this also belonged to the
example from the last episode which I
did mention we're not going to use for
the actual page we're going to create so
now that we're back inside our HTML file
what we're going to talk about here is
tags and when I say tags of course you
know you have like a P tag you have a a
tag
got Dib tags that kind of thing but we
also have something that's relatively
new inside HTML 5 which is tags such as
header section footer age group you know
that kind of thing and these tags are
new and are created because they tell
the browser what kind of content we're
dealing with now to give you guys an
example if you go to any kind of web
site you'll notice that the website is
split up into different areas like
different sections if you go to a front
page and maybe notice that you have a
like you have the top part of the
website which usually repeats at least
on regular if I can call them that
regular websites you usually have a top
part that repeats on every single page
with a navigation with a logo with a
title that kind of thing that repeats
and these are you know typically the
stuff that goes inside a header tag now
the actual content of each page which
might change goes inside something
called a section tag so to kind of
actually do something with this we're
going to go and write up these tags at
right now so the first one I'm going to
write out is the one called header which
is written like this you just simply
write header and make sure you open the
code with it and you close to code with
it anything that goes in between here is
going to be part of the header tag now
don't confuse two head attack
here with the head tag which is
something different now the header tag
is an actual physical part of the
website that we're creating with content
in it you know stuff you can actually
see on a website and the head tag is you
know other kind of information such as
like the stuff we included in a couple
episodes ago like the type of characters
we're using on the website such as the
title of the website and you know
linking to different kind of documents
such as the style sheet so it works a
little bit differently so other than a
head tag we also have something called a
nav tag which is used for navigation or
what you might call a menu and a rule of
thumb is that everything that goes
inside the header tags is the stuff that
gets repeated on every single page now
when I think about it a typical website
usually have a navigation at the very
top somewhere they get repeated on every
single website at the very top meaning
that we want our net tag to go inside
our header now of course it doesn't have
to but that's just you know the typical
way to do it and you can you know
rearrange these as much as you want but
this is the typical way that I have seen
you know most websites do it so inside
here we have an app tag and of course
you need to open it and you need to
close the code and then you can write
menus in here which we haven't done yet
but we'll do that in a couple of
episodes from now underneath our header
tag we will then actually begin adding
in the physical content like the unique
content of this specific page we're just
going to go inside something called a
section like I said the section is going
to be the main content and it can have a
lot of different things in it to give an
example let's say we have a section tag
and we want some kind of content in here
now you could essentially just create
the content which we will learn in a
couple episodes now again but you can
also divide the content into different
articles now you might be thinking you
know when I mentioned articles people
could think about a newspaper article
but that's not really the way you need
to think about it an article is
essentially way group similar
formation together and if you see for
example a section on your front page or
like on any kind of front page that
might have the latest news then you have
a section underneath it that has links
to the most popular post on the site and
then underneath that you might have some
some kind of slideshow going on with
some stuff on it now each of these are
nautical inside the big section we have
on the website so the way we're going to
create this is just as an example we can
create a article inside our section here
by simply writing out article making
sure it has the opening and closing tags
and inside the article we can then start
adding content to this specific area of
our section so inside an article we
could for example have a header such as
the one we have up here now because the
header tag is inside an article the
browser will know that this is the
header of the specific article and not
the actual header that we have at the
very top because it's not inside these
tags so what we could do here is inside
the header we could actually start
adding some head tags we can actually
add a limb go in scroll down a little
bit so we can see we could actually
start adding a h1 tag which is a header
one which is the most important header
on the website because there's an h1 and
a 1 means that it's very important and
then we can say this is a header so this
essentially says that we have a header
tag inside an article and it's inside
the header of the article now underneath
here we could then go ahead and go under
the header the closing of the header
inside the article and we could
essentially create a paragraph with some
text in here which could be the text of
the article or it could be you know
images or whatever we want to put in
here I'm just going to put text where
now since that's easier to do or quicker
underneath the actual content of this
article we could also include a footer
and again just like the header because
the foot is inside an article you will
not see it as the primary footer which
is usually underneath the section that
we created here now let's just go ahead
and include the footer
underneath the section so we actually
have the footer like so now going back
to the article if we go into our header
again and I want to include a sub header
by going underneath our h1 tag and
including a h2 tag and like I said the
closer to 1 the number is the more
important it is and since 2 is higher
than 1 it's less important so this is a
sub header like so now when we do it
like this right now the browser will see
both headers as the primary headers
because it sees these as individual
headers and these do not go together so
in order to fix that and you only need
to do this if you have more than one
header if you just have the h1 it will
be fine just writing it like this but
since I have two headers right
underneath each other what I need to do
is include something called an age group
which I can see it does not shortcut for
me so I'm just going to go ahead and
make it like this you're going to create
an age group you need to open the tags
before the age tags and close it
after days tags so now we just group
these together and told the browser
these are one thing this is a you know
main header because it's h1 and this is
a sub header to this h1 because it's
inside the age group now this is not
really really important and of course
your website is not going to break if
you don't do it this specific way but
it's just you know a matter of writing
the code correctly so this is
essentially how you could set up a site
and you know creating different sections
and since we have an article inside our
section let's actually create some space
so you guys can see the difference so we
have one article here inside our section
and then underneath here we could have
sensitive enough and like I said this
could be a slideshow or something with a
header that says this is a slideshow and
then instead of having it on a sub
header we could just down here with the
content erase our PT tags and just
create a slideshow and we wouldn't even
need the footer because it's just a
slideshow so you know you can create
different articles with it
like this and if you go out and save
this and refresh our browser while I
actually open up in our browser we can
actually see what we have going on here
so I'm just going to go ahead and open
it in Chrome
and as you guys can see we have some
text going on let me just zoom in for
you guys so you can actually see it so
up here we have a tag saying this is a
header which is the header of our
article one then we have this is a sub
header and don't don't think too much
about the sub header being larger than
the main header believe me it is h1
that's the main one the sub header is h2
so the fact that this one is larger does
not mean it's more important then we
have the content which is the the P tag
we included and then down here we have
the second article starting with the
second sub header and then the second
content okay now we could actually
include the like you know split this up
to make it even more obvious by actually
styling these so if we actually start
the article and give it gave it a
background of green we could actually
see the dis entire section that just
highlighted would actually have a green
background and then if we style the
bottom one to have a purple background
it would actually have a purple
background so that way you could
actually essentially test by itself to
see that this is in fact two different
things so this was just a little bit of
a preach about you know how to set up
different sections just to kind of you
know we're not going to be using this I
just gave this as an example you will be
using the header with the NAB tags we
will be using the section at some point
we will also be using the articles and
the headers and all that stuff but the
way I put it up right now was just to
kind of show you guys so I'm just going
to go and delete these articles so we
only have the section so we want to also
keep the footer the section the header
and the nav tags inside the header so
this is essentially how you split up the
content of the actual page and in the
next episode we'll actually start
talking about how to create these
headers and will actually be including
just a little bit of well I will show
you guys a little bit of PHP which is
very little PHP but it will help
phenomenally
and I notice as an HTML tutorial series
and you can choose to ignore what we're
going to do alongside the rest of the
stuff in the next episode you know the
little small PHP part we're going to do
you can choose to ignore it but I
promise you it will be very helpful in
the future okay so it's got an endless
episode here thank you guys for watching
and I will see you guys in the next
episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
