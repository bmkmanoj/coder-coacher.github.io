about something called increment and
decrement operators and as you guys can
see right now we do actually have a
variable called X which is equal to 10
underneath here
you simply echo out variable X meaning
that inside the browser I'm going to get
10 now the idea behind increment and
decrement is that we can actually take a
number for example the 10 we have here
and increase it or decrease it by 1 now
you might be asking why do we need to
learn this well in a later episode we're
going to talk about something called
loops and before we start talking about
loops we need to learn how to increment
or decrement numbers so we're just going
to ahead and jump straight into it here
now then we'll we say echo X we're going
to go ahead and add plus plus in front
of variable X and what this means is
that we're going to go ahead and add 1
now you might be asking why does plus
plus means that we add 1 well it just
does in PHP and JavaScript so don't get
it wrong 1 plus does not mean we add 1
and 2 pluses doesn't mean we add two
plus plus means we add one so two pluses
for one add if I can say it that way so
we're going to go ahead and refresh the
browser now and you guys will notice we
get 11 instead now if I go back in here
you might be asking well does the
positioning matter of the pluses yes it
does if I put it before variable X I'm
saying I'm going to echo well actually
I'm going to add one and then echo out
variable X but if I put the pluses
afterwards I'm actually going to echo
out variable X and then add one so if i
refresh the browser now you guys will
actually notice we get 10 again but if I
go back again go underneath here and
echo variable X you guys will notice
that afterwards we will actually have 10
and then we're going to have 11 because
we echo out 10 and then we add 1 and
then we echo out variable X again when
you get 11 now so adding pluses will add
but what about subtracting if I go and
remove the pluses again and refresh the
browser you guys will see we will
actually get 10 10 because we didn't add
anything now
if I go back again and before the echo
at least the first echo I'm going to say
- mine
if i refresh the browser we're going to
get nine of course we're going to get
nine nine because we will actually go in
and say we're going to you know subtract
one then echo out variable X underneath
here variable X is still nine so we're
going to echo out variable X again so we
get nine nine so if actually go ahead
and take the minuses put it in front of
variable X at least the first one
refresh the browser you guys will see it
says ten nine because you don't actually
subtract before we actually get to the
second echo which is down here so that's
the basic idea behind increment and
decrement and this is not really
difficult but we will need to learn how
to do this for a later episode so
learning about this right now is a
pretty good idea I hope you guys enjoyed
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
