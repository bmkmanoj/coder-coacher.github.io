to actually connect to a database and in
this episode we're going to learn how to
taxi to let data from inside the
database you connected to so as you guys
can see I started off from the previous
episode where we just simply included a
database connection inside our DBAs the
link to PHP file and we're going to use
this connection in order to actually go
into the database and select data and
then spit it out inside our website so
inside my index file I included my
database connection at the top here so
we accept access to variable con and
inside the index file inside the body
tag I'm going to go ahead and include a
piece of code that goes into the
database selects a piece of data and
spits it out so before we get started
I'd like to show guys what exactly I did
inside my database so inside PHP myadmin
I created a database called login system
because that's what I connected to
inside my DBAs file call login system
and inside this database I went ahead
and created a table called users which
we're going to use when we create the
login system a couple episodes from now
and inside this users table I haven't
actually included any kind of users yet
so we can actually go and do that
together so inside the description of
this video
inside YouTube you guys can find a link
to my lesson files for this lesson and
inside those lessons files I will have a
document called database code that SQL
and inside this file you can actually
find the SQL code that I used note to
actually create the table core users and
the insert statement that we're going to
use notes actually insert a user inside
the users table so I'm going to copy the
code from the bottom here called insert
into users plaplapla that will actually
insert a user inside this table up here
so I'm going to go inside my login
system database I'm going to SQL at the
top here I'm going to paste in the code
and I'm just going to go and include
another user so we have two of them
inside the database I'm just going to
change the information of the second one
so it's not Daniel instead we can say
Jane Doe
and we can change the the actual email
to just gain at gmail.com we're going to
change the username from admin to gain
two four five a of something we're going
to change the password to test one two
three four just to have something I'm
going to go ahead and run this code and
as you guys can see now that'll go
inside my users table we now have two
users inside this table here okay so one
thing to bear in mind that I want to
point out is that inside my table the
first row or the first column inside the
table is called user ID now the use ID
when I created the table if you go back
to the code is set to auto increments
and because it's Auto incremented we
don't actually need to insert any kind
of data inside this column here so
that's why we're not actually inserting
into a user underscore ID okay so now we
have to use this inside the database I
can actually go back inside my website
that has nothing inside of it right now
and we can actually go ahead and write
the code that will select the data we
just insert it inside the database so
inside my body tags here since we
already have the connection up here I'm
going to write the PHP tags so we can
actually write PHP code and inside of
here the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to select the actual data
using a SQL statement so I'm going to go
ahead and say we have a variable called
SQL I'm going to set it equal to double
quotes semicolon now inside the double
quotes I'm going to write one of the SQL
statements we learn them on the previous
episodes called select so you guys
should not have to actually do this by
now so I'm going to right select then
I'm going to select everything from
users because that's the name of the
table then I'm going to go ahead and say
well let's actually just go ahead and do
this then I'm going to say semicolon now
you might be asking why do I include a
semicolon we have a semicolon because
some people have been writing me about
that now when it comes to using SQL code
inside PHP code right now we should only
look at this code
as what is inside the double quotes so
right now if I were to actually write
code inside my database for example like
we did here with the insert statement
you guys will notice that there's a
semicolon at the end of the SQL code so
that's something that we need to do
inside SQL and that's why inside the SQL
statement inside the PHP code I also
include a semicolon at the end here so
this semicolon outside is the PSP
semicolon and the semicolon the inside
is the SQL semicolon okay now that we
have the actual SQL statement want to
insert inside the database that lets you
do something and return something to us
we need to actually query this code and
it's actually called querying the code
we want to send it to the database and
run it inside the database so the way
you do this is by creating another
variable we're going to call this one
results I'm going to set it equal to a
PHP function called my sqli
underscore query parentheses semicolon
and then we need to go inside the
parentheses and the first parameter in
here there's going to be two the first
one is going to be actually connection
to the database which we included inside
DBAs dot Inc the PSP which is right here
variable con so I'm going to copy this
variable which we have access to because
a link to it up here and insert as the
first parameter then the second
parameter is going to be the actual SQL
statement we'll want to actually query
inside the database which is the one we
just wrote here like so and now I'll
actually go in and fix the results but
now we need to actually take the data
that we got from the database and be
able to actually spit it out inside our
website so the way we do that is well
first of all we could actually take if
you had any kind of results so I'm going
to create a variable called result check
if you wanted to this is optional I
recommend you do it though because if
you don't get any kind of results from
the database you're going to get a error
message inside your website so it's a
good idea to tick with this sort of
thing so we're going to say result check
is equal to my SQL I
on the score num on the score rose
parentheses semi-colon and then I'm
going to insert the query that we just
ran inside the database and put it
inside the parentheses so it just takes
one parameter so now that we have the
actual result number we can actually go
ahead and check if we have a result
above zero so in the next line I'm going
to create an if statement that says if
we have results check and it's actually
greater than zero then do whatever is
inside the curly brackets so right now
if it did actually have any kind of
result from the database when we want to
select something then it's going to run
this code inside the curly brackets so
we've got no results it's not going to
do anything here okay so inside the if
statement we can actually go ahead and
say okay now we got some kind of result
so now what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to go ahead and spit out the data
now for were to create an if statement
that says if we have data then spit it
out then we're only going to spit out
the first data from inside the database
now because it selected everything from
the user's table I would like to keep
spitting out data as long as we have
results so what I'm going to do here is
I'm going to go and change the if
statement to a while loop that will
actually keep spitting out data as long
as I have data inside the database now
inside the while loop condition I'm
going to include a variable called row
which is going to be set equal to a PHP
function called my sqli
underscore fetch on the score as suc
which is going to fetch all the results
from the result we have up here so I'm
going to insert the variable result
inside the parentheses and it's going to
assign an equal to dollar sign row so
basically what's going on is we get all
the data from the database and we insert
each row of data inside those on row as
an array so because those are row
becomes a array with all the data from
the database the way we included or the
way we echo it out inside the website
it's the same way as an array so if I
were to go inside the while loop II and
actually say I want to spit out for
example to use the name from the users
I'm going to say echo space dollar sign
row and then the way we would actually
take out data from an array is by using
brackets and inside the brackets I'm
going to say single quotes usually
inside an array we could actually say 0
or 1 or 2 or 3 because we want to get
out the first or the second or the third
data inside the array but because when
we assign the data inside those on row
each data result will actually get a
name assigned to it which is going to be
equal to the columns inside the database
mean there right now if you want to
fetch the data from inside dollar sign
row and you try to write the name of the
column we want to access which is a
really neat feature if you want to
access data result easily without
getting confused about which data wax is
spitting out so inside the brackets say
if I want to get the username I just
simply write user underscore UID which
is the column name for the actual
username and then I can go to the
website and actually see what happens
here so now you guys can see we get
admin and we get gain 2 4 5 8 which is
the user names of the actual users I
could actually go and include a break
right next to the code here just so we
can see exactly what's going on so we're
going to say break like so and then we
connect to see the names easier so this
is how we can actually access data from
inside the database using PHP code of
course as other variations of how we can
actually select data inside the SQL
statement for example right now we're
just liking everything from inside users
I could also say want to take everything
from users where maybe user underscore
first which is the first name of the
user is equal to single quotes Daniel or
something then we go back inside our
website refresh you guys can see we only
get admin because I'm only selecting the
user that has Daniel at the first name
so we can also do a bunch of variations
to this SQL statement up here just so
you don't think can only select every
from users or something so hope you guys
enjoyed in the next episode we'll talk
about how to actually insert data inside
the database hope you guys enjoyed I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
