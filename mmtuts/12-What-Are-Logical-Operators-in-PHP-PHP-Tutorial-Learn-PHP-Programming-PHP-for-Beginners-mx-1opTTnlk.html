about something called logical operators
inside PHP and as you guys can see we do
have some stuff in the screen already we
have X which is equal to 10 and we have
Y which is equal to 20 now the basic
idea behind logical operators is they
can actually go ahead and add more
statements or more conditions inside
something like an if statement for
example and as you guys can see to
actually have an if statement down here
and if you guys don't remember an if
statement basically says if whatever's
inside the parentheses are true then
it's going to do whatever is down here
now in this case I did actually put in X
and asked if it was equal to Y and in
this case it's not so it's actually not
going to print out true because this
statement is false so if we're going to
refresh the browser you guys can see it
does actually not say anything now
logical operators basically allows for
us to combine multiple statements or
like conditions next to each other
so we can actually check for more things
than just one thing so if I go after the
Y we have here and say or and add
another condition for example I could
ask if one is in fact equal to one which
is actually a true because one is
actually equal to 1 there the same you
can actually see that we do actually get
true inside the browser because right
now it's checking if this is true or if
this is true then do this down here and
in this case one of them is actually
true so it's just going to do whatever
is down here now we can also use another
one called and in between here which
basically says that both of these
statements has to be true so if I
actually go ahead and refresh the
browser you guys can see that it does
not write anything because this one is
in fact false if I do actual government
change x2 20 you guys will see that now
both statements actually true and it
does actually say true so there's a
couple of different ways we can actually
write this and I do actually recommend
or not recommend I prefer writing it the
other way because it does actually look
a little bit cooler instead of using or
we're actually going to go ahead and use
these symbols here and I don't actually
know what they're called in English but
it's a vertical line going you know
up and down and if you have two of them
next to each other they will in fact do
the same thing as writing or so if I do
actually save this and go refresh the
browser you guys can see it does
actually say true because it attacks it
changed the X back to 10
so only one statement down here is
actually true and it still writes out
true because it's taking or and not and
now if you want to write symbols or
these two symbols for and we can
actually write ampersand ampersand which
does the exact same thing as writing and
so if we refresh the browser you guys
can see it says nothing because one of
these conditions are in fact false now
we have another one which is called X or
like this which basically says that one
of these conditions has to be true but
there can only be one condition that has
to be true meaning that right now one is
in fact equal to 1 X is not equal to Y
so it will in fact print something out
on the screen as you guys can see here
now if I do actually change X to 20
again so now X is in fact equal to Y
both of these conditions will be true
but if I go refresh the browser you can
see it says that is false and that's
because we are basically saying here
that one of these conditions has to be
true but we can't have both of them
being true so that's the basic logical
operators we do actually have inside PHP
we will be using these as well at some
point usually when you do more
complicated stuff or not complicated
stuff but usually when you do something
that's not very basic you do usually use
these kind of conditions here so I hope
you guys enjoyed this episode in the
next episode we're going to start
talking about these if statements we're
actually going to talk about all the
different types of statements we have
that are similar to the if statement so
I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
