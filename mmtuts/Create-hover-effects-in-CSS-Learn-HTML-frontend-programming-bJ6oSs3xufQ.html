talk about how to include a hover effect
once I take my cursor and put on top of
some kind of object inside my website so
right now if I were to hover my cursor
on top of a piece of text or a tip box
or an image right now nothing is going
to happen so let's say I want to take my
new section down here and once I hover
on one of the black boxes I wanted to
turn into red now it's actually very
simple to do that and all you need to do
to include a hover effect is to go into
your style sheet and add a piece of
styling to it so let's go ahead and find
our news - image styling and just simply
copy the styling we have here and paste
it below it now all you need to do to
add a hover effect is to go after the
class news - image and say :
hover and now it's actually going to go
ahead and do all the styling we have in
here once you have on top of the object
so of course we don't need to have all
the stuff repeated we only need to type
in what we want to change so right now
I'm just going to go ahead and delete my
with my height and the commented
background image we have down here so
right now I have a background color
which I can change into red I can save
it and once we refresh our browser
you'll notice that once I hover on these
black boxes they turn into red now this
is all nice but right now it just kind
of changed it's very suddenly maybe I
want to include some kind of smooth
transition into red and in order to do
that we're going to have to add some
css3 transitions which we're going to
talk about in the next episode now we're
not done with hover effects yet though
because right now let's say I want to
hover on something but I want another
object to change want to hover on one
specific object now in order to do this
you can only do it if that object is
inside the object you want hover on so
if I want to change for example my let's
say I want to change the text once I
hover on the whole new section then I'm
actually going to have to tell it well I
have to make sure that the text inside
this specific post so going into my
stylesheet again then we have our
newsdesk
image : hover I'm going to go ahead and
save
basically what we're saying is we're
saying okay we have a class called
newsdesk image and once you hover on it
we wanted to do this right now we want
something else to happen to some of the
object so I'm going to say after the
hover space and then I'm going to tell
it what I want what kind of object I
want to change so right now let's
actually go and delete or maybe copy
this effect we just added here and
instead go up to our index - news sorry
index - news article go ahead and paste
it below here instead and then change
the path to index - news article right
before the hover effect takes place so
now once you have an article something
else is going to change so right now
after the hover we're going to go ahead
and add a class called index - News
space P so right now what we're saying
is that once we hover on top of our
index - News which has sorry the article
which is inside index - News we wanted
to include a hover effect on this item
or like this object so this object right
now is the paragraph inside index - news
okay so right now our text for our
paragraph is actually black so let's go
and change it to red so I'm going to go
ahead and say color : red and save it so
now if I go refresh my browser you'll
notice that my paragraph doesn't change
okay so I did actually find out why it
didn't change because right now like I
said once we have on an object and we
want something else to change we can
only do to something that's inside the
object we're trying to hover on so
automatically it's going to assume that
the paragraph is inside index - news so
right now it's actually looking for a
index - news inside index - news which
has a paragraph in it so we need to
remove the index - news save it and now
if you go refresh the browser you'll
notice that now it changes so what we
can do here with this kind of stuff is
well it's kind of nice too
have something specific change like
let's say you want to text to change but
you don't want it to only change when
you hover on top of the text you want it
to change once you have on top of the
entire post a lot of times you're going
to run into the issue where you know how
do we do this and this is how you do it
so I've talked about adding hover
effects and like I said a lot of times
it's much better to app transition to it
which we'll do in the next episode but
sometimes you might want to change
something else than just a color so
let's go back and try our code and
instead of changing the color to red no
actually yeah we're just going to go
ahead and remove that we're going to
change the font size once you hover on
it 220 pixels so going back in and
refreshing my browser you'll notice if I
don't click on the wrong thing you'll
notice that we do actually get some
change in the text size now what we can
do now is we can actually go ahead and
do quite a lot of stuff we can also
change our dip boxes to change size we
can make it wider we can make it larger
we can do all kinds of stuff any kind of
style you can think of you can do two
objects once you hover on it like we're
doing right here so you can do a lot of
stuff with other hover effects and like
I said in next episode we're going to go
ahead go ahead and take a look at how to
do some transitioning which means that
we're going to smoothly transition into
something so right now if I were to
hover on an object we have transition on
it's not going to suddenly turn into a
bigger font it lacks is slowly enlarging
itself till it hits the pixels to be
told it to when we hover on it so I hope
you guys enjoyed this episode and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
