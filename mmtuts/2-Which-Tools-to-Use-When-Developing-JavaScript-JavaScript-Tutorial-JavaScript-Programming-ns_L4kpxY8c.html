going to be looking with tools you're
going to need for developing JavaScript
as well as a few extensions which you
might want to consider installing as
well but again just to point it out it's
not required the install extensions
extensions are just here to make it
easier to write code and create websites
now when it comes to the tools you need
for JavaScript development the only two
things you need to install the first is
a text editor and the second is a
browser because we will be spending a
lot of time developing using JavaScript
inside the browser's building developer
tool which I will teach you about in
another episode now when it comes to
text editor still a lot to choose from
they're very basic editors that doesn't
have any syntax checking or color
schemes to tell you which code is what
and then they're very complicated
editors that require that you spend some
time getting to know how to use them and
how to set them up and then they're
everything in between so what I went
ahead and did here is I found a few text
editors that I believe you should focus
on the first one is called sublime text
which is also the edits I have been
using in my earliest lessons here on the
channel so some of you might recognize
it it's also free editor but if you
don't buy the commercial version then
you will get pop-ups from time to time
asking you to buy the full version which
can be quite annoying the second editor
that we're going to be looking at is
called Adam which is also a free editor
but this one does not have any kind of
annoying pop-ups or commercial version
this is also the text editor that I'm
currently using on my channel when I
teach programming and post sublime takes
an Adam are very simple to get into and
start using the last edit I want to
mention is one called visual studio code
not to be confused with visual studio
which is 90 II these are two different
software both created by Microsoft
Visual Studio code is the editor that I
personally use my own projects but it's
also a bit more complicated to set up
than sublime sakes and Adam now all of
these editors are great options and it
doesn't matter which twenty-twos which
is why I will be using Adam for this
javascript course Adam is very user
friendly and it's very pretty to look at
which might not matter but I'm a sucker
for text editors that look nice so I
went ahead and drop links with these
editors in the description of the video
so go ahead and install it so it's ready
for the next episode of course if you're
willing to jump into another editor then
you're more than welcome to do so just
be aware that I'll only show how to
install extensions for
Adam in the next episode there's another
thing I want to point out since I get
asked about it quite often here my
channel which is the fact that all these
editors have a dark backgrounds when you
write code inside the program now I know
that a lot of you prefer a white
background when you write code inside
the editor but the reason that the
background is dark as a default is
because it puts less strain on your eyes
when you write code for an extended
amount of time but if you absolutely
have to then you can change the color
scheme inside the editor after you
install it and we'll also do that in the
next episode if you wish to see that so
now we talked about the editors and
that's actually going to talk about the
browsers now when it comes to browsers
it doesn't really matter which one you
choose to use in this course since they
all have built-in developer tools
however I should mention that some
browsers might look slightly different
in the developer tool personally it will
be using Google Chrome in this course
here so if you want your browser to look
identical to mine then you now know
which browser you should install and use
if you don't have it already
of course now there's one more thing I
want to mention this episode which is
the extensions that we're going to be
installing in the next episode now when
it comes to using these different text
editors that I just showed you here we
tend to install extensions to make it
easier to develop these websites and in
the next episode we will be focusing on
two extensions the first one is going to
be one that formats your code inside the
editor meaning that if you have code in
all sorts of weird ways and it doesn't
really make sense when you look at it
visually then you can using an extension
make it rearrange the coachee looks nice
again and the second extension we're
going to look at is one that updates the
website inside the browser as soon as
you save your code inside the editor
which is something that is really nice
to have so you don't have to go manually
inside the browser each time and then
refresh the browser to see the changes
so this is what I want to talk about
this episode in the next one we'll learn
how to actually install these extensions
that makes writing JavaScript quite a
bit easier so we all enjoy it and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
