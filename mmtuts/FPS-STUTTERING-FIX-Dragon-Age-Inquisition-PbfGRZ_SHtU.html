video where we're going to take a look
at a game called Dragon Age Inquisition
now since this game was released there's
been a couple of different issues with
the game including stuttering framerate
issues and crashing now with the
crashing I cannot help you guys because
I do not have crashing on my game so I
can't tell you guys what works and what
does not work but with the stuttering I
can definitely help you guys and I know
you guys have probably been looking on
Google and YouTube and how to fix this
and you've probably been looking at a
lot of different forums on how to fix
these issues but I promise you guys you
will find some methods in here that you
will not find anywhere else because I
checked already
there's none okay I actually have seven
seven different methods that we can use
in order to fix this and I like I said I
promise I will definitely help you guys
out so we're going to start with the
obvious one so you guys have probably
already heard about which is first of
all you have to go to your browser and
go install the latest driver for your
graphics card now if you have GeForce
you need to go to GeForce comm backslash
drivers or if you have Nvidia of course
if you have AMD drivers you need to go
to your AMD website install the latest
driver if you guys already have the
latest driver reinstall it after you
install the game okay I cannot say this
enough I did already have the latest
drive installed I then installed the
game and then I reinstalled my driver
and suddenly the majority of my
stuttering disappeared okay so you have
to reinstall the driver don't just
ignore this fact you have to reinstall
your driver go in here
go find your graphics card down here and
search for it and then find a graphics
card okay it's very important to do this
next thing we're going to do is another
one that you might have found online
somewhere which is that you need to
disable all your overlays now what
people will tell you is that if you go
to your origin just gonna open up here
you have to go up to the orange and menu
up here or up in the corner here and you
need to go down to where it says of our
so called settings program settings
software settings this isn't Danish for
me right now so you guys may not you
know see it in English what you need to
do here is go down to where's
origin in game and you have to uncheck
the one called act activate origin in
game you have to uncheck it okay it's
very important to do this after that you
close it down now another thing you need
to do also what we shouldn't have shut
it down already is that you need to go
into your game so you need to find a
game right click it go to properties or
game properties and in here you will
find this little piece of code that I
included in order to get rid of the
framerate cap that is on the cutscenes
and I do realize that some of you guys
may not have issues with the cutscenes
maybe have issues with the gameplay
stuttering just do this just to make
sure you have it and so I'll go ahead
and include this in the description of
this video so you don't have to you know
look at it and and just write it
yourself so just go ahead and copy paste
it from the description okay
after you've done that we almost went
through all the different actually we I
think we went through all the different
ones to do you will find online now
here's some of my fixes if you have
Dragon Age Inquisition open and you're
using a screen recorder like this one or
like fraps any screen recorder to see
the frame rate of your game you know you
don't necessarily need to record the
game but just to see the frame rate of
your game it will cause stuttering now
why you might ask well because I found
out that Dragon Age Inquisition have
issues with the CPU if you hit ctrl
shift escape when your keyboard you're
going to get this window open here it's
called task manager okay if you go to
performance you can see your CPU usage
what you'll notice is that when you get
stuttering like the micro stuttering
inside the game it is every it happens
every single time the CPU usage goes up
and hits 100% okay weird right and I'm
pretty sure - perhaps this in the future
they have to patch this because it's
just instead I've never seen anything
like this in a game so every time you
get stirring it will in fact hit CPU
usage 100% now I want to get rid of this
the first thing you need to do is make
sure you are not using
screen recorder it is not the screen
recorder that's affecting the game and
cause some stuttering it's the fact that
you have this the screen recorder
software open which causes some of the
CPU to think about the screen recorder
and then it hits a hundred percent okay
so don't have a screen recorder on I
know you want to see your framerate but
just don't have it on okay
now if you do have high CPU usage you
can go into processes and you can go
ahead and click on the CPU button up
here so that the one with the the
process is with the most CPU usage go in
the top and you can actually see which
ones you know you need to get rid of now
I have one called system idle process up
here which takes the most CPU usage
don't you know get rid of this one
because it is basically what it means is
that you're not doing anything on the
computer right now so this one is is
unimportant you don't need to do
anything to this one down here what
you'll notice is the races who naps pops
up from time to time actually it's going
up from like a second place to a third
place and turn it off okay if you have
bracer equipment and you have Razer
synapse open go down the bottom here
right click on race the synapse and
close it okay splitting out for me now
but you need to close races your naps
because it will make it go to 100% in
your CPU usage very important you do
this I do not know if Steam has any
effect you want to you want to eliminate
all kinds of overlays when you play the
game so just get closed down steam
because you probably have it in origin
if you if you have the game in the
computer okay
other than that I do not think we have
anything we need to do inside the
computer of course you can always do
stuff to decrease the stuttering inside
the game and we will actually get into
that so I'll just go ahead and jump into
the game then okay so now inside the
game and you guys may notice that
there's a lot of stuttering going on
here and I can tell you guys straight
away I do not have starting when I play
it's because I am recording the screen
and I'm recording my voice on the
computer on the same time which causes
you know the stuttering right now
because the CPU is is is thinking a lot
so what we have to do here is we're
going to go into options then we're
going to go down to where it says grab
fix and in here we're going to go ahead
and take a look at what we can change
now um a couple of different things here
I do actually have a fair fairly good
speck on my computer I will actually put
in the description so you guys can see
it what do you guys may notice is that I
do not have everything on ultra that is
not because my graphics card cannot pull
the framerate is simply because my CPU
cannot pull the game and I do have a
strong CPU as you guys may see in my
description so what we need to make sure
he is I'm not going to tell you guys
what to put on every single one of them
but the ones you guys do need to focus
on is to turn off the one called pros a
post-process anti-aliasing ok I do know
that there is a big difference between
at least having a little bit of
anti-aliasing on and having none on but
I highly recommend you turn it off okay
because it will help a lot in your CPU
down here where it says multisample
anti-aliasing you want to turn that off
also okay up here where it says ambient
occlusion now I do not experience that
much of a difference in the framerate if
I turn it up all the way up all the way
down so I just keep it at SSAO
now up here word says post process
quality put that to low okay
other than that I
well the shadow is pretty infinite
infamous for decreasing the framerate so
I would probably put that to me to move
over to you guys like I said the frame
were right now is not caused by the my
GPU because I have a I have a I have
good specs
I should be able to pull this game on
ultra it is simply because the CPU is
screwing up the game that is the cause
for every single issue with the
stuttering you have in this game okay I
can promise you guys so what you can see
is I have this one on ultra basically
that's all I have on ultra right now
and I I really hope they will get a new
patch out soon because really they can
they can put more thinking power or
something they can do something to to
you know make the CPU not as bad at
taking this game so they will release a
patch at some point I can almost
completely promise you guys that because
there's so many people having issues
this thing so that's the only thing
inside the game I will actually
recommend you guys to do like I said
don't record your screen don't even have
the screaming coder open don't have any
kind of processes going on that will
take away thinking power from your CPU
so I hope this video helped you guys and
please do leave a like if it did
actually help you guys because it will
help me know if I did actually help
someone and I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
