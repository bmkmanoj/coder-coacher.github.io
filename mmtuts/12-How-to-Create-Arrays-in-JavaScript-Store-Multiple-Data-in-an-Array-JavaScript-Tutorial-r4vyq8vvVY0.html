next episode on how to create JavaScript
now in this lesson you're gonna learn
about something called an array and an
array is very similar to when you
learned about something called the
variable some episodes ago now just to
recap a variable is a way for us to
store information inside a container and
an array on the other hand is a way for
us to store many pieces of information
inside one container so instead of
having you know one container with just
one item inside of it we can have one
container with many pieces of
information stuffed into it so we can
use it for a later purpose so the way we
create an array is very similar to
include variables so in this example
here we'll have nothing inside my script
tags we can go ahead and create a
variable by declaring a variable and
then we'll call it some kind of name
like items just to give it something and
usually with a variable with just that
are equal to and then something like a
string or a number or something but in
this case since we have many pieces of
information needs to go inside this
container I'm going to create a pair of
brackets now inside the brackets we can
go and create all a different lists of
data that we need inside this specific
array here and when we create these
brackets we automatically create an
array instead of a variable so what I
can do is I can say we have for example
a string called bottle then I'm going to
create a second string call something
like camera and just to do something
more we can create a third string and
just go and call this one juice just to
have something so right now we have an
array with three different pieces of
data inside of it
now this is one way we can declare a
variable and I'm not going to confuse
you with a bunch of different ways but
just to show you there's another way we
could have potentially written this out
depending on the purpose later on when
we start learning about loops and that
sort of thing that we might want to do
it in a slightly different way so
another way we could do it is just
declaring the variable so we're
declaring again the same variable called
items and I'm just going to close it so
we just declared it but we haven't done
anything to it then later on we can go
ahead and say well we have this variable
called items that I want to set equal to
whatever we did up here so I'm just
going to copy it
and paste it down so this does the exact
same thing as that Bob we just declared
it first and then we created the values
for the variable afterwards creating an
array instead now just to be clear the
way that we usually do it when we just
need to create an array is the first
method up here it's not till when you
start talking about loops and that sort
of thing inside JavaScript that you need
to worry about creating a array this way
instead of the above now when we create
arrays inside JavaScript we don't have
to just use strings like it in this case
here you can use any kind of data we
have inside JavaScript in order to
include inside an array so right now I
could for example say instead of camera
we could say we have a number called 4
and instead of Jews we could create a
boolean which we also talked about in
the data types episode called true so
you can create any kind of data inside
these arrays we can even have a race
within a race but that's not something
we're gonna talk about in this episode
we'll talk about that when we get to a
later episode so now we created this
array here so now the next question is
how do we actually get the data and show
it inside a website so what we can do is
I can go down to next line and I can go
out and say we have a console.log to
give an example because that is a way we
can get data out on the website inside
the console I can go inside the
parentheses and then when I want to
reference to a piece of data inside the
array I just write the name of the array
brackets and then I need to refer to the
index of the data inside the array now
the index is the precision of the data
inside the array so if you were to take
a look at this array up here you can see
the first data we have inside of it is
the one called bottle which is a string
the second piece of data is number four
and the third piece of data is true
which is a boolean now when I refer to
the first data inside the array we need
to use index number zero because when it
comes to JavaScript or any sort of
programming language we typically start
at the number zero and then one two
three four and so on so on so if I want
to refer to the first index which is
bottle then I write zero inside the
brackets here then if we were to go
inside my website refresh you can see we
get bottle inside the console if you
want to refer to the second data we say
one and then when I go inside the
website refresh you can see we get four
so this is how we refer to the data and
spit it out inside our website now the
last thing I want to talk about when it
comes to arrays is that we can reassign
values inside the array so right now we
have the items array if I want to change
for to for example eight then I can go
right after we declared the array before
we actually control lock it and I can
say items brackets and then refer to the
index of the number four which is one
because remember we start at 0 so 0 1 2
and then I'm going to set it equal to
something else we can also change it
into a string or whatever we want to do
but let's just go and change it into 8
and then if it were 2 console.log and
inside the website you can see that we
now get 8 inside the console so this is
a way that we can redo or reassign a new
value inside an array so this is what an
array is and this is something we've
used quite often when we create Java
Script so when we get to a couple of
projects or not so long time and then
we'll be creating something using a race
as well so I hope you enjoyed I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
