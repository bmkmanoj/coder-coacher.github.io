messages using bootstrap inside our
websites and as you guys can see in
front of me here decides to scratch the
website we've been building for the past
couple episodes because it wasn't very
pretty so instead what we're gonna go
into at the end of this series is we're
gonna go and try and build an entire
front page using bootstrap just to give
you guys an idea about you know building
an actual website using bootstrap and
the end of the series here so what we're
going to go into today is just focus on
creating messages now I want to say
messages inside bootstrap I'm talking
about a block that has some text inside
of it and then depending on the message
the blog is going to have a certain
styling as well as the text inside of it
and if we were to have links inside the
block it would also have a certain
styling so inside our code we're gonna
go ahead and start up by going inside
our body tanks as you guys can see I
have a container inside my body tag just
so we have the messages inside the
middle of the screen and inside this
container I'm gonna go and create a dip
box now inside the dip box I'm gonna go
and write some kind of text so I could
actually say success just to give you
some kind of message
you did well like so now for what to go
inside my dip tag I can actually go
ahead and add a class that exists inside
bootstrap called a well now a well is
when we have a regular piece of text
that has a block around it so basically
all creating here is just a very basic
message that doesn't indicate a warning
or anything like that so the way we can
decide the size of this well is by
saying well - and then the size of it so
right now if I want a small message I
can go ahead and say SM then I can
refresh the browser and you guys to
notice we get a small message inside the
browser again if I were to go back
inside my code and change it to LG it
stands for large refresh you guys can
see we get a bigger padding around it so
this is a basic way to illustrate text
inside some kind of message now forward
to include some kind of styling to it
and actually indicate some kind of like
danger or success I can go ahead and
tint this up a little bit so instead of
writing a well which right now is just a
standard styling for adding padding
around text I can go ahead and write
alert
instead of writing well LG we can go
ahead and write what kind of styling one
tab inside this message so right now if
we want to have a success message like I
have here I can go and say alerts -
success if it were to refresh the
browser you guys can see then now we get
a green success message and again if I
want to make something a bit more bold I
can go back and stop my code and change
my success text by adding a strong HTML
tag around it so I can go ahead and just
copy this around it like so and as you
guys will notice now we get a strong
message inside a browser now for which
include a link inside this message here
let's actually say we want to say
success you did well here is your price
or something like that we can actually
go out and say we want to include an
anchor tag inside the message here and
inside the anchor tag can say here is
your price like so and if we were to go
inside the browser now you guys will
notice that we don't really have the
default bootstrap styling or at least
this time the match is this message here
so what I can then do is I'm gonna give
this anchor tag a class so I can say
class set - alert - link and now for
what you refresh the browser you guys
can see it actually matches what we just
did in here so now we get a dark
greenish color that indicates a link so
if I were to go back inside my styling
here can actually go inside my alert dip
box and change it from success to danger
if I wanted to go back inside my website
and I got some notice that the entire
styling team's inside my message here
now the next thing we can do to this
message here so we can actually be able
to dismiss it so we were to click on
some kind of X icon we can actually get
rid of it and the way we do that is by
going back inside our code and inside my
div class here called alert alert danger
I'm gonna go ahead and add a class
called alerts
- dismissible like so and then inside
the div tag at the first line I'm gonna
go and include a anchor tag and inside
the anchor tag I'm just gonna write has
tag inside the link because we don't
want
to link to anywhere and then I'm gonna
go and include a class inside this anger
tag which I'm going to call close then
we're gonna go and include a attribute
called data
- dismiss which I'm gonna go ahead and
set to equal to alert which simply
indicates inside bootstrap that this is
a alert dismiss fee - including inside
this anger tag and then the last
attribute we're gonna include is called
area - label and we're gonna go ahead
and set this one to equal to close so
this is a closing button inside this
message here now inside the actual text
I'm gonna go and say we have a m % times
semicolon which is simply a simple that
is basically an X we could also just set
X to the 1/2 but this is the actual
symbol for it so now for words to save
this and actually go inside my browser
so you guys will notice then now we have
a X symbol we can actually click and
once I click it it disappears which is a
really nice feature inside you know
messages now if you guys think it
disappeared too fast we can actually
change it by making it fade out instead
so if we were to go back inside my code
I can instead go and stop my alert -
dismissible and say we want to add a
fade space and give a word - then go
back to my website refresh you guys can
see that now it fades out so these are
different ways we can actually include
messages and actually make them
disappear you know with an actual user
input inside your website hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
