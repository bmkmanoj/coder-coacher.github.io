about how to add a table to a website
and a table of course we can use to show
data information that kind of stuff to
our users and sometimes a table is just
very nice to have on a website instead
of you know writing out the information
so what we can do here is we can
actually go ahead and go into our HTML
file because we do actually need a new
section for this so if you go into our
front page and go to our video section
inside our section tags and copy it
because you do need a new section for
our table so we might as well just copy
one paste it below at the very bottom
right before the section ends and then
simply change the name from at least a
class name from video - box to table -
box we're going to keep the wrapper for
now we're gonna delete the iframe though
because they don't need iya frame then
we're gonna save it so now we're gonna
go ahead and go into our style sheet and
style our new table - box because we do
actually need some styling for it go to
the very bottom right before the footer
because in the HTML hierarchy that's
where it goes and then we change the
video to table now instead of the height
being fixed we're just going to go ahead
and delete it remove it and add a
padding at the very top and bottom
instead so we're gonna write padding and
then we're gonna say from top and bottom
we want 80 pixels and from the left and
right we want zero pixels and we did
talk about how to do this like the the
padding what it does in our what we
called it our introduction intro box
episode so we're just going to go ahead
and save it and refresh without any
further explanation to why we'd add the
padding now as you guys can see we do
actually have the same background color
as the footer so we should probably
change the background color as well to
FFF save it
refresh our browser and as you guys will
notice we get a new section at the very
bottom here now now we can actually go
ahead and include our table inside this
box so if I go into my index file go to
our wrapper which is inside our table
box div which is how subsection to a
section we can actually go ahead and
write out Oh
at least we need to open up the code
then write table
close it and then we need to add the
closing tag up the table which is down
here at the very bottom like so so now
we have the table but we don't actually
have anything inside the table so if you
go ahead and add a well there's three
different things you can put in here you
can put a table header you can put a
table row or you can put table data in
here so let's go ahead and add a table
row because we need a row for the header
first so think about it as the rows
going horizontally and depending on the
information put inside these rows it's
gonna add the columns so we're going to
start out by writing a table row which
would do by opening up the code writing
TR and closing it again then we need to
add the closing tag of the row of course
like so with a backslash TR and close it
then we're gonna shove it down to the
next line so in between the table row
we're gonna add either the table headers
or the data and for this first one we
should probably have some headers you
know like some titles for each column so
we're gonna go ahead and write th this
time which is table header and I just
wrote it out quickly it's the same thing
as the table row and then we're gonna
add some information in it in here so
we're gonna go ahead and say first name
for example then we're gonna add another
one so we're just gonna copy this one
below here let's go ahead and copy it
down twice and say last name and then
we're gonna go ahead and write points
and I'm actually using this example from
w3schools come so you know it's just a
very nice example so let's have
first-name lastname and points not name
just points like so and then we have
some different headers so now that we
have this we can actually go ahead and
add data for each header so we're just
gonna quit and copy this entire section
with the table row paste it below here
because we do need to have another row
to show a piece of data and then instead
of th inside because we don't need the
table headers we're going to write td4
table data so I'm just gonna go ahead
and highlight them all and write TD
instead
so now of course we want some data we
don't want the header text in here so we
want to write my first name at these my
first name I can use an example you guys
can write whatever kind of data you want
this can use my name is an example
Daniel and then my last name is a very
typical Danish name which is Nielsen and
then the points I get is hundred points
because I am just that good so now that
we have one piece of data we can
actually go ahead and copy this one
again and add another one because this
is just one person but we need a second
person just to kind of see what we're
doing so we're gonna go ahead and write
I don't know
ni ck L AES which is Niclas at least a
very complicated way to write niccola's
which is my brother's name by the way
and then we're gonna go ahead and write
another last name for my brother I'm
gonna write Jackson if that's how you
spell it that's I do not think that ties
fella that's how you spell it
and because he's my younger brother of
course he doesn't have as many points as
I do so we're gonna go ahead and write
60 so now that we have this we can
actually go ahead and go and refresh our
browser you guys may notice that we even
though we do have some information here
it's not very impressive looking because
right now our table is actually only the
width of the content and we as you guys
can see the first name does actually
touch the bottom of last name and points
and everything looks very tiny so let's
go ahead and make it a hundred percent
width of our wrapper so going into our
style sheet at the very bottom here
we're gonna go ahead and say well we do
have a well let's just go ahead and copy
this piece of code up here we do have a
table - box with a table in it so we're
gonna go ahead and after the table - box
a table we want it to look like this so
right now I'm just gonna go ahead remove
the background color and the padding and
then keep the width at 100% so after
we've done this refresh our browser you
guys will notice that the spreads out
now the thing about headers is that
they're always going to be centered and
the data is always gonna be floating to
the left side so we can actually change
this inside our styling if you want to
I'm just gonna go to zoom in so you guys
can see it even better
and let's just go ahead and style each
of these individually if I right click
on these and inspect element which is
something you can do in a lot of
browsers you can actually see that I'm
highlighting my table data right now
which as you guys can see the blue area
takes up this much space if it were to
highlight my table header which is here
it takes up the same amount of space but
the text is just centered so if I want
to change the color of my rows so that
look a little bit different from the
headers I can actually go ahead and go
into our style sheet again and I'm just
gonna go ahead and copy my styling from
a table box table paste it down here and
say inside the table we also have a
table header with a th so we don't need
to change the width because we already
have it 100% so now that we have the
table header down here we can actually
go ahead and add the styling to make the
text go to the left side because I do
think that the text being in the middle
does look kind of weird so let's just go
ahead and add it so that it goes to the
left side so we're gonna say text - a
line then we're gonna say left we're
gonna save it and refresh our browser
and you guys will notice that our text
is going to the left side who looks
better now you'll also notice that our
headers do actually have a bold styling
to it I'm just gonna go ahead and swim
even more in for you guys so you guys
can see it then it does actually have a
bit of boldness to it now this is
something that's just like with you know
eight elements and paragraph elements
like each elements will actually have
some boldness to them as a preset
headers will as well inside a table
header so what we're gonna do here is
we're just going to go ahead and add a
bit of background color to the rows so
we can actually tell them apart so going
into our styling again we're gonna go
and copy our table box data table box
table th paste it below here and then
say instead of th we're gonna say T our
oh sorry
TD table data and then we can actually
start styling it here
so inside our table data instead of to
text-align:left because we don't need
that it's already aligned left we're
gonna say back
ground desk color and then give it
something very light so let's go and
give it hashtag CCC and see how it looks
like so as you guys can see we do have
it highlighted now so maybe we want some
spacing between at least from the top
and bottom so let's go ahead and add a
margin as well so inside our table data
we're gonna say margin - top and say
maybe 2 pixels to not exaggerate too
much refresh it and you guys will notice
that nothing does actually happen ah
okay so did actually figure out what I
did wrong here and I do seem to make a
lot of mistakes lately but let's just go
ahead and fix this now when we want to
add a spacing to our table data at least
between the rows we don't have to
spacing to the table data we added to
the table row so what we can do is we
can actually go ahead and copy our table
data styling we're gonna paste it below
our tables box up here and then we're
just gonna go ahead and delete our
margin from our table data at the bottom
here and delete the background color or
at least delete both of these because we
don't need both of these is that a table
row also gonna change here to table row
and then we're gonna add instead of a
margin or padding because you can't
actually do that inside a table we need
to add a border instead so we're gonna
say border - top and then we're going to
say quotation marks are not quotation
mark : and then we're gonna say one
accident we're gonna say two pixels of
border from the top space you want the
line to be solid we could also add dash
to something depending on what kind of
line you want to add right now we're
just gonna add a solid line and then
we're gonna say what color we want it to
be so I'm gonna go and say we want it as
white which is hashtag FFF if I save
this now refresh my browser you guys
will notice we get some spacing so this
is one way to do things we can actually
we can actually also add a what you
called a border around our data down
here if we want to because if you go
into our table data everyone eat data to
be the like right
we just have a space in between the rows
and sometimes you actually want to make
you know a box around each data so we
could actually go ahead and go down to
our data instead of border top we're
just gonna say border then we're gonna
delete our border top up here at the
table row and I can show you guys that
looks a little bit different so now we
do actually get a border around each of
our data so we actually get these small
cells with information in them so you
can do this in so many ways and we can
actually just go ahead and make it not
white but let's go ahead and make it
black just for the fun of it
I'm kind of messing around with my
coding a little bit now just to show you
guys so if you make it black instead you
guys will see it even better did we get
these boxes so this is essentially how
you do this kind of thing and and
created you know tables and that type of
thing and you can add all kinds of crazy
styling to it you can add all the
different styling that you want to add
to it now we're just gonna leave this
for now in this episode we're not gonna
see in teens to the font you know family
you have change the font size or
anything cuz you guys already know how
to do that I just want to show you guys
how to make a table inside this website
so hope you guys enjoyed this episode in
the next one we're gonna talk about how
to include a form into a website which
is something that you're going to be
using quite a lot if you're using PHP
code which is something you guys might
consider looking into in the future and
it's just very nice to know about forms
because you do see them a lot on
websites for example you want to add a
little contact form on our website and
you want people to be you know be able
to send a email using that contact form
then it's nice to have a form that you
can actually use so I hope you guys
enjoyed this episode and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
