first episode on how to use Adobe
Premiere Pro now in this series we're
gonna be talking about some of the
basics and some of the advanced features
that the software has to offer and for
this episode we're gonna be talking
about what exactly Premiere Pro is and
what you can use it for compared to
other programs out there now as you guys
may know from your pros made for editing
videos and making movies whether it
being professional or amateur videos it
is one of the programs that some of the
professional people use alongside Final
Cut Pro which is mainly used by Mac
people because it's a Mac program but
Premiere Pro is one of the big programs
out there that if you want to be a
serious Video Editor then you would have
a program like this one now I would like
to talk about another program by Adobe
called After Effects which is also a
program you can use if you want to edit
videos but the main purpose behind using
Premiere is for cutting and editing
video clips and touching up on the
footage that looks nice where After
Effects is mainly used toward special
effects so if you want motion tracking
or fire effects or something inside your
video clips then you can put video clips
inside After Effects add the effects and
then you can put the after effect
project or just eclipse after you export
them into premiere so you can actually
edit and cut the clips and make a movie
so now that we cleared that out the
difference between After Effects and
Premiere we can actually go ahead and
get started on what exactly premiere is
now Premiere like I said has many
different tools for cutting editing
adding effects to your footage so you
can actually increase the quality or
change of the mood of the footage you
can also add effects to sound if you
want to touch up in the sound a bit of
course it's not going to be as good as
using a professional sound program but
it gets the job done
now premiere compared to other programs
out there is quite advanced because you
can do quite a bit of settings
you know effects options with your clips
and it also has a lot more control over
what you want to do to your footage
whereas some of the other programs out
there that might be cheaper like Sony
Vegas can also do a lot of the things
that premier can do but
very limited in the way you can use it
so premier is one of the good programs
there's also one of more expensive
programs because you need an Adobe
membership but it's really good for
doing video editing if you want to be
taken serious as a video editor so
that's basically it for this episode I
would like to just do this small
introduction that we just did and for
the next episode we'll talk about how to
actually set up a new project so we can
actually get started doing some kind of
editing hope you guys enjoyed and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
