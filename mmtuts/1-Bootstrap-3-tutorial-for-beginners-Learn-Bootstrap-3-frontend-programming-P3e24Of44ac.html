series we're going to talk about how to
learn bootstrap now in this episode
we're going to talk about what exactly
bootstrap is and what you need to know
before you dive into it so when it comes
to bootstrap bootstrap is basically a
front-end framework created to make
mobile first websites now what that
means is that when we create a website
using HTML CSS maybe a bit of JavaScript
we create it with a mobile phone in mind
first before we design for the desktop
now having said this and as you guys can
probably guess from it all you need to
know before you get into bootstrap is
basic HTML and basic CSS you don't need
to know any other kind of programming
languages other than these two in order
to start bootstrap so what we can do
with bootstrap is a bunch of stuff first
of all with bootstrap creating websites
inside you know the browser inside a
mobile phone automatically makes it
responsive as long as you of course
program bootstrap the proper way it
should automatically be responsive
because of the CSS the bootstrap
provides so if you guys have any kind of
plans to make whatever website the
creating responsive from the get-go and
you don't want to spend too much time on
creating responsive design yourself then
bootstrap is a really good charge to get
started quickly and get a responsive
website going really fast now you might
be asking how does bootstrap actually
work when we get into the coding part
well bootstrap is basically just a
library that you can download or just
link to on the web that has a bunch of
HTML and CSS and JavaScript that we can
use inside the website meaning that the
HTML attributes we have inside our
website such as you know the div boxes
and the sections and if you want to
create a navigation bootstrap has their
own HTML versions of those tags that we
can use which because we load bootstrap
inside the document as well
automatically styles and create this
bootstrap layout that we want to create
inside our website and this is why
bootstrap is so easy to learn because if
you have basic knowledge of HTML CSS
then you should have no problems
learning this now I mentioned that we
needed to download bootstrap and there
was two ways we could do it either we
could just download all the source files
there
the inside a root folder which is one
way to do it but the way we're going to
focus on these series here at least in
these episodes is using something called
a CDN network well CDN stands for
content delivery network so you can't
release a CDN network but you get what I
mean the basic idea behind using a CDN
network rather than downloading the
files and inserting all the bootstrap
files inside the root folder directly is
that when we use a content delivery
network we can actually load all the
files faster since when a user enters
your website all the bootstrap files get
loaded from a server which is going to
be somewhere near you a concert delivery
network basically means that there's a
bunch of servers all over the world
whichever server's closest to you it's
going to be the one that the user loads
all the files from when they enter a
bootstrap website so this is why we're
going to go and use a CDN network and
this is actually much easier to set up
then you know just downloading the files
and using them directly inside a root
folder so in the next episode we're
going to talk about how to actually set
up a bootstrap website and get started
on it so we can actually get this you
know CDN network working so we have
bootstrap available to us when we start
creating a website so if you guys
enjoyed I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
