about superglobals inside PHP and for
this episode we're going to talk about
something called a cookie and a session
now you might have heard the name cookie
before you know when you go to a website
and it says do you want to accept
cookies yes or no now the basic idea
behind cookies and sessions is that you
can save information on the user now a
cookie saves information on the user
side meaning inside the browser and the
session saves information on the user
inside the server side so to give you
guys an example let's say I go to a
website that has a login system now I'm
going to go into the login system or
like into the inputs of the login system
I'm going to type my username and my
password and then I'm going to hit login
now once I lock in if I'm actually
logged in correctly we need to be able
to save who is actually logged in
because once I do actually go to another
page
suddenly the website doesn't remember
anymore who's actually logged in so we
use sessions to make the website
remember who we actually are when we are
logged in
now even though cookies might be the one
you're more familiar with cookies are
usually used for saving information
that's not as dangerous for other people
to know about because hackers have an
easier time going into your cookies
rather than sessions now cookies
actually saved on your computer
somewhere where hackers can gain access
to it and you don't want that so when
you use cookies you can use it for
something like let's say you've been to
a website that sells clothing and you
want you know the website to remember
what type of clothing this person likes
so next time to come in you're going to
display that clothing as the first thing
when they enter the site now that will
be okay because that's not something
hackers can actually use for something
dangerous now as you know like a
username and password on the other hand
is not something I want to give away so
that's why we use sessions for that sort
of thing now there's also a difference
here because a session ends as soon as
you close down your browser if I
actually go up and shut down my you know
Chrome or Firefox or whatever browser
you might be using the
is going to end a cookie on the other
hand has a time limit I can actually set
a cookie for maybe you know 30 days like
a month if I want to and when they enter
you know a website again it's still
going to remember the information that
we saved inside the cookie it's not
going to forget it unless we tell it to
or the time expires so now that we
talked about differences between a
cookie and a session let's actually try
and talk about how to actually make
these so if I want to make a cookie I
connected right set cookie parentheses
which is an actual function inside PHP
and inside the parentheses we can put
quite a few parameters now the first one
is the one we have to put in there which
is the name of the actual cookie so in
this case I'm just going to go ahead and
write name afterwards it would make
sense to you know actually give this
cookie a value so I'm going to go ahead
and say come at Daniel inside a string
of course because right now if I call
out the cookie called name it's going to
write Daniel because that's the value of
it now let's say I want this cookie to
expire after quite a while let's say a
day which is not quite a while but let's
say we want this cookie to expire after
a day we can actually take comma then
I'm going to use a predetermined
function inside PHP called time
parentheses which basically takes the
current time and then we're going to add
a day to it now I'm just going to go
ahead and write eight 86,400
milliseconds which is a day apparently
because the dogs have a calculator next
to me here but this basically takes the
current time and adds a day to it so a
day from now as you actually activate
this cookie this cookie is going to
destroy itself now let's say I want to
automatically destroy this cookie I
don't want the user to wait a day let's
say I have a button inside the website
that says destroy all cookies and then
the user can click it now the way you do
that is by setting it to any kind of
negative if I were to say negative let's
say one millisecond this would actually
destroy the cookie because you know it
had to be destroyed yesterday so it's
going to destroy it right now so that's
the way we can destroy cookies as well
now let's say I want to create a session
instead because like I said cookies not
very safe so in some cases if you want
to create a login system we might want
to save the user name and password or at
least you know the name of the user
inside a session so what we can do here
is we can go ahead and create a session
by saying variable underscore session
brackets and I'm going to go ahead and
set this one equal to something now
inside the brackets we're going to put
either single or double quotes I'm just
going to put single quotes and we're
going to give this one a name now I
could actually write name inside the
session so right now this session is
called name I'm going to set it equal to
Daniel which is the string now because
session is equal to name let's actually
say this is equal to an actual ID of the
user Daniel inside the database which is
not something want a hacker to get their
hands on now let's say the idea of this
person is actually 12 we don't want the
hackers to know about this number but
because we're saving it inside a session
variable the hacker won't actually be
able to see this cookies on the other
hand they actually will but not sessions
so right now wax is saving a session
called name and setting it equal to 12
so we can actually create this sort of
thing inside for example form when we do
actually type something to lock in we
can actually create these sessions and
set equal to you know whatever user ID
is equal to the username and password to
tap into inside the login field inside
the input field so we can actually
create these and as long as we actually
have the session running inside the
website the website will actually
remember who you are as a user when
you're locked in so knowing this we're
also going to have to talk about actual
sessions because we need to have a
session going inside a website in order
for attacks to remember variables called
sessions like these sort of you know
superglobals down here so if you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
