things slide inside our website using
jQuery and as you guys can see in front
of me here a very basic navigation and I
also have an information box inside the
website now again this is kind of what
we had in the previous episode and for
you guys who didn't watch the previous
episode you guys can download these
files in the description if you want to
do the exact same thing as I'm doing
inside my website here again the effect
we're gonna learn in this episode
doesn't require that you have exactly
what I have inside my website well
basically just going to learn how to
slide things using jQuery and you can
just go and build whatever you want to
build inside this example here if you
want to so what we're going to do today
like I said is we're gonna go to make
things slide
when I say slide I mean that we want to
make things close and open by closing
from the bottom to the top now an
example of this and the reason I
included this information box here is
that if I were to have some information
inside this box and I want to be able to
open or close it then by clicking the
title for example we want this box down
here to slide up or down now if you guys
are not entirely sure what I mean when I
say open and close by sliding I'm gonna
go in to show you guys an example now so
inside our code I'm gonna go and go down
to the bottom where we have the jQuery
code now again this is from the previous
episode and as you guys can see we
basically say they want to wait with
loading this jQuery code until after we
loaded everything else inside the
website then afterwards we have a
selector that uses the navigation button
which right now is the one that's inside
my header up here now when I click it I
want this navigation to open or close by
sliding upwards so if we were to go
inside my jQuery code as you guys can
see I have a slide up effect included in
here which basically means that when I
click the button my navigation is going
to slide from the bottom to the top so
by going in here refreshing and then
clicking the button you guys considered
the navigation closed from the bottom to
the top now if we were to go back inside
my code we could do the opposite by
writing slide down and again remember to
capitalize to D then I forward to go
back inside my website as you guys can
see right now when i refresh it's
actually gonna open up
but if the navigation words that have
closed I can then open it again by
sliding down so if you want to have a
toggle effect we can also do that so we
can access a slide taco like so go back
inside the website and as you guys can
see when i refresh and then click the
button it closes then when I click it
again it opens and again inside the
parentheses after the effect I can
decide how long it should take for to
open and close a connects you go ahead
and say we want to add 10 seconds to
this I'm just gonna add another cero go
back inside my website refresh and then
you guys can see it slowly closes up and
it's actually going to take 10 seconds
before it closes entirely now we can
also go to add this inside an
information box like the one we have Ian
this is actually one typical example
that you can see inside websites where
you have you know maybe a fax page with
the title of the the fact that when you
click it you can open up the full text
that belongs to that specific title so
for what to go back inside my code go
down to the bottom here and say well
after we have this one function inside
the a query that just opens and closes
to navigation we can say we have a
another selector and this time I want to
select the title of my information box
now right now I actually went and gave
it a class called info desk title so I'm
just going to go to copy this class name
go down inside my daiquiri and say
inside the selector I want to select a
class called info - title then
afterwards when I click on that I want
something to happen so I'm gonna go and
say inside the click parenthesis we have
a function that needs to run want me to
actually click this title here I'm gonna
go ahead and add another selector
parentheses double quotes and say we
want to select actual content of the
information box which right now have a
class as info - content
I'm gonna say class info - content and
then that we want to do something to it
so we can also go out and have the same
effect is up here of course we don't
want to have ten seconds we're just
gonna go ahead and save
to have that's actually good and say we
don't want to have any kind of seconds
in here just to sure you guys you don't
have to have any kind of parameters
inside the parentheses I'm gonna save it
open up my website clicked information
title and as you guys can see it then
closes and open second so this is how we
can add closing and opening effects
inside our website using jQuery and
again when it comes to this effect
called slide down slide up and slide
toggle we can add two different
parameters inside the parenthesis you
can add the seconds either by writing it
using a number or we can go and use the
string called fast or slow if you wanted
to and then the second parameter is
going to be some kind of callback
function or something that happens once
it's done loading the effects so we can
say we have a function fantasy's curly
brackets and they want to alert some
kind of misses when it's done and again
we're just going to say hi there so once
it's done sliding we're gonna go ahead
and get some kind of misses inside the
browser so I'm gonna refresh click it
and then we get the message so this is
how can add a sliding effect inside
jQuery I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
