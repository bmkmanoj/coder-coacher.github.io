a validating form using Ajax
and before we get into this episode I'd
like to argue about why we need to do it
the way we're doing it in this episode
compared to other ways I've seen people
do it on the Internet
so when it comes to creating a
validation form using something like
jQuery or Ajax or JavaScript it's very
important to think about safety when you
do it now if I were to just take some
kind of form like the one I have here
which basically just sends an email so
essentially this is a contact form if I
were to not fill in any kind of
information like I have here and just
click send email you want to get some
kind of error message now there's a
couple of ways you can do this either
using jQuery or a text or whatever
method we might decide to use but some
are better than others now the way I
decide to do in this episode is by
combining PSP with jQuery or JavaScript
because we want to validate a form we
need to do it using some kind of banking
language now the reason for this is that
if I were to take a look at this
for security reasons I can actually
inside my browser right click on any
kind of element inside a website inspect
it and then use the built-in developer
tool inside any kind of browser and
change some of the front-end code
directly inside the browser so I could
essentially go inside my head say here
we have my javascript code or geekery
code and change some of the information
so it's not safe to only use jQuery for
validation when you have a form okay so
it's very important to do some kind of
backing language to do this as well now
in this episode we're going to learn how
to create this form here and what we're
going to do is basically just learn how
to figure out if people like to type
something in if they didn't have an a
valid email if it were to just write
something that's not really a valid
email and just click send you guys can
see we now get this highlighted error
message that says this is not a valid
email address and if I were to actually
write something that's active valid like
so and actually send it then you guys
can see we get everything cleared and we
get a email has been sent
confirmation message now the validation
we're going to do in this episode is
going to be something you can
to anything that you might build using
any kind of form like if you want to
have a sign up or login form inside a
website or some other kind of contact
form you can do any kind of forms and do
this sort of validation with it so we're
going to learn how to do this using a
check so we don't have to refresh the
browser each time we want to do this
which is something that's very nice to
do maybe not using a contact form
producing for example a login system and
again it's the same concept so you can
take what we do in this episode and
apply it to any kind of form you might
have inside your website so what we're
going to do here is first of all I'm
going to go and ask you guys to download
the style kit in the description of this
video because as you guys can see that
access down the form already so we have
something that doesn't look like you
know complete technical so we just have
something that's a bit nice to look at
so once you have the styling and insert
inside your root folder your website
there's one more thing you guys need to
do now the second thing you guys need to
have which I just want to mention
because I see some people just jump
directly into this episode without
actually having seen the first day text
tutorials is that you guys need to have
a local server or an online server if
you want this to work because when you
use a 2xo PHP code you need to have your
website inside a server so we need to
have this known for this to work okay
so what we need to do to start with is
I'm going to go to open up a index file
so right now as you guys can see I have
my stylesheet here which again stood at
downloaded by now and inside my index
file I have very little code besides the
link to my stylesheet and the scripts
for my jQuery code which is online
somewhere then what we need to do down
here is we need to actually create the
contact form and then afterwards we're
going to go ahead and create the jQuery
code or the 8x code for it and then
we're going to create the PHP code so
inside the body tags here the first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go
and create a form tag because needs to
actually have a form in order to
actually submit something now inside the
form tag we're going to go and create an
input I'm going to go and insert a text
type inside the type attribute I'm going
to go ahead and give it a name I'm just
going to set this one to name and I'm
going to go and give it a placeholder
just so we have some text inside the
input before we actually write something
so I'm going to say full name then I'm
going to go and go down to the
next line just copy the input paste it
down and we still want to have some text
in here but I'm going to change the name
to email because you don't want to have
the same name and I'm going to go and
change the placeholder to e-mail like so
then the next thing we want to add here
is a very basic select and again I'm
just creating a couple of different
types of inputs and some text and text
areas so you guys can see we can
actually do this using Ajax together
with a bunch of different form inputs so
I'm just going to say they have a select
we have an option inside this option I'm
going to go ahead and say mail or I'm
going to copy this down and say female
like so and then we need to insert some
attributes inside the Select tag up here
so I'm going to go and say we had a name
which is set to gender then I'm going to
go inside my option tags say space value
and set them equal to the same we have
inside the option ship so I'm going to
go ahead and say male and female like so
the next thing we need to have is a text
area so I'm going to go down to the next
line I'm going to say we have a text
area and then inside the text area tag
I'm going to go and save have a name set
to methods I'm going to go ahead and say
we have a placeholder set to methods all
right your message here or something
just so the person actually knows what
you need to write inside the inputs then
after this we're going to go and go down
to the next line and we're going to go
and include a button inside the button
we can say send e-mail and then we're
going to go ahead and give the button a
type set to submit and then we're going
to go and give it a name set to submit
now what we're doing here is just
basically setting up a very basic HTML
form so you guys should know how to do
this by now so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go and go inside my form
tag at the end here and I'm going to go
and set an action the action is going to
be set to mail
dot PSP because when we want to send
this information to a document and
actually do something with it like
checking if something is wrong then we
want to do it inside a separate file
called mail the PSP then afterwards
we're going to set a method we're going
to set the method as a post method like
so and before we end up to form this X
we couldn't create some space underneath
the actual input so we're going to go to
include a break underneath each of them
like so like so and after the text area
like so so now we have the basic HTML
set up node to actually you know have a
basic form inside our website so words
go back inside the browser and if I were
to just load up the actual file we have
here look like this this is what we just
created inside on documents now right
now it's actually not doing anything
because it were to click you guys can
see we don't actually have any documents
called Melda PHP and it doesn't really
register any kind of error messages so
we need to do something to this form in
order for this to actually work so what
I'm going to do here is I'm going to go
and go back inside my index file and I
want to get this form ready in order to
actually do what we need to do with it
using HX now what I had in mind is if I
were to go back inside the demo which
looks like this is we want some kind of
message to pop up when we do actually
get something right or something wrong
so we're going to go ahead and insert
the container for this message so when
we do actually get some kind of message
we need to insert it inside a container
so we're going to go and create that
inside our form so if we were to go down
below our button down here and create a
very basic paragraph tag I'm going to go
and give this paragraph an ID and I'm
going to set this one to form - methods
so right now all we need to do is when
we do actually get some kind of error
message or success message so I'm going
to actually you know type something and
submit the form we want to insert the
message inside this empty paragraph down
here because right now we were to save
it go back inside the browser and
actually refresh the proper form you
guys can see we still have nothing
inside of you because right now we have
no text inside the paragraph so once we
get to the part where we need to take
the data we typed into all the inputs
and take it to user type something wrong
inside the input or if the
did I do it correctly we need to be able
to grab the data and see if the user
actually did it correctly and if they
didn't we need to do something to these
inputs in order to actually style them a
different way if the user were to do
something wrong so let's say I didn't
type in a proper email address then I
want to style this input that has the
email input and make it some kind of red
color to highlight that you know
something went wrong here so in order to
do this and axis down these inputs
individually we need to give each input
some kind of ID or class so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go inside
each input and I'm going to go ahead and
insert some kind of ID so I'm going to
say like so we want to say ID is equal
to mail - something so inside the first
one up here which is the full name we're
going to say it's called mail - name
inside the second one which is the email
I'm going to say mail - email and so on
and so on and so on so we're going to
say tender for the next one and the last
one down here which is the message we're
going to say methods like so and we also
need to include one down word says
submit down here so we need to say we
have an ID which is equal to mail -
submit like so so now we can actually
target all these inputs and select them
using jQuery or JavaScript so what we
need to do now is actually go up to the
top here and include some kind of
scripts that will actually get the data
and use Ajax to actually load in the
correct information depending on what
the user typed in so if I go right on
top of my head closing tag right after
everything else inside the head tag I'm
going to go to include my script tags
like so and I'm going to go ahead and
create a selector that six if we have
loaded everything else inside the
website using jQuery so I'm going to say
we have a document I'm going to say dot
ready parenthesis semicolon then we're
going to create a anonymous function
parentheses curly brackets and then
inside of here we connect to include the
code we need to use in order to check if
we click the submit button inside our
form and then afterwards what we need to
do with the data in order to see if the
use the data correctly
so I'm going to go ahead and create
another selector that selects our form
like so and again if you guys have
multiple forms inside your website you
should have some kind of unique ID for
the form so you can actually select the
proper form so afterwards here I'm going
to go and say dot submits so now we're
checking for a submit events which is
again just when we click the submit
button down there that has to typeset to
submit and I'm going to go and include
another anonymous function inside the
actual submit function we have here now
the first thing we need to do inside the
submit function is actually disable the
default action that will actually happen
once you have to click the submit button
because right now if I were to actually
click the submit button it's going to go
and run whatever code is up here
I want to disable that and do it using
jQuery so what I'm going to go and do is
I'm going to go and create a events
parameter inside the function I'm going
to go down to the next line and
reference to the same events and then so
you want to disable it so we're going to
go and say prevent default parentheses
so basically what this does is that it
goes in and says we take this current
submit and disable whatever is going to
happen based off the submit so we're
going to disable the action and the
method down here inside the form then
we're going to go to the next line and
actually get data from all the inputs so
I'm going to go and say we have a
variable which is named as name which is
equal to the input we have inside the
data we have inside the first input down
there so we're going to say we have a
selector where I'm going to go and
select the actual data from the input
you would do that by thing want to
select the ID that's down here called
mail - name run say test tag mail dad's
name and then afterwards you want to get
the active value by saying Val
parentheses then we just need to
copy/paste this a couple more times so
we have about five of them and then we
need to change the names in here so I'm
going to say the second was the email
like so the third one was the gender
the fourth one was the Messick's and
then the last one was to submit like so
so now we have the actual data selected
inside this event here then we can go to
the next line and actually use the HX
function we have inside jQuery and do
something with the data so I'm going to
go and say we have a selector and I want
to select whatever I need to insert the
new data inside of which in this case is
form - message which is the one we typed
down hit the bottom here and let's
actually go ahead and create a class
instead of an ID just to have it and
then go inside our selector pm say we
have a class called phone - message and
then we need to decide what kind of a to
X function want to use inside GAE curry
now there's a column to choose from and
the one I decided to use in this episode
is because it's easier is the load
function now we're going inside the load
function we don't need to have a couple
of parameters so the first one is going
to be the actual file that we want to
load once you do actually submit the
form and again that's going to be the
same file as you select down here inside
the action so I'm just going to copy it
paste it in and then we want to add the
second parameter which is going to be
the actual data and them to pass on
inside this document here the data that
we want to pass on is right up here
because we already selected it so I'm
going to go and say comment space curly
brackets then just to make sure it looks
nice I'm going to move down to the next
line and inside the curly brackets I
want to say we have the first piece of
data which is called name and again this
is the post method that is called name
which would be equal to the variable
created up your called name I'm going to
say comment next line and just paste it
in a couple more times
so again we have five of them make sure
you delete the last comma down here
because you don't want to have a comment
to the last one and then we're going to
go and change the names so just going to
place them in like this like so like so
and like so and again just to not
confuse you guys the first name here's
the actual post name when we pass on
information to the next document
and this information in the right side
is the active value we got from inside
the inputs okay now this is basically
all we need to do in this document so
let's execute and save the document and
next we need to create the actual
document called mail dot PHP which we
need to actually load when we click the
submit button so if I were to go inside
a new document and save it inside a root
folder as mail dot JSP now the first
thing I'm going to write inside the mail
the PHP file is going to be a couple of
PSP opening and closing tags in order
for the browser to know that we're
actually going to write PHP code now
this is very similar to when we write
script tags using JavaScript or jQuery
in order for the browser to know that
this is actually jQuery or JavaScript
code inside PHP text the first thing I'm
going to do is I want to check if we
actually clicked the button inside our
index file and the way we do that is by
creating a is set function inside the if
statement and then checking if we have a
post method called submit now I just
want to mention again the reason we're
doing all this error handling inside the
PHP file I'm not using JavaScript or
jQuery is because it's much more safe if
you want to make sure that the user
cannot go inside the browser and just
manipulate the front end code and get
around the error handlers so we need to
make sure we do this inside a PHP file
okay so after we check if we did
actually click the submit button the
next thing we need to do is actually get
the rest of the actual post methods so
we're going to go and say we have a
variable called name I'm going to set it
equal to dollar sign underscore post
brackets and then we want to get the
post method called name now the post
method here that we got called name is
not something we got from our form
inside the front page so if I were to go
down to the form you guys consider we
have the post method down here which
actually sensed information but because
inside the jQuery code we prevented it
from exit during that and instead
created our own variables down here
using JavaScript we managed to send in
the
post method using javascript instead of
HTML so just to make sure you guys
actually know that the post method we're
getting right now inside the file is
from these variables we have inside our
JavaScript code
okay so we were to go back inside middle
of PHP we're going to go and copy what
we have here four more times or just
three more times because you don't need
to get to submit up here and I'm going
to go and change the names again from
name to email then we're going to get
gender and then the methods like so
underneath the actual post method C I'm
going to go and set two more variables
which is going to be the ones that
actually check if we had some kind of
error message so right now we want to
have the first variable called error MT
which is basically going to check if we
have any kind of empty fields inside our
form so I'm going to set this one to
false as a default then I'm going to
copy and paste it and say we want to
have a second error handler that text if
we have some kind of wrong email address
you know something that is not a real
email address so I'm going to say email
and that should also be equal to false
and then afterwards we need to actually
do the error handlers that goes in and
checks if we have some kind of error
message such as if there was any kind of
empty field so if we were to write an if
statement down here that says if empty
which is a PHP function that checks if
something is not existing I want to
check if we do actually have this
variable up here existing because if I
didn't type any kind name inside my form
then this variable here is going to be
completely empty and not have any kind
of data inside of it so if this one is
empty I want to get some kind of error
message down here that says for example
echo which is the PSP version of writing
text inside the browser then I want to
say we have a span tag in HTML and then
I want to say fill in all fields then I
want to close the span tag which again
this is basic HTML like so and just to
make sure we style this correctly
because this is essentially an error
message I want this to be read inside my
style see that did actually went ahead
and said that any kind of styling that
had the style as
form error to be read so I'm going to
include this class inside my spandex
here's I'm going to going to say we have
a class equal to single quotes form -
error like so then afterwards what we
need to do here is actually change the
error MT variable up here to true
because right now we did have an error
message so this one needs to be changed
to true now we don't just want to check
on MC name we also want to check for for
example an empty email or an empty
message because we don't want to send an
email if everything is empty so inside
the if statements parameters we check
for an empty name I also want to check
for an empty email so we're going to say
we have these vertical lines which is
the or statement inside PHP and I want
to check if you have an empty email like
so and then the last one is going to be
FM and empty methods like so then after
we check this we need to also check if
the user did not type a correct email
address you know some kind of email
address which is a wrong format so what
we need to do is go down to the next
line and write an else if statement and
then inside the condition down here I'm
going to say we have a PHP function
called filter underscore by presidential
variable parenthesis and then inside
this function I'm going to go and say we
have an email variable which is up here
which is the actual email we got from
the input and then say comment filter
and capitalize letters on the school
validate on the school email which is a
building function inside PHP that
actually checks if this email was a
proper email format inside you know PSP
and then if it is the proper email
format it's going to go ahead and do
whatever is inside the else if statement
down here now what I want to do is
instead check if it's not a proper
format and I do that by writing an
exclamation mark right before the actual
function so now if the email is not a
proper format is going to go ahead and
do what's inside the curly brackets here
so I'm going to go out an echo
or could just copy what we have up here
because of mighties here like so I want
to echo some kind of error message that
says write a valid email address like so
and after we did this I want to go and
create an else statement because if none
of these are actually true then I want
to actually say that you know everything
was correct and I want to get a success
message instead so inside the else
statement I'm going to go ahead and
again just paste in the echo and I want
to change the classroom form error to
form success because inside must I'll
see that you have a styling for it when
it turns to text green inside what we
have here so now fill in all fields
would be green inside the form if we
type everything in correctly okay so
this is basically all we need to do with
the PHP code what we could actually do
one more thing which is if we did not
submit anything we could also have an
error message for that so cystoscope
below the last curly bracket we have
inside the PHP file and Savelle
statement that says echo there was an
error in case this submitter was not
caught or something so now what we need
to do is once we're done with the PHP
code here write in some kind of script
that actually that's the jQuery no if
there was any kind of error messages
because right now we have some error
messages up here that is going to be
either true or false
and in case one of them are true we want
to show to you that something went wrong
inside the form so inside this document
here at the bottom below the PHP tags
I'm going to go and create a script tag
now can actually see we've got to do one
more thing up here which was include the
actual error MT inside the else if
statement down here because we need to
change not the error empty but the error
email to true in case this one down here
actually went through so inside the
script tags we need to actually get
these error email and error empty and
see if they were true or false
at the end description
so inside the script tags I'm going to
go and say we have a variable which I'm
going to call air on Mt
it's going to be equal to a string and
I'm going to do the same thing with era
email I'm going to say we have para
email and inside these strings here
connect include some PHP code so I can
actually talk about my PHP tags inside
the string just like we did with HTML
inside the PHP code and say we have a
PHP code I want to echo whatever we have
inside this variable up here called
error MT so we're going to say we have
error empty echo it and close the PHP
tags at the end here which means the
right now the JavaScript variable error
empty is going to be equal to the PHP
variable which is error empty go ahead
and copy this paste it below here and
say want to check for error email inside
the second one so now we have some
JavaScript variables which is equal to
the PHP variables from up here okay so
now the next thing we need to do is we
need to actually check if one of these
were actually true meaning that there is
an error inside our script then we want
to show the error message inside the
front page so what I'm going to do at
the bottom here is I'm going to create
an if statement inside JavaScript and
say if error MT which is the variable we
have up here is equal to true like so
then I want to do something inside the
curly brackets now what I want to do
here is I want to have a selector and I
want to select any kind of inputs inside
my front page the bottom here that needs
to do something when there's any kind of
empty inputs so for were to actually go
back in here I want to say I want to
select an ID called male gasps name and
then do something to it so I'm going to
say dot add class which is AG a career
function we have that actually adds the
class from inside our style sheet so I'm
going to go and add a class called input
error so I'm going to say parentheses
input
era which again if we were to go inside
this downside you guys consider down
here I have a styling called input error
which basically just gives our input a
box shadow of some kind of red color so
we can see some kind of error message so
what I want to do as well is I don't
just want to check for one into input I
want to check it all of them if there
was one of them that was just empty so
I'm going to say after the mail dad's
name I want to say comment ID mail gas
email which was the second input we had
comment I want to check for the third
one which was the gender so I'm going to
say mail - gender well actually in this
case the gender cannot be empty because
it were to go back inside my example
here we need to have some kind of data
either male or female so maybe we should
just focus on the first second and the
third one inside this error message here
so I'm going to go and say we have a not
male gender but male methods and then I
want to add the class called input error
which basically turns everything red so
after we did this we can actually go
ahead and check if we also had an error
inside our email so we were to go down
to the next line I can create a gift
statement which says error mail inside
the condition up here I'm going to say
if it's equal to true then I want to do
whatever is inside the curly brackets
which in this case is going to be kind
of the same thing here so I'm just going
to copy it paste it in and I only want
to have this error message inside the
email inputs I'm just going to delete
the other ones we have in here so I'm
just going to delete them like so so now
only going to get the error message
inside the email so after we did this we
also need to check if we had any kind of
success so were to go down to the next
line here and say we haven't if
statement that checks is tarah
empty was equal to false meaning that
there was no errors inside you know he
actually typed in all the inputs then I
want to do something else instead now I
also want to check if the error mail is
equal to false so I'm going to go and
paste that in here and say false then I
want to do something inside the curly
Brackins now in this case I'm actually
going to go ahead and remove all the
values from inside the input inside my
website because if were to go back
inside the demo that I created before
this episode if I were to type something
and create a valid email address so I'm
just going to say at gmail.com write
something down here you guys can see
wants to do actually click the send
button everything else inside the inputs
gets deleted and I want to do that
inside my JavaScript code here so I'm
going to go and go inside my if
statement and create a selector and say
I want to well basically select
everything from inside my if statement
appears I'm just going to go to copy to
select the year and I want to say that
there's a new value called Val
parentheses which is equal to nothing so
I'm just going to include a couple of
double quotes in here and just write
nothing inside of it so right now it's
going to be equal to nothing okay now
before we can actually finish out there
so there's one more thing we need to do
inside the JavaScript code here because
right now forward to actually get
something wrong so were to just type
something and leave one empty click in
then you guys can see we have a bunch of
styling supply to each of these input
fields inside the form now when I want
to click the input again so if I were to
actually fill this in correctly like so
and actually send it then you guys can
see all the stylings you know all the
red colors disappeared and right now
inside our input which is up here the
one you just saw was the demo if I were
to do the same thing all the red colors
even though I did everything correctly
the second time would still be inside
the form so need to get rid of all the
talents we applied inside our code here
when we said add class input error so we
need to remove these input errors again
if I did actually use the phone
correctly the second time so right
before everything else inside the script
tags I'm going to go ahead and say we
have a selector and I'm going to go and
select every single input from inside
the form so I'm actually just going to
pay so we have down here again and
delete what is this wrote up here like
so and also select the gender just to
make sure we have it selected so I'm
going to say hashtag male - gender and
then I'm going to go and write a theory
function called removed
class EXO parentheses semi-colon and I
want to remove the class called input -
error from all these different inputs in
here so now that all can be emptied and
then it's going to go and check again if
you should include these starlings down
here again so now that we have this
that's actually going to check out what
we have inside our website I'm going to
go and refresh and try and click send
email before anything else as you guys
can see we have a error message that
says we need to fill in all fields and
for two times something without having a
proper email address you guys can see
now gets write a valid email address oh
we didn't actually get any kind of read
styling series we need to check out why
that is ah okay we wrote error mail
inside our if statement we need to write
error email like so the text to go back
and check it again who were to refresh
write something and now I guess can see
we actually get the error message inside
the email field now before I end up this
episode let me access sir guys one more
thing which is something I know you guys
will ask me about if I don't show it now
inside our front page inside the forum
right now we actually have an action and
a method said and inside the jQuery code
up here we did actually decide to
prevent it from exit running you know to
action in the method so the question is
can actually delete these and still have
this working inside my website yes you
can so were to go back inside the
website refresh you guys can see that it
will actually still run the actual you
know PSP file and get some kind of
result out from it now why should you
have this inside your code then well
let's say I'm a guy who's up to no good
I'm going to your website and looking at
your form inside the developer tool and
seeing there's an action and a method
then it might lead suspicion away from
the fact that you're using JavaScript or
jQuery to actually do this inside the
forum since JavaScript and jQuery is
like I said not a safe as using PHP code
so if you were to actually include this
and here even though we're not using it
it's still a good idea so happens now
this is one of ways you can create
validation inside a form and before we
end off the episode
completely in case you guys are
interested I'd like to go through what
we did here just to make sure that you
guys didn't get confused along the way
about which specifically inside the code
does what so just to kind of go over the
thing again you know not actually
writing it but just going over the code
we have here inside the front page we
have a form inside the form you have two
inputs of the data they want to do
something with inside our website now
typically when you have a form you want
to do something with data you use PHP
code to actually do this so what we did
here was using JavaScript or jQuery is
we went ahead and told it to not run the
actual HTML function here or the method
and action that passes on the data to
some kind of document instead we do this
using JavaScript bakery up here which
takes the data and passes it on using
Ajax which is down here meaning that we
load the PSP document which is actually
handling the data without having to
repress the process so we're actually
loading the PHP document without
actually loading it so it's just running
in the background using HX so inside the
PHP document we actually run the error
antlers which checks if everything was
filled in correctly or if there was some
kind of error message and then at the NT
we simply check the data and see if
there was any kind of error message then
we want to pass on the visual change for
the user inside the browser using Java
scripts or jQuery which again leads me
to answer another question in case you
guys might ask it no you should not only
use to a descriptive jQuery in order to
validate forms inside a website you need
to do it using something like PHP as
well otherwise people can bypass your
validation or your error handlers inside
your phone ok so after we do this we can
then do a visual change which is what we
see inside the browser using you know
colors or something which lets out use a
note from a usability point of view that
this is not working
okay so again JavaScript and jQuery form
validation is only for usability point
of view if you want to actually have any
kind of security you need to use
something like PHP
hope you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys
