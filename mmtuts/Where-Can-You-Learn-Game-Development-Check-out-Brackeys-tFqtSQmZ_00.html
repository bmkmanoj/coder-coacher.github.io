another video gonna talk about game
development now a lot of you people have
been asking me for quite a while now
will there be any kind of tutorials
regarding game development now most of
my professional background is in web
development and video production so
currently I have no plans regarding you
know creating tutorials when it comes to
creating video games because it's not
really a field I'd study or work in so
what I'm gonna go and do instead is I'm
gonna refer you guys to another youtuber
inside YouTube that I learned from
myself when it comes to you know I do
actually do a bit of game development in
my spare time but like I said it's not
really at a professional level so this
guy is really easy to understand inside
his channel when it teaches all the
fundamentals when it comes to game
development inside unity so if you guys
interested in learning how to create
games you can go and check out his
channel
I do believe unity is one of the only
ones out there that actually allow for
you to create games using JavaScript so
I'm just gonna go in to show you guys
his channel his name is Brad keys and he
has a bunch of lessons in here regarding
how to I to create you know 2d games 3d
games and c-sharp even if you want to
learn how to code c-sharp there's a
bunch of lessons in here you guys can
check out the reason I know this guy is
because I in the past was actually
interested in learning how to make games
and you know based on all the YouTube
channels I found on YouTube this was the
guy I could actually understand when he
taught how to create video games so I
hope you guys will check out his channel
if you're interested in how to create
games using you know unity or c-sharp
since I don't really have any plans to
do any kind of game development at the
moment in the future so my focus is
going to stay on web development app
development you know video production
animation you notice all the things that
belongs under multimedia design which
you could argue is also video games but
video games specifically it's not
something that I have you know done
anything in in the past at least when it
comes to a professional point of view so
I'm gonna leave a link to his channel in
the description and you guys can go and
check him out hope you guys enjoyed and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
