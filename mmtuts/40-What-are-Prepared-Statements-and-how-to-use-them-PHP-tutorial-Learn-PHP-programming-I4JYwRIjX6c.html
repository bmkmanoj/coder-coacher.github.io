protect our database when a user goes to
your website and inserts data directly
from your website into the database
and the reason we need to do this is
because it's actually possible for
people to go to a website and when you
allow for them to actually write
something themselves that then gets them
to the database is that we allow for
people to actually write code which will
then get read by the database and we
actually allow for people to mess up the
database so the user could potentially
go into a database and delete or change
or see things that they shouldn't see
inside the database so we need to make
sure we protect the database inside our
website from what's called SQL injection
which is when people do actually go into
your website and write something inside
an input like inside a form and send
code inside your database now in the
previous episode we talked about how to
protect the database by using MySQL I
which is what we did right here by using
the my SQL Lite function inside PHP now
there's a much better way we can do this
which is not using masks you live by
using something called prepared
statements now the idea behind prepared
statements is that when we have some
kind of SQL statement like the one we
have down here we can actually go in and
say well we don't know what the data
tags are going to be yet which means
we're going to go ahead and add
placeholders instead of the actual
variables down here we then send the SQL
code to the database to actually parse
it which means we actually going to run
the code inside the database and then
afterwards later on we send the actual
data to the database and replace the
placeholders inside our SQL statements
and because when we do actually send the
data later on we use a different
protocol inside the database the
database won't actually read the
placeholders as code inside the database
just going to see it as characters now
today prepared statements is actually
seen as the preferred method we need to
actually connect to a database and
either need to see stuff or insert stuff
into the database so once you do exist
are making website the new tags to be
uploaded online then it's recommended
that you do actually use prepared
statements okay now what we're going to
go and do in this episode is first of
all I'm going to go and show you guys
how to use prepared statements when it
comes to selecting data inside the
database and then afterwards I'm going
to show you guys how to do it when we
want to insert data inside the database
so a couple episodes ago we talked about
how to select data directly from the
website which I believe was the first
so what we did actually do anything
inside the actual website that had
anything to do with the database so if
you guys want the lesson files from that
previous episode I recommend you guys go
back a couple episodes to where we do
actually learn how to select data
directly from the website and down the
lesson file so you guys can actually
follow this lesson if you guys want to
so this is the found that we had a
couple episodes ago where we just simply
insert the index file when then select
data and spin it out inside the website
and what we did here is we just selected
everything from inside the users table
and spin out the user name of every
single user so what I'm going to go and
do is I'm going to go ahead and say we
want to select a specific user inside
the database what we're going to do
first here is we're going to go and say
we have a select statement that makes
everything from users where user
underscore UID is equal to a specific
name so right now inside my database if
we were to take a look at it you guys
can see the right now I have just one
user inside the database called admin
now I want to select admin inside my
website so what we could do here is
inside this leg statement say we want to
select a user ID called single quotes
admin so we'll just save this and then
refresh the browser you guys should see
that we get admin ok so what I want to
do is I want to say that well we want to
include a placeholder instead of the
actual name of use we want to select
from the database so I'm going to go and
say question mark and then afterwards
I'm just going to go and delete
everything we have in here except for
the while loop down inside our check
down here I'm just going to delete
everything except for a while loop and
then we're going to go and replace all
this code with prepared statements
instead of using MySQL I which is what
we used before okay so underneath the
SQL statement and we can actually go and
write a comment to test we know exactly
what's going on I'm going to go ahead
and say that we just created a template
which will then use later on when we do
actually have the actual data that it
needs to insert instead of the
placeholder so I'm going to say we just
created a template and then after we
create the template we need to actually
create the prepared statement so what
we're going to do is we're going to say
we have a comment that says create a
prepared
statements which I'm going to go ahead
and say is the variable called as TMT
which stands for statements I'm going to
set it equal to a PHP function called my
sqli underscore as TMT underscore init
which stands for initialize so basically
what we're starting up here is a
prepared statement now right now inside
this prepared statement here we need to
tell it which connection want to use to
actually do this inside the database so
what we do actually have is inside our
DB H file we have a connection to the
database called variable con so I'm
going to go to say we want to use this
connection inside our statement down
here so I'm going to go and paste it
inside as a parameter inside the
function so after creating the prepared
statement I'm going to go underneath
here and now we need to actually prepare
the prepared statement using the SQL
statement we have up here the template
so I'm going to go and say we want to
prepare the prepared statements and we
do that using another PHP function
called MySQL eye on the score is TMT
underscore prepare now before we
actually continue we can actually go
ahead and create a check here the checks
if this prepares tape and can actually
work using the SQL statement we have up
here using the template that we created
beforehand so what I can do here is I
can actually go and say we have an if
statement and inside the condition of
the if statement I'm going to insert my
function down here called
MySQL i underscore statement underscore
prepare insert inside of here and then
inside the parameters of this function I
can actually go out and insert the
statement they've created previously so
I'm going to insert as the first
parameter and then the second parameter
is going to be the actual SQL template
that we created up here so I'm going to
paste it in as parameter number two so
now we just did here is we went ahead
and said okay if this function here does
actually succeed is to go ahead and run
the code inside the if statement now
when it comes to PHP code we want to
always check for failure before we take
the success so what I'm going to go and
do is I'm going to go and insert a
exclamation mark right before the
function
which now means that instead of checking
if it succeeds we now check if it failed
so if this does actually fail we should
write some kind of message inside the if
statement so could actually echo some
kind of string that says SQL statements
fails just so we know what actually
happened if we were to actually fail
using this SQL statement okay so
afterwards you want to say well we have
an if statement then else if this axis
succeeded then we want to run the code
inside the else statements so now we did
so voice we did like to create the
template we did actually create a
prepared statement using the connection
to the database and then afterward we
prepared the prepared statement using
the template so what we want to do now
is you want to actually bind the
parameters want to replace with the
placeholders inside the template and we
do that by going inside the else
statement you create a comment called
bind parameters to the placeholders for
holders since you only have one in here
and underneath that we're going to go
and create a PHP function called my sqli
underscore s TMT underscore binds
underscore parent which stands for
parameters parentheses semicolon and
inside the parentheses we need to have a
couple of different parameters now the
first one is going to be the active
statement that we prepared up here
called s TM T so we're going to go and
say we have variable as TM T comma space
then the second parameter is going to be
an indicator for the placeholder we
insert inside the template up here so
right now we have a question mark
instead of the actual data so what I'm
going to do is inside us the second time
so I'm going to say double quotes and
then I'm going to go and write s which
means the right now we only have one
placeholder inside the statement if it
were to have a second placeholders such
as if it were to also check if user
underscore first which is the first name
was equal to question mark and again we
will also add something like and in
between here then right now would
actually take for two different factors
inside our database would take for a
user name and the first name so right
now we do have two different place
lose in that case we would actually add
a second as inside the double quotes now
in this episode we're not going to do
that so I'm just going to go and delete
what I just wrote to you but just assure
guys who would accidie tat
now the third parameter inside this
function is going to be the actual data
they want to insert instead of the
placeholder up here now we haven't
actually created that data yet because
in some cases like inside a typical
website we could actually allow for
people to write something then search
for it inside the database but because
right now we just want to select some
kind of user using some kind of name I'm
going to create a variable at the very
top here which I'm going to call data
just to give you some kind of name I'm
going to set it equal to double quotes
which is a string called admin so right
now data is equal to Edmund which is the
name you want to search for inside the
database or a user name they want to
search for so I'm going to set this s
down here which right now represents the
place hole inside the SQL statement I'm
going to say I want to replace it with
this variable data created up here by
saying that the third parameter is going
to be variable data now if we were to
have two different placeholders and we
did I except the second as the way we do
this is we would actually create a
fourth parameter which would then be
equal to whatever variable we created
for the second parameter or the second
place holder inside the statement here
okay
but right now because we just have one
I'm just going to include one inside the
parameters down here so now we did this
we can actually execute the actual
statement inside our database so
essentially what we're actually doing
here is we're saying that we have this
SQL statement we then run it inside the
database and after it's been passed
inside the database we then include the
actual data that needs to be used
instead of the placeholders so
underneath that we're going to go and
say is that we want to actually run this
SQL statement but using the parameters
we gave it down here and the way we're
going to do that is first of all that's
actually going to create a comment that
says run parameters inside database then
we're going to go and say we have a PHP
function called my SQL i underscore s TM
t underscore execute
parentheses and then inside the
parentheses we just need to include the
statement that we just prepared like so
which means that right now we actually
ran this line of code which had all the
data inside we need to replace inside
the placeholders inside the database now
after doing this we still need to get
the actual data it's on an Ethier what
we're going to go and say is we want to
take the results from the executors
statement and insert them inside a
variable so right now I want to say we
have a variable called result which is
equal to a PHP function called my sqli
underscore s TM t underscore get
underscore the source parentheses
semicolon then inside the parentheses we
need to actually get the data from
inside the statement which is prepared
and then after we do this we can
actually take the while loop that we
have down here and just simply put it
inside our else statement like so so
right now we just did the exact same
thing as we did in the previous episode
we just went in and select the data but
instead we did it using prepared
statements which is much safer to use
inside a website so just to go and check
what we did in here for what you refresh
the browser you guys can see you still
get admin inside a browser now what x go
back inside the code and so you want to
search for not admin but John because
you don't have that inside database you
guys will notice that we don't get any
kind of results so what we want to do
now is now we learn how to actually
select data from inside the database now
we want to actually insert data inside
the database so in order to do this I'm
going to go and use the lesson material
from the previous episode where we
learned how to insert data inside the
database which is right after depth so
we learned how to select data so if you
guys are interested you can just go and
go back to that episode and download the
lesson files if you want to follow this
lesson here now when it comes to
inserting data inside a database using
prepared statements it's very much the
same as we did previously when we wanted
to use prepare statements in order to
select data from inside the database so
down inside our insert statement down
here inside SQL variable I'm going to go
and go inside my values in
place the first last email you ID and
password and I'm going to replace these
with a question mark which means the
right now we actually created
placeholders which we're then going to
give the SQL statement later on when we
like to create a prepared statement so
I'm going to go and delete my Maskull I
quarry down here because you don't
actually need it and then instead I'm
going to go and create a prepared
statement just like we did previously so
I'm going to say we have a variable as
CMT which is equal to MySQL I underscore
as TNT on the score in its parentheses
and I'm going to do this using the
connection to the database which again
is variable con which I created inside a
separate document I'm going to insert it
inside my parameter and then underneath
here I'm going to go ahead and prepare
this prepared statement using this SQL
code up here so we're going to go ahead
and do a check just like we did
previously where we take for failure
first so we're going to take some basic
mark and then we're going to use a
function called my sqli underscore as TM
t underscore prepare parentheses and
inside the parentheses it's actually
right there correctly like so then
inside parentheses we need to include
first of all the statement up here and
then the second parameter is going to be
the SQL statement now if we do actually
get an error message because it can
actually run this SQL statement at the
database then it's going to go and run a
piece of code that says echo a string
called SQL error or something you can
just go and write whatever you want in
here it's just for us to know if there
was some kind of error so after the if
statement going to say we have 10 our
statements and inside the else statement
want to actually bind the parameters to
the placeholders inside the interest
statement just like we did in the
previous part so what we need to do here
is we need to create the function called
my sqli on the score as TMT underscore
bind underscore param because you need
to bind the parameters to the actual
statements so inside the function
parameters we're going to say want to
use this
Eggman's they were created up here and
then the second parameter is going to be
the indicator of how many parameters we
want to bind to the template we created
up here which in this case it's going to
be one two three four five because
they're five different placeholders
inside the SQL statement so I'm going to
say SS s SS which is five SS then
afterwards we're going to say comma
space and then we to insert the actual
variables that we want to replace with
the placeholders inside the SQL
statement so the first one is going to
be variable first I'm going to say
variable first comma then variable last
comma and then we just paste in the rest
of them which is email comma you ID
comma and a password like so so now that
we told the statement what the
parameters should be inside the
placeholders
let's likes going to run the code inside
the database so we can actually use the
function called my sqli underscore test
emt underscore execute parentheses colon
and then inside the parentheses we're
going to say we have variable statements
we're going to save it and then try to
run it inside our browser so I'm going
to go and refresh and type in something
inside the inputs I'm going to say John
Doe email is going to be John at
gmail.com then I'm going to go and give
him a username called John 23 and his
password is going to be test 1 2 3 I'm
going to say sign up and then I'm going
to go inside my database refresh it and
now you guys can see we get John Doe
inside the database so this is how we
can actually use prepared statements
inside a website when we want to either
select or insert data inside a database
and it's the exact same method if you
were to instead of inserting data if you
want to change data or use any of the
other SQL statements we have inside SQL
you know tags interact with the database
now one thing I want to mention before
we end up this episode is that it's very
important that you guys understand that
we used functions in PHP meant for
procedural programming in
PSP so if you were to use
object-oriented programming you don't
use the exact same functions as we did
inside this episode and again if you
guys confused about what procedural
programming and object-oriented
programming is don't worry too much
about it if you want to learn
object-oriented programming and do have
a course on it if you guys want to check
it out but the important thing is that
you guys just need to know that we've
been using procedural programming in
this course here so if you guys enjoyed
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
