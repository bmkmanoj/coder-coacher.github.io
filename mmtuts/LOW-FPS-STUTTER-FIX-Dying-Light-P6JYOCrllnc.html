another episode going to take a look at
how to fix a game called dying light now
the problem with this game is that it
has just been released and the
developers are probably still working on
a patch for the game but right now
people experiencing a lot of issues
regarding the framerate being really low
or stuttering inside the game so what
we're going to do in this episode is
first of all I'm going to tell you guys
what is causing the stuttering and a low
framerate and then I'm going to tell you
guys how to fix it at least until the
developers get some sort of patch up and
running what we don't want you know we
don't need to do this fix anymore so the
issue with the game is that right now
the game is running on your CPU of
course because you have a CPU in your
computer I have a four core CPU
processor inside my computer right now
the game is running all of its power and
one of the cores inside my CPU meaning
that one of the course is running game
at 100% doing this will cause all the
stuttering and the framerate being low
so what do you guys need to do to fix
this is first of all let me just show
you guys what is wrong with the game if
I do open the game up here you'll see
that when I'm running and looking around
there's a bit of stuttering going on
which is just really annoying when
you're playing the game like you can
actually see if I'm just looking you can
see the zombies and the stuff blowing in
the wind is like freezing and then
unfreezing constantly and it is just
super annoying my framework right now is
around 30 again it varies depending on
where you look inside the game but it's
just like super low when I do this thing
to fix it that I'm about to tell you
guys my framework is running at around
60 to 80 and there's no stuttering going
on what you need to do is you need to
open up the game like I have right here
and then you need to you know all tap
out of the game go into your task
manager and I'm about to show you guys
in a second I'm gonna I'm going to
switch out to task manager now and then
I'm going to show you guys what to do
from there
okay so now we're inside the task
manager and as you guys can see the game
is still running in the background now
some of you guys might already be
thinking that oh you just want us to
change the priority of the game you know
that didn't fix anything but that's not
what we're doing this episode okay we're
going into processes then you're going
to right-click on
dying light game that exe and know
you're not going to change the priority
you're going to go down to set affinity
it's going to open up a window and
you're going to go ahead and uncheck all
processors then you're going to check it
back on you're going to click OK ok
after this you're going to close it down
and you're going to go back into the
game and I'm just going to jump into the
game now ok so now we are inside the
game again and that's actually one last
thing we need to change them to fix the
framerate I want you guys to go into
options we're going to go down to video
and inside here you can actually turn
the settings all the way up because
believe it or not there's only like five
frames per difference for like the
lowest settings and the highest settings
since at this game it's kind of weird
but it's actually true one thing you do
need to pay attention to is not to have
vertical synchronization on you're going
to turn it off then you're going to go
down to view distance and turn it all
the way down now you might be thinking
that this is going to make the game look
pretty ugly but it is not it's there's
no visible difference from what I can
tell well there's a little bit of
difference but it's not a lot of
difference between you know turning it
up to medium and turning it all the way
down this one is going to really
increase your frame rate okay you're
going to click OK then you're going to
go into your game settings you're going
to go down to field of view now this one
as you guys can see right now it's set
to 80 horizontal if you turn this one up
you're going to get lower frame rates
because for obvious reasons there's
gonna be more stuff on the screen at
once so I wouldn't recommend getting
this one
you know much higher than 80 frames per
like an 80 in horizontal view because it
will really take away your frame rate
okay after you've done this and you've
gone into you know setting the affinity
of the game I believe was called the
affinity inside the task manager if I go
back into the game
I have absolutely no stuttering going on
anymore this was like a really demanding
area because of the flames and because
you know it's about to sunset and like
this is a really demanding area and I
have absolutely no stuttering going on
anymore my frame rates are like 50 right
now
last time I was recording was really low
now it's 50 suddenly this is an amazing
fix that I found online after hours of
googling you know this was the thing
that fixed it for me I hope this one is
going to fix it for you guys if this
helped you guys out please do leave a
like to sort of get this video you know
out there and for people to see it
because this is a really really awesome
game if you like zombie survival
open-world games this game is just
amazing and it's really sad to see to
some people buy it and it's just not
working for them so please do leave a
thumbs up so we can get this video out
there for people to see and I'll see you
guys later maybe if you guys are
subscribers I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
