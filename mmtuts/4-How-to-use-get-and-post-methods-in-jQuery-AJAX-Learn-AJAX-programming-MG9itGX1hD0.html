load function inside thx
and in this episode we're going to learn
about the gate function and the post
function so when it comes to getting
data from a server using Ajax we have a
couple of different functions we can use
know to do something very specific so in
the last episodes we talked about the
load function which basically takes data
from a server and inserts it inside your
website somewhere like inside a dip box
or something now when it comes to the
get and post functions we can do
something different so let's say I want
to just get data from a server without
actually inserting it inside my website
I can use the get function inside HX to
do so now if I wanted to I could also
take the data and insert it inside my
website if I wanted to but the get
function inside HX allow us to do more
things without data other than just
inserting it inside the website and I'm
going to go to serve as an example of
this in just a second now the second
function we have is something called a
post function and this one basically
allow for uses inside the website to
interact with the website and do
something using HX to give you guys an
example of this so you guys can actually
understand what I mean let's say we have
a place where you can create a user
account inside the website where we can
allow you to type in a username and a
password if I want to notify the user
that a certain username has already been
taken before he click submits we can do
it using HX or another example could be
if I wanted to let him type a password
for this user
I can notify him if the password is
strong enough to be accepted as a legit
password inside the web site so we can
do a bunch of things using to get post
functions inside HX so now it's actually
going to do an example using the get
function inside HX so if we were to go
inside my website here you guys can see
right now I have a button that says
click me to get data and also have a
paragraph that has an ID set to test so
what I want to do here is using the
script up here tell my website to fetch
some data and insert it inside this
paragraph down here when I click this
button here and we're going to do that
using a get function so the first thing
I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead
and create the actual document or the
data that
want to get from somewhere so I'm going
to go and create a new document I'm
going to save it inside my server where
have my front page I'm going to save
this one as something like test dot txt
and again doesn't have to be a text
document it can be all sorts of
documents such as HTML files JavaScript
files PHP files all I could do here a
text document so you can have all sorts
of documents with data inside of it that
we can get using the get method so I'm
going to go and save this one in some a
root folder and I'm going to go and type
some kind of text in here so I'm going
to say it is is some random data going
to save it then I'm going to go back
inside my index file and inside my
script tags I'm going to go ahead and
start out by saying that we want to wait
with actually loading the take recode
till after everything else inside the
website has loaded so I'm going to say
we have a selector and inside the
selector we want to write documents then
after want to say dot ready parentheses
semicolon then inside the parentheses
we're going to save function parenthesis
curly brackets and then inside the curly
brackets would just need to include the
jQuery code so the first code I'm going
to include here is a selector so I'm
going to go and select the active button
down there and say once we do actually
click it something needs to have them
inside the website so I'm going to say
we have a button dot click parenthesis
semicolon and inside the parentheses I'm
going to say we have a function that
needs to run when we do actually click
the button and then inside the curly
brackets you want to use the get
function inside a checks so we want to
say we have a dollar sign Docs gets
parentheses and then inside the
parentheses we have two different
parameters one is being the actual
document want to load in the data from
which right now we call test the txt so
we're going to go and say we have text
dot txt inside a pair of double quotes
or single quotes then afterwards we're
going to say comma space and then we can
add a second parameter now this one is
actually optional but since we do
actually need to use in most cases we're
going to go and use in this episode so
the second parameter in here actually
returns two
data from text to txt and also tells us
the status of the actual get method so
let's say I want to both have the data
and the status I can say function
parentheses curly brackets because we
have two pieces of data in here we have
the actual data and the status so I can
actually include the data inside my
function as a parameter comment and say
we also want to have the status like so
and then inside the function down here
we can actually tell it what to do with
the data we got from text to txt so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to tell it
to insert the data inside our text
paragraph down here called ID test so
I'm going to say we have a selector
parentheses then I'm going to go and say
double quotes has tag test because I
want to select the test down there and
then I want to insert some kind of HTML
so I'm going to say we have they create
the ML function which basically just
insert HTML inside whatever we chose
inside the selector and inside the HTML
parentheses I'm going to go ahead and
write data so right now we're just
getting the data variable up here which
is the actual data we get from the
actual get request and insert it inside
a paragraph down here now if I want to
we don't have to use this status up here
but if I want to I can actually go ahead
and notify myself if this actually
worked or not
so if I wanted to I could actually go
down and say we want to alert
parentheses semi-colon the actual status
of this get request so we can actually
let ourselves know if this axis
succeeded or failed
now before we check if this actually
works I'm going to go and correct a
small mistake I wrote here right now
wrote text the txt it is actually test
of txt I called my document so I'm going
to go to fix that and then go inside my
browser refresh and then click the
button and as you guys can see we now
get a success message here that says
that this is actually run correctly then
when I click OK I get the data so this
is how we can get data using a get
method inside Jay create X and again
basically we just did the same thing is
using the load function inside Ajax but
I want to point out that we can actually
do whatever we want with the data that
we get from the documents using the get
method whereas using the load method
which is basically loading the day
and insert inside a document like we did
here so we can actually do a bunch more
things when it comes to getting the
actual data besides loading it inside
our documents so now let's actually go
and create something using the post
function inside Ajax so if I were to go
and delete everything we have inside our
jQuery code here except for the document
ready we can actually go and create
something using the post method so what
I want to do now is I want to go and
delete the button down here and allow
for the user to actually do something
inside the website so I'm going to go
and create an input instead of an actual
button this is going to be a text input
and inside the name we're going to go
and call this something like name now
basically what I want to do here is when
the user actually goes into the website
and write something inside the input I
want to check if the name or the
username that he's tapping inside the
input field already exists inside my
server meaning that if you type some
kind of name that already exists then
you cannot use that specific name so
what I want to do is I want to go inside
my jQuery code up here and say that I
want to run the jQuery code each time I
write something inside the input so I'm
going to go and say we have a selector
I'm going to go and select the input we
have down here so I'm just going to say
input then I'm going to say dot key up
meaning that each time I write something
inside the input it's going to go ahead
and run whatever is inside this
parentheses here so I'm going to say we
have a function parentheses clearly
brackets and then the first thing we're
going to do inside the curly brackets
it's getting the value what I actually
insert it inside the input so I'm going
to say we have a variable called name
which is equal to dollar sign
parentheses double quotes input to a
basically test getting the actual value
from the input then I'm going to say dot
bow which means that we get the actual
value then underneath here I want to run
the actual post function inside a text I
want to do the same thing as when we
wrote a get function which is dollar
sign dot post parentheses semicolon then
inside the parentheses we need to do
slightly different than the get function
because using the get function
only have two parameters inside the post
function you can have three parameters
so the first one is going to be the path
to the actual file they want to load in
which right now we haven't created yet
because I want to create something else
than the text document here so I'm just
going to delete that and I'm going to go
to link to a file called suggestions dot
PHP which again like I said we're going
to go and create in just a second then
the second parameter is going to be the
data that I want to pass on to
suggestions that PHP using a post method
again like I said when we use the post
function inside HX we want to allow the
user to do something inside our website
using HX so we can actually allows them
to pass on data using the HX request so
the second one here is going to be the
actual data that we pass on so the way
we do that is for writing curly brackets
and then just to make sure it looks nice
I'm going to go and move this down to
the next line and inside the curly
brackets we can write the data that I
want to pass on now right now I just
have one piece of data which is name up
here so I'm going to go and say that the
first data has the name as suggestion
colon and then a variable called name so
right now I'm passing on the name
variable to my document called
suggestion to PHP now the third
parameter inside the post function is
going to be exactly the same as inside
the get function which means that we can
actually choose to return data and
status the shows as if it is actually do
this correctly so inside the parentheses
down here right after the curly bracket
we're going to add the third parameter
the exact same way as we did with the
get function meaning I'm going to go and
write a function and then inside the
function parentheses I'm going to go and
include data comment status and again
these are actually optional I just
decided to include the minute to show
you guys who can actually get the data
and the status so inside the function I
want to actually get the result from
this post function here and insert it
inside our text paragraph down here
called ID test so I'm going to go and do
the exact same thing which is I'm going
to use a selector double quotes then I'm
going to go and say we have test
again we need to make sure we include
the hashtag in front of it dot HTML
parentheses semi-colon then we want to
get the data and insert inside the
paragraph down here called test now I'm
going to go and skip the echo status I'm
not going to load it out because this
actually runs each time you click a
button inside the input so it would
actually alert out of status each time I
click a button which gets quite annoying
after a while
so I won't do this till the ends so I'm
going to go to save this and open up a
new file because now we need to actually
create this file called suggestions dot
PHP which does something with the data
that the user actually typed in to the
website and then returns the data
immediately so we can do something with
the data so inside the new file I'm
going to go and save it as suggestions
dot PHP and again I need to mention here
that we don't have to do this using PHP
code or PSP documents you can do this
using a text document an HTML document
or JavaScript document or any kind of
document you might have inside your
server I just decided to use a PHP file
because I think it's easier to actually
do what I need to do in this episode -
sorry guys so inside the PHP file I'm
going to go and open up my PHP tags and
inside the PHP tags I'm going to go and
create a list of names because we need
to actually check while the users typing
if the name already exists inside our
server or inside a database or something
so I'm going to go and create a PHP
variable called existing names I'm going
to set it equal to the PHP array which
has a list of names inside of it so I'm
going to say we have Daniel calm man I'm
going to say we have Dennis comment I'm
going to say we have Danny and I'm going
to go and say we have something like
gain then below here I'm going to go and
check if we do actually have a post
method to be passed on from a jQuery
code which we actually did if we go back
to the index value guys can see we have
a post method called suggestion which is
equal to name which in this case is
equal to what it will be tucked inside
the input field so I need to get
is post method inside my PHP code now
before we do that I need to actually
check if we do actually have a post
method so I'm gonna write an if
statement and insert a function called
it steps parentheses and then we're
going to go and check for a dollar sign
underscore post method brackets single
quotes and then our post method was
called suggestion like so so right now
we've got the value of suggestion down
here which is again equal to name and
inside the if statement I'm going to go
and set the post method equal to a
variable just to make it easier so I'm
going to say we have a variable called
name which is equal to dollar sign
underscore post brackets single quotes
suggestion like so so now we have the
name so you want to check for if they
already exist and we have the name that
we typed in inside the input field and
now need to actually loop through this
array up here and check if the name
actually matches any of these data
inside the array because if it matches I
want to show the user that we already
have the name existing inside the
database so I'm going to go and say we
have a for each loop which is used for
erase the name start that for each loop
I'm going to go and say we have a
variable called existing names which is
the array we have up there and then I'm
going to say as existing name without
the s means that each time I write
variable existing name inside the fridge
loop it's going to refer to each piece
of data we have inside the loop so I'm
going to go inside the for each loop and
each time I do bout the array I want to
check if the name that they typed in
matches anything inside the array so I'm
going to say we have a shift statement
inside the if statement want to check
for a string position parenthesis now
the string position basically tells us
if whatever it happens at the input
matches anything inside the array we
have up there and the position of the
active string inside the array so for
words I actually get a true result it
means that the string already exists
inside the array if you get a false
result then the string does not exist
inside the array
going to go and say we have existing
name inside that's the first premise
inside this function here and then I'm
going to go an insert variable name
inside the second parameter then I'm
going to check if it's not equal to
false because if it's not equal to false
then the name of type didn't exist
inside the array and then I need to
write out the name that it matches
inside the array so I'm going to go and
say we want to echo and I want to echo
out the existing name which means that
it's the actual name that it matches
then afterwards I want to echo out a
break just to make sure we go to the
next line
if I were to actually have more than one
match inside the array so now if I save
this I can go and stop my browser
refresh and if I start typing something
like Daniel you guys can see that we get
Daniel Dennett's and Danny if I were to
keep writing something like a then you
guys can see it doesn't matter tennis
anymore
so not only gives me Daniel and Danny
and if I keep writing you guys can see
at the end we have Daniel so we can
actually see that there is a name called
Daniel inside our server again one more
quick fix here if you guys are
interested if I were to actually delete
this again we're going to get a error
message so need to go back inside my
code to fix that error message by saying
that we also want to check if the actual
name appears empty like so and if it's
not empty then we want to actually run
this for each loop down here because if
it works actually delete everything
again then the string position down here
doesn't have a second parameter because
there's nothing inside the input and
then it's going to give me an error
message so just to make sure we don't
get that error message I'm just going to
go to include this empty function in
here so now if I were to go back inside
the website refresh you guys can see
wants to start typing something and then
delete it again now we have no errors so
this is basically how we can use the get
and post functions inside jQuery AJAX
and again just to mention some of the
differences between the two the gate
function is used to actually get data
from the database typically if the data
is something that's not sensitive
meaning that we just want to you know
get some random data that everyone can
see inside the website if we were to use
the postman
it might be because they have some more
sensitive data that should not be shown
inside the website or if it's because
the use have some kind of input like we
just did here outside something inside
my website then we can use the post
method so this is basically what a get
and post function is inside Theory 8x
some of you guys have actually given me
suggestions to what to do in the next
couple episodes so I'll actually go
ahead and do a couple of those episodes
and then after that we're going to go
ahead and go into JavaScript HX so we
guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
