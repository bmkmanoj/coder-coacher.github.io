two turn how to set up your PlayStation
4 controller to the PC so we next play
video games with it now when it comes to
setting up a PlayStation 4 controller we
do actually have native support for it
at least today inside Windows 10 and
inside the steam store so we don't
actually need to install any kind of
third-party software or emulators like
we did in the past when we wanted to set
up for example a PlayStation 3
controller so it's quite easy to just
plug in and play with a small you know a
couple of steps you need to do in order
to get it working and I'm going to show
you guys a few things that we need to
fix before we actually do start playing
with it after you plug it in because
there's a few things with the
PlayStation 4 controller that's quite
annoying when you just plug it in that
you need to turn off inside steam so the
thing we need to do now before we get
started is we need to make sure we have
everything that we need we need to have
a controller of course and we need to
have the wire that comes with the
controller or with the PlayStation when
you bought it
so we can plug it into the computer now
you might be asking what about Wireless
because Wireless is much better you
don't have to use a you know a stinking
wire going back and forward from the
computer now if you want to you know
play wirelessly you need to have
something called an adapter and the one
that you need is something called a dual
shock adapter which is not something I
personally own I do actually have one
for the Xbox one because I'm using
expose one to to play on my PC not
typically my PlayStation 4 controller
but if you want to play wirelessly you
need an adapter like this one and you
can buy it inside any kind of electronic
store that you know sales places and
equipment or you can buy it online
somewhere now what I'm going to show you
guys is how to do this with a wire and
it's pretty much the same process with
the adapter I think so what we're going
to do is the first thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to go ahead and take my
wire which is the typical water comes
with the PlayStation and plug it into my
computer so now that plugged in the wire
to my PC I'm going to go ahead and wait
before I plugged into the controller
because we don't need to do that just
quite yet the first thing we need to do
inside steam is to set up the controller
and it's not going to allow you to do
that if you plugged in from the start so
what we need to do is before connecting
the controller open up steam and then
inside steam I'm going to go ahead and
test this with Dark Souls 3
because why not inside steamed up in the
right corner we have a controller icon
that says big picture mode I'm going to
go out and open that because this is a
mode inside the Steam library or inside
the steam application that is meant for
controllers so I'm going to open that so
we can actually get access to the
settings that we need to you know touch
on so I'm just going to go ahead and
yeah let's load it down go inside my
settings up in the right corner inside
big picture mode which is up here and
inside settings we have something called
controller settings which is why we need
to connect the controller so inside the
controller settings we need to actually
allow ps4 configuration support so we
check it off and then you guys will see
you get a short message saying you need
to make sure the control is not
connected because we did that already
before you say ok so we do that ok once
you've done that you can actually go
ahead and connect the controller so I'm
going to go and plug it in so now that I
connected my control as you guys can see
I get a small light inside the
controller because I already set up this
controller once before I will not get a
pop-up that says you need to you know
click OK or do something first
you guys probably will just go ahead and
click OK because there's no settings in
do you need to change just yet so once
you click OK you're going to have
whatever I have on my screen here and
once you do that we do actually have the
controller connect it now before we can
actually use it because it's going to
have a really annoying feature enable
from the beginning that pretty much runs
the entire experience when you want to
play with the controller we're going to
go ahead and open up a game so I'm going
to go ahead and go back using circle go
into my library what you guys will also
notice is that we can actually use the
directional buttons because it's not set
up as a default you need to use the
analog stick to move around I'm going to
go into my library and I'm going to go
ahead and open up Dark Souls 3 so I'm
going to go and click it let me say play
and once we start up the game I am going
to go ahead and show you guys how to get
into the Steam Navigation or into the
steam menu for the controller as you
guys can see I get a small pointer
moving around the screen here which is
actually because I'm moving my
controller around this is what we need
to disable
so now the game is loaded up and it's
actually buffing up the menu it might be
kind of laggy for you guys because it's
not actually a screen recorders inside
my game recording mode but as you guys
can see I can actually move around the
mouse cursor using my controller which
is not what we want because of the
gyroscope that's inside the controller
so I'm going to go inside the game and
just open it up okay so now I'm inside
the game and as you guys can see when I
move around the controller right now my
character is turning and twisting and
doing all sorts of things so we want to
disable that because I can actually use
my analog stick to do the exact same
thing which is the typical thing to do
in PlayStation so we need to disable the
what you call the gyroscope inside our
controller so in order to do that we're
going to click the PlayStation icon on
our controller and then I get into the
menu where we can actually go into
controller configuration if I go inside
of it you guys can see we can now remap
and Tim some of the settings on the
controller so there's quite a few things
we can do in here including turning off
this annoying thing so inside this menu
here I'm going to go down to what says
Mouse in the middle here as you guys can
see it's highlighted and click it
because this is the gyroscopes settings
so I'm going to go head and change the
style of input from Mouse to none so
right now if I go back you guys can see
it's not working anymore I can actually
do whatever I want to you know to do
it's not moving around so now I can just
use the controller or the analog stick
in order to move my character around and
I can I can actually play with it so
this is what we need to do in order to
get the controller working using steam
now if you guys are interested in how to
get this working with Windows 10 without
having to do steam at the moment I
haven't made a tutorial yet if I have
made one later on I'm going to put an
annotation just around right over there
and you guys can click it and see how to
connect it using steam using the Windows
10 operating system in case you guys
want to play an origin or something so I
hope you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
