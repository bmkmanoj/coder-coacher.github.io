show you how to fix an error inside OBS
which is the fact that sometimes your
webcam doesn't want to show inside the
software now I do have four different
solutions that we're going to try out so
hopefully by the end of this video you
should have this working for you now the
first solution I'm going to mention is
something that you probably tried
already but I'm just going to mention it
since some people might not have tried
it yet try to close down OBS and open it
back up again and see if that works now
even if it did actually work it might
not be the underlying problem so it
should keep following at least the next
two examples of how to fix this to make
sure this doesn't happen again
so the next solution is the fact that
when you try to access a webcam that is
already running in a different
application then you can't do it so to
give you an example if I were to have my
webcam which right now is a lot to take
webcam copeley you if I were to have
that webcam running in a different
software I liked a lot to take webcam
software you can download off Logitech's
website then because it's running that
software I can access it from OBS
because you can only have the webcam
running in one place at a time so this
might be causing the issue for you now
in my case this wasn't the issue the
issue in my case is the third solution
which is the fact that if you were to go
inside OBS which you can see I've opened
here right now
and down here at the bottom it says
scenes and sources inside your scenes if
you're using more than one scene inside
your specific software like you can see
I have four different kinds if I were to
access the same webcam from inside at
least two of the different scenes in
here or more then because I have access
to the same webcam in different scenes
it's going to think of it as you have
access to the webcam in a different
software in the same way so it's not
going to be able to show it inside the
different scenes now in most cases when
you can't get your webcam working like
we can't in this video it's caused by
the fact that you only have two webcam
available inside one of your scenes so
the reason for this is the fact that
even though you have different scenes
it's still going to see it as four
different software's
accessing the same webcam the way can
fixed is
is by going into the first of your
scenes go to your webcam source which
right now is my play 1080p 60fps if I
were to open it up you can see we have a
setting called deactivate we're not
showing it's very important to check
this on so if you were to jump to a
different scene then it's going to
deactivate the webcam from inside this
specific scene otherwise it's going to
keep running in the background which you
don't want to do so make sure you check
this on click okay go to the next
instance of your webcam this is the same
webcam just with a different setting
open it up and deactivate we're not
running on we're not showing then again
close it down then go to a different
scene do the same thing just like we did
before go to next scene do the same
thing just like we did before and when
all the scenes all the instances of this
specific webcam and all the different
scenes has been deactivated
we're not showing then you should have
it working inside your software so right
now you can see that it doesn't well it
shows inside this scene if it were to
jump to next scene then it shows in that
if so right now as you can see the
wakened us actually work inside this
scene if we were to jump to the next one
it works inside this scene as well when
I switch between the different scenes
and this is also something that if you
can't get this specific as you're
working if it doesn't switch the wave
came automatically then again deactivate
we're not showing and it should fix it
now the last error that you might run
into if none of these works is the fact
that the antivirus you're running in
your computer might be blocking you your
webcam this is something that I'm not
sure it's gonna be a solution for any of
you watching but I've seen people
discuss this online and some people has
said that their antivirus were blocking
the webcam I don't know why this would
happen I don't see how this could be a
solution but if none of the other
previous one worked try this out other
than that I don't have any other
solutions for you so hopefully this is
working by the end of this video so I
want you think so I want to thank you
for watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
