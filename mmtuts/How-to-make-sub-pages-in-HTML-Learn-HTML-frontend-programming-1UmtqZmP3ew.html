about how to make sub pages inside our
website and if you take a look at the
website we have so far here you guys
will actually notice we don't actually
have any sub pages yet so what I would
like to do is I would like to make a
gallery page and once we do actually
click the gallery up in the menu we have
up here I would like to go to that page
and then in the next episode we will
create a gallery inside that page so the
way we create a sub page is by going
into our code editor and simply creating
a new file now I'm going to go ahead and
save this file inside our root folder
and I'm going to go ahead and call it
gallery dot HTML you don't have to call
a gallery like I did here you can call
whatever you want
the only thing and have to call a
certain thing is the front page which is
indexed at HTML but any other kind of
sub page you can just kinda rename for
your liking so I'm going to go and save
this one and now we essentially do
actually have a sub page so if you go
into our front page here we do actually
need to add some of the things we have
in here for example do we actually need
to add our header so if I copy from the
first tag of our section the actual
starting tag of the section actually
let's go ahead and copy everything in
here because we need both the footer and
header and everything so copy everything
from your front page paste it inside the
gallery page and then go to the section
tags I actually have my closing tag here
and delete everything inside the section
tag so I'm just going to go and scroll
up a little bit here to actually hit the
section there we go and delete so now we
do actually have the head and the
beginning of our document in here we do
need all of this on every single page so
we have the head we have our body tag we
have our header which has a menu in it
we have our section with nothing in it
yet then we have two photo at the bottom
so if I save this and refresh my website
you guys will actually notice once that
you actually hit gallery we go to the
gallery page and the reason we do go to
the gallery page because inside my
header where I have my navigation I did
actually tell it that once I click the
gallery link it needs to take me to a
gal
sorry dot HTML document which is the
name of the document just created so if
you did in fact name it something
different than gallery then you need to
change the link inside your navigation
as well so what we can do now is we can
actually go ahead and talk about adding
the gallery because right now if we were
to add something inside section all we
need to do is on every single sub page
simply delete everything from the
section and then add whatever you need
to in here so in this case we could
actually create a div and give it a
class and call it gallery - box and then
when we actually do get to create the
gallery in the next episode we do have a
tip box ready for the gallery so this is
how you create subpages and it's really
not that difficult and we can actually
go ahead and just create all the other
ones we have here as well we have a
forum we have a well we have another
gallery this would probably be tutorials
like I have in the URL I also have
another forum down here which would be
about and then I have the contact down
here so let's go ahead and create forum
tutorials about contacts I'm just going
to go ahead and open up four documents
here I'm going to go ahead and copy
everything from my gallery since we
might as well take that one paste it
into the first one save it as form dot
HTML take the second one we have paste
everything in save it as
what was it let's go to use about dot
HTML and then we also need to have the
let's say we have the forum we have well
we did actually change everything in
here so now we did actually screw
something up we need to take the
navigation from the front page to be
changed because we didn't actually
change that inside all the sub pages now
this is an issue that you guys might be
asking about because if we have eight
different sub pages and there's a menu
in every single one of them and you
change one thing in the menu yes using
HTML only you're going to have to go
into every single sub page and
update the menu and that's just
something you have to do if you only
want to use HTML if you want to add
something like PHP you can actually do
without having to go into every single
page you can actually just do in one
document but since we're not doing PHP
right now we just go ahead and do it
this way so I'm going to go and copy
everything now again from our well just
wanted to sub pages who created with the
new menu in it and then I'm just going
to go and copy it inside the other
documents as well so right now it would
actually be well why do we have to oh
it's because I'm looking at the the
footer we need to look at the navigation
up here so up here we would have to
create a tutorials to Torrio with an S
HTML and the last one would actually be
contact so this going to place
everything in save it say contacts dot
HTML like so so now we have all the sub
pages we have inside the menu I'm just
going to go and save all of them and as
you guys notice we did actually need to
change the footer menu as well so let's
just go ahead and do that I'm going to
go to the footer of my front page
actually we do need to carry down the
menu from the top here since it's simply
going to be the same go down to my
footer which is all the way at the
bottom change all the links and do that
on every single page make sure we save
it and then go down to every single sub
page and change the footer as well like
so and make sure we also change it at
the top because I did actually change
the footer on some of them instead of
the actual main navigation so this one
is not correct just make sure that the
photo and the top navigation is the same
on all the pages and here we go this one
is not correct either
this one is tutorials we have the top
one is correct the bottom one is not
correct so now we change the footer
there and on the last one we need to
change the footer as well so there we go
now the photo and top navigation if i
refresh the same as they are on all
pages so if i zoom in so you guys can
actually see you guys can actually see
it's the same if I go to forum you'll
take a notice that our URL up here
changes to form HTML
go to tutorials it changes to tutorials
about ghost about contact it goes to
contact go back to the front page we
have the front page so now everything is
working inside our sub pages now the
next episode like I said we're going to
talk about how to make a gallery and
then after that we're going to talk
about how to actually upload a website
online now I got a question in one of
the comments inside YouTube asking me
about if well I did X include a forum up
here in the menu and if we were to
actually create a forum we would
actually need to know PHP code because
you can't create a forum just with a
2-month CSS since it has to be
interactive you need to add a specific
kind of code that can make it
interactive and PHP is one of those
languages we can add to that now since
we haven't really talked about PHP yet
we won't actually be creating a forum in
this example but once you do actually
get to the PHP code inside our website
here inside YouTube then I will actually
be using this example to create a forum
inside our website so Dave Simone CSS
only we cannot do this I hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
