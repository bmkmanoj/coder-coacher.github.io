how to add effects to a website using
jQuery and in this episode we're going
to learn how to tame these effects and
how to stop them once you start
animating so as you guys can see in
front of me here I have a very basic
website that has a button inside of it
that says click me to stop animating and
also have a button that here says click
me to start animating and as you guys
can see when I click the button it gets
bigger and then after a while after
about three seconds the text gets bigger
so what I want to do is I want to stop
this animation from happening once I
click this button so inside my code as
you guys can see I have a very basic
script inside the top of my website that
has a selector that goes in select
actual box then when I click it
something's going to happen and then
afterwards is going to start animating
the box in here changing the width and
the height and that's going to happen
for about 3 seconds then after that has
happened it's going to select the box
again and do something else to it which
is right now changing the font size of
the text inside of it so the way I want
to do this is first of all I want to
actually chain these correctly now right
now as you guys can see I selected the
box then again below it I selected the
same box and did something else to it
but we can actually do this much simpler
which is we can actually chain these
directly right after each other so the
way we can chain events instead of
writing it like this where we select the
same object two times in a row is I can
actually go directly after the first
object here and say will ask to do the
first animation I'm just going to go and
say punctuation and then animate a
second time and then do something else
and again we're just going to do the
same thing as down here so I'm just
going to select everything we have here
which isn't animation and do it right
afterwards and then I can actually
delete the second one down here so now
I'm basically doing the exact same thing
as I had before where I say well I
select some kind of elements then I want
to animate it and do this to it then
afterwards I want to animate the same
object doing this thing instead so we
can also do this using other things such
as if I want to fade out at the ends I
can actually go and chain another effect
to it so if we want to
fade out at the end I can also do that
and I can just paint it right after each
other two words actually click this
again you guys can see when i refresh
the browser and click it the first
animation runs then after it's done the
second one goes and then it should fade
out like so so this is how we continue
vents right after each other now let's
actually go and talk about stopping
animation from happening after we
activated animation so right now I have
a button down here that says click me to
stop animating I haven't done anything
inside ticular to actually stopped event
from happening so what we're going to do
is I'm going to go ahead and say we have
another click event so I'm going to say
to have a selector I'm going to use the
button down there so I'm just going to
say button dot click parenthesis
semicolon then I have a function inside
the parenthesis like so inside the curly
brackets down here I'm going to go and
select the actual box up here which
right now is animating and say I want to
stop then amazing from happening and
again when I want to stop the animation
is not only the animate effect we can
stop we can stop all sorts of effects
such as fade in fade out and slide if I
want to so to stop function we have
inside geekery stops everything from
happening so we went ahead and selected
the content box then afterwards I can
say dot stop parenthesis semicolon and
right now we have two different
parameters inside the stop function
right now we have the first one
determines if all effects inside the
content box needs to stop immediately or
if it should only be the current effect
that's actually running the second
parameter is going to decide if all the
effects that is inside content box needs
to immediately actually run and then
stop so to give you guys an example here
let's actually go and run this code
before writing any kind of parameters
inside the parentheses mean that right
now both parameters is going to be set
to false so for words I have to go
inside my browser refresh click the
button and then click the stop animating
you guys can see I stopped the first
effect but the second one is running if
i refresh again click the button stopped
animation and then again stop the second
animation by clicking
second time you guys can see I can keep
stopping down emissions from happening
so what we can do now is if it were to
change the parameters inside the stop
function I can go and say we have a true
parameter inside the first one meaning
that right now for were to go back
inside the browser and refresh it should
immediately stop all animation from
happening inside this button down here
so if I click here and click nothing
else runs inside the animation
everything stops and not only the
current animation that's actually
running if I go back inside my code and
say I have a second parameter that I
want to set to true then when I click
the button is going to finish off all
the animations immediately and stop them
so forward to refresh and click the
button you guys can see their old
animations finish and then stop so this
is how we can chain events inside jQuery
as well a stop animation from happening
inside our code hope you guys enjoyed
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
