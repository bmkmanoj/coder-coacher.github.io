about something called a switch inside
PHP and the basic idea behind the switch
is we're going to do something different
inside the browser depending on some
kind of answer we might have so in our
example our answer is going to be X
which is equal to 1 so the way we write
out a switch is by writing switch
parentheses curly brackets and you guys
might recognize it looks very similar to
an if statement it's not exactly the
same though because in an if statement
you do actually have different
conditions underneath each other like
this we're in a switch you write all the
different possible answers inside the
curly brackets itself so let's actually
go ahead and write out one different
case that actually says if X for example
is equal to 1 then do this so the way we
do that is by writing out case space and
then we need to write what answer should
be and in this case it's going to be 1
then we're going to go ahead and say :
let's actually go ahead move down to the
next line and then we're going to go
ahead and put in the code that needs to
go inside the browser if X in fact is
equal to 1 so let's actually go ahead
and say we're going to echo and then
we're going to put in a string that says
the answer is 1 now after we're done
giving up the answer need to put in
something called a break and a break is
sent to the sets that now we're ending
case number 1 so we also need to add one
more thing because right now we didn't
actually tell the switch what we're
actually checking for and in our case
waxey checking variable X so need to put
variable X inside the parentheses so now
if we go into the browser and refresh
you guys can see it says the answer is 1
because in this case X is a actually
equal to 1 and if it did actually check
if it was equal to 1 down here now if I
go ahead and copy this case move it down
to the next line here we can actually
change case 1 into for example a string
called
number
as an example and then we can actually
go ahead and say the answer is number
now the thing we can change here to
change the answer is by going up into
variable X changing equal to 1 into a
string called number so now if X is
equal to number then it's actually going
to go ahead and say the answer is number
so if i refresh the browser you guys
will notice that the changes to the
answer is number so we can add a lot of
different cases here we can actually
copy these and just kind of paste them
underneath each other if we can change
number two to an actual integer 3 &amp;amp; 4 so
now we have four different cases where
we count depending on if it's 1 2 3 or 4
it's going to do something specific so
we can actually change this to 2 3 &amp;amp; 4
so as you guys can see it can actually
change our variable up here and say if
it's 4 then it's going to say the answer
is 4 of course now this is all good but
let's actually say we have some kind of
answer that you don't actually have
listed inside our cases we're going to
go down to the next line and then we're
going to write something called default
now the default is going to say okay if
the answer is something else that we did
not stayed in here then it's going to do
this down here so we're going to go
ahead and say echo I'm just going to
copy the top line here echo and then
we're going to say there is no answer if
you don't actually need to put a break
underneath the default because the break
is just whenever we have a new case
after the next one we need to add a
break before the new case and because we
don't have any new cases after the
default we're not going to put a break
so if I do actually go up and say that X
is equal to let's say 8 which I don't
actually have listed down in my break
it's going to say there is no answer so
that's the basic idea behind a switch
and this is actually a really nice thing
to have if you just need to check for
answers and not conditions like we do an
if-else statements and that sort of
thing so I hope you guys enjoyed this
episode in the next episode why is it
going to start talking about doing
something specific
inside the browser with all the
different code we've done so far so
we'll actually learn how to do something
with our PHP code because up until now
all the lessons we've done so far has
all been focused on teaching aghast the
fundamentals of PHP that you actually
need to know before we can start using
it so we guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
