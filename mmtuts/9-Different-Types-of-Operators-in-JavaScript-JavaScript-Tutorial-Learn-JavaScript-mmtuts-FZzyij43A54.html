to a next episode on how to create
JavaScript now in this episode I'm going
to talk about something called operators
within JavaScript and operators is
something used in order to create all
sorts of logical operations within a
JavaScript scripts so when it comes to
these operators we have a lot to talk
about this a lot of different types of
operators but for the sake of this
episode I'm just going to talk about a
few of them later I'm going to actually
get to more specific types of JavaScript
functions or code and we'll get into
some of the other operators we have
within the AMA script but for now it's
just going to confuse you since we
haven't talked about conditional
statements and loops and that sort of
things so for now we're just gonna focus
on a few of them so what I have in here
is a basic index dot HTML document just
consuming so you can actually see what's
going on and inside this document here I
have a couple examples of assignment
operators and arithmetic operators now
assignment operators we've actually seen
before I'm on the previous episodes
where we set a value equal to for
example a variable inside JavaScript so
I'm going to show you a couple examples
of the different types of assignment
operators that we have inside JavaScript
so the first one that you've already
seen is the equal sign now if we were to
go ahead and create a variable by saying
you have a number not number number I
can actually see my keyboard here there
we go and set it equal to some kind of
value for example a integer numbers so
were to say 10 and then we use this
assignment operator in order to set
number equal to 10 now if I were to go
ahead and use one the other ones here
and so an example of it if I were to go
on the next line and say I want to add 5
to this 10 inside number I can say
number is equal to number plus 5 and
what this is going to do is that it's
going to say number is going to have a
new value and we're going to take number
which is 10 and add 5 to it so forward
to console.log this is actually going to
say 15 inside the browser now this is
sort of a weird way of doing it so what
we can do instead is we can
to go and use the assignment operator we
have up here so we'll go down to the
next line and just comment out what we
just did here and create a new example
where we say number I can access see my
keys here is plus equal to five which
means that we're going to add five to
the value inside the variable we're
talking about before the assignment
operator so this is the exact same thing
as doing the above I just showed you an
example of and the same thing goes for
if you want to minus multiply divide and
so on and so on and so on
this is going to add something to the
current value of the variable or the
value that we're talking about so this
is what we call an assignment operator
and the next example here is something
we call an arithmetic operator which is
hard to pronounce but every thick
operator and this is just basic math
Messick operations that we have inside
for example algebra so if I were to go
ahead and say we have a variable called
number two because we need to have a new
variable and set it equal to five times
ten the multiplier symbol is going to be
an arithmetic operator so we have all
these types of operations inside
JavaScript in order to perform well
operations inside our scripts inside
javascript and these are something I've
used constantly when we write Java
scripts in a few episodes we'll talk
about for example conditional statements
which allow for us to say that some code
needs to run if a certain condition is
true and inside the condition we have
another type of operator we're going to
talk about so all these operators we
have within JavaScript we're going to
get to once we get a bit further hitting
this course here because there's quite a
few to talk about and it's it's too
early to talk about them now because
they're just gonna confuse you this
early on so this is what we call
operators within JavaScript and I just
want to mention it that we have these
because they're really important to know
about before we get too far into
JavaScript so I hope you enjoyed and
I'll see
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
