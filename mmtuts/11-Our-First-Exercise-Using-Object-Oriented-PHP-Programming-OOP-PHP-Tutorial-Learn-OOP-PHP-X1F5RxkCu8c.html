using all the stuff we learned so far
using object-oriented programming so
today we're going to build a very basic
calculator using optical hunter code
just so you guys can get a bit familiar
with how the system work when we want to
use optic darn to code inside a website
so as you guys can see inside the
browser here I have a form that has two
inputs in it I also have a drop-down
that says we can add subtract or
multiply and then we can calculate so
even though this is not a really
exciting project it's going to teach us
how to do some of the basic stuff with
uptick rounds of programming so inside
the input I'm going to go and say we
want to add two and four and then when I
calculate you guys can see we get six so
we're going to build this very basic
thing using object-oriented code so what
we're going to do to start with is this
is the file that we are going to build
in of course there's nothing inside of
right now for to refresh you guys can
see it's empty and we're going to go
ahead and start up by going inside our
index file and building the form that we
need to use in order to calculate
whether we need to calculate so inside
the body tag of our index page I'm going
to go and say we have a form and inside
the form want to set an action to a page
that we haven't created yet called calc
dot PHP and I want to set a method to
post like so now inside the form I'm
going to go and include an input and
again this is just basic HTML you guys
should notice by now so I'm just going
to go ahead and say we have a text and
the first one is called num1 which
stands for number one I'm going to go
ahead and copy this paste it underneath
and change the to num2
then I'm going to go and create a select
and inside the Select we're going to
create one option called add I'm going
to go and go inside my option here and
say if you have a value set to add and
small letters inside the Select I'm
going to go and say we have a name and
I'm going to go and set this one to Cal
for calculate now I'm going to go and
copy the option two more times and say
we have subtract and multiply
we're going to go and change the values
in here as well so I'm going to say we
have a sub and a mole just to make it
short the next thing we need to add is a
button so I'm going to go and say after
the Select we have a button like so that
has calculate inside of it I'm going to
set the type to submit and save the file
so now we did everything we needed to do
inside the front page I'm going to go
ahead and open up a new page and this is
going to be the page that the form sent
us to in order to calculate whatever we
typed in inside the form and forward to
refresh the browser you guys can see now
we get the actual calculator in here so
I'm going to go and create a new file
I'm going to save it inside my root
folder as calc dot PHP save it and
inside this file we're going to go over
them up the PHP tags because the first
thing you need to do is actually get the
values we passed on from the form so I'm
going to go and say we have a variable
called num 1 I'm going to set it equal
to dollar sign underscore post and the
name of the post is going to be num 1
I'm going to copy this two more times
and say the second one is num 2 and the
third one is going to be calc like so
let's actually make sure we did that
correctly we did not it was Cal not calc
like so and now that we have this we can
actually get started creating the class
that needs to contain all the properties
and methods in order to calculate what
we just did in here again object runs
the program is probably much better for
larger stuff like creating a login
system but just to give you guys some
kind of exercise we're going to go and
make to something very small now I'm
going to go ahead and open up a new
document and I'm going to go and save it
inside a root folder I'm actually going
to go and create a new folder called
includes just to have a folder to put
all my class files inside of inside this
folder I'm going to call the file calc
dot Inc dot PHP and again the dot Inc
don't get confused by it it's just a way
for me to name the file so I know it's
an include file inside my include folder
Lync does nothing you could also call it
Cal TSP if you wanted to I just call it
couch during that PSP so I'm going to go
and save it now and inside this file
we're going to go ahead and start
creating back to a class so I'm going to
go and open up a pair of PHP tags I'm
going to say they have class called calc
with a big C curly brackets and inside
this class we're going to go and create
three different properties each property
is going to be equal to one of the
values you pass on from the form so I'm
going to go and say we have a public
variable or property called num1 I'm
going to close it off then I'm going to
go and copy the property two more times
like so the second one is going to be
num2 and the third one is going to be
Cal now in order to actually assign
values to these properties here when we
pass on the information from the
calculator over here into character PHP
we're going to go ahead and create a
constructor method that will actually
take these data and pass them inside
these properties here so on the next
line we're going to say we have a public
function called on the score underscore
construct parentheses curly brackets and
inside this constructor here we're going
to go ahead and say we have this
property called num1 and we're going to
go ahead and set it equal to variable
num 1 and again this variable num 1 here
is not this one up here this variable
down here is simply what we're passing
in when we create the optic later on
okay and again this variable here is not
the same variable as we have up here
inside the property this variable here
is what we're going to pass in inside
they construct the parameters here when
we call on the object created from this
class okay
semicolon then I'm going to go and copy
this two more times and change the
values we're going to say 2 we're going
to say Cal like so so now we made it
possible to actually pass the parameters
from our calculator inside our class
using an object so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to go inside my couch the
PHP where we created the post
method so actually tap the post methods
from the forum I'm going to go and go
down to next line and I'm going to go
and create a new object I'm going to go
ahead and call this one variable
calculator I'm going to set it equal to
new and then the class name which right
now is calc of course right now we have
three different parameters inside our
constructor like we created here what we
do actually need to add two more like so
and like so going to change the names so
that the proper naming and after we did
this we can actually go ahead and go
ahead and include these three parameters
inside I'll count the PHP so going to
say parentheses and then pass them in of
course right now the only reason that
this name is the same as this name is
that it makes it easier for swimmers to
create these up here to go ahead and
just name them the same as you would up
here there's no larger idea behind using
this specific variable name inside the
parentheses here it just makes sense for
me because it's the same as up here so
now that we instantiate the class and
created an object from it we can
actually go ahead and create the method
that's going to calculate what exactly
we type didn't inside the calculator so
inside the cows Bell Inc the PHP inside
the calc class we're going to go and
create a public method so I'm going to
say public function we're going to call
this one calc method parentheses curly
brackets of course you guys can call
whatever you want I just decided to call
it calc method and inside the calc
method I'm going to go and create a
switch like so again creating a switch
is something that you guys will be able
to inside regular PHP so it's exactly
the same thing as here so I'm going to
go and say that inside the switch
parameter I want to check which type of
calculation that shows inside the actual
calculator over here so what I'm going
to do so I'm going to go back up to the
properties and say well this Gramma's
over here is called Cal inside our files
so I'm going to go until you want to get
this Cal and insert it inside our
parentheses so now we're getting the
actual value of what we chose inside the
drop-down
then based of this value I'm going to go
and say that if the value is equal to
add then it should do something inside
the code I'm also going to go ahead and
say we have one called subtract which
was called sub inside its name and we
had one called more like so inside the
default I'm going to go and say they
have a variable called result which is
equal to some kind of string now the
string is going to be error because if
we did actually get the default it means
we did something wrong inside the
calculator so we're just going to go and
get a message that says error now I'm
going to go and copy this paste it
inside add and instead of saying the
result should be equal to error we're
going to go ahead and say it's going to
be equal to this num one space plus this
num2 okay I'm going to copy it paste it
inside the other two down here simply
change it from plus to minus and plus to
multiply then I'm going to go ahead and
go down right underneath the switch
after closes and say we want to return
dollar sign result like so so now we
have an actual function on actual method
that gives us the result of whether we
typed in inside the calculator now right
now it doesn't actually spit anything
inside the browser so in order to do
that I'm going to go and copy help
method up here go inside my calc for PSP
and underneath the object we created I'm
going to go ahead and say we have an
object called calculator point to a
method called calc method and again the
numbers that are getting passed to the
calc method it's going to be what we got
from up here
because the object is based off these
numbers here so now if I save and I go
inside the browser refresh you guys can
see that if I type one subtract by one
we get an error message that's because
right now we didn't actually include the
couch that Inka PSP file inside where we
need to use it so when we do actually
create these classes you will need to
make sure
to the class using an include tag so I'm
going to go inside my PHP tags right
before we get to post methods and I'm
going to go ahead and say we have an
include space single quotes and then go
inside the folder I have called includes
forward slash and then say we have a
calc dot Inc dot PHP like so so now if
we go back do it again so we have two
minus one this time
we still didn't get anything because we
need to echo the actual method down here
so we need to say echo and now it should
work
so let's actually refresh one more time
and there we go we now got three so
remember we need to include the file
that we actually created that has the
class in it and we need to make sure we
create an object from the class and pass
in the parameters we got from our form
and we need to echo out the method we
want to use in order to calculate
whatever we'll need to calculate again
we could do a completely other method
inside the class and just simply call to
reducing our objects because remember
the class is a blueprint and we can do a
bunch of stuff inside the class now hope
you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
