edit out footage inside the project
window before actually dragging it
inside the timeline so the way we can do
that is as you guys can see we do
actually have a tap up in the left
corner called source a right now says we
have no Clips if I go down to my project
window double click a piece of footage
you guys can see we now have it inside
our source tab now in here we can
actually go ahead and preview our
footage we can mark in and mark out just
like we talked about in the previous
episode and then we can actually go
ahead and drag the footage by clicking
on the clip up here and dragging it
inside our timeline and right now the
only part of it dragged in here is the
part we Mark in and out now what you can
also do is if you want to only have
video but no audio you can go down the
bottom here which says drag video only
and we can go ahead and drag it in to
our project we can also just extract the
audio if you want to by simply clicking
the audio tab and dragging that in as
well now a couple of other features we
have in here is that we can actually go
and insert or we can go ahead and
overwrite this footage with whatever's
down here inside our timeline so if we
do actually go ahead and choose the
middle part here and I have a part of my
footage here selected I connect to go
ahead and say insert but once I do it
let's actually choose a bit more once I
do it will actually notice that the back
part of my timeline actually gets pushed
out and that's because when I insert it
you guys can see it gets inserted inside
the video we already have down here and
then it gets pushed out now the other
way we can do it is we can go ahead and
click overwrite what inserts the footage
up here as well but instead this time is
simply overwrite the actual footage down
from the timeline and it doesn't get
pushed out like so so that's basically
what I wanted to talk to you guys about
in this episode for the next episode we
can actually go and talk about some of
the features we have down here inside
our timeline because those are actually
connected to what we talked about in
this episode when it comes to inserting
an overriding because some of these
features actually attached to these
features so if you guys enjoyed
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
