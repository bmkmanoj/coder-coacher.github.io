another episode on the Corsair k70 RGB
keyboard now in this episode we're going
to be focusing on actually testing the
keyboard to see how it feels like to
actually use the keyboard because I've
seen a lot of videos on YouTube actually
showing off the colors and you know the
new features that this specific keyboard
has with it but I have not seen any you
know demos or like testing of the
keyboard while it was actually being
used so I think we do them in this
episode and just sort of like get our
hands on it and actually test it out I
have a feeling it's gonna be very
similar to the Corsair k70 which is not
the RGB version because essentially it
is the same keyboard just with you know
neat new colors natural thing in it but
I figure we should actually try it out
and actually test it out so right now we
do actually have a camera on the
keyboard we do have a game open here and
we have a face cam going on so what
we're going to do here is we just sort
are gonna test the keyboard out I'm
gonna give you guys my general opinion
on how this keyboard actually feels like
to use in an actual thing like a video
game so we're just gonna start up a
quick match here okay so now we're
inside a game and now that we're
actually getting started on it I think
we might as well talk about what
specifically we need to be testing on
this keyboard first of all we need to
take a look at if the structure of the
keyboard is more sturdy than last keep
what I had at least you know compared to
other keyboards we need to look at if
the colors on it ofc very distracting
because the keyboard is being bought
because of its colors and if the colors
are way too distracting when you're
sitting here playing in the light or in
the dark you know it's gonna get
annoying and you can't really be using
it while you play games so and I guess
the last thing is just like the sort of
the overall feel of how it feels like
compared to my last keyboard now I did
actually have the race a Deathstalker
before which is a membrane keyboard that
very uniquely had like the buttons from
very low to the circuit board so you
know when I click the button it really
did not take any sort of pressure in
order to like click on it now when I
have this keyboard for the first couple
of like
I don't know an hour it took me a little
bit to get used to it because you know
I'm not used to mechanical keyboards at
all I have never used a mechanical
keyboard before this keyboard so I can't
really well I do have a mechanical
keyboard but it's like a really cheap
mechanical keyboard that I bought like
the first time I ever bought a computer
and it is just not worthy of comparing
to this keyboard like if I did have to
compare it this this one pretty much
beat every single keyboard I've ever
tried in every single way when it comes
to actually the feeling of actually
using it because it's like the putters
just feels the keyboard feels like you
could drop it from our high distance and
it would not break it feels very sturdy
and when you I'm like I'm pounding the
keys right now and I don't know about
how loud you guys can actually hear the
keyboard not very loud I think when I do
recording of actual gameplay it really
takes a lot of pounding for you guys to
actually hear it in the microphone from
what I can hear so it's not very loud
now to keep what I'm using here is
actually using brown switches it's not
red switches would actually it's the
standard switch that came out with when
it just came out the keyboard when I
came when I got this keyboard I had to
wait till I came to Europe which means
that the keyboard had already been
released in the US for like a month
before I actually got my hands on it and
by that time the brown switches had
already come out for so I did not need
to wait anything it was it was out right
away when I got it which i think was
pretty good I've never tested any other
kind of switches before well I did test
the blue switches which I did not like
because I need to need to be typing on
my keyboard because I'm a multimedia
designer our code and that sort of thing
so I needed something that have buttons
that I could actually use for other than
just gaming which is why I chose to
actually go up to brown switches now the
lights do not feel distracting at all
the lights of this key were compared to
the two the Razer BlackWidow RGB
keyboard that just came out - like a lot
of people say well you know you should
order to raise a Black Widow RGB
keyboard custom call
a lot brighter you know but the keyboard
itself from what I have felt it I felt
the razer blackwidow RGB keyboard well
at least a black widow version that they
made into the RGB keyboard and for what
I feel from Ed is that well basically
it's all plastic this keyboard here is
metal like when you lift it off the
table
it feels so heavy in a good way like it
really feels like it's stuck onto the
table and that it's not gonna break now
build quality wise I would definitely go
to Corsair keyboard now with the colors
some people say like I said you need to
go with the Black Widow if you want to
get like a keyboard with nice colors
then again if I'm sitting in the
nighttime and I'm playing a game and I'm
using this keyboard the colors are just
bright enough to that I can actually see
it and I can enjoy it to the point where
if I had to use the Black Widow keyboard
and I have of course I haven't seen the
colors on it but if I had to guess the
colors are so bright that there would
actually be too annoying and distracting
when I'm sitting here playing a video
game if they're if they're like really
really really really really bright I
can't focus on my screen it's like if
the keyboard isn't right in between the
screen and your face so if it's too
bright then I'm not gonna be you know
noticing the game so I think this
keyboard has a perfect amount of
brightness to it I don't think it should
be brighter than this
after some considerate thoughts if I
should say so but the overall feel of it
is very nice definitely this is the best
keyboard I've ever not only owned but
touched anywhere the build quality is
just amazing so I hope this can sort of
give you guys some insight into how to
key what actually is you know typing
that sort of thing it feels amazing so
if you have to go for a keyboard if you
had to recommend the keyboard if you're
going for like the build itself
I don't know if the case ever D that is
not RTP has the same metal finish on the
top of it if it does I can recommend the
case 70 and the k70 RGB for either
reason just because of its build quality
if you're going for the colors you know
if you're only going for colors not
build quality
you know depending if you like it really
bright or not you might consider going
for the Black Widow but look at the
colors I mean I'm sitting here in broad
daylight
the colors are not supposed to be very
bright and still you can you can see it
plenty on the camera so I hope you guys
enjoyed this little test I sort of gave
my feedback on it even though it might
have been as not as been as technical as
other people might have done it but it's
more of a personal opinion here so I
thought I hope you guys enjoy it and
I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
