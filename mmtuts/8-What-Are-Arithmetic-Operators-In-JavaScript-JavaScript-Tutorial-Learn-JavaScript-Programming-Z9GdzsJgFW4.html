something called operators inside the
other script and for this episode we're
going to talk about the tag called
arithmetic operator now as you guys can
see it it actually write out quite a few
different math problems here and the
basic idea behind everything edek
operators are that we have some kind of
symbol we use in between our numbers in
order to get some kind of value now I
have a plus symbol I have a minus symbol
multiplication division it's really
basic math and these symbols are what we
call arithmetic operators now the last
five that I wrote down here would like
to explain because at least allows for
them we will use quite often when we do
JavaScript now the percentage symbol
that we have up here what it basically
does is that it divides the numbers with
each other and tells you how much is
left over afterwards now five divided by
five is going to be you know divided
evenly into each other meaning that
there's going to be zero numbers left
over if I have something like 8 if I
divide 5 by 8 I can only do that one
time but after we divide it by 8 since
it doesn't go up evenly we have three
left over after we divide them so the
you know the actual result here would
actually be three now I'm not going to
go too much into these things up here
because it's really basic math but the
ones down here like I said are quite
important the first one here basically
adds one to five so when we take some
kind of number it could be either number
not just five and right plus plus after
it it's gonna go ahead and see okay
the answer is five and then I'm gonna go
ahead and add one to it down here it's
gonna say okay the answer is five and
I'm gonna go ahead and subtract one to
it so the answer would actually four
afterwards now you might be thinking
well what about the plus plus five
rather than five plus plus because
there's a difference here if I were to
run some kind of loop which we haven't
talked about yet but it's basically if I
were to keep spitting out answers one
after another
until some kind of statement has been
fulfilled let's say I run a loop which
means that I'm doing some kind of
calculation and I have to give an answer
and then it's going to start over giving
another calculation and then giving
another answer if I were to say five
plus plus if I were to run into the once
and there was only this one statement in
there the answer would be five the first
time and then for the next time it's
gonna add one means mean which means
that the next loop is gonna give out six
as an answer whereas down here what the
first time we run the loop it's gonna go
ahead and add the number first
and then it's gonna spit out the answer
which means that the first time the loop
is actually running the answers can be
six and not five compared to this one up
here and the same thing goes for this
one down here where we have five minus
minus the first time the answers can be
five and then it's gonna subtract one
and then it's gonna run the loop the
second time where the answers can be
four same thing down here first time the
answers gonna be four because we
subtract first and then the second time
the loop runs is gonna be three okay now
that's the basic idea behind these
arithmetic operators and enough I'm not
gonna go too much into detail with them
because as you guys can see they're not
too complicated you can make them more
complicated if you have a I guess a more
complicated math statement but this is
the basic idea behind them so if you
guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
