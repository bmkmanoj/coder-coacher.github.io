make a website for free without having
to code in this example we're going to
make a small business website for a
handyman service by using the steps
listed in this video you're also going
to learn how to create a personal
website blog or even ecommerce website
so here's the website I'm going to start
building today and it's about a handyman
service I've designed the website to be
conversion oriented which means that our
call to action buttons are in orange so
that they stand out on a more likely to
be clicked we have the contact number
really high up so that anyone can give
us a call with their questions instead
of leaving the website there's some more
quick information about us and why you
should choose us and at the end we have
testimonials from previous clients this
is how we attract customers right aside
from the homepage I've also created our
services about contact and testimonial
pages which are simple easy to
understand and easy to use to make the
website I use WordPress which is a free
website creation tool also known as a
content management system it's used by a
lot of websites such as CNN Sony and
even NASA WordPress has a huge community
of freelance web designers too so what
do you need to build a website well
firstly you need a domain name this is
your website's address and name after
you choose a suitable name you need web
hosting and that's the server that keeps
your website online you can host your
own website but it's not very practical
it's much cheaper and more reliable to
have someone else host your website once
you've gotten a host you need to install
WordPress which is completely free just
make sure you use wordpress.org and not
wordpress.com for downloading the
software the hosting service that I
personally use in recommend already has
WordPress built in so that you can
install it with a single click
after getting WordPress installed it's
on to building the website and for that
you need a theme the theme is something
that gives your website a certain look
and functionality and you could add
further functionality by installing
plugins finally when you have the look
and functionality set up to your liking
it's time to add your website's content
so let's start off by getting a domain
name and web hosting for this I used
Hostgator and it's a super reliable and
very user friendly domain and hosting
provider they are recommended on the
site called hosting FAQs which basically
analyzes each web host for their uptime
load time and customer support from my
experience I found them to be a reliable
trusted host they're also one of the
biggest hosting web providers with over
2 million web sites since we're using
WordPress
I found it best to go with Hostgator
WordPress cloud hosting which I find
first-rate now they originally cost
thirteen ninety-five a month which is
pretty hefty but they have some
discounts that are available just type
in the following URL to get it for $2.99
a month hosting fax dot-com slash go
slash Hostgator use the link in the
description that's below the video to
see if the offer is still valid
so next you'll be on there hosting
landing page they offer three different
hosting options all with unlimited
storage and bandwidth it's good because
they don't limit you if your site starts
to get some serious traffic or if you
plan to upload a ton of content now I'll
go with the cheapest option because of
going to build only one site but if you
plan to create more go with the higher
priced package for me the $2.99 package
is good enough oh they also throw in a
domain name which is almost free it
costs one cent so the next step is to
choose a domain name for your website if
you're setting up a business website I
recommend choosing something that you
can brand for as related to your
business if you're creating a blog or
personal website just go with your name
com if you already have a domain name
that you purchased somewhere else click
on the write tab and enter your domain
name if you don't have a domain name yet
write it in the first tab in my case
I'll go with fix your stuffed org as you
can see it's only one cent for the first
year I also recommend that you purchase
domain name privacy to avoid any
unwanted spammers because it hides your
domain registration information from the
public next we need to choose a hosting
plan I'll go with the cheapest option
which is for one site and I recommend
that you do the same unless you plan to
build more than one web site I have a
monthly build contract but I truly
recommend that you get a 12 or 24 month
plan because I'm unsure how long they'll
offer the service at this price it could
easily go up again
now the security pin isn't very
important because it'll be sent to your
email after you've completed the
registration but it's good if you can
memorize it next just fill in your
personal details and choose the payment
option credit card or PayPal I use
PayPal but you can use a credit card if
you don't have an account additional
services are not really needed but
Hostgator does include website backups
and extra security by site lock which is
a good perk to have you can also choose
ssl to turn your site into HTTPS as you
can see the final cost is 1595 if you
don't opt-in for domain privacy you can
get it for three dollars - now it can
take around 5 minutes for Hostgator to
activate your account once it's
activated you'll be sent to this page
here just click on hosting and you could
see that Hostgator has already installed
WordPress to my domain from here you can
manage the install create email accounts
and so on but for now we'll just click
on manage WordPress and you'll be
greeted by the WordPress login once
we've logged in we will see our
WordPress dashboard this is where you
navigate and change every part of your
website but let's get right into setting
up the website on the Left column
hover the Settings tab and select
permalinks here we will need to set the
permalinks to post name so our posts URL
will automatically be the same as the
post title click Save Changes and head
to the plugins tab
you will have some pre-installed add-ons
here which we don't really need because
we're going to install our own plugins
later so just select them all and choose
delete from the drop down menu now we
can start building the website I've gone
over hundreds of different themes and
for this particular website I've chosen
the tesseract theme mainly because it's
free highly customizable and already has
most of the functionality that we need
it also has great tutorials how to work
with this theme and I do recommend
checking the mat if you're new to this
but right now let's just download it
after it's downloaded head back to your
dashboard and locate themes on the
appearance tab click add new and then
choose upload theme let's locate the
themes on our computer there it is let's
install it once the theme is installed
we also need to activate it now that
it's activated we can leave it as it is
for now and go create the necessary
pages that we need so in order to make
them we need to go to the pages tab and
click on add new right now I'm not going
to add any content to these pages I will
just create them for the header menu
you'll see what I mean in a couple of
minutes so let's name the pages and make
sure that it's set to full width page in
the page attributes
now just do the same thing for all the
pages that you want to have for me it's
home our services about us contact us
and testimonials now that we're done we
can visit our website and we can see
that it doesn't really look finished and
there is basically no functionality to
change that you need to click customize
in the top menu currently we're not
going to setup the whole page we're just
adding a header a footer and a menu on
the right you can see a preview of your
website and every change you make it
will automatically update the preview
first I'll go to the general tab and set
the homepage to static I'm going to
choose the page that we previously made
called home and add the orange header
first followed by the menu so let's go
to the header options and select header
colors from here you can change the text
color background color link color etc
but to do that you need to know which
colors you want to use I recommend
choosing a color palette from the web
that suits your taste but for me it's
blue orange and grey and make sure you
have the colors RBG code first I'm going
to change the background color to orange
text and link color is going to be blue
and activated color is gray
I'll change the logo text color to white
now we can go back and head to site
identity nope I mean header logo in here
you can add your site logo which I've
already made but if you don't have one
you could easily create one by clicking
create your logo it will direct you to a
website where you can easily make one
here you can search for graphic elements
that you want to have I'm going to go
with tools and select these shovels
also let's add text next to it you can
resize or recolor objects and mess
around with them as much as you want
after you're satisfied with the results
in the bottom right you can crop your
logo and hit save it will automatically
save it as a PNG with a transparent
background now to add it to your page
change the logo type to image and click
select image you can upload a previously
made image or use the logo you just made
by simply dropping it here let's choose
the image and we're good it's a bit
narrow so I'm going to change the header
size a bit just slightly bigger
and let's go to the header menu font
styles in here you can change the text
size and font so let's change the font
weight to 300 and font size to 17
in order to add a menu we need to
navigate back and select the menu tab
from here click on the add a menu button
let's give it a name and select where
it's going to be placed in our site I'm
going to display in the header section
we can choose which pages we want it to
show I'm going to select all the
previously made pages then click on
reorder hmmm
I think our services should be first
followed by about us then contact us and
testimonials will be last nice now we
can click Save and publish and we have a
menu it still doesn't look quite right
so I'm going back to the header text tab
let's make the font weight bigger 600
should be nicer
now that our header and menu is done
let's also set up the footer I'm going
to copy the footer text that I already
have but you can also write your own
text now let's navigate to footer
options and click on footer content here
it gives us many options to choose from
I'm going to go with the HTML option
which lets you add a link or text to
your footer copy or write over the pre
written text and then head to footer
colors I'm going to copy the color code
from my color palette again and change
the background color to blue also we
need to change the text font you can
choose whatever font you like I'm going
to go with lotto now let's change the
color of the text a bit white stands out
too much let's make it slightly more
gray so that it blends better with the
blue background yeah that's much better
now we can copy the color code and make
the link color match the text color
perfect the header and footer sections
are now set up and we can start building
the main content part of the website
click Save and publish now in order to
make the website look like that we're
going to need a plugin called beaver
builder in the WordPress dashboard head
to the plugins tab and click on add new
type in the search beaver builder
and install and activate the first
result
to see how it works we need to visit our
site and as you can see in the top
there's a new tab called page builder it
offers you a tour if it's your first
time since I'm already familiar with it
I'm going to click no thanks but I
recommend taking the tour if you haven't
used it so in order to add a hero
section we're going to need to go to
content blocks and locate hero explorer
there are many options to choose from
but personally I've always liked this
one
firstly let's change the text by
clicking on it this will open the text
editor so let's change the title to we
fix your stuff set the color to white
and I think I'm going to make it bold as
well yeah that's better now I'm going to
copy paste the subtext which is almost
like a company slogan and align it to
the center as for the buttons you need
to hover over them and click the edit
button this will let you edit where the
button redirects the clicker I'm going
to change that to my Contact Us page
which is a slash contact - US I know
that it's that because in the beginning
we change the permalink to the post name
which means that every pages URL will be
the same as the pages name instead of a
space there's a - sign and the other one
will be /r - services now let's give
them correct names and hit save in order
to change the background picture I need
to click the tool button at the top of
the page from here we can scroll down a
bit till we see the background section
make sure it's on photo and then we can
select a new picture once again I
already have the pictures that I need
but if you don't I'll leave a couple of
awesome free picture websites in the
description
to make it fit better with the site I'm
going to give it a blue overlay just
choose your copy or desired color and
choose how intense the color will be
for this site 80% works well and now we
can hit save and it's already starting
to come along but it's a bit too big and
a bit oddly placed let's fix that once
again click the tool button and go to
the Advanced tab in the padding section
change the bottom to zero pixels it'll
make the picture a bit more narrow click
Save and also let's edit the text
highlight the title and click on the
text tab it might look a bit complicated
in here but the only thing I'm going to
do is locate the text size part and
change the PT point to px pixels yeah
that looks better
let's save it
hmm I still want the picture to be a bit
smaller
click the hero sections tool button go
to the Advanced tab and change the
bottom margins to let's say 100 pixels
that works click Save now to change the
button to orange we need to go into the
text editors text tab again and locate a
line called button primary button and
replace the primary with orange and save
nope sorry it was the wrong tab I'm
quickly going to inspect a tag uh yeah
it was just the orange button head back
to the text editor and change the
primary button tag to orange there it is
now it's orange perfect
let's change the spacing a bit more this
time a bit from the top let's say a
hundred and forty and the bottom perhaps
120
yes that's better
so now to add the feature section let's
go to the content blocks again and
choose services to once again because I
already have the text I'm just going to
copy and paste it first the headline
because my text is shorter I'm going to
make it a bit bigger paste the text and
change the color to orange
and the text to bold sorry old habits a
bit bigger you can also change the text
to bold in the font weight line hmm yeah
that looks alright now let's change the
icons once again I already have the
necessary icons and just need to upload
them click on the tools button and
select photo drag and drop them in
choose their correct odor and do the
same steps for the other two
that one didn't change for some reasons
so I'll do it again there we go
now for the text part it works exactly
the same as the hero section just copy
and paste the text and make the headline
orange
oops that's the wrong orange I'm going
to quickly correct that right I need to
set a custom color yeah that's the one
followed the same steps for the other
two icons
lastly I'm going to remove the contact
us today part since I already have that
in the hero section before adding the
next section let's just remove the
existing one looks quite good already
so we need to add this section let's
head back to the content blocks and
let's find four square there we go
now start with making the background
gray instead of white click the tool
button and change the background type to
color paste the color code and click
Save
as you can see there are only two
pictures and the content blocks need
three so to add another one I'm going to
duplicate the picture and move it into
this little blue line at the bottom it's
automatically going to be full width but
don't worry we'll fix it now let's
duplicate the text part and move it into
this little blue line next to the
picture now we have three pictures with
text boxes let's just edit the pictures
and the text once again I already have
the assets that I need
oh and I've already uploaded them as
well so let's just select a photo let's
do the same for the text copy paste it
again or just write it in as you like
align it all to the center no actually
let's just keep the headline in the
center make the headline bigger and also
change the color to orange and save as
you can see the text isn't exactly in
the center so let's change that head to
the Advanced tab change the top margins
to perhaps 80 pixels maybe a bit more
yeah 120 seems good click Save now let's
follow exactly the same steps on the
other two sections as well change the
picture and once more select the photo
copy paste the text change the size
change the color change the subtext
change the subtext color fix the spacing
paste the color code and click Save
actually I'm going to change the subtext
to white
hmm I think I'm going to make the
subtext a bit bigger let's change it to
18 pixels instead of 16 do the same for
the other text then the top right and we
can click done followed by publish we're
still missing the testimonial section in
order to add that let's go back to page
builder content blocks and search for
simple closed
let's change the text to black and the
background type to none and hit save
copy/paste or in your case maybe write
the text and I'm going to make it Orange
and change the name of the person to who
set it now we need to add a link here
let's call it read testimonials and
click on the chain looking icon we need
to address where the link will direct
because of the permalink structure I
already know that my testimonials page
URL is slash testimonials I want to make
that link into a button unfortunately
you can't do it by dragging and dropping
you need to use the button tag which we
used in the hero section so in the text
editor go to the text tab and locate the
link name that we just added and write
class equals quote button primary -
button end quote in front of it I'll
leave that line in the description box
so you can copy/paste it just make sure
you paste it before the links name once
you're done click Save
let's make the spacing a bit narrower in
the Advanced tab change the bottom
padding to zero pixels now there is
still a call to actions section to add
so once again let's head to the content
box and search for CTA simple
once added let's change the background
color to blue
copy/paste or write the text
change the links name and also its
destination which for me is slash
contact - us so when clicked on it would
lead to the correct page let's also make
the button orange like we did in the
beginning change the secondary button
tag to orange and I'm also going to add
a solid line at the bottom
pretty good our homepage is nearly
finished let's click done and publish
hmm the header still needs a couple of
changes let's go to the dashboard and
from the appearance tab to menus first
I'm going to remove the home menu and
rename the other menus with caps lock
and hit save
let's see hmm let's make it a bit
lighter orange so had to customize
header options header colors and drag
them down a bit yeah that'll do also I'm
going to make the logo a bit smaller
perfect
and I'm going to change the menu font
let's change that to Montserrat make it
smaller back to 300 and I'm going to
make the letter spacing wider the color
isn't quite right so back header colors
and slightly lighter
overall building website is about
tweaking the little things and sometimes
it can take many tries before you get it
right but just bear with it until you
get it right yes that'll do let's mess
with the opacity
that seems right so let's save it and
start making the our services page so
click visit site go to our services page
and page builder again and let's Oh
perfect
discover home change the text like we
did previously to our services make the
text smaller and change the sub headline
to what we offer hmmm maybe change the
spacing
advanced top-20 and bottom to zero and
save also we need to change the photo so
the tool button choose the right picture
and also give it a blue overlay advanced
fix the spacing
maybe 40 or zero and eighty or rather
100 yeah that seems right
now we need another content block this
time it's called six text boxes as
before change the text make it a bit
smaller so that it fits in one line and
also align it to Center let's change it
back to 32 or even bigger the text size
box may have limitations if so then you
could change the size also in the text
tab you can change the font size number
to whatever you need
let's change the spacing yep everything
seems fine and click Save
hmm actually maybe even bigger
46 okay that's good now for the six
boxes copy/paste or write new text edit
the title and now we can just follow the
same steps for all of them
I think many of you never realized that
building a website can be this easy web
developers can ask thousands of dollars
for their work just because a lot of
people don't know how easy it can be
in the last box we need to add a button
first let's give the button a name
that's the words that will be shown on
the button highlight it and click the
chain icon this makes it a link and
choose where the button will redirect
now head to the textbox before the
button name we need to add the button
element again it will also be in the
text description so that you can just
copy it wait not blue/orange yes and
that's it for the services page click
done and publish now on to the about Us
page so about us and go to page builder
change the text we don't need the
founders link paste it in here
do the same to the main section
in the bottom section we need to change
these pictures so select photo and one
by one change all of them
we can just delete the bottom section
and done let's move on to the contact
page let's hit up the Builder page again
and in the content block take the same
hero section again in here we're going
to need to do the exact same thing that
we did in the home page and our services
pages change the picture blue overlay
and fix the spacing and of course change
the text
now for the bottom we need to look for
contact 3 oh yeah let's change the
subtext
we can delete the pictures part because
we already have a hero section oops
there we go also get rid of this and
we're just left with the headline area a
contact form code and a map so let's
change the headline first there we go
now you see this line of code this
pretty much makes the contact form work
but before it can work we're also going
to need another add-on that will create
the actual contact form so let's click
done for now and head to the plugins tab
on the dashboard add new
and search for contact form seven it's
very highly used with over a million
installs let's install it and activate
it now there is a new tab at the left
called contact from here choose the one
pre-made contact in here head to the
mail tab in the first space you can
write the email address that you want to
receive messages in and you can
customize it a bit more if you'd like
let's go back to the forum tab and copy
and paste the line of code in the blue
box and click Save
now we can head back to the page builder
and finish the contact page Contact Us
page builder
as you can see the previous code ID was
255 now if we paste our copied code here
you can see that it's ID is 78 that
means that we can get rid of the wrong
one just delete and save let's add some
spacing and done oh right we also need
to fix the maps location so click the
tool button and you could search for a
location that you want
I don't remember currently what the
current location is so I'll just leave
it as it is for now
the only thing left to do is to
testimonials page again go to the page
builder we're going to have a hero
section and three testimonials so just
as before choose discover home and again
fix the spacing add a background picture
add the blue overlay
and of course changed the text
now for the testimonials you're going to
need a simple quote content block just
the same as in the home page
change the background color change the
text
change the person who said that quote
change the text to orange and now we can
just duplicate it and once again just
copy and paste the text
make the middle ones background darker
so that it will be easier to separate
them and one more time copy paste the
text
and make an orange button which we've
already done several times in the past
add the button code
and done
our website is complete and ready
everything has been done using free
resources and it only took us an hour
