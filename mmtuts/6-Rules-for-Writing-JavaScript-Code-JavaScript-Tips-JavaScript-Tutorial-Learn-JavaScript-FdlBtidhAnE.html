rules and conventions we use from right
to have script code and it's very
important that you don't get confused
about the code that I write inside the
developer tool in this episode because
we haven't talked about JavaScript code
before so don't expect that you know
what variables and functions are and
that sort of thing so don't get confused
about the code just know that you need
to keep these rules in mind as you start
learning about these variables and
functions and so on in the following
lessons now the first rule when it comes
to JavaScript is that we end the line of
code with a semicolon
now technically we don't have to in a
line of code with semicolon even though
most people think we need to insert
JavaScript but it's a really good habit
to get used to because most programming
languages will require that the ends a
line of code using semicolons so I think
it's a really good idea to get used to
ending a line of code with the semicolon
and just to demonstrate if we were to
write documents dots body dots inner
HTML is equal to a new string that says
blah blah blah then I'm gonna write
semicolon at the end of this line of
code because I have now finished my
statements and just to test it out we
can click enter and as you can see we
now have text inside the browser for
which to zoom in so you can see it there
we go the second rule is not really a
rule but more of a convention is that we
want to write comments in our code
explaining what exactly the code does
because in case we take a long break and
we need to see the code after a couple
of months then it's a really good idea
to write comments so we know exactly
what we wrote inside our code and the
way we write comments at least in one
line is for writing forward slash
forward slash and then whatever comment
we have inside our code and when we
write a comment it's just going to get
ignored when the code gets parsed inside
the browser so it doesn't actually read
the code it just sees it as a comment
and ignores it now if I want to write
more than one line of code we can use
forward slash multiply multiply forward
slash and whatever goes in between the
multiplication symbols is going to be
part of a comment and we can also go on
a new line if you want to and continue
the comments like so simple word to have
a piece of code that maybe teams to
color the menu a cadenza we have a
comment that says this changes the menu
hello and then we have a comment inside
our code now the next thing I'm going to
talk about is the fact that JavaScript
is case sensitive meaning that if we
were to create something like a variable
and call it names and set it equal to
Daniel because that is my name and if it
were to then grab the variable
afterwards by may be alerting it inside
the browser so we want to alert names
and then you guys can see we get Daniel
inside the alert but if we were to do
the same thing and instead alerts names
with a big end so it's very important
that if you name something with a non
capitalized a capitalized letter that we
then continue to reference to it the
exact same way we spelled it and when it
comes to naming inside JavaScript we
have a couple of rules that we want to
follow
when it comes to specific JavaScript
elements that we want to name for
example when we have variables and
functions and methods we don't start out
with a capitalized letter so in the
example I wrote the name we want to
start out with a non capitalized letter
but if you want to include multiple
words inside the variable name such as
name list then I want to start the next
word with a capitalized letter so I want
to say name list like so and then lastly
we have something called constants which
is a new type of variable we got not
long ago and we name these variables
with all caps
meaning that if we were to create a
Const variable and name it something
like again names I need to make sure the
names is all capitalized and don't worry
too much about this error I just got
here's just because it didn't actually
declare anything with it so we can say
Const name instead of equal to blah blah
blah and then you guys can see we don't
get any error messages because we need
to set something equal to the constant
variable now the last thing I want to
talk about is the fact that white space
inside code doesn't technically matter
but it helps make code easier for us to
read as humans meaning that if we were
to create this line of code here
document dot body dot inner HTML is
equal to blah blah blah semicolon and
then variable name is equal to Daniel
and then enter as you can see we don't
get any kind of error messages but
because everything in his on one line
and there's no spacing there's no next
line in between it becomes harder for us
as humans taxi understands what exactly
is going on inside the code because
everything has been written out in one
line of code which means that we might
mix up the code inside our heads so even
though whitespace doesn't technically
matter for the machine it's really
important for us humans to understand
what is going on inside the code now in
the futures we start creating more
JavaScript code it's important they to
remember some of these rules and
conventions we just talked about and
again if you get confused about some of
these rules and convince and so you can
always come back to the video and watch
it again
now in the next episode we're gonna
start talking about variables inside
Java scripts which is something we
constantly use when we create JavaScript
application so it's very important to
talk about variables so we guys enjoyed
and see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
