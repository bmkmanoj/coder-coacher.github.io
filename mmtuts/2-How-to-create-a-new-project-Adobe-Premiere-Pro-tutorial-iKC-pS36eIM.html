set up a new project inside Premiere Pro
and as you guys can see I already start
up the program now once you start it up
you're gonna get this a window here that
gives you some options either you can
see a recent projects you can see your
libraries you can synchronize your
settings or we can actually go down and
start up a new project or we can open an
existing project if you have somewhere
in our computer if you want to start a
new project we can click new project or
we can go up in the left corner it says
file new and the new project once you
start up a new project we get a lot of
options and this might terrify some
people in beginning but we don't
actually need to do a lot in here you
need to go ahead and choose a name for
your project I'm just gonna call my own
tutorial and then you need to choose a
saving location because this location
you want to save the project has to have
quite a bit of space in it if you save
it some of a little space you're gonna
quickly run out of space in your
computer so I'm gonna go ahead and
browse and I'm gonna go and choose my t
drive which has quite a bit of space on
it for all the different project files I
might create inside this project now
down here at the bottom we get quite a
few options we can either choose the
display format which should be set to
timecode we can also choose our audio
display format which which I'm just
gonna go ahead and set to audio samples
you can also choose to capture format
which you don't actually need to do
anything with unless you do actually
plug in a camera to a computer because
this one just basically says what kind
of format your camera is or what type of
camera you're connecting to the computer
if you want to extract footage directly
from the camera so this one you don't
act need to touch so you don't need to
worry about it saying HD or just DV now
inside our scratch disks we can choose
where we want to save small file which
are called scratch files and these files
just basically increases performance
inside the project now as a default
it saves to scratch files inside the
same path as you chose as the default
location for a project so these ones
down here we don't actually need to
touch to do anything with so to setup a
basic project all you need to do is name
it and choose where to save it
and then we're just gonna go ahead and
click okay now as soon as you start up a
new project that's gonna look like this
which is gonna have some different
windows it's gonna have a couple of
toolbars it's gonna have different taps
in it it's gonna have a decibel meter
down here in the right side and this is
basically how a new project looks like
when you have nothing inside of it yet
we don't have a timeline we don't have
any footage we don't have any audio
files we don't have anything yet so for
the next episode we're actually gonna
talk about what these specific windows
do and after we've done that we're then
gonna talk about how to set up a
timeline so we can actually see some of
the things inside our preview window and
in our timeline so if you guys enjoyed
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
