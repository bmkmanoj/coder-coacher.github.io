talk about how to create our header
inside the website and even though we
can actually see the header up here
inside our index.html we can't actually
see it inside the browser yet and that's
because we didn't style it so inside our
stylesheet we're going to go ahead and
start styling the header so what I would
like to do is underneath all the Ria's
reset CSS code that we added in the last
episode I'm going to write a comment
saying that this is where my code starts
and the way you write a comment is
providing backslash and then multiply
and then you in order to close the
comments you write x / so it's very
simple to do so in between here I'm
going to say my code just so I know that
this is where my code starts underneath
here we're going to start styling our
header so what we're going to do first
is we're simply going to style our
header by writing out header so every
single header on our website is going to
be styled with this styling I'm going to
say space I'm going to say curly
brackets open and close them and then in
between them I'm going to add some code
so I'm going to go ahead and give it a
width by writing out with colon and then
say 100% semicolon so every single time
you write a piece of CSS code you need
to close it off with a semicolon before
start writing the next line so the
reason we want to use 100% and not for
example my browser here is 2560 pixels
wide because that's the kind of monitor
I'm on a lot of people will have a
monitor that's 1920 wide because that's
their resolution on the screen now if
you want this to fit or like be
responsive to all kinds of monitors out
there then you're going to have to do it
in percent when it comes to the width
otherwise it's just not going to like I
said be responsive so what we're going
to do underneath here is we're going to
go and give it a height we're going to
give it a height as 80 pixels like so
and then we're going to go ahead and
just kind of give it a background color
so we can see what's going on so I'm
going to say background - color and then
I'm going to give it a color code by
writing out
has tagged zero zero zero which is for
black and then semicolon I'm going to
save it and then refresh our browser and
there we have now of course I have
actually sumed in for you guys now has
actually assumed in five hundred percent
I think no four hundred percent three
hundred percent so you guys could see it
if I were to zoom out at a hundred
percent you guys can see that eighty
pixels is not actually a lot so what
we're going to do with this header is
we're going to go ahead and put our logo
up here we're going to put a this title
about site and we're going to put a menu
inside this header so that's what we're
going to do in the next episode so right
now we do actually have a header and we
can actually see it so thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you guys next
