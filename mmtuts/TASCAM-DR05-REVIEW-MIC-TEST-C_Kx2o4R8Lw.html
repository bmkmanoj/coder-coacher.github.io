today we're going to take a look at a
device called the tascam dr-05 i got it
yesterday so i had about a day or so to
fiddle around with some of the features
and stuff it had so what we're gonna do
today is i'm going to show you guys some
of the features it has and what we're
gonna do at the end is do a microphone
test between the m-audio producer
microphone i'm using right now and the
tascam dr-05 so before we get started
all that I would like to show you guys
what it came with when I got this
microphone or the the recorder it came
in a box like so bear send that box
it was very well packed up with a bunch
of foam balls to stuff inside the
package from FedEx it came inside this
thing which also had two batteries for
it so you don't need to actually buy
batteries for them to get it I would
recommend doing so anyways because
usually the battery should get with
recorders are not too good to start with
so but this is in fact the recorder with
the batteries that came with as you can
see it has a couple of neat buttons it's
very easy to press it gives a very nice
sound when you press them and you don't
feel like you know when you have those
new cellphones with touch screens and
stuff you don't well you can't really
feel the buttons being pressed you can
actually feel the buttons very nicely on
this thing
it came with a bunch of manuals in
different languages just to show you
guys it came with a whole bunch of
manuals it's a big package this has all
sorts of languages so you know if you
need to look up any features you can
always look up the manual I did in fact
has to have to go through the manual a
couple of times just to see if it had a
couple of features that I really needed
it to have so what we're gonna do now is
I'm really quickly going to show you
guys two device and show you guys how it
works so when we take a look at this
test cam up close you can see that has
quite a few buttons on it one thing I
want to note before we get started is
that the buttons down here are very nice
to press when you click them you have a
really good feeling of actually clicking
something you can actually hear the
sound of it being clicks which to me I
think is a very nice feature to have on
it let me take a look at it you can see
that it has a pause button which is the
same button to hold in in order to turn
it on and off so as you can see I just
turn it off here turn it on the screen
is
very nice to look at if you're used to
assume or test chem it's not too
difficult to figure out so it's very
similar to all the other devices out
there if I want to record something you
can see that I do have a record button
the thing about it is that you have to
click it once and then it goes into a
pre record mode which is a mode where
you adjust the sound levels and stuff
before it actually starts recording if I
want to turn off the microphone if I
don't think the microphone
you know picks up enough sound I need to
click the forward and the backward
button down here in order to you know
adjust a micro microphone input levels
if I want to turn up and down the volume
for the headset if I have a headset
plugged in on the side here I need to
click the plus and minus button so it's
not too difficult if I want to record I
need to click the record button a second
time it announced now it is in fact
recording as you can see it has a
counter up here it counts I don't know
if you guys can see it when the screen
goes dark but it does have a counter
that you know starts recording down here
it says that is as the thirteenth clip
I'm recording so it does in fact number
each clip to your recording which is
nice so if I just turn it off here if I
want to stop the recording
I can click the pause button like so and
it does in fact stop the entire
recording and saves it if I want to
continue the recording if I just want to
pause it and continue it maybe a few
minutes later on the same clip I can
click the record button one more time
and it just passes it and it doesn't
store it so it just passes it and I can
click the record again and if does in
fact start continuing the same clip
which is a nice feature so like I
mentioned it does in fact come with a
line out what it has said if you want to
listen in on the headset as you're
recording on the other side here it
comes with a hole in order to put in
your microSD card it does in fact come
in two gigabytes to start with which i
think is a very nice little detail about
the product it has a USB entrance you
know when you have to hook it up to the
computer and actually transfer your
recordings to your computer one really
nice feature about this if you're
sitting at the computer and want to use
the device in order to just record voice
over and stuff like that for YouTube or
something if you hook up the device you
get a
option of either just like transferring
stuff from the tascam to the computer or
if you want to use the computer to power
the test cam so you don't need to use
battery and then you can just sit and
use the test camp as a recorder being
you know powered by the computer so
don't have to use battery on it so you
can actually use it as a podcasting
device if you take a look at the back
here you can see it does in fact have
speakers one thing about the speakers is
that they're not very loud you do
actually need to go into the device into
the settings turn on the speakers and
when you need to listen to it you do
actually need to bring the device all
the way up to your ear in order to hear
it so it is you know only meant as a
emergency speaker thing if you don't
have a headset on you so you can you
know listen to your recordings that is I
think that's nice I don't think you need
to play it very loud so as an emergency
I think it's a very nice detail it does
come with these rubber things so you can
actually put it down very nicely without
it getting scratched I think that's nice
too at the top of the device you can
actually see you have a microphone
entrance if you have an external
microphone like a clip on you want to
use one interview you can in fact plug
it in up here one thing that's very
important you do though if you use a
microphone is that you need to make sure
to check if the microphone you have
needs phantom power or not phantom power
is when you have a microphone that needs
to be powered up by whatever device is
plugged into so if you need a device
with phantom power you do need to go
into the device and you need to turn on
mic power inside the settings before you
plug in the microphone otherwise you
might screw up the microphone okay if
you're not using an external microphone
you do need to make sure the mic power
is turned off otherwise you might screw
up the microphone setup here on the test
cam so you need to make sure you're
constantly keeping you know an eye on
these settings so you don't screw up any
microphones so if we actually try and
turn on this task I want to show you
guys what exactly does and as you can
see it takes very little time in order
to turn on when you turn it on and go
straight into record mode where you can
start recording if I click menu down
here it goes into a menu you know a list
where it has different kind of menu
settings you can go in and change you
have record setting you have play
setting you have browse speakers and
others if I take the top
to start with you can see that you can
actually change the format of the
recording you're doing right now mine is
set to wove 16-bit you can actually go
up and choose mv3 if you want to which
is a nice little feature just gonna keep
mine and why of 16-bit for now the
sample rate you can also choose to
change that one depending on what you're
recording down here you have the type
you can actually switch from mono to
stereo the the preset is stereo when you
get it so if you do podcasting you do
probably want to change it to mono down
here we can actually choose the size we
want to record on right now it's two
gigabyte like I said it is the the card
that came with the the test cam recorder
down here is the feature that's very
important to note if you use a external
microphone and it's a microphone that
requires phantom power you do need to go
in and switch this one to on in order to
use the microphone probably even don't
do this and use an external microphone
that does need phantom power you can
actually break the microphone so make
sure it's turned on when you use an
external microphone and when you're not
using one it needs to be a nun off if
you go down here you can actually choose
the different other settings not too
important though if you go back you can
access either play settings down here we
can actually see that you can choose you
know where to save your files and stuff
like that you can change the play EQ if
you want to change it from treble you
know middle bass you can do different
many things here I'm just going to go
ahead and change the back again like so
if you go out again and go to the Browse
you can actually see all the different
recordings I've done and you can
actually see that they're all stored
right here if I want to delete them I
simply go to one of them and I choose
quick down here and I can actually
choose to either see the info or delete
it or add it to a list so you can delete
and then you can click yes and then
delete if recording if you go down to
the speaker settings if you want to use
the speaker that's on the back of the
device you do actually need to turn this
one on it's not little a loud speaker
like I said you do need to put it up two
years so I'm just gonna keep that off
for now
if I go down to others you can see
there's you can actually see a little
bit of information about you know two
you can do various different things you
can actually tune stuff if you have a
instrument you can actually choose this
as a tuner and I'm just gonna try to
whistle with her so you can actually see
it so you can actually see it's actually
you know telling me what kind of tune
I'm whistling that's a common eyes
feature it can change the filenames to
date and time and as you can see about
the system and stuff okay so before we
turn off this episode I would like to
show you guys a little sound test in
order to see how good is this Tascam
actually so I have my microphone set up
here there's actually recording right
now and what I'm gonna do here is I'm
gonna hold up the test cam next to the
microphone and I'm gonna talk into both
of them and then I'm gonna turn on and
off the different microphone so you guys
can hear the difference so I'm just
gonna go ahead and get it ready here I
clicked it once I'm gonna test the sound
levels to see if it's good enough and it
does seem like it is okay I'm gonna
click again now it's recording so I'll
put it up to my mouth here and I'm
actually gonna talk into both
microphones in the same time switching
on and off the different microphones so
as you can hear right now I'm talking
into the producer microphone you can
hear the quality quality here I have not
done anything other than made sure that
the decibels were the same I have not
done any noise removal I'm gonna go into
the test cam now and I'm going to show
you guys the difference I'm not sure
which one has the most background noise
but I do in fact know that the test cam
has a little bit warmer sound when I
talk into it it does give off this warm
feeling when you talk and the sound is
very nice I think for a tascam so I'm
gonna go back in to produce a microphone
right now so you can hear a difference
I'm gonna go back into the task cam so
you guys can hear it different I'm just
gonna switch back and forward just a
little bit back and forward here so you
guys can hear the difference between the
microphones so I'm gonna turn it off
here I'm gonna go ahead and enough this
episode I hope you guys enjoyed this now
my overall thought about this test cam I
can't really tell you guys too much
about if it's good or not because I've
only had it for a day or so enough to
just play around some of the features
but for now it does seem like a good
purchase and it is in fact personally I
think it is better than the producer USB
microphone not because it's newer stuff
like that but I
have checked the quality and I have
played around with it and my experience
is that it might have slightly more
background noise than the USB producer
does slightly it's like barely
noticeable but it does give off a mots
warmer sound which i think is a very
nice thing so I might actually use this
one to record any future YouTube episode
from now on if it does in fact fit in my
microphone holder so you know thank you
guys for watching I hope you guys found
this little video useful and I hope to
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
