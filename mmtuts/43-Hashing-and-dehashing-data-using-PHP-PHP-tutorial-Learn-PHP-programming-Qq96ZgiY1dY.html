bee has using PHP code and the reason
this is so important to learn is because
in some cases inside our websites we
build applications that allow for users
to go to a website and then type an
information that we then save inside a
database now because we save data inside
a database that the user provided in
some cases like with a login system we
need to make sure that some of the data
that the user types in is unreadable
inside the database because let's take
an example where person forces the way
into our database and Reis all the
information we want to make sure that
some of the data at least the sensitive
data is unreadable and doesn't make
sense so we need to be able to take
information like a password if a person
were to sign up inside a website and
make it unreadable and then insert it
inside our database and then once we do
actually need to login the user we need
to take the password and then D has it
so we can actually see what it looks
like and allow for them to log in so
what we're going to go and do today is
we're going to learn how to has and B
has using the PHP function called
password on the score has which is a
really strong one-way hashing algorithm
which currently support the hansung
method we're going to use called bcrypt
which is an algorithm that is built into
the PHP language which gets updated as
time goes on which make sure that the
bcrypt method is always up-to-date so
compared to other hand methods we used
to have in the past called md5 or Stata
256 this one is always up to date and
should be used when you want to have
passwords for some other kind of
information inside a website okay now
one more thing I want to mention
regarding the pass or underscore hash
function we're going to go ahead and use
is that salt is included inside this
function so in case some of you might be
asking well soon we also salt the
password then I can tell you that the
salt function is included inside the
password underscore hash function so we
don't need to worry about it now for you
people don't actually know what salt is
it's basically when we add a random
string to our password before inserting
it inside the database to make it even
harder for people to figure out what the
password is so don't worry too much
about it if you haven't heard about it
before
just know that salt is included in that
password on the score hash now as you
guys can see in front of me here I have
very basic index of PHP file and inside
of this file we're going to go ahead and
include the password underscore hash
function and I'm going to go to
got a couple of things about it just so
you guys know exactly what we're going
to do with it once we do actually start
using it in real applications so inside
my body tags I'm going to create PHP
tags and inside these PHP tags we're
going to go ahead and create a echo I'm
going to go and echo out test' one two
three which is going to be a pretend
password that we're going to use in the
future
so let's say a user types in the
password called test one two three then
I'm going to go ahead and echo out a
break just a regular HTML break and then
underneath a I'm going to include a
third echo which is going to echo out
the hashing function we're going to go
and use in this episode though so you
guys can actually see what it actually
does to a password want to do actually
has it so we're going to say we have a
function called password underscore hash
parentheses and then inside the
parentheses we need to include two
different parameters the first one it's
going to be the password that we want to
ask which is test one two three which is
up here I'm just going to take it and
put it inside as the first parameter
then the second parameter is going to be
the method we want to use and right now
we have two methods we have decrypt and
we have something called crypt
underscore below face now we're not
going to get into Krypton scope Blowfish
but we're going to be using B crypt for
this lesson year so we're going to say
want to use password underscore defaults
which is the bcrypt method and then I'm
going to go and save this and go inside
my browser and then refresh so you guys
can actually see what actually happens
inside our websites as you guys can see
right now we have two different pieces
of text we have tests one two three
which is the regular password and then
after hashing it we have this long
Tipperary string that we have here so as
you guys can see if I were to go inside
a database and then see it is I can't
actually tell what the password actually
is and as you guys can see each time i
refresh the browser you guys can see it
changes meaning that it's going to get
randomized each time we use the password
underscore hash function so the basic
idea here is that we want to take a
password win for example a user signs up
inside the website and then do the
hashing function to it and then insert
the hashed password which is this one
inside the database now that also means
that once you like to create the
database we need to insert a user into
you when you do have to create the
password column you need to make sure
you can at least have 60 characters
inside the color okay now in the future
there might be updates to it which is
why I recommend that you guys allow for
at least 256 characters just would make
sure that we can actually have all the
characters inside the database but just
know that if you don't actually get the
password inserted inside the database
when a user signs up then you need to
check if you allow for as many
characters as a has password actually
generates okay so what we're going to go
and do now is we're going to go ahead
and take a look at how to actually has a
has password so if we go back inside the
code I'm going to go ahead and go
underneath here and I'm just going to go
ahead and just comment on what we have
here so far then I'm going to create a
variable called input which is going to
be what the user actually types in when
it goes to your website and tries to log
in so we're going to set this one as
test quantity three input is the
password he types in this can move it
out and then we're going to create a
second variable which is going to be
called hashed password in database which
basically means that this is the
password we have inside the database
right now I want to actually calculate
what we have up here like so which means
the right now the password inside the
database now needs to be used in order
to check if this password is equal to
the password inside the database when
the user actually logs in and you might
be asking well right now test one two
three looks like test one two three and
it has password down it's going to look
like this long string of text so right
now these won't actually match up when
we match them up inside our code so what
we need to do here is underneath here is
we need to do a function called pass
underscore verify which is the other
side the coin when it comes to password
underscore hats so the password let's go
has hands to password and password I'm
just go verify actually D has to set so
I'm going to echo out the function
called password underscore verify
parentheses semicolon and then I'm going
to insert two different parameters I'm
going to insert the password the user
typed in which is input and then the
second parameter is going to be the
password from inside the database which
right now looks like gibberish
so once we do this and then I refresh
the browser you guys can see we get a 1
which means that the passwords do
actually match because 1 is equal to
true and 0 is equal to false so right
now we did actually get a match when you
match the two passwords together so this
is basically how you can have some D has
data before inserting it inside a
database now in case you guys want to
see a real-life example of how to
actually use this inside let's say login
system then I'm going to leave a link in
the description of this video so you
guys can see how to use it inside for
example a login system now the link in
the description Gus actually send you to
a complete tutorial how to create a
login system so if you guys also insert
in learning how to actually build a
complete login system then you can also
watch that video if you want to I just
want to point out that inside my login
system tutorial I'm using MySQL I node
to interact with the database so if you
guys want to learn how to do it using
prepared statements you need to download
the lesson files from my login system
tutorial because inside the lesson files
I have an example of how to do it using
MySQL I and I have another example of
how to do it using prepared statements
ok so if you guys enjoyed and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
