a banner using javascript and as you
guys can see in front of me here I have
a very basic demo or what we're going to
be building in this episode and as you
guys can see is a very basic banner that
switches up a few seconds we can
actually customize the amount of seconds
it should take before it actually
switches and if I were to hover my mouse
cursor inside this banner you guys can
see it actually passes from actually
changing because there's a nice feature
for the users who might visit your
website and we can actually go ahead and
change the images inside the banner
using buttons if it were to click it you
guys can see we do actually change the
banner images now another thing about
these banners is we can actually go and
add text to them so right now do you
have some text this is not inside the
image this is actual HTML text that also
changes with the banner women to
actually change the image inside the
banner now the text will also have
different positions we can style that
using CSS so we're going to go and build
this today and the first thing we're
going to do in order to do this is I'm
going to go to open up and index that
HTML file and just write the basic code
we need to have in order to have a
regular HTML page so as you guys can see
it just had the very basic tags in here
but I have nothing else inside our
document so what we're going to do here
is I'm just going to open up one we're
going to be building today which is this
empty page one out because we had
nothing inside our documents and we're
going to go ahead and get started on
actually building it because we will be
using CSS in this episode so I'm going
to go and create a link tag so we can
actually link to us down sheet you guys
do know how to do this but now because
this is just basic HTML and inside the
body tag I'm going to go ahead and
include a div now when we create a
banner we need to have just a basic
container we can actually have the
banner images inside of so right now
just to illustrator for you guys right
now inside this demo I have a box which
you can see here that has three images
inside of it we do actually have images
next to each other so we have an image
so we can the left side we have to
censor image and then we have the image
to the right and then what I do is every
couple of seconds the images actually
change places and then the last image on
the left side here actually goes back
behind images and then it all starts
over like a loop so that's basically how
we're going to do it in this episode
and in order to get this box in here
would you actually need to have a
container so inside the HTML document
I'm going to go ahead and create a div
tag
now this div tag is going to have a
class set to main banner just so we have
something we can actually style inside
the CSS and I'm going to go to include
an ID because we're going to go to use
this ID when we include the JavaScript
so I'm going to say we have a main -
banner I'm just going to give the same
name as the class over here then
afterwards we're going to go and include
the images we're going to insert inside
the banner so we're just going to do two
HTML first then we're going to do two
CSS and then we're going to do two
JavaScript so the images I'm going to go
to insert is going to be not inside
image tags but inside div tags and then
I'm going to include the images as a
background inside the div tags and the
reason I'm going to do that is I want to
have this text outside the band in order
to do this it was easier just to include
the images as a background now if you
guys are interested in having the images
Mike's using for this episode you can go
ahead and find them in the description
of this video so you can just go and
download them so you have some material
for this lessons here so I'm going to go
and create a div tag and inside this div
tag I'm going to go to include a class
I'm going to call this class image ban
IMG pen which stands for image banner
then afterwards I'm going to go ahead
and give it an ID so we can actually
target this image using javascript so
I'm going to go and call this one image
then three and then I'm going to go to
move the div tag or at least a closing
tag down to the next line now you might
be asking why do we start using the
third image because right now I said
image span three which stands for the
third image you might have inside the
banner that's because when we load a
HTML page inside the browser I want to
make sure the first picture we need to
actually see inside the pattern has to
be the one that loads the last and the
only reason for that is if I were to
actually go to the website and load the
images then the images might end up
actually loading a ton of each other
visibly inside the browser and we don't
want to actually see it so no to not see
it I want to go ahead and start with the
third image first and then I'm going to
go and include the second image which is
going to be the image banner number two
and then the last one which is going to
be image banner number one so just to
make sure you guys
stand the last one here is going to be
the first image we see inside the
browser this one is going to be the
second and this one is going to be the
third one when the banners to axis which
places inside the image banner now I'm
going to go and save this then I'm going
to go to open up a new document and save
it as style that CSS so once it style
dot CSS which is going to be discounted
we link to previously so inside this
document I'm going to go and include a
couple of stylings just some default
ones to make sure we get the right
effect inside the browser so we're going
to go ahead and say we have a
multiplication symbol which means that
we're styling everything inside the
website I'm going to set a margin to
zero I'm going to set a padding to zero
and then afterwards I'm going to go and
give the entire web page a background
color just so we can actually see the
banners inside the browser so I'm going
to go and say if you have the body tag
going to move up to curly brackets and
give it a background color I'm going to
go and call this one has tag f3f3f3 just
to get some kind of light gray
background color now this is basically
all the default styling needs have
inside this website so now we can
actually get started on styling the
actual banner inside the index page so
we were to go down underneath the body
tag I can go and say we have a class
called
main - banner curly brackets and then
inside this class we're going to go and
include a margin set to zero Auto
and the reason for that is that we do
actually want to Center the banner and
again this main banner styling here is
going to be the container for all the
images inside the banner which is the
first day we created so if I go back
inside the class I'm going to go and
include a width and a height because the
container is going to determine the
width and the height of all the pictures
inside the banner so I'm going to go
inside a width to 1200 pixels we want to
set a height to 400 pixels we're going
to set a background color to hash tag FF
which is going to be a white colleges
who connected see the container forward
to not have any kind of pictures in it
yet then afterwards we need to include a
overflow set to hidden
and the reason for that is right now
inside the banner if I were to take the
demo here you guys can see we have one
image inside the banner now in the image
slides it actually slides out outside
the container and the reason we can't
see it when it slides out is because
right now the container has an overflow
set to hidden so as soon as any kind of
elements go outside the container you
can't see it
so that's basically what we're doing
with the styling here now the last thing
we need to include is a position set to
relative now you might be asking why do
we need to have a position relative well
right now the thing that actually
determines how the banner should
actually move so right now it's actually
inside the banner if we were to click
Next
you guys considered the Bennis lights
out of the picture now the thing that
determines that is going to be a
precision absolute inside our styling so
in order to have a precision absolute
included inside the container the
container has to have a position
relative otherwise the image is just
going to be snug at the bottom or
something else and we don't want to do
that so we need to have a position
relative in a container if any of the
child elements has a position absolute
at least if you want two images to stay
inside the container so that's basically
why I'm including this and this will
actually make sense to you later when we
do include the actual styling for the
images so let's go ahead and style the
actual images inside the banner we're
going to go and include a class called
main task banner then inside the main
banner class we have an ID set to image
ban three and then we're going to open
up the curly brackets so right now we're
actually doing is including the first
image inside the banner so before we can
include the images inside this ID here
let's actually go to add the images
inside our root folder so right now you
guys can see I have no images in here
I'm just going to go and paste in the
images I have in the download link in
the description that you guys can also
download so I'm just going to go and
include it and inside of here you guys
will notice that we have the two buttons
that we can click on the sides and we
also have two images for the banner I
just call it been a one and A two been a
three you guys can give you some kind of
other names you want to I just decide to
call it this now inside our stylesheet
I'm going to go and include the first
image so I'm going to set a background
desk image
include the URL which is going to be
inside an image folder forward slash
banner 3 dot jpg like so and then I'm
going to go and include a background
size so I'm going to zip background -
sighs I'm going to set it to cover to
make sure it covers the entire container
that is inside up then we're going to
set a background position we're going to
set it to center just to make sure we do
actually have the image sensor inside
this banner and then we're going to set
up background repeat' to no-repeat like
so now that we have the styling for the
first image that's actually going to
just copy paste just two more times
because we need to have a banner 1 and a
banner - so just going to set the second
one to two and the last one to one also
make sure to change the image names
inside of here so we're going to change
it to one and two now this was basically
just including the images but the actual
dip box that images the inside of right
now does not have a width and a height
so who were to go back inside index.html
file right now we just have this dip box
here that has a class in its ban and an
ideas image span three so right now we
said that this IP here's would have this
background image but we also need to
tell it to have a height and a width and
we're going to go ahead and do that by
standard span to make sure that all
these three images have the exact same
styling so inside my stylesheet before
we include the styling foot IDs
I'm going to go ahead and copy what we
have down here just to have something to
start with and I'm going to go and
delete everything inside this styling
and instead of having an image span
three that is an ID I'm going to change
it to a class and say we have an image
ban then inside this image bans darling
I'm going to go and give it a width I'm
going to set it to 100% to make sure it
goes all the way to left and right and a
height set to 100% like so
then I'm going to go and give it a
precision absolute and again like I
mentioned before the precision absolute
is not going to work unless we have a
persistent relative inside the main
banner styling up here so we need to
make sure we have this position relative
in order to get this working I'm going
to say position:absolute then afterwards
we're going to style a top and set it to
zero pixels meaning that all three
images is going to be at the top part of
the container at all times now in order
to just get some kind of transition
effects when we do axis slide images so
it doesn't just pop really fast from one
image to the other I'm going to go to
include a transition which again is not
necessary but just to get another effect
we can go ahead and do this so I'm going
to say transition all space ease - in -
out and let's set it to 500 milliseconds
I'm just going to go and copy this paste
it below make sure we have a WebKit
styling as well again if you're not
familiar with this sort of styling we're
basically doing this to make sure it
works inside all browsers so I'm just
going to go ahead and go down one more
time it's actually going to copy this
line we just did and make sure we can
get this working inside Firefox so we're
going to go and say mocks which is the
Firefox browser then the next line and
then include a pyrrha so just going to
say oh so now we have all the different
browsers styled and we can go ahead and
get started on creating the JavaScript
code note to get this banner working so
right now let's actually see what we
have inside the browser
if it were to refresh you guys can see
it right now we have one image inside a
container that doesn't move so right now
it says the static image and all these
images right now on top of each other so
the words actually remove this top image
with the mountains we would see the next
image behind it okay so what we need to
make sure now is that using javascript
we're going to position these images so
that one image is in the left side over
here one image is in the center which it
is right now and the last one is going
to be on the right side so inside our
index.html file I'm going to go ahead
and go down to the bottom of our
document and I'm going to go and include
a script tag like so now inside the
script tag we're going to include the
JavaScript node to actually get this
working here now inside the script tags
the first thing I'm going to do is when
a good and creative there
Ripple I'm going to call this one Benna
status and basically what this variable
does is that it keeps count or at least
keeps track of which image is right now
the current image inside the banner so
right now I'm going to go and say we
have a set of set to one we know that
this is the first status inside the
browsers are right now this would
actually be the first image that has
status as one then inside status number
two we have the second image and then
the status number three we have the
third image the next I'm going to set is
the timer for how long does it actually
take so I'm going to go and say we have
a banner timer set to 4,000 which is
going to be four seconds inside
JavaScript and again at any point inside
the code you can actually go and change
this if you're just testing something
and need to have the banner switching
really fast you can set this one to one
or two so I can actually see it faster
and if you want the banner to be eight
seconds long instead of four you can
change it to 8,000 so now that we have
this we need to create a function that
actually changes the images using
javascript so what we're going to go and
do is say that we have a function that
is called banner loop parentheses curly
bracket and then inside of this function
here we're going to start out by
creating an if statement that actually
says if we're inside Benna status number
one then the images needs to behave in
this way so right now we're going to say
if banner status is equal to one then do
this blogger code inside this if
statement now what I wanted to do inside
the if statement if we do actually have
a status as one is to give all the
banner images a persistent absolute
right styling meaning that right now
we're going to tell it that the images
should be this many pixels from the
right side of the container and then
we're just basically going to manipulate
these numbers each time we get to a new
status inside the website now the second
thing you need to include in here when
it comes to styling it's also to make
sure we have the images in the right
layers using a set index CSS styling to
make sure we don't get any kind of wonky
or weird effects when the images
actually slide on top of each other
because it's entually we could actually
risk the one image when it needs to
slide in and replace
the other one actually slides under the
current image we should always have the
next image slide on top of the current
image I'm going to do that using again
CSS styling using javascript so we're
going to go and start up by saying you
have a document dot get element by ID
parentheses and then we're going to go
and say we have a image ban one which is
going to be the first image up here that
is right here and we want to do
something with it using CSS so right now
we want to style the banner or at least
give it a different styling using
javascript so we're going to say we want
to style the right side inside this
position absolute set it equal to double
quotes zero pixels meaning the right now
image number one which is image span one
it's going to be leaning all the way up
against the right side of the container
and then it's just going to continue to
let that until it has this represent
width so right now we should have the
first image fitting perfectly inside the
banner container if I then go back
inside the styling I also want to make
sure it has a set index set to something
like a thousand so I'm just going to go
and copy what we have here and I'm going
to go and say we target the same banner
which is going to be image span number
one and I want to style something which
is not going to be a right but instead
at set index we're going to say set
index with the big eye which is how we
actually style set index using
javascript and I'm going to go and set
it to a thousand just to give it some
kind of set index hierarchy or some kind
of layer using CSS and then we're going
to go and do the exact same thing for
image span number two and three so I'm
just going to go and copy this paste it
down two more times and change it from
one to two in the middle two ones and
the last one we're going to change to
image span number three now we need to
change the numbers in here because right
now the first image which is image band
number one is perfectly centered inside
this image banner now the second image
spanner is going to be positioned
differently so we want image span number
two to be the next image that slides in
meaning that this image right now
technically needs to be persistent on
the right side
this banner because it needs to slide in
and fit inside this container so in
order to give it this outside position
we need to style it with a precision
right which is not zero pixels but minus
1200 pixels so right now this image is
going to be a negative 1200 pixels to
the side meaning that the left side of
the image is going to start right where
the image container stops then we're
going to do the exact same thing for
image span number three which instead is
going to be 1200 pixels to the left side
of the image banner container so I'm
going to say not zero pixels but 1200
pixels so hope it makes sense to you
guys to what we're actually doing here
is positioning the images on the left
side the center and the right side of
the container now the image Venom to set
index should not be a thousand because
right now we want this image to slide in
on top of the center image so it should
actually have a higher set index then
the current centered image which is
image Bend number one that has a
thousand so this set index would be 1000
something that's actually higher than a
thousand which I'm just going to go and
set to 1500 just to have some kind of
number in here then the last one down
here because it's on the left side and
it has to go all the way back and be
positioned on the right side after Damon
to switch next time I'm going to set it
to a lower number than 1000 so I'm going
to set this one to 500 then a third
benefit switched around using the CSS
styling here we need to make sure we
change the banner status right now to
set to one so I'm going to go and copy
what we have up here and paste the
pilota if statement and say Venice that
is should now be two so now we're
changing it so the next time we do
actually run this panel OOP it's not
going to go and run this blogger code
here because the next time the banner
status is not going to be equal to one
now we should actually not include this
here which it acts included inside the
if statement like so now before creating
the next if statement it has a balance
that is equal to two I'm going to do a
second thing inside of here because when
we start looping this loop in here I
want to make sure the back image which
right now is image 3 when it is to go
Loup behind the actual slider I want to
give it an opacity set to zero just to
make sure we don't get any kind of
screw-ups when the images switch around
since we do essentially have three
images switching around inside the
banner so just to make sure we don't get
any kind of other images showing I'm
going to give it a opacity set to zero
just to make it invisible so I'm going
to go and go below what we have here
inside the document.getelementbyid YZ
and I'm going to set a document actually
we could just copy/paste what we have up
here that might be easier like so so I'm
going to go and go inside my numbers
here chain two to one make sure it's
down the opacity like so and again if
this doesn't really make sense with the
opacity I will show you guys a bit later
when we do actually get this banner
working why we need to add opacity so
right now I want to do this what I also
want to make sure we do is that the
image that actually disappears is I want
to make sure the image that actually is
on the left side that goes behind the
active banner has an opacity as zero so
right before we do actually change all
these numbers the last image that needs
to go all the way back in line which is
number three because right now image
number three is going to be on the left
side has an opacity set to zero so it is
invisible when it actually goes back in
line so now we almost have all the code
we need to have inside banner status
which is equal to one because I want to
make sure we get this done properly so
right now I want to time D so we don't
execute everything at once because it
might be too much for the JavaScript to
handle so I'm going to go and go inside
my if statement and right before we do
all the document.getelementbyid E's in
here at least the center one I'm going
to set a timer so I'm going to go and
say we have a set time out which is a
function inside JavaScript that sets a
timer for when does it actually happen
on say parentheses semi-colon and inside
these parentheses I'm going to say it
needs to run a function after a certain
amount of seconds I'm going to say
function parentheses curly brackets move
down to the next line and then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go and take
all these document get on by these copy
and delete them and
insert them inside this set timeout
function here I'm just going to go to
move the mountain looks nice and then
inside the set timeout function we need
to make sure we tell it how many seconds
should there pass before we run on these
functions in your at least all these get
element by ID JavaScript code we have
been use so right now before the last
parenthesis I'm going to go and say
comma because we do have two parameters
inside set timeout and the second one is
going to be the time it needs to take
before we run all this code so right I'm
going to set to 500 milliseconds which
is going to be half a second and then
I'm going to go and copy this code that
we just wrote in here paste it below
because I also want to set a timeout for
the last document get owned by D we have
down here to set the opacity so I'm
going to go ahead and just move it out
go ahead and copy what we have here as
well
so after closing part of the actual
function and then I'm going to go and
change it to 1000 so we have one second
before it actually needs to run this
code here so basically what I just did
here is that told it okay as soon as we
load this loop we need to set the first
image on the left side too and opacity
set to zero then afterwards after half a
second it's going to take the images to
move them around so the third image over
in the left side is going to be moved to
the back and then inside the next loop
we're going to set the opacity to one
just like we did down here using the
opacity setting inside image span number
two now just notice that there's a small
mistake inside my code which was that my
opacity stylings has to be inside the
same banner so right now I have one set
to image spanner number three and
another one to image panel number two
both of these has to be image spanner
number two because when the image goes
back in line and needs to have in a path
set to zero and then we want to change
the opacity back to one so we need to
have it inside the same banner or these
two same image when it goes back in line
so now that we have this we can actually
go ahead and create the if statements
for the other two statuses were going to
get so right now status number one it's
going to be the first image showing
inside the banner then we need to have
an if statement it says status number
two it's going to be the second image
and then status number three is going to
be the third image okay so going back
inside the banner loop I'm just going to
go and copy this if statement
pasted below here
status two two and then the next thing
we're going to change in here is that
right now because the third image is
going to be the back in the line when we
get to the second loop we're going to go
and set the third image should have an
opacity set to zero because when it goes
back in line we then wanted to change
back to opacity one then inside the
actual styling tier we just need to
switch around the stylings inside each
limits because right now the image is
just basically going to switch places
using the right styling so I'm just
going to go and say that the first image
span up here is going to be going down
to the bottom instead like so then the
next one is going to be three and then
two so this was actually a lot easier
than just handing all the numbers over
here I figured so we could just change
the numbers inside that you want to get
so now we're basically just switching
the stylings of all the image span IDs
which is going to be what makes the
banner actually switch to the left side
and after doing this we're just going to
change the banner status to three so
right now we're going into the third
loop and we need to make sure we don't
have an if statement here we need to
have an else if statements and then I'm
just going to go ahead and copy what we
have here and then we're going to change
the last one so it matches this you know
this pattern that we're creating inside
the else if statements so right now the
banner status would be three the last
opacity should be out the image been
number one and again also at the bottom
here and we want to set the image span
of status to one because now we're going
back to the first loop up here which is
the if statement where Benna status is
equal to one and we also want to switch
around IDs inside to get elements in the
year so right now the next one in lines
would be 3 3 1 1 2 &amp;amp; 2 and then we go
back to the first one everything is
going to go back to normal and then it's
just going to continue in an endless
loop looping okay so now that we did
this we can actually go and refresh the
browser you guys will notice that
nothing really happens inside the banner
because we also need to actually
initialize the loop and have it run each
couple of seconds so the way we're going
to do that is by going back inside our
JavaScript code go to the top here and
then what I want to do is I want to say
that when we load the web page the first
time it should activate the banner loop
down here and the reason I want to do
that is because right now inside to see
styling we have no styling set to write
set index or passive these without
matter so by running the loop just one
time when we do actually load the
browser we set these numbers inside our
banner so I'm just going to go ahead and
say we have a window dot unload is equal
to a function curly brackets and then
inside this function we just want to run
banner loop one time so just going to go
and load it just one time in here as
soon as the webpage is actually loading
then after doing this we can actually go
ahead and set the automatic timer that
keeps rolling in the next image so now
we actually just gave it the first
stylings in here by doing it unload and
then afterwards we need to create a
function that keeps loading the images
inside the loop so we're going to go and
go down to the next line and say we have
a variable called something like start
banner loop it could be any kind of name
you guys want to give it consider two
equal to a function called set interval
parentheses semicolon and inside the
parentheses we're going to set of
functions I'm going to save function
parentheses curly brackets move down to
the next line and then inside this
function here we're going to say that we
want to run been a loop which is down
here down here and run it each couple of
seconds or at least how many seconds we
determined inside to bend the time up
here so what we need to do in here just
like the set timeout down here that has
two parameters inside of it we're going
to have two parameters inside the set
interval function inside the other
scripts so right before the parentheses
here we're going to say comment space
and tell it how many seconds we wanted
to wait until our next image so right
now we did actually decide that inside
our banner time appears I'm just going
to copy a variable and insert it so
right now we do actually have 4,000
milliseconds inside the set interval
function down here so now if we were to
actually go inside my browser and load
it you guys will notice that after about
four seconds if it actually change the
image inside the browser like so so now
we do actually have
an image spanner working inside the
browser but then again we want to give
it a couple of fix because this is just
a very basic banner and right now if we
were to actually hold my mouse cursor
inside the banner it just still keeps
going so I want to change that so when I
leave the banner it should actually
continue and then when I enter the
banner is stopped so if I were to go
inside my code again I'm going to go and
go below my start banner loop function
down here and say we want to start up a
document dot get element by ID
parentheses punctuation and then I want
to set some kind of event meaning that
right now for were to do something
inside the browser then it needs to run
a certain function inside this event
handler here so if I were to say on
Mouse enter means that when my mouse
actually enters this element we're
targeting inside I'll get element by ID
then we need to run the function so I'm
going to go and say we have a banner
container called main - banner which is
right now the entire container inside
the banner then it's just go ahead and
do the functions I'm just going to say
equal to function parentheses curly
brackets and then what we want to do is
want to clear the interval that we
started previously inside up here so the
way we do that is by writing parentheses
semi-colon and just basically saying we
want to stop the variable we have here
called start banner loop so just
clearing it meaning it's not going to
run anymore
after doing this I can then go to next
line and say when we do actually exit
with our mouse then we want to run the
banner loop one more time so I'm just
going to copy what we had here paste it
in and say on Mouse leave we want to go
ahead and activate the ACTU loop again
and again on certain intervals inside
the website so what I'm going to do here
is I'm just going to go and copy the
variable up here that has a set interval
and what we need to make sure we don't
do is write variable and then the name
of the actual variable because if I were
to write there
Abell down here then we're creating a
new variable instance which is not going
to be good because then when we do
actually enter the banner again then it
doesn't know where this variable
actually is because it's not this one LP
animal running it's the new one down
here and it doesn't know where it is
because it's inside a function so we
need to make sure we set the same start
banner loop as we head up here and we do
that by not creating the VAR statement
right before it okay so we need to make
sure we don't do that so now we did this
we can actually go ahead go inside our
browser refresh and if we were to wait a
couple of seconds just to make sure it
still works there we go if I were to
enter my mouse right now you guys will
notice that it doesn't work anymore it
doesn't keep sliding and then if I exit
again it's going to go and set the
interval one more time so just going to
wait for it there we go now the next
thing I'm going to create inside this
banner is going to be the buttons that
actually allow for us to change the
images manually which are right now as
you guys can see inside my demo here
from the beginning these two errors we
have on the sides so I'm going to go
ahead and go back inside my index file
I'm going to go up inside the images we
have up here inside the div tags and
right before the actual images I'm going
to insert the buttons so I'm going to
create a div which is going to be my
first button which is going to be the
back button and I'm going to give it a
class set to image span button not
spelled out completely just IMDB a and
BTN and I'm going to go ahead and set a
second class to image ban button -
previously or previous and the reason
I'm doing this is because we need to
some kind of standard styling for the
buttons then the second class is going
to take care of the actual position of
the button next thing we want to do is
actually set an ID so we can actually
target it using javascript and i'm going
to go and set an ideas the exact same
thing as we gave it as the second class
here since we won't have more buttons
called the exact same thing here I'm
just going to go and save it and now
that we had this I'm just going to go
and include the second button which is
going to be on the right side which is
going to be the next button it's going
to be right after the images like so
instead of previous I'm going to set it
to next like so then I'm going to save
it I'm going to go back inside my
stylesheet and now I'm going to go and
stand the buttons so I'm going to go to
the bottom and say we have a class
called
image ban button curly brackets I'm
going to give it a width set to 40
pixels and again you guys can change the
numbers here if you want to have a
different looking button then I'm going
to set a height to 40 pixels I'm going
to go and set a background color to
black so I'm just going to say hashtag
zero zero zero and then I'm going to set
a border radius and again basically what
I'm just doing is dialing it so it looks
somewhat nice so I'm going to say -
radius set it to maybe 4 pixels I'm
going to give it a position absolute and
again this is so we can actually
determine where the button needs to be
inside the container so I'm going to set
it to a top which is going to be equal
to 180 pixels and the reason for that is
that right now we have a banner which is
400 pixels tall so need to take half of
that and then - 20 pixels because right
now the height is 40 pixels so notice I
actually get this centered vertically we
need to have the top set to 180 pixels
then I'm going to go and say they have a
set index set to 2000 and the reason for
that is because inside the image banner
we set the set index to 500 a thousand
in 1500 mean the right now we need to
make sure this button is on top giving
it a set index as 2,000 so we can always
see the button then I'm going to go down
to the next time give it an opacity to
0.8 just so we don't have the button you
know like a really strong button all the
time except for when we hover our net
and then we're going to go and say if
you have a cursor set to pointer which
means that when I actually enter my
mouse cursor inside the button we should
get the link icon with the with the
mouse cursor so we get this hand symbol
then what I'm going to do is I'm going
to go ahead and copy this the styling we
just did give a hover
that and tell it to change the opacity
to one that might be two months is
actually going to say 0.9 so now that we
gave the button to hover effect we can
actually go ahead and style
the first button which is the previous
one so I'm going to go ahead and go down
to my next line here I'm going to say if
you have a class called image ban button
- previous stance for previously or
previous then I'm going to open up the
curly brackets and then we're going to
go and set a left because we need to
decide so this button B on the left side
of the right side and I'm going to go
and set it to 5 pixels from the left
side then I'm going to go and set a
background image and right now inside
the folder you guys downloaded from my
description
there should be two button images so I'm
just going to go and include this one
inside as a background for the first one
sometimes a URL and set this one to have
an image folder forward slash arrow -
left dot PNG then we're going to say
background size set to 60% just to make
sure we don't have the arrow taking up
the entire button inside of it because I
don't think that looks nice and I'm
going to go and set a background
position set to center then I'm going to
say background repeat' and set it to
no-repeat like so then we're just going
to go ahead and copy this and then start
the next button which is the image span
button next so just going to go and
change that to next and set the right
side to 5 pixels and then change the
image name to right so now we basically
have all the styling for the buttons
inside the browser sword to actually
show guys now we have two buttons in
here when it's left when it's right and
it changes opacity want me to actually
hover on it the next thing we need to do
is actually make sure willing to
actually click get that something will
actually have them inside the banner so
if we were to go back inside my index
file go down to right after we have the
unmask leave JavaScript I'm going to go
ahead and Cree
a new event handler for the buttons so
I'm going to say documents get get
element by ID parentheses calm creation
and then I'm going to say we have an
event called unclick so when I do
actually click the button something
should happen so I'm going to go and say
we have a ID called image ban button
- previous then I'm going to say we have
it equal to a function just like on the
previous one up here
now inside of this function I'm going to
go ahead and give it a JavaScript code
that actually goes backwards inside the
image spanners who want me to actually
click the button the banner should go to
other way around but before we do that I
would like to do the not the previous
button first but the next button because
it's much more simple to do so I'm going
to copy what we had here pasted below
and then I'm going to go and change it
from image span button previous to next
like so and then inside the actual
function down here we're going to say we
want to run the banner loop when we do
actually click the button so just going
to run this - one more time changing all
the statuses and everything meaning it's
just going to go ahead and skip to the
next one as soon as we click the button
so now forwards I actually go inside a
browser refresh you guys will notice
that when I click the button it changes
image now again if you think that it
might be changing image on its own right
now because I'm actually hovered inside
the image is not going to change
anything until I click back to the
button so in order to get the previous
button working the simple way to do it
is to create an if statement and inside
the parentheses I'm going to check if
the banner status is equal to a certain
number so right now if the fan of status
is equal to one then I want to change
the banner status to something else
because right now if I were to have been
a status number 1 the next one is going
to switch to number 2 but I don't want
the banner status to switch to number 2
because then it's going to go and run
the wrong loop down here because we want
to go backwards instead of forwards so I
want to tell it that I wanted to go to
the banner status that then the next
time the banner switches will load up
banner status number 3 instead so if I
were to say we want to change the banner
status I'm going to say we want to
change the to Venice status number 2
so now women to actually click the
button if Penna status is equal to one
then automatically you should actually
load up venice tenders then
automatically it should actually without
the button load up banner status number
two but because we by clicking this
button change to bend the status to
number two instead the next time it
loops is going to loop number three not
number two okay if that makes sense so
i'm going to copy what we have here and
paste it below change it to an else--if
statement copy it one more time paste it
down and I'm going to say that we want
to change then the status to two and
three down what we do have to check for
it and then the same thing I'm going to
go and change the inside of here to
three and one so just changing the
bandit status to the one ahead a where
taxes should be because we want to you
know load not the next picture but the
next one again and then when we actually
click the button we need to actually run
the loop down here so I'm going to say
we have a banner loop parentheses which
means that we will run the loop as soon
as we do this check here okay now before
we actually check this inside the
browser to make sure it's actually
working
I did actually notice a couple of
spelling mistakes so right now we have
been a status we need to make sure it's
a big capitalized s inside all the words
so just going to go and change that
really quickly like so then if I save it
go inside the browser
you guys will notice that we have two
mountains when I click Next we have the
food when I click Next you have this
shit so if I were to click the previous
button after the next image we should
essentially not get the food but we need
to go back to the ship image so if I
click it you guys considered now we get
to sit image now we do have some kind of
wonky effect going on when we do exit
change backwards which is because right
now inside the banner loop down here we
design the styling in order to go
forward and not backwards so one way to
fix is and I'm not going to get into
that in this episode but one way to fix
it if you guys interested is to create
another function like been a loop that
we then instead initialize inside
our back button so we could call Ben a
loop number two instead and this new
banner loop should be styled opposite so
when we do actually click you know the
other button everything needs to switch
to the other side instead so one way to
fix it will be doing that I'm not going
to do that in this episode because it's
already a long episode and I don't want
to do any kind of work that is basically
just repeating or weed it down here so
you guys can go ahead and play around
with it for a little bit because it's
good practice but what I'm going to do
instead is I'm going to go and show you
guys how to insert the text inside the
banners because right now I have no text
in here and inside the demo we have text
in here so going back inside our banner
go inside our code I'm going to go ahead
and go up inside our images up here
inside the index file inside the index
file I'm going to go and create a dip
box so we're going to say give give it a
class set to image ban dance box just to
give it some kind of class name and this
box in here is going to contain all the
text for this banner so inside this
image band box I'm going to say we have
a h2 element the first one could be sail
the seas then we might have a paragraph
underneath it and inside of here we
could say on real wooden ships comma and
at sea punctuation you know just to have
some kind of text in here then I'm going
to go ahead and copy this paste it
inside the other two then I'm going to
go and change the text so we have two
SEC one saying try exotic dishes now I'm
not going to change the paragraph down
here because you guys can do it yourself
but the last one we can go ahead and say
that sale disease but see the mountains
this actually spelled like correctly
like so and then we can actually go
inside inside the styling so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go ahead and
go down to the bottom of my stylesheet
and then the first thing I'm going to do
is I'm just going to go to install the
text inside know these boxes in here so
I'm going to go and give it a default
by saying we have a class called main -
banner inside this main - banner we have
a class called image ban gas box and
inside of it we have an eight - elements
then I'm going to say to have a fun
family just to give you some kind of
funds set to Arial we have a font size
set to 60 pixels and we have a color set
to hashtag white then I'm going to go
understand the paragraph instead of the
h2 element so you have a P tag this
would have the same font family but
we're going to change the size to 16
pixels instead I'm also going to go ed
and give it a padding top just to make
sure it's not too close to the h2
element once the padding - top set it to
6 pixels like so and then we're going to
go to stand the active boxes that this
Texas inside of because we want to be
able to move the boxes wherever we
wanted inside the active banner so I'm
going to go and say below here that we
have a class called main - banner then I
have an ID called image than 3 space and
then I have a class called image ban -
box curly brackets so now we'll just
basically stand the image span box
inside the image spend 3 only ok so what
I can do is I can say we have a padding
top set to 220 pixels I have a padding
left set to 100 pixels and now I can
just go and copy paste this a couple of
times so we can say we have a panic hold
2 and 1 and then I can just go and
change the numbers in year so going to
Elysees from the top we could have
inside the second one then I'm going to
say we have a padding right set to 100
pixels then I'm going to go and say if
you have a float right because I wanted
to be in the right side of the banner
set at the left side and I'm going to go
and say they had text
- align right just to make sure the text
is aligned properly inside the box as
well now we can go and change the last
one down here which is the image banner
one I'm just going to say instead of
having 220 pages from top I'm going to
say 70 so now if I go back inside my
website you guys can see that now would
you actually have text in here and this
is actual text and not text inside the
image itself because this is better
fuzzy optimization so we should do it
this way
inside our websites if I were to change
the images you guys can see the text is
actually positioned differently inside
the different images so this is how we
create an image banner using javascript
and again this was kind of to give you
guys an exercise to do you know what all
the stuff we've learned in the previous
episodes in order to give you guys an
idea about what javascript can actually
do because one thing I do actually
regret about this series here is that we
didn't do enough exercises so hope this
one gave you guys an idea about what
exactly Java can do inside the web site
so if you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
