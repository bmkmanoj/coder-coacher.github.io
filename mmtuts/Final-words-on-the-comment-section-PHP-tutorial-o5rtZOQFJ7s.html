episode and how to create a comment
section now for the past couple of weeks
you guys have been giving me input on
what you guys want to learn when it
comes to PHP code and I think it's about
time to finish off our comment section
here so it doesn't get too long and I
just want to mention I really appreciate
the input you guys come with since it
gives me ideas to what you guys want to
learn in the future now so far we've
actually been doing a lot of the basics
with PHP you know in the first many
lessons where we just talked about if
statements and L statements and sessions
variables that sort of thing and the
reason behind creating this comment
section here was to show you guys how
you could take all these lessons we've
been learning and apply them to
something real meaning that right now as
you guys can see all the stuff we've
been using to create this comment
section here with PHP code has actually
just been using the tools we've been
learning in the past many episodes of
PHP so when you guys come with feedback
on what you guys want to learn in the
future it's always appreciated because
it gives me some ideas to what you guys
want me to teach you guys when it comes
to the new PHP lessons we're going to be
learning here now as you guys can see
right now we do actually have this
comment section and the last thing we
basically need here to get this fully
working at least as I can think of right
now would be to include the reply
feature to reply function that actually
allows for us to click reply write
something and then you can see the
message underneath here now we're not
going to actually code it I will explain
briefly what you guys need to do if
you're interested and actually doing it
but the reason we're not going to code
it is because everything we will be
doing would be repetition of what we've
done in the past right now like I said I
want to stick with purely PHP in these
lessons which means that if I were to
make an episode on how to create a reply
button it will be done completely
identical to when we created the edit
button which means you click edit you
can edit a post
submit it and then you see it it it's
the exact same thing when you create a
reply feature you click reply you go to
an external page you write a message so
you click Submit and you just need to
create an insert statement instead of an
update statement for the active posts
then you just need to take the function
that actually shows these post and place
it underneath where we have our get
comments function down here you just
need to place it at the bottom that's it
then you do actually have a reply
feature inside your website so because
it's so simple and I would like for you
guys to actually you know try to think
for yourself not try and say it is a
negative negative way but one of the
ways to learn PHP is to have a problem
and then experiment in order to get a
working of course I would always be in
the comment section to guide you guys if
you have questions about how to create
this reply button if you get stuck but
the way I learn PHP was actually by
having a problem and trying to figure
out by myself if you guys rely on people
to tell you how to do everything in PHP
then you never learn the thought process
that goes behind trying to figure out
how to create something in PHP because
there will always be at some point
something that you want to make in PHP
but you can't necessarily find on the
internet on how to do it or somebody
hasn't done it before and it's something
completely original you're trying to do
so you need to be able to think in a way
that allows you to solve problems using
PHP code so I know some of you guys
might have been following these episodes
you know trying to actually make a
comment section from scratch but I've
seen this more as an exercise to teach
you guys how to use the tools we've been
learning in PHP in order to make you
guys understand the behavior PHP and how
to actually used to the small you know
functions and variables and all these
lessons we've been doing in the past how
to actually use them and apply them in a
real situation so there's nothing new in
creating a reply button which is why
like I said I'm not going to do an
entire episode and doing this because it
would take quite a while
to do this as a lesson so I hope you
guys can bear with me on this and I
really appreciate the feedback you guys
to come with when it comes to what you
guys want to learn and I hope you guys
will continue to give me feedback I will
always be in the comment section if you
guys need help I've been doing that in
the past I've been trying to answer all
your questions so far right now the
channel is not very big so there's been
time for me to reply to all the the
questions you guys have come with so I
hope I can continue doing that in the
future hope you guys enjoyed and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
