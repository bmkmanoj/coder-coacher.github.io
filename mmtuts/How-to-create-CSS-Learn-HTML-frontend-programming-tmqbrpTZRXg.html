talk about how to actually use our
stylesheet alongside our HTML file so in
order to do that I'm just going to kind
of give you guys some examples of you
know some objects and some text and how
you can use the stylesheet to interact
with it so inside our HTML file I'm
going to go and delete the text we
created in the last episode and I'm
going to create a object inside our body
tags now an object is created by writing
tip tanks which is a sensor just div you
need to make sure you actually open it
and you close it inside the div we can
go ahead and write stuff but for now
we're just going to leave a blank so if
I were to save this and refresh my
browser you'll notice if you don't
actually see anything and that's because
we didn't write anything yet we didn't
do anything to this day we didn't tell
it what kind of height it had to be what
kind of with it should have you know
what kind of background colors should be
inside of it so that's what we're going
to do with a stylesheet right now so
inside our stylesheet we can actually
start styling this object since we
already linked to it so our HTML file
does know what the stylesheet want so
inside our stylesheet we're going to go
ahead and say we have a div space then
we're going to open up the code and
close it again with curly brackets like
so and you don't actually need to put it
on the next on the next line like I did
here you can actually put them right
next to each other like so and then
write code in here but it's just a
really nice way to do stuff to to have
some order in it to do it this way so
inside here I'm going to go ahead and
write what needs to change with this tip
so first of all we need to tell it ok we
want a height and I'm going to want to
tell it that the height should be a
hundred pixels so right height : 100 px
for pixels then I close it by writing
semicolon and that's how you need to
close every time you write a piece of
code inside CSS it's very important to
close it because otherwise you're going
to get some kind of weird arrow and
something is going to happen on your
website that you don't know what is and
then you should always double check for
these kind of errors below here we're
going to write with honor pixels
and I'm going to give it a background
color as red now again I'm just sort of
demonstrating here so don't you don't
have to follow along on this piece of
code at least for this episode but for
the next episode we'll actually be doing
stuff together but for now you can do
this as practice or you can just kind of
watch me so I'm going to save this and
see what happens to a dip box whoa there
we have a red box so that's essentially
how we style objects and do stuff to
them now with this kind of styling we
can tell it how objects need to look
like and how they need to position
themselves onto a website so if I were
to create margin on the left side of the
box which is spacing on the left side
and put it to 100 pixels refresh my
browser you'll see that actually moves
100 pixels to the right because I added
space to my left side now if I were to
create some text on the website let's go
ahead and create some text underneath
out dip with a paragraph tag which is
done by just writing P make sure you
open and close the code and inside here
we're going to say this is so much fun
exclamation mark save it and refresh the
page you can see we have some text down
here and because I put the paragraph tag
tags after my dip box it does not appear
inside the box but if I were to take
this paragraph put it inside my div box
it would actually appear inside the box
itself like so now styling doesn't have
to be done on only dip box if you can
style essentially everything on our
website then we put inside an HTML sheet
so if I were to go ahead and start my
paragraph like so and tell it ok we want
a color to be blue I would like for the
font size to be 24 pixels
save it and refresh the browser you can
see that it changed so we can
essentially change everything now of
course this is a very simple way to do
it but what if you have more than one
div on your website what if you have
more than one paragraph on your website
because you will you will have a lot of
them how do you specify specifically
which one of them it is you want to
style and we're going to get into that
in the next couple of lessons for now
this is all I wanted to show you guys so
hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
