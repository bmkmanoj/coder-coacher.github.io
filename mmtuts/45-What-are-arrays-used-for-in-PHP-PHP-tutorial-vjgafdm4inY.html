about a race inside PHP and the reason I
want to do that even though we talked
about a race in the past is because for
the next couple of episodes we're going
to do more advanced stuff with arrays so
before we do that I'd like to spend this
one episode just briefly talking about
when exactly we use arrays inside a
website now as you guys can see I have a
website right in front of me here and
inside this site or at least inside this
index page I have a variable called
person which is equal to Daniel and have
a variable called people which is equal
to an array now the basic idea behind an
array is that if I have one piece of
data for example Daniel which is a name
that is equal to a variable then we can
easily just do a regular you know value
as Daniel but let's say I have a lot of
values or a lot of data that needs to go
into one variable then we can use arrays
now beneath E I have a variable called
people which is equal to an array that
has Daniel Jane and John if I were to
write this on the website I could go
ahead and echo variable people brackets
and then say we want the first piece of
data which is Daniel so we count from 0
1 2 3 4 this is very basic we talked
about it before so if I go refresh the
website you can see I get Daniel now the
most typical place you might be using
this inside a website because I've heard
people ask me before you know what
exactly do we use arrays for because we
haven't actually used the race and one
of the previous exercises we've done in
this channel now one of the reasons we
might want to use an array inside a
website is when we have a lot of data
that needs to go into one variable now
right down here to I only have three
different pieces of data which could
easily go into three different variables
I would just say name number one name
number two name number three but when we
have a lot of data for example a hundred
or maybe 200 names instead of having to
create 100 or 200 variable or such equal
to a name it's much easier just to put
them inside an array now you might be
asking when can we actually do that and
when do we actually need to use that
inside a website in my case the reason
that I use it most often is when I have
to spit out data from a database
now I like to use something called
object-oriented PHP programming which is
not procedural programming which is what
we've been learning so far the basic
idea behind procedural and
object-oriented is that inside a file
like the front page that I have here
when I need to use PHP I just simply
create the PHP code for the stuff that I
need to use right now when you do
object-oriented PHP you create all the
functions and everything on the side
inside a separate document and then you
call on those functions whenever you
need to use them so you don't have to
recreate them all over again every time
you need to use them inside a file now
if that doesn't really make sense to you
just go ahead and ignore what I just
said but the basic idea here is that
when I have a lot of data from a
database and I need to spit it out
inside a website when it comes to object
or into PHP one of the solutions to do
that is by using a race so we're going
to talk about also in one of the next
episodes how to take data from a
database and put it inside a race so we
can actually spit it out inside a
website because they will get useful
when you do actually need to do
object-oriented PHP at some point in the
future when we do actually get to that
point so that's the basic idea behind a
race at least when I use a race that's
what I use it for so for the next
episode we're gonna be talking about how
to take an empty array which is just
basically an array without any kind of
data in it and how to insert data after
you created the array so hope you guys
enjoyed this episode and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
