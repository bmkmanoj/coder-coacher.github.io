our next episode and how to create the
otha script now in this lesson we're
gonna talk about something called
properties and methods within JavaScript
and properties and methods are something
that we use constantly when it comes to
JavaScript I know that I say that all
the time for these lessons that we use
it all the time but in this case it's
especially true because properties
methods are what actually makes our jobs
could do something to the data did we
have inside our JavaScript so as you can
see in the example I have in front of me
I created a variable that I call item
which is equal to bottle of water which
is a string and right underneath it I
have a console log but I haven't done
anything to the console log yet so just
to give a short explanation of what
exactly a property and a method is a
property is a way for us to get certain
meta information about a object now
variables and arrays are type of objects
if we can do that to them and methods of
functions that belong to the object that
allow for us to do something to the data
inside the object such as a variable or
an array so what I want to do is I want
to show you how exactly these properties
and methods work by showing you a couple
of examples here now just to start with
I'm just going to use a variable to
demonstrate these different examples so
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
just going to take this variable and I'm
going to console locked inside the
browser so I'm just gonna go and save it
go inside the browser and as you can see
we have bottle of water inside the
console down here now one can also do is
we can use a property on this object so
what I can do is I can go inside
right after we grab the item variable
here I can say punctuation mean that now
we're going to add a property or method
behind it that is going to do something
to this variable here so to give an
example of a property we can go ahead
and use something called length that is
going to give us the length of this
specific string here so if we were to go
ahead and go inside the browser you see
you get 15 because right now we have 15
pieces of characters inside the string
here so were to count 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11 12 13 14 15 which should match it
now it is also going to count the spaces
so it will be 15 in total including the
spaces in here
now this is an example of a property and
again a property is a way for us to get
information regarding this specific
variable here so we're just getting the
length of it now a method on the other
hand like I said and now for us to
actually do something to the data inside
the actual container so if we were to go
ahead and go right after the item
punctuation because that's what we need
to add and declare a specific method
called index of index R now do you
notice that when we use a method that
has multiple words inside of it the
second word is not going to be separated
with a space it's just going to start
off with the capitalized letters so
index is going to be non capitalized and
then the first letter in the next word
which is off is going to be a
capitalized
o now after we define a method we always
need to include a pair of parentheses
because this is something that defines
that we're now using a method or a
function which we'll talk about later to
a specific objects so what index off
actually does is that to give us a index
position of a certain piece of data
inside the object that we have up here
so if I were to go ahead and say I want
to get the precision of a certain
character or a certain word inside this
string up here and go out and say we
have a string called off and I want to
get the precision of it so were to go
inside the console you can see we get
seven so what account we have 0 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 including the space mean that it
now gave us the position of a certain
letter or sentence inside the string up
here so this is one example to give you
another example we could go ahead and
use something called a sub string now
substring does something slightly
different so we'll just go ahead and say
sup string this one allowed for us to
cut off a certain part of the string or
the object that we have on top of us
meaning that I can go ahead and say we
want to start adds a index position of 7
and then I want to keep the rest of the
string until a certain point so it could
say after what you want to keep it till
9 which would give us just the string
called odd inside the console because
I'm
everything up until the seventh position
then I'm going to keep the rest of it
until the ninth position which is right
here and then cutting the rest of it off
so if we were to save this go inside the
console you can see the get off inside
the console now another example here I'm
just going to give you a few examples so
you can sort of get the idea here
another example we could use would be to
use something called replace so were to
go in here and say replace and then go
inside the parenthesis we can go ahead
and take a word from inside the string
up here like water and that has to be a
string of course and then I want to
replace it with juice then if we were to
go inside the browser you can see that
we now get a bottle of juice instead of
water so we can do a bunch of things
when it comes to these different methods
here now the last one I'm going to show
you when it comes to variables is one
called to uppercase and again this is
actually three different words to
uppercase so in this case we would say
two non capitalized upper it's going to
be capitalized and then case again is
going to be capitalized at least at the
beginning there so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to say that we just want to
delete whatever is inside the
parentheses and then it's just going to
capitalize all the letters inside the
string we have up here so we'll just go
ahead and save it refresh the browser
you can see that we get bottle of water
but it's all capitalized so these are
some of the methods we can use when it
comes to variables now there's a lot of
different methods we can use in order to
do a bunch of things when it comes to
variables and arrays and I can't show
you all of them in this episode so I
will go ahead and link a list in the
description of this video where you can
see both properties and methods when it
comes to both arrays and variables so
now we talked about variables that's got
and talked about when we use these on
arrays instead of variables so if we
were to go ahead and just replace our
variable here with the array example we
had from the previous episode now what I
want to do to start with before we use
any kind of properties or methods is I
want to just go ahead and console.log
the actual array inside the browser and
this actually need to be items not item
go back inside the console you can see
that we get the actual array listed out
inside the console now a really funny
thing when it comes to a race inside a
console is that we can in fact see the
different properties and methods we can
use on the array inside the console here
so you'll notice that we have this
little arrow next to the array we can
actually go and click that and then you
can see we get first of all the
different index numbers of the data
inside the array so we have 0 1 2 and
then underneath here we do actually get
the properties that we can use so in
this case we have lengths and that
actually gives us the property value
which is 3 because when it comes to
arrays we don't get the number of
characters we do actually get the number
of array indexes so we can also use
lengths if I were to go in here say dot
length we can also use that when it
comes to arrays so if we just go back
here go inside the console and go and
grab the list again you can also see we
get something down here at the bottom if
we were to extend that you can see
different methods we can use inside the
array here now this a lot of them and
again there's going to be a list in the
description of this video but we're just
going to take a few examples from this
list here now if we were to go back
inside my code we're going to go and try
out a method called join so if we were
to go inside the code in say dot join
parentheses because this is a method now
this one actually goes ahead and takes
this specific array and combines all the
different indexes we have into one
string so were to go inside the console
here you'll see that instead of having
different indexes we do actually get
just one string of the data that we had
inside the array you're going to notice
that we don't actually have spaces in
between the commas which would look a
little bit nicer aesthetic wise we do
also have one called two string we could
use that will automatically create the
space but the cool thing about using
join is that we can go inside the
parentheses and add a couple of
parameters like we did with the variable
examples now in this case we can say
what we want to include in between the
data inside the inside the indexes
inside the array so instead of comma we
could add something else like want to
add a space - space save it and then you
can see we get this in between the data
instead of the default comma we could
also if you want to use the comment we
could say comment space save it and then
you can see we get the default comma
space value we usually have in between
data inside a website and you can use
any sort of character in between here if
you want to you can use pipes you can
use ampersand so you can use a bunch of
things and then you can see we get these
different symbols in between the list
here so the next example I want to show
you is something called pop and also
much a certain one called push so pop
actually goes in and removes one piece
of data from inside the array so if we
were to go in here and say instead of
join I'm going to say pop parentheses
it's going to go ahead and remove one of
the day that from inside the array which
is going to be the last index we have
inside the actual array so right now
it's going to actually remove the one
called true if a word suggests console
lock this it is only going to show me
which data is going to remove from the
array so we're to go inside the browser
you can see that actually rights are
true because that's the data it removed
from the array so were to just go ahead
and say instead of console locking it
I'm going to go in between the array and
the console lock and then I'm going to
use the method so I'm just going to
refer to the variable at the so I'm just
going to refer to the array called items
and then say dot pop which means that we
now remove the last index then
afterwards I just want to console.log
items inside the actual console inside
the browser so right now you can see
that we just have bottle and four and we
just have two indexes inside the array
now we could also combine these and say
we want to say dot join parentheses and
then go and do that and then this case
we use two different types of methods
inside that this one example here so now
we just removed a piece of data and we
included some spacing and made it into a
string in one piece of code so this is
something we can do now when it comes to
using pause we can do the exact same
thing so for were to say push it is
going to do the same thing but it's
going to include a piece of data instead
of
moving it so I can go and say want to
push in a piece of data could be any
kind of data a string number something
so what I want to do is I want to add
juice as a string and I'm just gonna go
ahead and console.log push instead of
the other one and I'm also going to go
ahead and include juice inside at the
console.log example here now the first
line up here is just going to add juice
which means that if I want to see this
inside the full array I just need to
console.log items in order to see this
so you can see we now have bottle for
true and dews now if we were too
conscious log the whole thing with the
dot pers then it's going to show me the
index number of where puss was inserted
inside the array which is at the end so
it will essentially just give me the
total number of data inside the array or
indexes inside the array so were to save
this go inside the browser you can see
we get five because we have five pieces
of index inside this array here now
before you continue to next lesson
there's something that's very important
for me to mention about these properties
and methods here now properties and
methods are built into the JavaScript
language meaning that we don't need to
create them first in order to use them
inside our code now properties like I
said at the beginning is just basic
information about the objects but a
method is a function that actually does
something to the actual object now a
function is basically a block code that
does something specific and a function
is actually something we can create
ourselves as a user and when it comes to
methods is actually just a function
that's related to the actual object but
when we create our own functions we just
call them functions and these are what
we also call used to define functions
and properties and methods of what we
could call building functions so without
making this too confusing and too
complicated what we're going to talk
about in the next episode is something
called functions and it's something
you've used constantly inside a website
when you create any sort of JavaScript
code for the website so after we learn
about functions I think we're ready to
start talking about how to actually do
something inside a website using
javascript
up until now the lessons you've seen so
far has been more or less knowledge
space meaning that we haven't actually
done any sort of practical examples when
it comes to JavaScript inside a website
so hopefully within the next couple
lessons we'll start learning something
that we can actually use inside a real
website so I hope you guys enjoyed and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
