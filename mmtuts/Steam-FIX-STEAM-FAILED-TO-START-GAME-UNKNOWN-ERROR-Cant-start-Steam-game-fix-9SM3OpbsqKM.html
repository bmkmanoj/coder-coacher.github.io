take a look at an issue that happens
quite often with some of the games from
Steam
I just opened up my Steam here and I
have a game here called call of duty
ghost multiplayer which is a game that
some of you guys may know when I press
play it will come up with this arrow
that says failed to start game unknown
error okay and now depending on your
machine and all that stuff there might
be different kinds of errors the one I
have here is a very simple one but I'm
just going to go through a couple of
different errors at least a couple of
different fixes in order to fix this the
first one is that if you get this
message you probably need to make sure
that you check your firewall to make
sure it's not blocking it usually a
computer has anti-virus software right
you have to make sure it's not blocking
your game so you have to make sure you
go into your antivirus and check the
list over you know applications it might
block and make sure it's not on there
okay so the second thing you want to
check for is to make sure that there's
no applications on these background
applications that are preventing the
games from starting up and the way you
do that you go to run which you know
depending on what kind of Windows you
have you know this should be run
somewhere in your computer then you type
in MS config like I have here click OK
and then this window will open up so in
order to disable all the you know
startup background applications you go
ahead and uncheck load startup items and
then you go to services and check on
hide all Microsoft services and did you
say disable all and when you click apply
and then ok it's going to ask you to
restart your computer in some cases when
you restart your computer starts up
again it may ask you again do you want
to restart just go ahead and say no to
that and then see if you can play the
game or not and then if it still gives
you this error it's not because of the
background applications ok so we sort of
you know what do you call it going
through all the different steps to
figure out exactly what is wrong with
this I'm just going to cancel it here
now another way if this doesn't work is
you can actually right click on your
game and then go down to properties
and then you can go to local files and
then verify integrity of game cashew I
think it said case catch and you should
try doing that because it might work
afterwards a lot of times when you have
issues with game some steam
it's because you have to verify the
integrity of it so go ahead and try that
if that does not work try you know
uninstalling the game and install it
again and see if it works if that does
not work what you need to do is close
down steam I'm just going to go ahead
and exit it here now when you have exit
steam go ahead and right-click on the
icon you have for steam it can be out in
your desktop or whatever a bit down here
my you know start panel you're going to
right-click your steam icon or
application and then you're going to run
it as administrator and when you do that
I'm just going to connect the steam here
really quick when you do that in a lot
of cases it will allow you to run those
games when I click play now it should go
into the game and the screen might
become black for you guys because I'm
using a screen recorder to record my
desktop not the game but as you can see
now it actually loads up which is a good
signal there's a lot of different fixes
out there depending what kind of
computer and stuff it at you're running
by the way I have not tested this yet
but if you do have a computer runs on
32-bit and not 64 you might need to
upgrade to a 64-bit computer because
this game at least this game here will
not run on 32-bit from what I hear I've
not tested out so I'm not quite sure yet
but these are different fixes that you
can do in order to see if you can get
your game working and again I hope this
helped some of you guys out and hope see
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
