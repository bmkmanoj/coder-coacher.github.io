different rates I have inside PHP
because in the past what we've talked
about so far has been a tab called
indexed arrays now when it comes to
arrays inside PHP we ex have three
different types yep index the race you
have associative arrays and we have
multi-dimensional arrays so what I'm
gonna do in this episode is I'm just
going to briefly introduce these three
different types and then the next two
episodes we're going to talk more detail
about associative arrays and
multi-dimensional arrays so when it
comes to a race at least the top we know
about so far we have a variable called
something which is equal to an array and
in this example I have daniel john and
jane as data inside this array now if I
were to spit out the first data which is
Daniel I would actually need to echo out
variable data brackets and then I need
to give it the index number of where the
data is inside this array so in this
case because we start from 0 1 2 if I
want to spit out Daniel I need to write
0 inside my brackets here now this is
all good and fun but what if I want to
make this a bit more easy to pull out at
least when it comes to understanding
what exactly is inside this array then
we can use something called an
associative array now the basic idea
behind an associative array is that
instead of writing 0 inside the brackets
we can actually name the data for
example the array I have down here that
has the first name the last name and the
age of a person I connect to go ahead
and name these pieces of data for
example first last and 8 and I can
simply give this key like we call it a
value so that's basically what an
associative array is when it comes to a
multi-dimensional array is when we have
an array inside an array so as you guys
can see here I actually have an array
and then the first data inside this
array is actually another array now of
course you can actually mix this with
regular data like we have here like john
and jane but the basic idea behind these
is that we have an array inside an array
so what i'm gonna do in these next
couple episodes is i'm gonna give you
guys an example of associate to erase a
multi-dimensional arrays and how taxes
spit out the data from these types of
arrays because these will get useful is
especially the associative array and the
multi-dimensional array compared to what
we have up here because this is a very
basic array that we don't really use
that often when it comes to real
websites we actually use these down here
more especially when it comes to pulling
out data from a database so if you guys
enjoyed I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
