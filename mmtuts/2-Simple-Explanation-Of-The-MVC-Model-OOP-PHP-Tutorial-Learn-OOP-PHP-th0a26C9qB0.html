something called the embassy model
inside optical into PHP programming now
when it comes to the optical into
programming we have a lot of different
patterns we can choose from and one of
the more famous ones is the embassy
model so this is the one I'm going to
use in these lessons here before we get
started actually using the MVC model
we're going to do a lot of fundamental
stuff first since you guys need to know
some basic stuff about after go into
programming before we can dive into the
embassy model but because I think the
embassy model gives you guys a really
good idea about what exactly up there
into programming is I think it's
important to explain the Embassy model
from the beginning okay so as you guys
can see in front of me here I have a
diagram that I drew inside illustrator
and I'm going to go ahead and explain
what exactly this diagram means so as
you guys can see we have a browser down
here we have a computer with a website
in front of it this is you guys you're
watching the actual website then we have
three different parts of the Embassy
model we have a controller we have a
model and we have a view now each of
these does something specific meaning
that the controller takes information
from the user when it goes to a website
such as let's say he goes into a search
field and searches for information
inside the website then the controller
take cares of all the requests from the
user
now the model up here takes care of all
the connections to the database meaning
that the model knows everything about
our database these down here don't know
anything from the database they only
take care of the user or shows the use
of the information he needs to see
inside the website so when it comes to
the view this guy just takes care of
showing the user the actual code that he
needs to see inside the website okay so
to explain this in a very very basic and
visceral way let me tell you guys a
story about a company we have a company
called for example NBC inside this
company they buy and sell different
goods such as merchandise and a customer
walks inside the door which is right
here and says he wants to see some of
the goods that we have inside the
company so inside the company we have
three different people working we have
the CEO which is up here he knows
everything about the company he knows
all the companies he
threats and some of this information is
very sensitive therefore he has two
people working inside the company since
you know the CEO shouldn't do all the
work inside the company he has one guy
who takes cares of selling stuff to the
customer and he has one guy who buys
stuff from customers so when the new
customer walks inside the door and says
I want to see some of the goods you guys
have for example I want to see all the
soccer balls that you guys might be
selling inside this company then the
view takes care of the customer and says
ok he wants to see soccer balls I'm
going to go to the CEO and ask him which
kind of soccer balls do we have inside
the company we can tell him so the CEO
because the old information he carries
is very precious it's only going to give
his employee all the information about
soccer balls this guy down here is then
going to go to the customer and show him
the information
now another customer walks inside the
door and says I want to sell you guys
basketballs
now because this guy over here takes
care of buying stuff when customers come
inside the door he's going to be the one
to greet the customer he's going to take
the basketballs get the information from
them and then pass them on to the CEO
and say ok we just purchased these
basketballs here you go now you can
actually note down inside our system
that we have more basketballs and
storage now both of these employees down
here don't actually know what each of
them are doing and as soon as one of
these employees has actually done
something with a customer such as given
him information regarding soccer balls
or bought something from the customer
they immediately forget what exactly
they bought or showed the customer the
only guy who has any kind of brain
inside this company is the model up here
or the CEO so this is the basic idea
behind how an MVC model works regarding
the information that gets passed back
and forward inside a website and this is
what we're going to focus on in the
later run once you learnt the
fundamentals of object-oriented
programming
I hope my story gave you guys some kind
of visual idea about what exactly an MC
model is and how often go into
programming works at least when it comes
to an MVC model in the next episode
we'll actually talk about how to get
started with the actual programming of
optic or into programming
I'm going to talk about something more
fundamental stuff which means that all
the stuff we just talked about in this
episode regarding the MSE model is just
to give you guys an idea about what
exactly these things do and we're not
going to touch them you see model to
later episodes okay so hope you guys
enjoyed I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
