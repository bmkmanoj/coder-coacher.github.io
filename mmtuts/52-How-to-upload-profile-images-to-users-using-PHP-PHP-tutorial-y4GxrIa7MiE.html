profile images to users inside a website
and this is going to be based off
directly at the previous episode I did
where showed you guys have to upload
images and files directly to a website
so if you guys haven't seen the previous
episode I recommend you guys go back
what's at first and then return to this
episode here because all the code you
guys see in front of me here is directly
the same as what we did in the previous
episode and we will continue to build on
this system here we created previously
now another thing I should mention is
that we also need to be able to create a
login system because it makes sense that
in order to make a profile image upload
system we need to have a login system so
if you guys don't know how to make a
login system I also recommend you guys
go back to episode 39 where show you
guys how to create a login system so
having said this let's actually go ahead
and take a look at what we're going to
be building this episode here so what do
you guys see in front of you here is
going to be the prototype we're going to
be building today and yes I know it
doesn't look we're pretty I didn't focus
on styling today so if you guys want to
make it pretty you just need to add some
CSS to it now
what we're going to be doing here and
I'm just going to take this one by one
so you guys understand what is going on
inside my browser here is first of all
at the top of the page we're going to go
ahead and list out all the users we have
inside the database now right now as you
guys can see I have no users because I
didn't sign up any users down here so
what we're going to do underneath here
once we get all the users is we're going
to get a message that says if we're
locked in or not because I do actually
have a login and a lockout button down
here now I didn't create a traditional
login system where you have a user name
input field and a password field and
then click login because we're just
creating this as a test today
but it's going to work exactly the same
way for uploading profile images had it
been a regular login system okay I just
decided to create a button instead of a
input field we also have a logout button
so we can lock out our admin again
that's basically what we have for a
login system then up here I have a
signup form where you can sign up a new
user inside our website so what I'm
going to do here is I'm just going to
demonstrate what it is we're going to be
doing and how the upload system is going
to work so I'm going to go ahead and
sign up myself Daniel
Elson I'm going to call myself admin
because we need to be able to login as
admin down there I'm just going to
create a one two three password and then
after I click sign up you guys can see
we get admin now what do you guys will
notice is that right now as a default
once I click sign up I haven't uploaded
any kind of profile image yet so as you
guys can see I get this default profile
image and this is actually something I
uploaded inside my uploads folder inside
my root folder so as you guys can see I
get this profile default that JPEG image
now once I do actually click login you
guys can see we now get a profile image
upload system that replaces my signup
form because I'm logged in we shouldn't
be able to sign up anymore and instead
we can upload a profile image now this
profile limits is going to go in and
replace the default image we have up
here so if we go in and say choose file
and select myself
click upload you guys can see I now
change my profile image so this is a
pretty cool way to change it now if I
wanted to change it to another profile
image I would just go ahead and choose
another file and at the image like this
guy down here upload him and as you guys
can see we now get a new profile image
so this is basically what we're going to
do today so hope you guys find this
useful because in a second I'm just
going to delete everything I have on the
screen here and then we're going to
build everything from scratch okay so
now I went ahead and deleted everything
inside the prototype except for what we
did in the previous episode so as you
guys can see this is all identical to
what we did previously
in the last episode ok so the first
thing we need to do to create this
upload system is that we need to create
the database we're going to use in order
to upload these images so I'm going to
go into my database or decent-size
phpMyAdmin and as you guys can see I
already created a database called image
upload so if you guys don't have a
database yet or if you already have one
running for another website just go
ahead and use that database go ahead and
create one first so inside my image
upload database we're going to go and
create two tables I'm going to go into
the SQL tab up in the top here so you
can write SQL code and I'm going to go
ahead and create two tables the first
one is going to be the user table
so I'm going to say create user or
create table not user of course and then
what kind of call this one user we're
going to go and insert some values or
some values for the columns we're going
to insert into the user table so we're
going to say parentheses and then
semicolon and inside of here we're going
to say that the first column is going to
be named ID the ID is going to be a data
type set as integer we're going to set
it to maximum of 11 characters we're
going to set to not null and then we're
going to go and set this one as our
primary key we also need to set it to
auto increments so it automatically
updates to a new number higher every
time we add a new user like so and then
comma and then on the next line we're
going to go and say we have a first name
so we're going to say first we're going
to create a batch our data type going to
set to 256 not null and again this is
all stuff you guys know how to do by now
so we're just going to move a little bit
faster here so last name
ma Chau 256 not null and then we're
going to create a user name I'm just
going to go and call what we have up
here because it's going to be completely
identical and then the last one is going
to be the password once a password it's
going to be much as well 256 and not no
and no calm at the end here so after we
created the table for a user we can
actually go ahead and run the code after
we ran the code need to create a second
table because once we create this image
upload system we need to be able to tell
if we already uploaded an image or if we
didn't because if you haven't uploaded a
profile image we need to get the default
image that I showed you guys inside my
uploads folder so what we're going to do
here is I'm going to go and create
new table and this table is going to
tell us the status if we already
uploaded a profile image or not so we're
going to say create table profile image
again we're going to insert some column
values the first one is going to be an
ID completely the same as we did for the
user so we're going to say integer 11
not now primary key and also increment
it like so now the second column is
going to be the ID of the user inside
the user table when we do actually need
to link the profile image we have in
here to the user so we need to know
which user has which status of this
profile image so we say user ID which is
going to be the next name for next
column we're going to say integer
because the ID of the users inside the
user table is an integer as well so why
not just make it integer 11 characters
and not not then we need one more piece
of data because now we told it which
user has this image status so now we
need to actually set the status as if we
uploaded or did not upload the image yet
so I'm going to say status like so
integer 11 characters and not know so
that's all we need for the profile image
table we have in here we just need to
know which user the image is linked to
and did he already or did he not upload
a profile image so we're going to go
ahead and say go so now we created the
database we're going to use for this
entire episode so that's all we need to
create in here so going inside our code
the first thing we're going to do inside
the index the PHP file is we're going to
go ahead and set a session at the very
top of our page because in order to be
logged in we need to have a session
running inside the entire page so I'm
just going to go ahead and create a
session up at the very top here so we
need to UM about PHP tags like so and
inside the PHP tags you create a session
underscore start
so now we have a session started on the
entire front page which we need to have
now the next thing we're going to do is
we're going to go ahead and start a
connection to a database like these
create a connection so we have it for a
database so I'm gonna bubble new file
and I'm going to go ahead and save this
one as DBH dot PHP inside my root folder
now the code we're going to run in here
is going to be the opening PHP tags
first of all we need that and we're
going to create a variable called pun
which is equal to the parameters we need
in order to tell it which database we're
connecting to so we need to say my SQL i
underscore connects parentheses and
inside of here we'll need four different
parameters first of all we need to tell
which server we're actually choosing for
the database which in this case is
localhost because it's not online comma
the next one is going to be the username
which in my case is root for my exam and
then the password is going to be empty
because I'm using xampp again if you're
using another program for your localhost
then you need to go ahead and check in
which username and password you have for
it
the fourth parameter is going to be the
database name then my case I decide to
call mine image upload if you have
another name for your database you need
to change this to whatever you have for
yourself so we're just going to go and
create this because we're not going to
do a bunch of error messages we're just
going to go and create the very basics
in order to get this image upload system
running because this part here is also
if you guys could have learned when we
created our login system so we're not
going to go too much into detail here so
once I have this we can actually go
ahead and go back to the index page and
we can link this DBH document to our
front page so at the very top here right
underneath the session start we're going
to go ahead and say include on the score
once single quotes DBH dot PHP so now
included this document in here so now we
do actually get a connection to the data
so the next thing we need to create is
our login and lock out forms of course
we could do this and then kind of order
we wanted to but I'm just going to go
and create the login and logout form
first because why not so what we're
going to do here is we're going to go
ahead and go underneath the form we
created in the previous episode what we
did actually upload images I'm going to
go ahead and create a form down here now
this form is going to be our login form
so I'm just going to go ahead and set a
action which is equal to login dot PHP
I'm going to set a method as post and
then I'm going to go ahead and give it a
button now we're not going to give it an
input because remember I'm not trying to
create a an input field for the username
and password I just want a button that I
can click and get logged in as the first
use I created inside the database which
in this case is the admin so I'm just
going to go ahead and create a button
I'm going to set the button tight as
submits I'm going to go and give it a
name which is equal to submits login
like so now inside the button we can go
ahead and say lock in just so we know
what it does and I'm going to go ahead
and create a paragraph right on top of
the form so we can tell ourselves what
this form does so I'm just going to go
and create paragraph tags and I'm going
to go ahead and say login as user so now
what it does now we're going to go ahead
and create a second form we're just
going to copy everything we have up here
because it's going to be pretty
identical to it and this one is going to
say log out as user like so now we're
going to go ahead and change the action
to lock out the PHP and we're going to
go ahead and change the title inside the
button to lock out like so well is it
going to change the name of the button
so it doesn't say submit login but is to
say submit log out and that's basically
what we need to do for the forms we have
in here so now we need to create
documents that allow for us to log in
and allow for us to log out
so we're going to open the new documents
I'm going to go ahead and save it as
login dot PHP enzyme a root folder and
inside this file we're going to go ahead
and open up the PHP tags now we're going
to go and create a session that has
started because we need to have that in
order to lock in a person when he clicks
the button we need to have a session
running underneath here we're going to
go and create an if statement and inside
the condition we're going to go ahead
and check if the button has been clicked
so we're going to say is set parenthesis
and then we're going to check for post
method called submit lock in so I'm
going to say dollar sign underscore post
brackets single quotes then we're going
to say submits log in with a pick out at
least in my case I wrote it as a bigger
now inside the if statement we're going
to go ahead and lock in the person as
the person inside the database that has
the session ID or at least an ID as one
so I'm going to say we have a session
variable which is a super global by the
way you guys notice by now if you know
how to create a login system and we're
going to go ahead and call this one ID
I'm going to set it equal to one because
you just want the first ID from the
database and again we're not actually
getting anything from the database I'm
just saying I want to be logged in as
the first user inside the database that
has the ID as one so we're not doing any
kind of special thing in here so
underneath here the last thing we need
to add is a header function so it can
actually be taken back to the front page
once we did actually log in so I'm going
to say double quotes location with a big
L and then we're going to go ahead and
set it to index dot PHP and that's all
we need to have inside the log in the
PHP file now the next thing we need to
add is we're going to go to add a logout
file so I'm going to save a new file of
logout dot PHP and then we need to do
kind of the same thing in here we need
to first of all start out the PHP tags
and then we need to set a session start
because in order to destroy a session we
need to either started first then we're
going to set a set
in underscore unset which unsaid all the
variables we have inside our session
variables and then we're going to
destroy it afterwards with a session
underscore destroy like so so now we
just locked our person out if it does
actually click the logout button now we
also need to be taken back to the front
page so I'm going to create a header
function here as well call the exact
same thing logout or location not logout
: index dot PHP so now we just created a
login and logout button that actually
works and now what we're going to do is
we're going to go ahead and tell the
website what we want to see if I logged
in and what we want to see when we
logged out so we're going to go back
into the index the PHP file the very top
of the body we're going to go ahead and
open up PHP code with the PHP tags and
then inside the PHP tags we're going to
create an if statement and this if
statement is going to check if we're
logged in so what we're going to do is
we're going to check for a session ID
that's set as ID so we're going to say
tell us on on the score actually no
we're going to say is set parentheses
and then dollar sign underscore session
which again is the superglobal that has
a name as ID so now we're just checking
if we are locked in then do whatever is
inside the if statement so what we want
to do inside the if statement is we want
to create another if statement because
we want to check if we're logged in as
admin or at least the first person
inside the database so we're going to
say is set parentheses then we're going
to say if the session ID we have up here
it's equal to 1 then write something
inside this if statement so I'm going to
say echo you are locked in as user
number one or something we could also
call it admin if you wanted to but right
now we're basically locking ourselves in
as user number 1 from the database so
we're just going to say user number 1
now what we also want to do is you want
to go ahead and show
if we are locked in the form we created
in the previous episode that allows for
us to upload images because we don't
want to see the former we can upload
profile images if we're not logged in we
should only be able to upload images if
we logged in so I'm going to go ahead
and copy this form down here delete it
then I'm going to go and go inside the
first if statement after the second one
and then I'm going to go ahead and echo
a string which is going to be this form
you just copied down there now of course
we do need to change these double quotes
to single quotes because we have single
quotes around it I'm just going to going
to do that really quick like so like so
like so and change them so now we
basically have our image upload form
inside the if statement X if we're
locked in because now if I'm not logged
in we can actually see the form so what
we can do now is we can actually go and
test this really quickly just to see
what's going on so if we're going to set
the website you guys can see oh we do
actually get an error message let's
actually go ahead and fix that we don't
set and is set for if we're checking if
the session ID is equal to one we just
need to check if the session ID is equal
to one so if you caught that mistake
great job so now if you go back to the
website refresh you guys can see we now
get this right now it says you are
logged in as user one so if I go ahead
and say logout
we don't get a message if I click login
we get a message so this is basically
working like we wanted to so what we can
do now is we can go ahead and see one
message if we're locked out because
right now as you guys can see we don't
see anything if I go inside my code
right after the if statement which says
if we're locked in then do this down
here we can go and create the else
statement now inside this else statement
we're going to echo you are not locked
in just so we can see we're not locked
in as you guys can see if I were to go
back it now says you are not locked in
then if you login it doesn't say it
anymore so what we need to add
underneath here is we're going to go
ahead and add a signup form because
we're not logged in we want to be able
to sign up a new user
so what we're going to go ahead and do
is we're going to go down to the next
line and we're going to start creating
the HTML form that allows for us to sign
up a new person so we're going to say
echo a string and then inside the string
we're going to create the form tags like
so then inside the form tags we're going
to go ahead and create the input we need
in order to sign up a person so we need
to say input which is going to have a
type which is equal to text we need to
set a name which is equal to first
because now we're going to go into the
database make sure that all the inputs
fill out what we have inside the user
table so if I go into the structure of
my user you guys can see we have a first
name we have a last name a username and
a password so we need to fill out all
those four fields of course the first
one which is dydy
is not going to get filled out because
it does it automatically so we're going
to go back inside our code and inside
the input we're going to go ahead and
put a placeholder so we can actually see
what is written inside this input inside
the browser so I'm going to say first
name then we're going to close the input
and then we're just going to go ahead
and copy it down three more times like
so then we're going to go and change the
second one to last inside the name
I'm going to change the placeholder to
last name then the third one we're going
to go and change the name to username or
these UID which in my mind stands for
username inside the placeholder we're
going to say username in the fourth one
we're going to change the type to
password we're going to change the name
to PWD I'm going to change the
placeholder to password like so then
we're going to create a button
like so and inside the button tag we're
going to go ahead and set a type which
is equal to submit we're going to go
ahead and set a name which is equal to
submits sign up and this is basically
all we need to do for the inputs now
inside the form tag at the very top here
we also need to set an action and a
method so we're going to say action
which is equal to login dot PHP then the
method is going to be equal to a post
method so now we just created everything
we needed for login form or the signup
form not the login form so we'll go back
to the website you guys consider once we
log out we get a sign-up form of course
we forgot to put something inside the
button let's do that really quickly so
inside our button down here inside the
signup form we're going to say sign up
so now it should look correctly there we
go
so now that we have that we need to
create the code in order to sign up a
person inside the database in order to
do that we need to see what is going on
inside the browser
so before we start signing up people we
should probably create the thing that
tells us how the user looks like inside
a browser so as you guys remember at the
top of my prototype you could actually
see if we had a user inside the database
or not and if we had a user it showed us
what the user name was what the name of
the person was and what the profile
image looks like so need to create that
first and then we can start signing
people up so at the very top of our page
here inside the body tag actually now
inside the PHP tag up here we're going
to go ahead and start selecting users
from the database because we need to see
if there is any kind of user from the
database and if there is we want to show
them inside the top of our website if
there isn't any users then we want to
show a message that says there are no
users so the first thing we're going to
do is we're going to go ahead and create
a select statement so need to write SQL
code so we're going to say we have a
variable called
SQL which is equal to double quotes
select
all from you sir let's play see what we
need then on the next line we're going
to go ahead and run this query so we're
going to say dollar sign result which is
equal to my SQL I underscore query
parentheses semicolon and then inside
the parentheses we're going to say we
have a database connection inside our
DBA to the PHP file which is called
dollar sign con which is going to be the
first parameter because we need to
connect to the database and then for the
second parameter we need to run the SQL
code up here so we get all the results
from this SQL string we we just queried
on the next line we're going to start
spitting out the results so first of all
we're going to go and check if we
actually got any results from the
database because if we don't have any
users inside the database yet we're
going to get an error message so if you
start spitting out stuff so first of all
we're going to say if we had any kind of
database results by writing my SQL i
underscore num underscore rose
parentheses from the query we ran called
dollar sign result that is greater than
zero so we had any more results than
zero running this query up here then we
want to run the code we have in here and
in here we want to say okay if we had
any results then while we have results
we want to spit them out so I'm going to
create a while loop there we go so
inside the while loop we're going to say
dollar sign row which is equal to my SQL
i underscore fetch underscore a suck
parenthesis from the query ran inside
the Select statement like so so if we
got any results and spit out each row
result inside our while loop based on
this query up here so now that we did
this normally we would start spitting
out the stuff we want to see from the
user inside the database so if I want to
show a tip box with the user image and
the user you know the username and the
first name and last name I could go
ahead and start writing it inside this
while loop but we can't do that yet
because first of all we need to check if
we have uploaded any kind of profile
images to this user yet because based on
that we're going to have to run another
select statement that goes in and checks
if we already upload a profile image so
in order to explain it to you guys
properly before we start writing
anything new let's go ahead and go back
inside the database just to show you
guys what's going on here now inside my
user table the first use I'm going to
sign up is going to have an ID which is
equal to one now because that user is
going to have an ID we also need to say
that once we sign this person up he
needs to have a row inside a profile
image table which at the moment looks
like this
so inside the profile image table we
need to tell it what the use ideas of
the user and what the status is did he
already upload or did he not upload a
profile image so based on the status we
need to say do we want to show the
default image inside the folder or do we
want to show the new image that he
uploaded himself so I want to check this
and need to check the user ID in here we
need to create another select statement
or at least we need to first of all get
to use ID of the person who is inside
the user table so we're going to go
ahead and say dollar sign ID which is
equal to dollar sign row single quotes
ID which now gets the ID of the user
just selected from the database now
because we have this we now can go in
and check the database inside the other
table we have if the status of this user
says that he already uploaded a profile
image so we're going to go and create
another select statement we're going to
say dollar sign SQL which is equal to a
select statement let's actually go and
change this text so we have SQL image
which is equal to a select statement or
we select all from profile image inside
our table where the user ID column that
we have inside the user inside the
profile image table is equal to the ID
we have up here
we just got from the user so now we're
checking if we actually have a profile
image uploaded from this user now the
next thing we're going to do is we're
going to go ahead and run this query
inside the database so we can just go
and copy what we have up here where we
actually run the previous query and then
we just change the name of it down here
so we don't have SQL we have SQL image
and then we contains the result name
over here so we say we have results
image and then we go ahead and go in and
check what the status is of this user
inside the the image table we created
so just to recap for you guys the basic
thing that's going on here is that we're
going into the database checking if we
have users inside the database if we
have users then should start looping
them out one after another but each time
it loops out one user is it also going
to check if that user has an image that
you uploaded inside the root folder of
our website now the image so at least
the status is going to show inside a
profile image table and based on that we
want to show the image or we don't want
to show the image that you uploaded or
not so after we did this we're going to
go and run another while loop and inside
of here is where we're going to start
looping out the data we want to show
inside the browser because now we have
data from both database tables and we
can start spitting out whatever we have
from them so inside the parameter of
this while loop we're going to go ahead
and say if dollar sign row image equals
my SQL i underscore fetch underscore at
stock parenthesis then we're going to
get Dulles and result image from up here
we're going to insert it inside the
parentheses so running this query up
here and now we can start spitting out
the information we want to show inside
the website so now that we create the
while loop we can actually start
spitting out the stuff we want to see
inside the browser for example a tip box
with the image inside of it and the user
name and the first and last name of the
user we can start spitting that out so
what we're going to do here is I'm first
of all going to echo out a string which
is going to be a dip box I'm also going
to go and close the dip box in a second
echo underneath here because we need to
put some stuff in between like so
and then the next thing we're going to
do is we're going to go ahead and check
if the status of the image says it's
uploaded or not uploaded already so
we're going to create an if statement
where we go into the second query ran
which is called doubles on row image
brackets and we're going to check if the
status inside this column says that the
image has been uploaded or if it has not
been uploaded yet so I'm going to say if
it's equal to zero then we already
uploaded an image but if it's not zero
then we want to create an else statement
down here that says we haven't uploaded
an image yet so we need to echo out the
default image I inserted inside my my
root folder inside the upload folder so
we're going to go ahead and dig in a
path we're going to create an image it
has a source equal to single quotes
uploads forward slash profile default
dot JPEG then after the single quote
we're going to go ahead and close off
the image tag so now we're basically
showing the default limits I have inside
my root folder if we don't have any kind
of changes made to the profile image yet
now inside the other if statement up
here we're going to go and copy this
echo we're going to insert it and
instead of writing profile default you
want to write profile and then delete
the default we're going to start up yet
P code again by writing double quotes
then to punctuation and then we want to
show the user ID from the user inside of
here because now the name of the image
is going to be profile one because the
gun logged in us right now has an ID as
one inside the database so right now
that image is going to be called profile
one so what we need to make sure we do
now is that once we do actually upload a
new profile image we need to change the
name to something else than a unique ID
you create it in a previous episode as
you guys can see down here we create the
new file name we made unique ID which we
now need to change to whatever we have
inside here instead
okay and we need to do that in just a
few minutes so one last thing we need to
do is we need to go ahead and say well
if we have no users inside the database
yet then we need to have an else
statement that says there are no users
inside the database so there are no
users signed up yet so we're going to
echo out an else statement that says
there are no users yet now we need to
finish out what we have inside the dip
box because right now we're just showing
the image but I also want to show the
user name and the first name and last
name of the user are these just a user
name doesn't really matter so right
underneath the else statement we're
going to go ahead and say you have an
echo that echoes out the username of the
person inside the database so right now
we want to go up and grab the query from
the last result we got up here which is
dull assign row and say we have a column
called username so now we're echoing out
the username and the image of the person
inside the database so now that we
created this we're basically done inside
the index page except for one more thing
we need to do at the end but now what we
need to do is we need to make sure that
when we sign up a new person using the
signup form we have down here that we
insert data inside the user table and
inside the profile image table inside
the database once we've done that we're
basically done creating this image
upload system well we also need to
change the upload PHP file we have
inside from the previous episode but
that's really easy code to do so we're
almost done so what we're going to do
now is we're going to go and create a
new file we're going to save it as sign
up dot PHP and inside of here the first
thing we're going to do is going to open
up the PHP tags and then after we click
the sign up button inside our index page
we need to grab the data to be passed on
from the index page right now as you
guys can see if I go down to the signup
form we have a first name a last name a
username and a password so inside the
sign of the PHP file we're going to say
we have a variable called first which is
equal to a super global called post
that has a name as first then we're just
going to go and copy this paste it down
three more times and then we're just
going to go and change the names inside
these variables and inside the
superglobal so the second one was called
last in the third one we called it UID
and the fourth one are called the PWD
for password so now that we have this we
can start inserting the data inside the
user table so what we're going to do is
we want to create a variable called SQL
which is equal to double quotes insert
into the user table parentheses space
values space parentheses semicolon at
the end and then we need to insert the
column names and the values we have from
up here so in the first parenthesis
we're going to say we have first comment
last comment username comma password
then I'm just going to go and move this
down to the next line just so we can see
this better and inside the parentheses
here I'm going to say single quotes then
the variable first we have up here like
so comma single quotes variable last
comment single quotes variable you ID
comma single quote and then dollar sign
PWD
so now we're just inserting data inside
the user table or at least we have the
string that we need to query in order to
insert it into the user table so
underneath here I'm going to say dollar
sign result I'm going to set it equal to
my SQL I on the school query parentheses
then we need to get the database
connection which we haven't gotten yet
so we need to go to the top of the page
here include underscore once single
quotes DPH and dot PHP semicolon because
now we can go in and get the database
connection which is dollar sign
con-com at and then we want to run the
query which is up here called dos on SQL
and once we've done this we signed up
the user now one small detail just
notice is that we don't actually need to
have the dollar sign result equal to
down here so I'm just going to go and
remove that and then right underneath
where we have the insert statement we
now need to go into the database select
the user we just inserted into the
database so we can use this information
to create a new row inside the profile
image table inside our database so on
the next line here we're just going to
go and copy everything we have right
here and instead of an insert statement
we're going to create a select statement
so we're going to say select all from
user where you ID or not the edita
username is equal to u ID from up here
and first is equal to the first name we
have up here now you might be asking why
am i doing two different parameters down
here that's simply because we want to
eliminate as many errors as possible if
a user for some reason has signed up his
username as the exact same thing as
another user then we would end up going
in and overriding that first user so we
want to make sure the user name and the
first name is the same just to make sure
there's less errors so after we have
this we can now go down to the query
down here and we can go ahead and say
that we have a variable called results
that is equal to the query that we just
ran in here after the query we then run
an if statements and inside the
condition of this if statement you want
to check if we had any results from this
select statement here so I'm going to
say if my SQL I on the score num
underscore rose parentheses from the
dollar sign result here greater than
zero so we have more than one result
then it needs to run this code down here
else want to give an error message that
says echo
you have an error or something inside
the if statement we now need to get the
data from this user we just insert it
into the database so I'm going to go
ahead and say we have a while loop
parentheses curly brackets and inside
the while loop condition we're going to
say dollar sign row is equal to my SQL i
underscore fetch underscore s sup
parentheses and then we're going to say
double sign result inside the
parentheses so now we're basically
getting all the data from the use of
just insert it into the database inside
the while loop we want to get one piece
of information from this user we need to
get his ID inside this column so I'm
going to go ahead and say we have dollar
sign user ID which is equal to dollar
sign row brackets and inside the
brackets you want to say we want to get
the ID of this user here so now that we
have the ID we can actually go out and
insert a new row inside a profile image
column so what I'm going to do here is
I'm going to go ahead and say we have a
new insert statement so I'm just going
to copy what we have up here paste
underneath here move everything out so
it looks nice like so and then we're
going to change it from insert into user
to insert into profile image then we're
going to change it inside the parameters
because we only have two so I'm going to
change the from first to user ID and
then from last to status then inside the
values we're also going to delete the
last two because we only have two
different parameters we want to change
it from doubles on first to use ID
because we want to insert the user ID of
the user inside the user ID inside the
profile image column and then inside the
second parameter we're just going to go
and delete what we have here and write 1
now the reason we're writing 1 is
because right now inside the index page
once we loop out the user inside our
website we're checking if he has a
status inside his profile image set to 0
or one if it's zero then we're looping
out the profile image he uploaded if
it's one then we're basically saying
that it doesn't have a profile image yet
so right now because it's just signed up
he doesn't have a profile image yet so
now we're going to go and save this and
the last thing we need to do is we need
to take us back to the front page we're
going to say header at least I had a
function location colon index dot PHP so
now we'll basically have everything we
need in order to test this out because
it should be working now so if we go
back inside our website we can actually
go ahead and refresh everything right
now it says there are no users yet
you're not logged in because when I
logged in we didn't create any users yet
if I were to go in and try and sign
myself up with Danielle Nelson admin why
not one two three sign up you guys can
see we now get a profile image my
username which now shows we have a user
inside the database of course it doesn't
look exactly the same as what I showed
you guys my prototype because we have an
X because we have an exit style anything
yet but as you guys can see we now have
the profile image and the admin so now
that we have the profile limits here
what I'm going to do really quick is I'm
going to go ahead and style this very
quickly I'm going to show you guys to
code so you guys can copy it but I'm
just going to go and paste in some code
I created from our prototype so the
first thing I'm going to do to make it
look nice is I'm going to go into my
index page I'm going to go into my div
that have inside my while loop in here
and I'm going to go ahead and give it a
class I'm going to give it a class name
as user
- container then I'm going to go ahead
and say that the username down here is
going to be inside two paragraphs or
inside one paragraph like so and like so
and then I'm going to go into my style
sheet which you haven't created yet I'm
just going to create one really quick
I'm going to save it a style of CSS like
so and then I'm just going to go and
paste in all the code I have for my
styling again if you guys want to see
this I'm going to go and leave a link in
the description
guys we can download this stylesheet
link so you can just paste it if you
want to so now I'm just going to go into
my index the PHP file I'm going to go
ahead and link to the stylesheet up here
at the very top style dot CSS and now
I'm going to go into the website refresh
it and as you guys can see we now have a
bit of styling so it doesn't look
completely ugly so what I'm going to do
now I'm going to go ahead and lock in
my user by clicking login as user once
I'm locked in it says you're logged in
as user number one and now I connect to
start uploading profile images to my
profile here but we need to make a small
change to the document created in the
previous episode which is the one called
upload to PHP because we don't want the
name to be some kind of unique number
and we need to make sure that once we
upload a new image we also make a small
change to the database so the top of
this document here we're going to go
ahead and start a session like so and
once we start a session I'm going to go
ahead and go underneath here connect to
my database file we're going to include
on the score once DBH dot PHP after
including the database file we now need
to get the session ID of the users just
locked in because in order to change the
profile limits we now need to tell the
database who we are as a user so which
kind of use name or use ID do we
currently have so underneath the include
I'm going to say we have a variable
called ID which is equal to the current
session ID like so so now we have
everything we need in order to change
the name of the file we're going to
upload so I'm going to go back down to
where we just created a new file name
called dulles on file name new and I'm
going to go ahead and delete the unique
ID we have down here first of all we're
going to go and include a new string I'm
going to say double quotes I'm going to
say profile then after double quote
we're going to say punctuation and then
we want to reference to the current
session ID so I'm going to say dollar
sign ID so now the name of the file is
going to be profile then the name of my
current session ID punctuation and then
the file extension so now that we have
this all we need to do now is go into
the profile image database table and
update the information we have in there
because right now the status is set to
one which means that we haven't uploaded
a profile image yet but we want to
change to zero to tell it that we just
uploaded an image we now have a current
profile image inside our root folder so
right before we go into the header
location or the header function down
here because we need to do this before
we go back to the front page we're going
to go ahead and write an SQL statement
we're going to save dollars on SQL
double quotes and then I'm going to say
update profile image and we're going to
go and set the status column equal to
zero where the user ID is equal to a
current session ID so dollar sign ID and
our last thing we need to do is we just
need to run the query and after that we
just need to do one more thing which is
very short and then we're done so I'm
going to go and say dollar sign result
is equal to my SQL eye on the score
query parentheses semi-colon and inside
here we're going to get the database
connection for con and then we want to
get dollar sign SQL so now that we did
this we can actually go and test this
because now it should be working so
we're going to the website refresh I
choose some kind of profile image and I
select maybe myself in here upload
whoops we get a error message upload the
PHP line 27 let's actually go ahead and
check that out
ah I forgot to add a semicolon at the
end here there we go now we can go in
and check that it's working so let's
actually go ahead and refresh again
choose a file and upload and as you guys
can see my image just changed because
now if we go into the database go into
the profile image it now says my status
is equal to zero meaning that I now have
uploaded a profile image even though we
set it as one when we created the user
if I were to go in and clear
new user justice area guys I'm going to
call this one Jane Doe I'm going to call
her something else one two three
sign her up now you guys can see that
she also have the default limits and if
you go into the profile image database
just to show you guys her image status
right now says that she has a status as
one meaning that it doesn't have a
profile limit if I were to lock in a
stain and change the image it will get
teens to 0 which is what we just did
with my profile so this is basically how
we can do this now one last thing I want
to mention is that if I were to go in
and change my profile image again if I
were to log in choose another image
right now you guys can see it didn't
change for some reason even though I
just uploaded a new image and there's
not an error caused by the image file
name or anything like that but it's
actually because some browsers can
remember how images look like so forward
to refresh there's enough times you guys
can see now it changed so we want to
make some kind of change so it doesn't
happen so it needs to update the profile
image right away after we change the
image now known to do that we're going
to go back inside index to PHP and
inside index to PHP we're going to go
down to where we have the name of our
image so right now it says we have
profile variable ID dot jpg right after
the jpg we want to add a random number
of some kind in order for it to always
update the name of the image because if
it just keep updating the image without
changing the name then the browser is
kind of think it's the same image as
last time right before we change the
image so we want to update it right away
we need to also update the name of the
image when the browser loads damage so
after jpg we're going to say question
mark and then after the single quote I'm
going to say double quotes because we
want to change the two PHP code right
now punctuation marks and then we're
going to go ahead and create a function
called MT on the score random which is
going to give us a random number between
a certain amount of numbers we're going
to say parentheses now because we're not
setting any kind of parameters in here
it's just going to give us some kind of
random number so this is basically all
we have to do for this episode and I
hope you
guys find a useful even though it's
quite long but this is basically how to
change profile images or these one of
the ways you can change profile images
because there's quite a few ways you can
do this
so we guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys
