about something called a header and the
reason we're going to do this is because
we did talk about headers and paragraphs
and early episodes but we just mentioned
it we didn't really go into it that much
so in this episode we're gonna focus on
doing that so what we're gonna do here
is I'm gonna go ahead and go down into
my main content like the section part
down here and I'm gonna go below the
video we created so I'm gonna go ahead
and create a another div box here
another container for some other stuff
I'm gonna go ahead and call this one
well I'm gonna give it a name inside a
class and I'm gonna call it index - text
all we could call index - intro that
sounds better we can go ahead and copy
this and just go and put it inside our
style sheet so we can actually style
this box
I'm gonna go to open up the code and in
here we're gonna go ahead and give it a
width as a hundred percent I'm gonna
give it a we're not gonna give it a
height we're actually gonna give it a
padding actually let's go ahead and wait
with that because I want to show you
guys exactly what we're gonna do with
the padding so I'm just gonna give it a
width and we're gonna go ahead and give
it a background color
now just for now a good rule of thumb or
not a rule of thumb but a good trick is
when you're creating something on your
website and you just want to see where
the stuff is you can give it a
background color as something really
really obvious so I'm gonna go and make
this one red I'm gonna save it and do
notice that it did not give it a height
and like I said in the last episode when
you do not give it a height it's gonna
automatically adjust to the content so
now that we have this I'm gonna go and
go back into my index file inside my
index intro tags we're also going to put
in a wrapper so we're gonna create a div
give it a class equal to wrapper
now inside the wrapper we're gonna go
ahead and create our header the way you
create a header and the header by the
way is the title is by creating
something called a ate tag so you open
up the code right H and then you need to
give it some kind of number now the
number we're giving it it's gonna depend
on how important the header is for
example h1 is going
be the most important title an entire
website a rule of thumb is also you
should not have more than one h1 tag per
page so if I were to create something
really important here let's say well we
might not have it as an h1 but maybe an
h2 which is the second most important
thing on our page so we're just gonna go
ahead and create this one so I'm gonna
make sure I do open and close it and
inside here we can put some text so if
it were to say this is an intro title
exclamation mark then we do have some
text going on inside a header now
underneath here we could actually create
something else call or call the
paragraph which is inside something
called a pit tag and just like before
you do actually to open the P tag and
close it then we can go ahead and put
some text in here now when it comes to
putting text I can actually show you
guys a little trick which is to go to a
website called Lipson dot-com and going
in here you can actually go ahead and
generate some random little exum lower
lorem ipsum if I can say correctly boom
if some text which will allow you to get
this random gibberish and this is very
good to use as a placeholder me when you
do create a website and you need to you
know borrow some text because you might
not have you know any kind of text
thought up that you want to use yet so
I'm just gonna cut in copy this go into
my code and paste in some random text
I'm gonna go ahead and save it and then
we can actually go ahead and refresh our
website so as you guys can see we do
have the red background and we do also
have a title here I'm not just gonna go
ahead and win for you guys
so we do have a title down there and we
also have some random text now I want
some spacing from the top and bottom of
where the text start and finishes and
instead of creating a height inside my
div because I want it to be flexible
what I can do instead is say okay well
we need to look at the height of the div
which right now is the height of however
much the content is filling so when I
take the height I would like to add an
additional
space on top and bottom so inside my
code in order to do that I need to go
into my stylesheet go down into my index
intro box that we created and then I'm
gonna go ahead and create a padding now
the padding we can either do in two
different ways either we can say padding
- top and set it equal to a certain
pixels so let's say we give it a 80
pixels I'm gonna save it if i refresh my
page you guys will notice if you
actually get some space between the text
and the video like so now another way to
do it instead of same padding top a
padding bottom left or right is we could
just go ahead and eliminate the desktop
so right now we're creating a padding
and right now it's gonna be padding top
right bottom and left it's gonna be 80
pixels so if I were to save this just to
show you guys it's gonna start looking
like this which is not quite what we
want to cuz now we can actually scroll
sideways because we do actually have 80
pixels going to the side do not want
that so if you go into our code instead
what do you need to calculate this right
here is the same thing as multiplying
this four times so top right left bottom
right that's how we're counting it so if
I want to have 80 pixels from the top
I'm gonna keep the first one now I don't
want anything from the right side so I'm
just gonna go ahead and write zero
pixels now from the bottom I do also
want 80 pixels so I'm just going to
leave that one but from the left side I
also do not want anything so I'm just
gonna write zero saving this refreshing
the website you'll notice that now we
can scroll sideways anymore and our text
does actually appear you know a little
bit away from the top and bottom meaning
that now we can have something that
looks quite nice now we talked about
using four different values here let's
go ahead and just delete the last two
because doing it this way it will come
from top right then it's gonna go back
to the beginning bottom left so this was
essentially be the same thing as what we
just wrote so if I saved there's a
refresh you'll notice that there's no
difference in here so this is how we
create a spacing from the top and bottom
I'm just going to
ahead and leave this for now we're gonna
create a we're gonna delete the
background color so we can I see what
we're doing and refresh now when it
comes to creating the header let's go
ahead and go back to the header again
when it comes to creating the header as
a default a lot of headers do have a
font weight to it so if I want to
eliminate the font weight I'm gonna go
ahead and go down underneath here I'm
gonna actually I'm gonna go ahead and
copy this one we just have it's go
underneath here and then after the index
intro I'm gonna say space they're not
gonna say 8 2 so we're saying inside our
index 10 so we have a 8 to then I'm
gonna go ahead and style the header here
so in order to eliminate the font weight
we can just say font - let's see if I
can actually write this correctly font -
weight and set it to 100 not pick who
not don't include pixels on anything
just go ahead and write hundred so after
we do this I can go and refresh my
browser and as you guys will notice the
tick down here is actually a little bit
Bowl now let's go ahead and zoom in so
you guys can see it properly the text
here is a bit bold so when i refresh
it's gonna turn into a text that looks
very similar to our paragraph down here
it's actually very identical right now
so this is how you eliminate the
boldness of a header so now because it's
a header we do of course want to look a
bit different so we're gonna go back
into our style sheet
I'm gonna save font - family to make the
text a little bit different we can say
lapto because it did actually include
the letter font in an earlier episode so
I'm gonna just go ahead and use that one
then I can actually go ahead and go back
to the font weight because I do not want
it to be too slim so I'm just gonna go
ahead and say actually that's good and
say 700 underneath the font family we
can say font size because maybe want it
to be a little bit larger than it is
right now we can say font size as 24
pixels then I'm gonna go ahead and save
it and I'm gonna go and refresh my
browser and you guys will notice that
suddenly changed what we can also do now
is we can actually go ahead and center
out header so what I'm gonna do down
here some I'm gonna go ahead and say
text
- align Center and then it's actually
going to align to the center of our
screen so going back in here you guys
will notice that it's in the center now
we might want to create some spacing
underneath the text and when it comes to
text when you want to create spacing at
least when it comes to text if you want
to create space sideways you need to use
margins if you want to create spacing
from the top or bottom you need to
create padding it's just kind of a rule
of thumb you need to follow so once we
go into the eighth - we're gonna say
padding colon then we're gonna go ahead
and say 40 actually let's go ahead and
say zero pixels access we just need a
padding bottom because there's a lot
easier so I'm gonna say padding bottom
and then in here we're gonna go ahead
and say 10 pixels so going back into our
code you'll see that now we get some
spacing so this is essentially how we
create a header and if ago hadn't zoom
back out to 100% you guys will see that
we do actually get something that's a
bit more distinctive so once we have the
header we can actually start creating
the paragraph down here which we'll do
in the next episode and then we'll talk
about a bit of text styling because
there's quite a lot you can do to text
to make it different so we're just gonna
go ahead and do that in the next episode
one more thing I want to show you guys
is sometimes when you create headers you
might want everything to be uppercase
now when we created the navigation up
here we did just write everything
uppercase inside the navigation but a
better way might be to go into your
stylesheet and do it instead because if
I have to change a lot of different text
everywhere into non uppercase have a
regret doing uppercase
then I'm gonna have to go into every
single piece of code I wrote everywhere
inside my files and change the back so
instead it's mostly suggest going to go
inside your style sheet so if I were to
go inside my style sheet here what I can
do is I can say texts - transformed
and then we can go ahead and say
uppercase save it and as you'll notice
my text down here if i zoom in for you
guys becomes uppercase so this is how we
do headers and the reason you might want
to consider doing headers and not do
some paragraphs all the time because I
see that a lot on people that they just
go ahead and use paragraphs for
everything when you do want to make a
website you might want to consider
something called Co optimization which
means that your website becomes more
easy to find it's like Google when
people search for something and using
headers is a better way to do it if you
want to see you optimize your website so
just go ahead and make it a habit to use
headers whenever you have a title so
that's all we're gonna do in this
episode I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
