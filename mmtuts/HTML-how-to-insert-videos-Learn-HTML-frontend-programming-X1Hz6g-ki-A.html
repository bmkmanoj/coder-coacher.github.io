about how to import a video to the
website and if you take a look at the
website we have so far can actually see
the right now
we did actually finish the header so the
next part we need to create is the
section which is the part that goes in
between the header and the footer at the
bottom of the page so it's important to
note that everything you put inside the
section is the part that changes on
every single page so my thought was for
the front page we might as well try and
include a video at the very top of the
page so we can kind of see how we do
that so we talked about including videos
there's two different ways you can do it
either you can link to a video for
example and YouTube of email or you can
include it inside your root folder now
you might be thinking well this is kind
the same as when we included the fonts
into the website and yeah it kinda is
it's a bit the same but a little bit
different so what we're gonna do now is
we're going to talk about how to include
it with a URL or like a link so inside
our index.html page we're gonna go down
to the bottom where we have the section
and inside this section we're gonna
include a container meaning we're going
to create a dip box now this is a
container that's just going to keep the
video inside the section so we're gonna
go ahead and give this one a name called
class equal to quotation marks and we're
gonna set it to video - box so what
we're gonna do now is we're gonna go
ahead and go into our stylesheet and at
the very bottom of our style sheet we're
gonna go ahead and start styling this
dip box we just created so if I were to
give this one a class called video - box
above the code and then go ahead and
style it by giving it a width as a
hundred percent so we have it going all
the way from this to right we're gonna
give it a background color as hashtag -
- - which is a very dark gray color and
then we're going to go ahead and keep
this for now and you might ask why we're
not including a height to our box
well if you want a box to be flexible
and adjust the height according to what
kind of content is inside the box then
you're just gonna leave out the height
but that also means that right now
if I were to save this and go refresh my
browser we can actually see it we don't
see any dark gray background color of
inside a box here and that's because we
don't have any content inside of our dip
box yet
meaning that it's not gonna have a
height yet so going back to our index
dot HTML inside our video box we also
want the video to be able to censor
itself on the screen so we need to
include a wrapper so we're gonna say
we're gonna create a div and this dip is
gonna be called a class named wrapper
which we did already create in one of
the earlier episodes so now in order to
include the video we just need to put it
inside the wrapper tags so like I said
there's two ways you can include a video
and the first example we're going to go
to youtube and try to include a YouTube
video into the website now using this
way you could include something called
an iframe which is essentially when you
take a section of another website and
include it inside your own website now
so if we go ahead and go into this
YouTube video and this is just the last
video from from this series and go down
to the info section the loader video
you'll notice that we have a share
button if I click this one we get three
more options we have share embed and
email I'm gonna click on embed and then
you can see we get this long link or
like an iframe link that we can put
inside our website now I'm not just
gonna take this iframe link because I
would like to have a little bit more
customization over it so I'm gonna go
ahead and click show more and then
you'll see if we can suddenly customize
the size so my wrapper inside our
website is 960 pixels and you'll notice
that when I write 960 pixels it
automatically adjusts the height so it
says okay if this is the width then it
needs to have this height which is nice
because you want to have the same ratio
of height and width when you include
videos so now that I have this we can
also choose to take off some of these
buttons down here I'm just gonna choose
not to we're just gonna keep this for
now and then I'm gonna go to include the
entire iframe so I'm gonna copy it go
into my index that HTML included inside
the wrapper save it
and then we can go ahead and refresh our
browser so now you'll notice we do
actually have a video in here but
there's a couple of things I want to
change right now because we included a
iframe you'll notice that we do actually
have a couple of pixels down here at the
bottom if I go and assume in for you
guys at the bottom here we do have a
couple of pixels of background it's kind
of like the the height of the dip box
you have it inside up it's a little bit
taller than the video itself meaning
that we might have to go into our
stylesheet and go down and give it a
height so we're gonna go ahead and say
height and set it to 540 pixels because
that's the height of our video I'm gonna
go ahead and save it refresh and you'll
notice that the line disappears so now
that we have this you'll notice that you
also have quite little space going from
our container here to the header so I'm
gonna go and include a little bit more
height to the header so inside our
stylesheet I'm gonna go to the header
and say instead of 140 pixels I'm gonna
say hundred and sixty pixels high
refresh and there we go looks much
better so this is essentially how you
include a what you call an iframe which
is linking to a video if I want to
include something inside my root folder
we need to create something called a
html5 video now if you go into this
index file and delete the iframe so we
can actually get started under video I
want to talk about using html5 videos
because when it comes to using video
players inside your website not all
devices support all video players now
when it comes to html5 videos I think
all devices do support html5 videos but
there are some other video players out
there which are not supported by all
devices you'll notice that a lot of
Apple devices don't support a lot of
video players but html5 is one of those
two players that it does support meaning
that an html5 player is actually a
really good player to use inside your
website so the way we create a html5
player is first of all as you guys will
notice I did actually go into my root
folder I created a video
folder inside the video folder I
inserted a video called
my video dot mp4 which is the last
episode the same video we just went to
on YouTube and what you need to pay
attention to is that it's called dot mp4
because there's gonna be relevant for
later so now we go inside our section
and we start creating the video tag so
we're gonna open up the code we're gonna
write video space then we're gonna say
with equal to quotation marks and the
width is gonna be 960 pixels what we do
not need to include the pixel pipe so
just leave that out space we're gonna
set the height equal to quotation marks
to 540 pixels afterwards we can then
choose if you want to include the
controls to the way to the video and if
you want to auto play the video if you
want to include the controls
you just write controls inside here if
you also want to auto play just say
space and write all to play now we're
not gonna auto play the video because
that's just a little bit annoying for
this example so we're just gonna keep it
at controls then I'm gonna close it and
then close the video tag underneath here
like so and then we can actually start
including the path to the videos inside
these tags so inside here we're gonna
open up the code we're gonna write
source space SRC for source again equal
to quotation marks and then we need to
write the path to our video so like I
said we included a overt like we created
a video folder and inside this folder we
have a video called my video dot mp4 at
least I do if you guys have any kind of
video for this example actually I will
go ahead and include the video inside
the description of this video inside the
website not inside YouTube but inside
the website I'm building so you guys can
take this video and use it as an example
so you guys just going to go to
description and get it so after we
included this we need to write what kind
of type of video it is because it
doesn't know that it's an mp4 video even
though we just roll
so afterwards you need to write type
equal to quotation marks they need to
write video backslash mp4 so after we
make this we can actually essentially
see the video so if I go ahead and go
into my browser and refresh the browser
you'll notice that now a video player
changed its not YouTube anymore now a
couple of downsides to this is that some
functions like clicking on the video
it's not gonna play it you do actually
need to go down and hit the play button
down here it's episode 1 to play it you
do still have this one like this is the
control thing we included inside the
code so we do actually have it if you
were to leave out the control we
wouldn't actually be able to play the
video so we do need to have it in here
you can adjust the volume it can make it
into a big screen or just minimize it
again so now that we included the player
will need to talk about the different
formats of video you can use inside the
html5 player so like I said the mp4 is
going to be relevant because not all
browsers support all kinds of video
formats now I do actually have a link
here which goes in and explains what
kind of formats you can use inside the
browser and if you go down at the very
bottom here by the way this is a website
called w3schools comm which is excellent
for looking up this kind of stuff but
you can actually see here what kind of
browser that supports mp4 WebM and
OGT which is two kinds of formats you
might not have heard about before but
you can actually see what kind of
support they have right now mp4 is
supported by all browsers according to
this thing but just for safety you might
want to include the one called OGG as
well inside your website so you might be
talking you know asking me okay so we
need to include a before WebM and OGG
but how do I actually create these
formats because not all video editing
software can actually export into OGG or
WebM so how do we do that well I have a
free video converter here for you guys
which is the best video converter I've
ever
Mette and what kind of go ahead and
download it together and install it so
make sure you guys install it correctly
and then we can take a look at the
different formats you can export with
this video converter so I'm gonna go
ahead and download this one I'm gonna
click the link at least install a
installation link we can choose English
and we're gonna go ahead and uncheck
this one to help them you know improve
the software because I don't see a
reason to next one and then it's gonna
ask you it's your PC running at full
speed and it's very important you don't
just keep clicking next because every
single free software you find on the
Internet is gonna try to trick you in to
clicking except to stuff you don't need
so we don't need this install tune-up
utilities software I wants to install
with it
so we're just gonna say I do not accept
next then it's gonna ask you if you want
to express or custom installation we're
gonna say custom because now we can also
check off that we don't want to install
safer paths again it's trying to trick
you in the next one we're gonna do a
full installation or custom installation
and it's always better to choose custom
and then we're going to go ahead and say
well we we could include a desktop icon
so we'll just say Next then you're gonna
go ahead and include the path you're
going to install it on I'm just gonna
install into my D Drive so I'm going to
change a little bit and then we can say
next and then I will actually install so
after this one is installed we can
actually open it up it's actually
opening up for me here I'm just gonna go
ahead and close some of this stuff down
okay so now it's done installing and I
can actually launch my freemake Video
Converter so if I launch it you'll
notice that we do actually get some
different well we do get this pop-up
this says thank you for installing so
I'm just gonna close that down but in
here you can actually see that we can
convert to video audio DVD photo and
something called paste URL so down here
at the bottom you can say okay so we
want to create a html5 video which is
the one we want to click so if I click
this one it says we need to include some
file so if I want to include the video
that we just included inside our root
folder in here it will actually convert
to all these three formats that just
talked about inside the website we just
I just show
you guys so doing it this way you will
then have all three formats after you
have them you need to include all of
them inside your root folder inside the
video folder and inside the code we need
to include some extra tags inside our
video tags inside our index.html so
we're gonna go down to the next line I'm
just gonna copy pasted here and then
we're going to change the what do you
call it the extension - Oh G G and the
same thing over here by the type we're
gonna say OTT and save it so now you
would actually be able to if this top
video for some reason doesn't play
inside one browser it will say okay
we're gonna go we're going to continue
to the next one which is the OGG one now
if that one doesn't work either what we
can do down here at the bottom is we can
leave a little message saying your
browser does not support html5 videos
exclamation mark and then if they can't
actually play any of these videos then
it's going to tell you that well there's
no support here so this is essentially
how we create a html5 video and I hope
this was useful for you guys now of
course there's pros and cons to using
both ways the YouTube for example
there's gonna be a lot of functionality
on the video where you can click the
video and it'll actually start and
there's a lot of good stuff about it you
can change the quality settings if you
do plan on changing the look of the
video player control down here inside
the html5 video you do need to know
JavaScript and it's not it's not
difficult but it's just not something
we're gonna include inside this video
series because this is a html5 and CSS
video series so not gonna include
JavaScript so you guys enjoyed and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
