about how to create a footer and I do
realize we don't have as much stuff
inside this section yet as you might
want to have but I think it's a good
idea we get started on the footer and
just kind of finish it off in this
episode so we have our footer down here
at the bottom of our index.html and we
did actually already create the tags for
it in one of the first episodes I
believe so what we're going to do now so
I'm going to go into the stylesheet and
then we're going to go ahead and style
the footer tags so at the very bottom
we're going to go ahead and say exit
let's go ahead and make a comment really
quick because I would like for us to
actually see where the foot of start so
I'm just going to go ahead and make a
bit of text here then I'm going to write
footer in here so now we know that
everything related to the footer stop
starts below here so down here we can
actually start creating the tag for the
footer we're going to open up the code
and then we can give it a width so let's
go ahead and give it a width as a
hundred percent because we want it to be
responsive then we're going to go ahead
and give it a background color as has
tag two to two which is a dark gray
color and we're not going to give it a
height but we'll get we're going to give
it something else instead which is a
padding so we're going to go ahead and
say padding and then we're going to say
60 pixels from the top and bottom and
we're going to say zero pixels from left
and right so now if I were to go and
refresh my browser what you'll notice is
that we do actually get some footer down
here now the cool thing about using a
padding is that it actually takes it
from where the content starts and
finishes and then it builds the padding
around that meaning that right now if we
were to put content inside my website
right now it doesn't have a height yet
even though we do see some background
here the the footer does not have a
height but because of the padding it
adds an additional 60 pixels on each
side to the height so right now it's
zero pixels height plus 60 plus 60 which
means that we have this much that also
means that if we start putting content
inside the footer it'll actually gonna
it's actually going to start from the
middle and not from the top of it which
is kind of nice so what we're going to
do in
here is we're going to go inside our
index.html we're going to going to go
inside the footer and then we're going
to put in a wrapper because I do
actually need a wrapper I do think is
important I'm going to actually need to
write class wrapper if I can spell it
correctly like so and inside this
wrapper we're going to go ahead and put
another menu so we're going to go up to
our menu we're just going to kind of
copy it so I'm just going to copy my
let's just go ahead and copy the UL tags
and put it in here like so just go ahead
move everything down now the cool thing
about this software is that you can
actually hold down the control button
and keep clicking then it's going to put
up a typing symbol all the different
places just clicked and then you can
just kind of type everything at once
just just a just a really nice thing for
you guys if you're using this program so
now that we have this menu in here we
can actually go and save it and refresh
the browser and what you'll notice is
that we get a menu down here now you
might be asking why isn't it style again
that's because you don't have the nab
tags inside of here so maybe we should
have included the nav tag so let's just
go ahead and do that really quick like
so make sure you close it around the UL
like so and just go ahead and move it a
little bit so now that I saved it you'll
actually notice that we get some styling
going down here now what we need to do
is first of all as you can see our
navigation actually goes below our
footer which is because we already do
have a styling for this specific code
because we just simply copied the whole
navigation up here and right now the
navigation has a margin from the top
meaning that it will push down below the
footer so we need to add a specific
styling to this nav which is similar to
this styling up here but not the same so
going into our style sheet what we can
do is we can go up to our navigation we
have up at the very top and then we can
say okay well we do have a nav tag but
we want it to be the nav tag inside the
header
so I'm just going to go ahead and write
header behind the NEB tags so we have
okay so we have a navigation inside the
header which should do this so I'm just
going to go ahead and do that the same
place here I'm just going to go ahead
and copy you guys do the same thing and
now that our entire navigation at the
very top has the header in front of it
you guys will notice that the bottom
styling has disappeared so you might be
asking well why should we then put the
net tags around it well if you just go
ahead and copy the entire navigation
from the top go down to the footer like
so paste it in here and then replace
header with footer we didn't get this
specific styling for the footer only
like so now we do actually have two
styling for the footer now if I actually
go refresh I can show you guys the right
now we do have it styled again but now
we can change the specific styling for
the footer meaning that now I can
actually go ahead and remove my margin
so now the text is going to be up here
now I would also like for the text color
to change into white so down where we
have our color which should be right oh
we do we don't actually have a color
anywhere so we should actually go down
to our a tag go in and say color Col one
and set it to hashtag FFF which is the
color code for white if i refresh we get
a white navigation now typically when I
see a navigation at the bottom its most
the time a little bit smaller than the
top navigation so we're going to go
ahead and give this one a font size as
maybe 10 and then we're going to go
ahead and give it a floating to the left
side instead of the right side so where
we have the footer nav I'm going to say
left I'm going to refresh the browser
and you guys will notice that it moves
over here so when it comes to creating
this navigation we could essentially
also just put them underneath each other
we don't have to put them next to each
other but since we don't have as much
content on our website so far
I don't see a lot of stuff we can put
inside the photo so let's just go and
keep this for now now we do actually
have a footer and we might be including
some other stuff in the fourth at some
later point maybe the name of the person
who made the website or maybe some
contact info which could be in there
what do you call it in a list over here
the right side but for now I think this
is good okay so now we finished the
footer and what I would like to do in
the next episode is talk about creating
a new section inside our section of the
website which means that it's going to
go in between the footer and this piece
of text we have up here at least this
whole box that's here so we're going to
have another section underneath it which
is going to be the new section so guys
enjoy it and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
