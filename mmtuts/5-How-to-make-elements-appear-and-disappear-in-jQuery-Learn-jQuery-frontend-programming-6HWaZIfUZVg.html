stuff appear and disappear inside our
website using jQuery and as you guys can
see in front of me here a very basic
website with a navigation and what we
want to do this episode is make this
navigation appear and disappear when we
click this navigation button on the top
left corner now of course in my example
here I want to make a navigation appear
and disappear but it's important that
you guys know that we can make anything
inside our website appear and disappear
using the jQuery code from this lesson
here if you guys want to have a
navigation you guys can do this together
with me you can go ahead and download
the lesson files in the description of
this video so in order to make this
medication appear and disappear we're
going to use two different methods we're
going to use something called height and
sew and we're going to use something
called fade so the first one is simply
where we make this appear and disappear
in some kind of speed if you want to
what we can just make it instant and the
second ways we can make this fade out by
changing the opacity or fade in again so
as you guys can see inside my document
here the only code we have in here that
is not bakery right now is a link to a
style sheet and then at the bottom here
we have a header that has an image
inside of it which is the one at the top
here with the logo of the menu button
and the second thing we have in here is
the navigation so inside the navigation
tags we have two unordered lists with
two different menus inside of it and
what we're going to do today is when we
click this image up here then we want to
do something with jQuery which in this
case is going to make the navigation
tags appear and disappear so if we were
to go down to the script tags have at
the very bottom of my document here you
guys can see I have no jQuery code
inside the script tags now the first
thing we're going to do is make sure
that the Cakery code does not load as
the first thing inside the website now
right now since we have the script tags
at the bottom this is not going to be an
issue because the document is loaded
from top to bottom but if you were to
put this at the top of the document you
would have to write something called
dollar sign parentheses and then say we
have a document dot ready parentheses
semi-colon because we always need to end
off a line of jQuery code with a
semicolon and inside the parentheses you
want to write function parentheses curly
brackets and
then whatever code goes inside the curly
brackets is going to be loaded last
inside the document so if I were to have
the script tags here were to just copy
them and put them up here in the head
tag instead now this code will actually
not be loaded first because we inserted
a function inside the occurred that says
you need to load this after loading the
rest of the page so even though this is
that the first of the documents is not
going to get loaded first now just
because it's a habit that I have I'm
going to go and put the script tags at
the bottom of the document just like
we're doing Java scripts so down here
I'm just going to go and keep this for
now because it doesn't hurt to have it
to make sure that the code actually gets
loaded last so inside the TA curry code
which get loaded after everything else
inside the website I'm going to go to
include a selector now remember the
selector is the thing that determines
what needs to happen something to in
order for something else to happen
inside the website so in this case I
want to do something when I click the
button up here order image which right
now is the button so we need to select
the image in here using jQuery so
forward to go down inside my code I'm
going to go ahead and open up a selector
by writing dollar sign parentheses
double quotes and inside the double
quotes I want to select the image now
right now because we have no other
images inside the website I could simply
say we have a image but because I want
to make sure we don't accidentally
choose another type of image at some
point later on this website I'm going to
go and give this image a ID so we're
going to say we have an ID equal to
double quotes and then we're going to
say menu - toggle just so it has some
kind of name I'm going to go ahead and
copy this name go down to my Tia Carrere
code and then I'm going to say we have a
ID called menu - taco so now I selected
the image up here and we can go ahead
and tell it what needs to happen to it
before we run some kind of code so in
this case the event is going to be a
click event so when we click on the
image something needs to happen so we're
going to say parenthesis semicolon
because we're ending off this line of
code and inside the parentheses I'm
going to go and write a function
because I want to run this function as
soon as I click the button now inside
the function we're going to add a second
selector so we're going to say we have a
dollar sign parenthesis and then I want
to select the navigation because it's
the navigation something needs to happen
too when we click this button up here so
I'm going to go and go to my navigation
and see well right now we have a
navigation called nav but just to make
sure we don't close every single
navigation inside my website I'm going
to go and get this navigation and ID so
we're going to say ID equal to double
quotes I'm going to go ahead and call
this one side - nav then I'm going to
copy it ID name and paste it inside a
jQuery code of course we need to
remember to add the ID tag in front of
it afterwards we need to add a effect
which is what we call it when we want to
do something to the element we chose and
in this case we're going to use an
effect called hide so I'm going to say
hi parenthesis and semicolon so right
now we're using the default hide
function or the default add effect
inside jQuery so if we were to go inside
my website refresh then click the button
up here you guys can see the navigation
disappears so it's very similar to the
feature we have inside YouTube what we
can actually close the navigation and
then we click it it should actually open
up again right now it doesn't do it so
if I were to go back inside my code I
can go and use another effect called
show like so and if I were to go inside
my Styles you can say that the
navigation needs to be hidden all the
time I'm do actually refresh the browser
by going down inside my nav styling and
then say display:none
so right now forward to refresh the
browser you guys can see that no
navigation inside my website now if I
click the button you guys can see it
appears now of course we don't want to
be able to just make it disappear or
appear so we have another feature called
taco inside da Curry so I'm going to go
ahead and say instead of so I'm going to
say Tahoe which right now switches in
between show and hide when I click the
button so we were to go back inside the
website refresh you guys can see it's
hidden right now for were to click the
navigation button it appears if I were
to click it again it is
Pearse so this is a really nice effect
to have inside te curry now when it
comes to these effects inside the
parentheses we can go to insert some
parameters now when it comes to hide
show and tackle we have two different
parameters the first parameter is going
to be the speed or which the effect is
going to happen and the second one is
going to be something we call a callback
so the first one we can go and say we
want this to happen over a period of one
second which is a thousand milliseconds
if it were to then refresh the browser
you guys can see the navigation appears
from the side of the screen if we were
to click it again it disappears slowly
during a period of one second now if
we're to go back and stop my code and
say well we also want to add a callback
Const a comma space and then I'm going
to go and include another function
parentheses curly brackets and tell it
that it should also alert a message
inside the browser so I'm going to go
and say alert double quotes hi there so
right now basically what we're telling
it is that we're going to go ahead and
run this toggle feature after one second
it needs to be done and then afterwards
after the effect is actually done then
we want to call back which means that we
can do something once the effect is done
loading which right now alerts a message
called hi there so we're to save this go
and set my browser refresh now you guys
will notice that when the navigation
appears or disappears we're going to go
ahead and get a message called hi there
so I click it and then we get the
message if I were to do it again it's
done loading and then we get the message
so a callback is basically when it does
something after it's done loading the
effect again right now just used a alert
message in order to write something to
me but could actually do much more stuff
than just an alert message you know we
can actually run other types of effects
after this one is done so can actually
chain events inside the callback so this
is how you can use toggle show and hide
but what if you want something to fade
in and fade out so we actually get a
opacity change inside the browser now
let's actually going to meet some of the
stuff that we have here for were to
delete everything back to right after
the punctuation mark so we need to add
the effects I'm going to go and use an
effect called fade
n and do pay attention to the
capitalized I here because we need to
make sure when we have two words inside
the effect name the first letter is
going to be not capitalized and then the
second word is going to be capitalized
it's a typical habit to do that inside
ta curry or JavaScript or PHP just
because it makes it easier to see the
different words inside the name of the
effect or the functions so we're going
to go make sure we don't forget to
include the capitalized letters then
we're going to say parentheses now
inside these effects here we can also
add a speed and a callback feature
inside the parameters for now just not
going to do it so I'm just going to go
to save it go inside my browser refresh
and now you guys will notice that when I
click it fades in so we have an opacity
change from zero to one after a certain
time if I were to go back inside the
code we can also go and say fade out
like so I'm going to go ahead and go
back inside my styling and remove the
styling coat display:none because new
tax is c2 navigation when we refresh the
browser like so if I were to click the
button you guys can see it fades out now
we also have something called fade taco
inside ta Kareem so we want to say fade
taco just like the four it's going to go
and switch between fade out and fade in
when we click the button so I'm going to
go and go into my website refresh and
you guys can see when I click the button
it fits down when I click it again it
fades in
now of course we can also add the
parameters inside the effect in years
that we connect to say a thousand
milliseconds just going to save it
refers to browser and as you guys can
see now it rates out much slower than
before now when it comes to the fade
effects inside key acres we have one
more fade effect we can use which is
something that allow for us to decide
window pattern needs to stop so right
now we have to fade chuckle if I were to
say fade too we can actually decide
inside the parameters whether opacity
needs to stop changing too so forward to
say right now we want to say to some
kind opacity after certain time I can
say a thousand which is one second
comment I'm going to add the second
parameter which is going to be some kind
of passage like the one we haven't
ESS so I'm just going to say 0.5 just
have something save it if I go inside my
browser refresh you guys can see when I
click it it's going to fade out halfway
so now we can actually still see the
navigation but it's half way transparent
just like we decided to in Santa Cakery
now for what to go back inside the code
I want to let you guys know that we
still have the callback parameter in
here so we don't have two parameters in
this case we have three different
parameters so we could still say we want
to add a function parentheses curly
brackets for the third parameter and do
a callback called alerts because why not
and in fact the alert we can also say hi
there so now if I go back inside the
browser refresh it's going to take one
second to fade out halfway and then
afterwards it's going to alert the
message called hi there I'm going to
click it one second and we get the
message so these are some different
effects you can use in order to make
stuff appear and disappear inside jQuery
and like I said it's actually very
simple to do we just need to add a
selector that selects something inside
the website they want to interact with
with a events and then afterwards we
need to tell it with a selector what we
want to change and then what needs to
happen to reducing an effect so if you
guys enjoyed I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
