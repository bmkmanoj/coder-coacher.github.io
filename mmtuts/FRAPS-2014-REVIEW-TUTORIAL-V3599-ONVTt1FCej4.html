review and this one we're gonna take a
look at a screen recorder called fraps
now if you do know what fraps is it's
probably because you went to Google and
said what is the best screen recorder
out there what is the most famous screen
recorder out there fraps is one of the
better screen recorders and I'm not
gonna lie it is one of the most used
screen recorders a lot of people really
complement this one and I'm gonna do my
best to review this as good as possible
as neutrally as possible now I did
actually do a review before of fraps and
because I'm doing another one is that it
is a newer version it is three point
five point nine nine and they did fix a
couple of the hiccups that they used to
have so I figured today would be a good
day to do another review of this screen
recorder so what we're going to talk
about here is how the dashboard looks
like how to use the dashboard what are
the settings in here and then I'm gonna
do a little test if you could call it
that I did do some footage beforehand
some raw footage and I'm gonna show you
guys a little thing that some people
might find a little annoying and how you
can fix it so let's go ahead and start
off with the actual dashboard here as
you can see it looks very simple it has
four buttons up here four different
menus if you do not count to help menu
up here of course and if you take a look
at the one called general you can see
there has five different buttons down
here you can check off and if we take a
look at the first one you can see it
says start fraps minimized now that
basically means that when you start
fraps up it starts to minimize down here
in just you know the system tray down
here whatever it's called down here with
all other symbols or softwares you might
have put down there you can also choose
to say that fraps window is always on
top which means that if I'm opening our
program such as premiere and I check it
off you can actually see the knife of my
premiere it's actually on top of it it's
always gonna stay on top I can't see a
reason for doing this so I'm just gonna
go and check that off you can also
choose to run fraps and windows starts
now if you wanted those people who use
this perhaps more than just recording
screens and I'm talking about checking
your frame rates at all times
some people do do this and even if
they're not recording a game they do
like to have fraps open just so they can
see how much of a frame rate they do
have
they're playing I do that from time to
time this one is very neat to check off
I do not do this because I don't record
my screen every time over maps I'm just
gonna leave this checked off now down
here you can actually choose to record
something called monitor arrow desktop
which means that you're basically saying
that it should record your desktop if
you do not check this off it will not
record the desktop it can only record
applications and I must mention that
this feature down here only works with
Windows 7 so far
or like Windows Vista or whatever you
have that's lower than that if you're
trying to do Windows 8 it does not work
yet okay in the future they might fix it
well I'm pretty sure they'll fix it
because otherwise they're gonna run out
of business but they will probably fix
this little feature in the future
because right now you cannot record your
monitor or like a desktop with fraps so
that's one thing to be very aware of
before buying this product down here it
says minimize the system tray only that
basically means that down here in the
corner you have like some small symbols
like your volume stuff like that fraps
will be minimized down there if you do
check this off I don't think that's a
nice feature well it is a nice feature
but I don't use it and especially not
now that I'm doing a review I don't
think I should check that one off but
you can do it if you feel like it if you
go to the next one called FPS which
means frames per second you do have
benchmark settings and you have overlay
hotkey settings now the pinch mark
settings if you don't know what
benchmarking is it's basically if you're
recording a game and let's say you don't
want to record the entire period of time
that you're recording it if you only
want to record some of the highlights
you can actually pre pre the pre program
the software to record the last X amount
of seconds of your gameplay so right
down here I actually checked it off at
60 seconds so if I click f11 it says
here you'll actually record the last 60
seconds of my gameplay so instead I'm
recording the entire gameplay and having
to edit and find all the places where I
found highlights and stuff like that I
can just do this every time I find
something interesting in a game that I
want to record which is kind of neat
down here do you have some benchmark
settings like FPS frame times
minimax AVG I'm not quite sure what
these do I have not played with them a
lot I should probably have investigated
that before I got started here but I
figured why not have something that you
guys can go and explore for yourself
so dad you're gonna have to Google over
here we do have only hotkey settings we
have a button here that we need to click
in order to change the overlay now right
now I've set it to hide overlay if I do
decide to you know check off the corners
when you've record and when you have
fraps open you will have a little frames
per second counter up in the corner and
you can actually decide where you want
that one placed or if you do want it
hidden and don't want to see it the
frames for the second counter I do
personally think you should have on
there because it really helps so you can
see if suddenly your game gets very
laggy is it because of the frame so is
it because of the game so I think it's a
nice feature to have on you can also say
that you only wanted to update the
overlay once a second by that it means
that when you do have the frames per
second counting up in the corner it
constantly that's where it looks like
every millisecond it's updating how many
frames per second it's counting out so
it go up and down up and down from time
to time if you check this one off it
will only update the overlay up here
every second which means that you don't
get all those you know numbers going up
and down up and down you get all this
factors and stuff when you're playing so
that's a nice feature too I'm actually
gonna check that one off because I think
that's pretty nice to have on if you go
to movie settings this is actually where
you will be spending the most time
this one says where do you want to
record your footage and you should
probably change this one as soon as you
get your hands on fraps because if you
don't do this the preset is usually your
main Drive which means that it's going
to start filling up your main drive and
trust me when you record with fraps it
takes up a lot of space compared to some
other screen recorders it takes up a
crapload of space if I have to say it
nicely and I mean if you edit this in
post production and export it it will
take up a lot less frame a lot less
space but the raw footage itself takes
up a humongous amount of space so don't
use your main drive do use a external
hard disk or something like that it
makes it a lot easier down here we have
the hotkey for the recording as you can
see right now I have mine set to the
number key if I start clicking the
number key right now we will in fact
start recording with fraps I should
probably not do that because right now
I'm actually not recording this whole
review here with fraps I'm actually
using another program so I'll just not
click that button down here you can
actually choose to video capture
settings there's two frames per second
you can choose 60 50 30 or you can
customize it down here now one thing I
do want to mention here is that I'm some
of the older versions or at least I
think it's still going on is that some
people on the internet says if your game
drops in frames per second when you
start recording with fraps which by the
way it does this program will drop the
framerate of your game and you start
recording it is very bad at doing that
that's one of the major errors of this
screen recorder it's very reliable but
if you do not have a supercomputer on
you you cannot play a game under highest
settings and use fraps in the same time
I can barely do it I mean I can do it
easily but you know what I'm talking
about if you want to record a really
really high demanding game I would
probably need to turn down my settings
in order to do you know have the footage
look at least a bit nice cuz I don't
want to have a little bit of drop in
frame rates I want it to be maximum
frame rate all the time so do not do the
fix I'm about to tell you which some
people do say you need to do in order to
fix this if you go down here and click
this customized frames per second off
and you do this nine nine nine nine nine
nine and then oh my god or like but some
people actually tell you type hundred
and twenty and that'll fix it if you do
this your CPU with focus the higher
frame should record that the more CPU
power fraps takes up if you do this I
promise you your frames per second will
probably drop a lot more than if you
choose a low frames per second okay now
a lower frames per second like thirty I
find to be plenty when I record a game I
don't need 60 frames per second because
when it goes up in YouTube YouTube can
only show you the videos at 30 frames
per second anyways if I have a 60 frames
per second footage and I upload to
YouTube it makes it 30 frames per second
anyways so there's no reason to use
more than 30 frames per second okay at
least if you're using YouTube for this
sort of thing down here has something
called loop buffer length I'm not sure
what that is down up here actually I
forgot something here this says if you
want to change the video setting video
settings to be full size a half size now
full size I always use it's kind of nice
it has half size because then it won't
take up it won't fill as much when you
record it it won't be as many gigabytes
when you have the raw footage on you but
choosing half size makes the footage
half the quality of if you chose full
size it makes it so crappy to look at
that you would be embarrassed to show it
on YouTube do not use half size for
God's sake do not use half size because
it does screw up your footage a lot down
here we have something called split
movie every four gigabytes this feature
is so annoying they included I don't I
do not see why they have to include this
inside fraps if you do check this off
every time your footage fills 4
gigabytes it will split the footage up
now I'm I was mentioning that traps does
take up a lot of gigabytes for me wrong
footage right when you do this if you
record for let's say an hour you're
gonna have so many video clips that you
need to put together in editing and then
upload it is so annoying especially if
if people like me who likes to maybe
brighten up to footage a little bit so
you guys can better see what's going on
if I have to put the same brightening
brightening effect on every single clip
in post editing it gets so annoying
rather have one full clip you can just
do to once so for God's sake do not
check this one off either I just did
accidentally so just ignore that but do
not take that one off
do keep in mind sometimes when you open
up fraps just by opening it up it does
check it off by itself which is super
annoying but it does do it so you need
to make sure you check every single time
with my fraps it does not is not ticked
off okay over here we can have some
sound capture settings we can choose to
record the system sound which is
basically if you're playing a game do
you want the game sound to be in there
too of course that should be checked off
because they do you do need it if you
want people to hear what's going on you
can use stereo or multi-channel right
now I have just stereo chosen down here
if you do have a microphone like the one
I'm using right now and you want to
record your voice inside the game you
can actually check this one off and then
tell it which microphone you want to use
now one little thing I want to mention
here is that if you do choose this one I
am not sure how you can adjust the
microphone level compared to the game
leveling like the game volume so I do
not use this one I actually prefer
recording in an external program such as
audacity here because it makes a lot
easier in post-production and after
editing down here we have the hot hype
mouse cursor in video which makes sure
that your cursor is not visible when you
play a game or if you are doing
something in the desktop your recording
down here you can actually lock the
frame rate while recording this one I do
have checked off because I wanted to
walk at 30 frames per second if it can
so I think that's kind of a neat feature
to have on there I do not want it to
drop up and down and frame for a second
because it makes the video look a little
funky if it does it too much you can
also force loose less of red green and
blue capture now I think this might have
something to do with one of the issues
I'm about to show you when I'm done
showing you guys the dashboard which
I'll get into a little bit later over
here we have the screenshots you can
decide where you want two screenshots to
be saved you can choose the hot key for
recording the screenshot you can choose
the format for your images when you do
make a screenshot of course I have it at
a peg right now over here you have the
screen capture settings you can choose
if you want to include the frame rate
the overlay does up in the corner onto
the screenshot or if you do not want it
there down here you have if you want to
repeat the screen capture every 10
seconds after you click the button and
in order to turn it off you're gonna
have to press it again so that's pretty
much the dashboard now I would like to
show you guys some footage some raw
footage just to show you guys what I
meant about what he called the red green
blue color thing if you look at the raw
footage here when I play it I did
actually get a lot of comments saying my
footage looks so dark when I'm done
recording how can I fix this if you see
my footage here you can see it is very
actually able to go ahead
do this one if you look at my footage
here you can see it is very dark to look
at this is raw footage and it is well I
wouldn't call it dark but it is super it
has a really high contrast which makes
it look dark and this is not nice to
look at so the way to fix des is
actually when you import it inside your
editing program I'm using Premiere right
now it does actually fix this right away
now it does not look dark anymore
it does not look saturated as you guys
can see okay it actually looks pretty
normal now some people when they upload
stuff to YouTube when you upload to
YouTube it does make your video clips a
bit darker for some reason like slightly
bit which means if you're playing a
horror game and you want to record the
footage if you upload into YouTube you
do need to lighten or brighten the
footage in post production before you
export the videos you can upload it that
is kind of a necessary feature for not
because YouTube does make it darker
which is for some reason I don't I don't
know why to do it it's so annoying but
you're gonna have to do that so I think
that's pretty much it for the screen
recorder I do have a lot of other screen
recorders that I paid for
so if you do have screen recorders this
one I'm actually not using this one too
much at the moment I'm using one called
mirillis action screen recorder which I
found to be a bit nicer to use it runs
very smooth and it does for a fact we
quote the desktop in Windows 8 and the
font sizes are not as big as fraps is I
mean it's not too much of a difference
but I found it to be more custom aside a
cut how does it customisable in that
matter and it does have a lot less
errors than fraps sometimes have the
errors I'm talking about is that for
example on my old computer when I
recorded something certain games would
drop so much in framerate that I could
not stand playing the game anymore I'm
not talking about the video dropping
frames the actual game dropped to like
912 frames per second on my old computer
of course but the latest update here did
actually fix it so even though they
fixed a lot of features on under under
new fraps here there's still a couple
out there there's some games like
some very rare games in between that for
some reason crashes if you try to open
it up it is different depending on a
computer for some reason because my
laptop does it perfectly fine on those
games but this one doesn't on the other
hand my laptop does screw up the screen
recording on other games that this
computer for some reason doesn't do it
on so it's a little flexible layer I'm
not quite sure how to tell you guys
which games have worked one does not
work for but I hope you guys enjoyed
this review I hope you guys don't think
I talk too much
because I really want to share my
personal opinion with you guys while
still remaining neutral of course so
have you guys enjoyed this don't forget
to click that subscribe button it helps
a lot and I'll just see you guys later
