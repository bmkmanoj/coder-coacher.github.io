one we're going to talk about an issue
that you guys may have a lot of indie
games out there and it doesn't matter if
you got the game on Steam or if you got
it online somewhere if it's a free in
the game you got it's still going to be
the same issue so the issue I'm talking
about is that when you have an indie
game and you want to play it online with
people either it's you know random
people you want to play with or you want
friends to play with you or you want to
join friends it's going to give you the
same error message which is going to be
could not connect to hosts or something
like that and this error message is
super annoying because actually let me
give you guys an example I was playing
online with my friend actually I was
going to play online with my friend last
night and we sat from 10 o'clock to 4
o'clock in the morning trying to get a
game called white noise online to work
this is a steam game and even though you
have an inside steam and when you open
the game up steam says you know it has a
little button down the corner that says
join friends or invite friends or
something like that it will not let you
do it is still going to give you the
same error message even though it's a
steam game now the solution to actually
playing with each other in indie games
like this is that you need to do
something called port forwarding and
don't start panicking don't click away
from this video I know you've heard this
before and know people on Google and
YouTube tells you all you need to put
forward well port forwarding I have yet
not found a single step-by-step for
idiots tutorial on how to do this and
trust me I needed a idiot step-by-step
tutorial how to put forward because it
seems like people on the internet
expects you to know how to port forward
as a default I did not know how to do
this so I did actually get a solution to
it and I did have well my friend had a
friend help her out fixing this issue
and now we can actually play with each
other and she showed me how to do this
so I'm going to show you guys now
step-by-step how to fix this issue so
without any more stalling let's go ahead
and get started here first thing you're
going to have to do is actually go down
to your control panel
now again if you're on a Mac I'm not
quite sure how you're going to fix this
but I know for PC users this is the way
to do it so inside the control panel
you're going to go to your network and
Internet settings you're going to go to
network and sharing center and inside
here you should have
all your basic network information and
setup connections and underneath here
you should have your active networks now
in my case I have to because I have
hamachi installed my computer you guys
will probably just have one which is you
know either a wireless network or a
Ethernet cable network now on the right
side of your network you're going to get
access type homegroup and connections
now again because I have an Ethernet
cable mine is going to say local area
connection next to my connections you
know description here you guys may have
something else but if you have wireless
but you're going to go ahead and click
on this link that is next to it now
you're going to get this little window
here and actually before we get started
here the reason we're doing this just
you guys know is because we need some
information from our router which we're
accessing right now in order to actually
post forward we need to get to the place
what we need to post forward and we need
to information from in here to do that
ok so inside here we're going to click
on details and inside here I'm actually
going to black some of this out for you
guys because I do not want you guys to
know my my personal information but
inside here you're going to get a long
list of stuff right and one of them is
going to be called ipv4 address and just
going to give you guys this long number
with dots between them or like you know
punctuation between them you're going to
need this number so either you copy down
somewhere or you just leave this window
open and do this the next one you're
going to need is the one called ipv4
default gateway which also has probably
the same number as two ipv4 address but
without some of them not you know with
some of the numbers missing it and so
you're going to need these two numbers
here now that we have Dee's we're going
to go ahead and open up our internet
browser and we actually need to go to
this website first which is a website
steam made or like a thing steam made
where you can actually go in and see
what the required ports are for steam
and don't start panicking I know this
may look confusing to you guys because
it sure as hell does to me okay you're
going to need these numbers and I'm
going to tell you guys specifically
which numbers we need in here and how
we're going to put them in okay so we
need this window here this this internet
page and I will actually leave the link
in the description if
did not mention that yet so go and check
the description of this video and get
this link up in our browser we're going
to open up a new window and what you're
going to do is you're going to type in
the IP address not the IP address that
you got called ipv4 address but the one
called ipv4 default gateway so you're
going to type in the the gateway numbers
that you got with the punctuation marks
between them okay so I'm going to go
ahead and say room and move this out of
the way so you guys can see it and I'm
going to go ahead and type in my default
gateway and of course I'm going to block
this out for you guys because I don't
want you guys to see this hmm
whoops I'm a very slow typist you guys
can see and there we go now when you
type enter and access this place what's
going to happen is that you guys
probably going to be asked to do yet
like to type in a password and a
username now I already typed in my
password and username so do not need to
do this again but you guys are going to
be probably going to get asked for a
username and a password and after you're
done typing that in you're going to get
to this place now to username and
password the way you're going to get
that is well if you know it already it's
great you know the password for your
router now if you do not know the
password for your router you're going to
have to call your internet provider and
ask them well go to that website and
somehow go to your settings and find out
what these are now if you call them just
tell them you need the password username
to go into this dashboard we can forward
a port forward your router and they will
give it to you okay so that is one
really annoying thing you need to do a
non support forward that is actually
calling them and asking for this
information when you do that and you get
access in here you are going to get a
dashboard that is probably very
different from the one that I have here
because you probably have a different
instead of Ida than I do
okay but know this you need to go to
advanced settings or to port forward
settings so whatever you have inside the
dashboard because you will be able to
pull it forward from this dashboard so
you just need to find it okay
in my case it's inside advanced settings
and then I have a little submenu over
here in the left side called forwarding
that is actually what need to go now in
here we need to type in the information
we found from Steam and of course you
know if you guys have done this before
you might not know how to do this just
like I did not know how to do this I'm
going to show you guys what you need to
put in first of all down here in my case
which there's no rule adder you guys
might have a different but you should
have a place we can type in the local IP
address and stuff like that with the
local IP address this can be two of them
there's gonna be one up here there's
going to be one down here in my case at
least you're going to type in the IP
address you got from when we once went
into the control panel and you need to
go to the one not called the default
gateway but the one called ipv4 address
and the number that is typically the
same as the one you typed it up here but
just a little bit longer okay you're
going to type that in in your local IP
address and also down here the bottom
where you have another local IP address
I'm not going to type it in for you guys
because I do not want to black out more
than I need to after you've done this
the next one is called external IP
address now you can choose to just leave
this as 0.0.0.0 or if you only want one
specific friend or one specific computer
to be able to join you in your game you
need to type in their IP address now as
a default I'm just gonna leave this as
whatever it is right now because you
know why not just have anyone be able to
join you if you want to play with them
so I'm just gonna leave this like this
for now down word says service name as a
default I have something called a IM
talk and I'm just gonna go ahead and
leave it at this I want to note though
that if your port forwarding does not
work you can actually click in here and
go down where it says
Steam games and you're probably going to
want to choose the one called 27000 okay
and use that one but for default I was a
told not to change this one so I'm not
going to change this one down here what
says local IP address we typed in the IP
address the second time underneath here
it says local start port now this is why
we need to go into our Steam place here
because as you guys can see that
she says UDP 27,000 to 27,000 15
inclusive that's the game client traffic
okay that's the one we need so twenty
seven thousand and twenty seven thousand
fifteen so go in here and one says local
start port I'm going to say twenty seven
thousand where it says local end port
you're going to say twenty seven
thousand fifteen okay down here where it
says external IP you just going to leave
that one blank you're going to leave
that one at 0.0.0.0 okay down here which
says external start port you need to
type in the same numbers that we did
above so the excellent start port will
be twenty seven thousand external end
port will be twenty seven thousand
fifteen down here says protocol again if
you go look at the the you know required
Steam client port you can see there the
one we chose with the twenty seven
thousand and twenty seven thousand five
fifteen it says UDP not TCP it says UDP
so we go in here we change it from TCP
to UDP okay
underneath Erie I have a description you
guys are just going to say whatever you
feel like if you do have a description
option inside your dashboard you could
call it steam or something like that and
underneath here where it says enabled
needs to put it on on and now you click
apply and it should work when you done
this
it should port forward and you should
actually have it saved in here somewhere
I do actually nowhere have mine saved
have it in here somewhere where I can
port forward but you shouldn't have it
saved down if you actually start up a
game and try to join each other the port
forwarding sort of works okay so hope
you guys find is useful I hope this
worked for you guys if it did not work I
do not know what you need to do but this
is how I learned to put forward the old
fashioned way not using hamachi or
something like that which is another way
you can do it especially if you do
minecraft and you want to play Minecraft
together a lot of people use hamachi but
some games like white noise online does
not work with hamachi at least that's my
experience with it and we did actually
need to know how to do this so this is
how you port
or if you guys enjoyed this episode
please do leave a like and I hope to see
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
