episode just to kind of give you guys an
update on why I have not been uploading
any kind of content for many days now
now max is starting to finish up my
bachelor exam which is this Monday in
three days I think three days now
because of that I can't actually focus
on both my full-time job as a multimedia
designer and studying for the exam and
making tutorial videos so I have three
days from now to finish up my exam or
finish it up I need to finish the
presentation because I have an oral exam
Shh now because of my exam this Monday
won't actually have time to do any kind
of tutorials until I'm finished so for
the next three days or so I won't
actually upload anything to YouTube just
like I haven't done for the past many
days but after the exam is done I'll
have time to focus on my job and I can
cut out the exam part of my schedule and
replace it with trying to make tutorials
for YouTube so I'm hoping to get at
least two videos up a week on my channel
so it'll be some new content from time
to time so don't want you guys to think
there's not gonna be anything in the
channel anymore because there's been no
videos going on for the past long time
I'm just currently very busy with like I
said full-time job exams and it's just
leaves out time for tutorials so but
after I'm done there's gonna be stuff
uploaded so I just want to give you guys
this update too to let you guys know
where I'm at with my time and schedule
and yes this is actually my apartment I
think you guys have seen it before yeah
so that's pretty much all I have to say
for this episode I will leave it at this
and start working like Sam and then I'll
see you guys
sometimes next week with a new tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
