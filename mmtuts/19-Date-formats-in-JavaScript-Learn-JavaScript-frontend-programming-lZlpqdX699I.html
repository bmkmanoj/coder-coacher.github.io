different date formats we have inside
JavaScript so in this episode what we're
gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and
write out the date inside the browser
and then talk about how it contains the
dates you know to get a specific date
I'm also going to talk about how we can
change the format of the dates so as you
guys can see right here I have a very
basic index page with a P tag that has
an IDs test and inside the script tags
we have nothing so what we're gonna go
ahead and do here is I'm gonna go ahead
and insert the date inside the P tags so
if we go inside the script tags I can go
ahead and say documents dot get element
by ID parentheses of course we need to
get our ideas test which is up here and
then afterwards you want to say inner
HTML so we can insert something inside
our P tags now what we want to do here
is we want to go ahead and insert the
date meaning that we can actually use a
method inside JavaScript called date
like so which inserts a default date
format for the time right now so if we
were to go inside my browser you guys
can see that when i refresh the browser
we get a date format now the date format
is actually the current time meaning
that each time I refresh you guys can
see it does actually change now this
format here does not look very pretty
it's what we call a long format inside
inside JavaScript meaning that we might
want to change this up a little bit now
before we change the format let's
actually talk about writing out a
specific date inside you know this date
function here now the way we can write
out a specific date inside JavaScript is
by creating something called a
constructor and if you're familiar with
object-oriented programming you're gonna
know what a constructor is but basically
we're gonna create an object and based
on that object we can then manipulate
some of the information using this date
function down here so inside the scripts
X that's actually going to create one of
these constructors I'm gonna go ahead
and say we have a variable called X
because why not oh we could actually
write dates because that makes sense I'm
gonna set it equal to a new constructor
I'm gonna call it date for the Big D
parentheses like so
because this is the name of our
constructor and we want to create an
object based off this constructor here
so what we want to do here is we want to
set specific parameters inside the
parentheses which is going to change it
so that when we do actually spit it out
inside the browser we can actually
decide which state we want to spit out
inside the browser so what I can do now
is I can actually go ahead and to say
instead of spitting out the date
function let's spit out the date
variable which means to be get this data
up here now for what to refresh the
browser you guys can see we get the
exact same thing because this is the
default format and we didn't actually
change anything inside the parentheses
here so what we can do now is we can
actually go ahead and print out three
different types of formats inside at
least inside the parameter here that
will give us a specific date now when we
do this you guys need to know about the
starting time that we're gonna print out
the date from because back in the days
when they did actually create this date
function here they decided that well we
need to start somewhere and count the
time from that specific date in order to
get a new date now if that doesn't
really make sense let me actually go
ahead and demonstrate what I'm talking
about now back in the days when they
decided okay we need to start the date
from now was back in 1970 at the first
of January at zero zero zero zero time
meaning that right now for were to go
inside my date parentheses here and
right well let's say five which is five
milliseconds and then go ahead and
refresh the browser you guys can see
that we now get a new date right now set
to 1970 which was the data talked about
being the starting date and based off
this date here we can actually go ahead
and set a time format so let's say you
know of course right now we wrote five
inside the parentheses meaning that you
know it doesn't actually know how to
count five because that's not a lot
that's actually going to write a
thousand instead just to serve guys now
do you notice that the the back number
is going to change into a one because we
just changed to you know the what we put
inside the parentheses here for were to
write something about thicker you guys
can see it's gonna count forward that
I'm on a milliseconds that I just wrote
in which right now is January Oh for
this date here
this this year at this time so what we
can do is we can actually go ahead and
write a you know the date using
milliseconds has one of the default
methods you can write out a date now you
might be asking why do we need to learn
how to do it in milliseconds because it
doesn't really make sense to do it in
that way because we can't really predict
when it's gonna hit that specific date
or you know we don't know which day we
type inside the parentheses but in the
future when we do need to set stuff and
we need to be precise using time it's a
really good way to do it so in the
future we'll actually be using it for
some kind of exercise now the second
form you can write it in is using a
string which means that we can actually
go inside the parentheses and write out
a specific string of course using double
quotes we could for example say we have
a date we want to write inside the
browser which is for example 2016 - 12
which is the month right now - let's say
29 because that's the date today if I
were to refresh the browser now you guys
can see we get a nother format now as
you guys can see we get a new date
inside the browser and the date we're
getting is exactly what I typed in
inside the parentheses it's December
29th 2016 which is what we typed in but
we still get it in this weird long
format which I talked about which we're
going to learn how to change later on so
the third way we can write something
inside the date construct in here is by
writing out the time and separating it
by a comma so if we were to delete what
we have in here which is called a date
string and instead right let's say we
want to get 1999 I'm gonna go and say 99
comma oh six which is going to be the
month comment I'm gonna say 11 which is
going to be the day comma we can say
hours let's say we have 12 comma minutes
seconds and milliseconds so this is how
we can set a date using this format here
using commas you know by creating
different parameters if I were to
refresh the browser now you guys can see
we get a new date we get 1999 something
something something which is the last
way we can actually write this inside
the date constructor
now of course right now as you guys can
see we don't get something that is
really useful if you need to for example
right to date inside a website because
this doesn't look very pretty so now we
learned how to write a specific date
inside the browser using a constructor
let's actually talk about how to change
the format to be see inside the browser
now I do want to correct one thing as
well which is that I did actually call
this format a long date this is actually
called a full date not a long date okay
so going inside our code again we're
gonna go ahead and change out the format
that we see inside the browser now one
thing I need to mention is that what we
have here when we create a constructor
automatically converts the date into a
string meaning that if we were to go
behind the variable date down here and
write the function called two string
parenthesis which converts the data into
a string it does the exact same thing as
not having it at all and the reason I'm
mentioning this is because we can
actually convert it to other types of
formats using of the functions behind
the date here so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go ahead and convert it to
what we call a UTC string which is
another format that we have inside the
date which is another format we have
when we want to write the date so I'm
gonna go and say UTC string I'm gonna go
ahead and save this go inside the
browser and as you guys can see we get a
new time format now this one looks a lot
better because we can actually you know
make sense of it we don't get a bunch of
stuff behind it and it just looks so
much better now what we can do as well
is we can go and change to something
else called
to date string which is mainly something
to make it easier for us to see the date
so I'm can actually say to date string
refresh the browser and as you guys can
see we get it even simpler so depending
on which function to use behind your
variable or just behind a constructor
you can go ahead and change the date
format inside the browser to to
something much more simple as you guys
can see
so not only talked about how to output
the date inside the browser in a more
simple way let's like to talk about some
different formats we can write the date
inside the constructor parentheses
because right now what we talked about
so far is different ways to write out a
specific date but we haven't talked
about some different formats we have
inside to date constructor so what we
can do here is we can actually go ahead
and write out what we call a I so
date and Dubai - actual call it date
string method meaning that we had double
quotes and I'm gonna go ahead and write
out a date here so I'm gonna say 2015
I'm gonna say gasps oh three oh four -
twelve capsulize to1 : 34 : 12 and then
a set at the end which means that we
were setting this as a UTC format just
like we did down here at the bottom here
so when we do it this way basically what
we're doing is we're setting the year
the month the date the hour the minutes
and the seconds and then what we want to
do is you want to separate with the T to
say that we're adding more than just the
date we're adding time behind it
now to set over here like a service to
you to see format so we need to have
that so if I were to go inside the
browser now and actually delete what we
have back here which is called date
string refresh the browser as you guys
can see we get a new date which is
actually the date that I wrote inside
the browser using the logical format
that we just wrote inside the code now
another way we can write a date is by
going back inside the string here and
instead we can write something called a
short date now a short date is for
example if we say 0-5 forged last 12
four words last 2015 which means that we
now have the month the day and the year
so if I go back inside the browser so
you guys can see that now changed again
and we now have the month day and year
now the last time we're gonna talk about
is the one called a long date which is
when I confuse the default format with
which is actually the full date but the
long date is when we go in and instead
of writing it this way we actually write
the date using letters so if we were to
say we want to have March 15 2015
we can write it this way I can go and
save it refresh the browser and as you
guys can see we now get March 2015 to
15th we can also do it a different way
we can actually go ahead and switch
around 15 with March if you want to like
so this does the exact same thing you
can also go ahead and write out the full
month if you want to does the exact same
thing and it's just a very basic way to
write out a date in case you guys want
to write the date inside the browser now
the last form you need to talk about is
what we call a full date which is
just remove anything we have inside of
here like so refresh the browser and
then you guys can see we get this format
inside the browser here now the idea
here is that we can actually take this
order date that we have here I could
actually go ahead and copy it like so
and paste it inside my date constructor
and I will actually get this date which
is called a full date format so these
are some in different formats we have
inside the date constructor inside the
date function we have in order to run
out of date inside the browser using
JavaScript so if you guys enjoyed I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
