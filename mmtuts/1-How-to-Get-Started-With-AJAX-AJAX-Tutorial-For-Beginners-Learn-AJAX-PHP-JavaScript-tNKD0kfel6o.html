episode on how to use ATX now this first
episode we're going to talk about what
exactly a text is and why it's so good
to know inside web development
now 8x10 so a synchronous JavaScript and
XML and it's basically a way for us to
insert content inside our website from a
database or a server without having to
refresh the website each time now this
is something that might not seem like
anything special but when you have a
website that needs to load in data from
time to time Ajax is something that's
really annoying not to have now this
might not seem like a big deal if you're
not used to including data from a
database or a server but when you have a
website that has something like a chat
system you know like the one you have on
Facebook where you can write messages to
each other when you want to see a new
message from another user if they were
to write you something the ability to
see the message instantly inside your
browser when it just pops up in the
bottom requires something like Ajax
because without a TX if I were to see
the message some person actually sent to
me I would have to refresh the browser
each time I want to check if I got a new
message so when we load in data from a
server or at database which we can do
using PHP we can use a text to display
the data immediately by only refreshing
part of the page so if I have a small
chat box in the bottom of my screen here
and I receive a message then that tab
box is going to be the only thing that
refreshes inside our website and it's
going to do it by itself if we tell it
to using a text now as you guys can see
in front of me here I have an example to
show you guys what exactly a Tech's can
do inside a website what is a very basic
example what it can do and a couple of
things to know before we actually click
this button up here is that a text only
works inside a server so right now as
you guys can see I do X have two tabs up
here I have the one you guys can see
here and I have an identical one that is
in here now both of these have HX inside
of it inside the code but only one of
these are inside a server so this
website here is just inside a root
folder inside my desktop and the other
one is inside a local server installed
using xampp and you will in fact learn
how to actually install xampp and how to
get a local server
and running it's very easy to do but for
now I'm just going to go to insert guys
what exactly a Tech's can do so inside
the first tab here I'm not inside a
service or were to actually click the
button nothing happens now forward to go
to the second tab and click the button
you guys can see that I change the text
so basically what I just did here is I
went ahead and click the button and then
I replace the text with another piece of
text that was inside a separate document
inside my server and I did all that
without having to refresh the browser
now this might not seem very impressive
if you're not used to PHP and handling
databases but this feature here is
actually something that's really needed
when you want to get data from a
database and put it inside a website and
again I want to mention that you don't
need to know PHP or about databases in
order to use Ajax it's just something
that you can use together with PHP and
databases in order to get data without
him to refresh the browser from a
database I'm mentioning this because you
know a lot of you guys will have a PHP
background and you will be using a TX
for getting data from a database so I
just want to include this but 8x is not
only for people who want to pull in data
from a database it's also for people
just want to get data from a server
without having to refresh the browser
now when it comes to a text there's
actually two different types we can use
you can either use a text with
JavaScript or Cakery now because they
occur is the easiest one to learn I'm
going to go and start out the students
by doing the da Curie way and then
afterwards we're going to learn how to
do it using Java scripts so in the next
episode we'll talk about how to actually
do stuff using a text so we guys enjoyed
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
