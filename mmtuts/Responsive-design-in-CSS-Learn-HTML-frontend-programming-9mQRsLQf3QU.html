about how to make our website responsive
inside different devices so if I were to
take this website we have right here and
you'd inside a cell phone or tablet
right now our website would look exactly
like it does inside a browser inside a
computer and in some cases that would be
okay but in a lot of cases such as this
one we have right here where we have a
small menu up in the corner we have you
know tiny text going on we have a little
image down here if I were to see this
inside a cell phone it would not be very
you know user-friendly because it's very
tiny so in a lot of cases we want to
make our design respond to the device
that we're viewing it on and that is not
very difficult to do we can actually do
that only using CSS so what we're gonna
do in this episode is we're gonna talk
about how to make a website that we have
right here responsive now I should also
mention that today well if we were to
take five years ago the amount of people
who are viewing websites inside their
cell phones and tablets were not as high
as today but it has rapidly been
increasing so today you can't really
have a website that's not responsive to
cell phones and tablets because there's
just so many people viewing websites on
the devices so it's it's actually
getting pretty important to have a
responsive website which is why this
episode might be really important for
some of you guys so what we're gonna do
here is first of all I'm gonna go ahead
and open up my code and inside my
stylesheet we can actually go straight
down to the bottom of our stylesheet I
usually like to style our media queries
oh well you guys don't know what
mediocres is yet but I like to style the
responsive design at the bottom of my
stylesheet so at the very bottom here
underneath the footer I'm just gonna go
ahead and move down a little bit so I
have some separation from the rest now
what we're gonna do here is we're gonna
go ahead and specify exactly how wide
our screen needs to be in order for to
start changing the design meaning that
if I were to take my browser here and
let me just go ahead and minimize the
window a little bit so and if I were to
actually minimize the screen sideways
how
for I do want it to go before it starts
saying okay now we're on a tablet or now
when a cellphone and now needs to change
the styling of our website because if I
were to have it too small as you guys
can see it actually starts to cut off
and we don't want that inside a device
so inside our stylesheet down here at
the bottom the first thing we're gonna
do is well at least a rule of thumb for
me is that you should always style for
the smallest device first meaning that
we're gonna start out with a cell phone
so what we're gonna do here in order to
specify that okay every single piece of
code that goes right here is full when
the screen reaches a certain size and we
do that by adding at whoops I did
actually just tap away from my code here
I do that by writing at media space and
then we need to specify the width of our
screen as we are you know viewing it on
a different device so we're gonna add
parentheses and in here we can either
write max width or minimum width so
right now if I were to say max with Max
- width and say colon and then set it to
let's say 768 which is one of the
presets you can find on the internet
that says okay now we're styling for a
cell phone so after you've done this in
the parentheses afterwards we just
simply open up the code like we've done
before and you guys will see it does
actually turn into a except the color
inside my code editor so everything that
goes in here will happen once we reach
this width of our window so what we can
do here is for example if you were to go
back to the website and say okay once I
reach a certain size when I minimize my
window I would like my intro text down
here to change in size because right now
it's very tiny and I would like to have
it readable so if I go back up to where
we have the styling for that part we can
actually go ahead and just find it it's
right here
index intro P and in index intro h2 I'm
just gonna go ahead and copy the styling
for those go down to the bottom here
where we have a media query then I'm
gonna paste it in here like so
I'm just gonna go ahead and move it out
a little bit because I would like to
show exactly where my curly braket start
from the media aquarium where it ends
and then where all the styling in here
goes now I just copied the entire
styling for the h2 and the paragraph you
don't need to copy everything down you
only need to copy down what you want to
change meaning that if I only want to
change the font size I actually don't
need any of these other codes here so
right now we don't want the text
transformed because it will
automatically be it's only gonna
overwrite it's not gonna completely
change the styling once we actually
minimize the screen I need to need to
make that clear so the padding bottom we
can just keep the same the
text-align:center we want to keep the
same the font family we want to keep the
same and let's just keep the font weight
for now so once we minimize our browser
I would like for my font size to become
34 instead I would like my paragraph
down here to also as well I'm just going
to ahead and delete everything except
the font size and the font weight I
would like my font size to become 26 if
I save this now and then we go back to
our browser I've refreshed my page and
I'm just gonna go ahead and minimize the
browser as you guys can see I do like to
have it quite tiny now if I were to have
it this big like this is not 768 pixels
yet if I were to slowly minimize notice
that the text down here will actually
increase in size once we do actually hit
that certain point where it gets bigger
so if I minimize minimize minimize and
there we go so as you guys can see it
does actually pop bigger once we do hit
that certain size which is how you you
know style for a device now going back
to our code I want to talk a little bit
more about the different types of media
codes we have here because you can do
quite a lot with these so right now we
specified the max width we can also
specify the minimum width if it were to
say this we will actually notice that
everything gets flipped around so right
now it's tiny and if it gets above 768
it does actually changed into this we
have down here
let's just go ahead and reverse that
again now we can also specify something
else in here after the media and this
one is not well this might not be as
important for you guys right now but
after the media we can also specify if
you want this to be viewed on a device
that has support for something called
screen mode and the way we do that is by
adding screen afterwards here and this
is just if you go to w3schools torque
which is the website I usually like to
use when I have to look up references
they actually recommend that they use
screen when you want to make it for
devices because apparently device is
just kind of support this thing another
thing we can add in here is something
called only which we are going to add
right before the screen and this is
something that is done to hide the
styling you know once we do actually
change the styling we need to actually
hide the old styling from all the
browser's or what you call older user
agents because the newer browsers does
actually support this automatically but
some older browsers might not support
this you know that we're doing here so
we need to specify these two at least I
think it's a good idea that we keep
these two in here and then we just
continue on from here on out so I also
want to mention that if we do want to
have something in between a certain
width and you know like a minimum width
and a max width you can also specify
both of these parameters by saying okay
I would like to have media screen media
on the screen and I would also like to
have a minimum width so I'm just gonna
go ahead and say min in here - width and
set it to something specific like let's
actually go ahead and take our let's
let's take the 768 in here just for now
and copy it in here and then I would
like to say afterwards here and I would
like a max width to be 1000 768 as an
example if I were to view this now it
would actually only be in between these
meaning that if I go and refresh my
browser
you guys will notice that right now if I
were to sass it up a little bit you can
actually see if I have it below here
below 768 it will actually be the
regular styling if I were to hit above
768 Boop we do actually get a larger
font size but if I continue to the point
where I reads as 1000 768 pixels with
you guys will notice that it will change
back to normal like it did right there
now you guys might be asking well how
can you window be larger than once 1000
768 that's because I'm actually on a
really big resolution monitor here so in
case of you guys you might want to you
know change this down a little bit to
maybe 900 or something now so this is
how we essentially do this let's just go
ahead and reverse back a little bit and
just keep it at max width and then this
thing because I think this is good for
now this is just for cell phone devices
and that kind of thing so now that we
talked about this specifically I would
like to talk about something called
portrait and landscape mode as well
which is something that's also going to
be really important for you so let's say
I have this certain styling here and I
would like to also specify that if the
user were to take their cell phone or
the tablet and instead of viewing it
with the you know the long width of the
screen going upwards if they flip the
tablet or if they flip the device into
landscape mode I would like for it to
change the styling to something else so
right now if I were to take my cell
phone and say okay if you view yourself
on like you would normally I would like
to add and parentheses and then I'm
gonna set an orientation like so I'm
gonna set colon and then I'm gonna say
portrait so right now if I were to view
this in portrait mode it would actually
have a certain type of styling so let's
actually go ahead and test this out so
if I were to take this styling here and
say this is for portrait mode only then
I'm gonna go and copy on my code paste
it below and let's go ahead and make one
for landscape mode instead so if I were
to change portrait to landscape
on the bottom one we have here and then
I would like to say well I would like my
82 to also change the font color into
red I can actually go ahead and save
refresh my browser and then if we were
to go ahead and just kind of minimize it
below so we do get some change into the
text let's see if the font size let's
actually get bigger it does not for some
reason let's go ahead and figure out why
it does not do that okay so I just found
out why I couldn't see anything inside
my browser and I did actually forget to
add an and I believe inside my code so
make sure to ask the screen you do have
an end and then max width and
orientation portrait and the same thing
down here when to come with the
landscape code so once we have this we
can actually continue I did X has been
quite a lot of time figuring out that I
was missing this so this is go ahead and
add back into the website here now if we
go ahead and resize our window sideways
and we have it you know like our view is
actually taller than it is wide
you guys will notice that our tix gets
bigger but it doesn't turn red in the
landscape styling and it actually tell
it that it needed to turn red once it
was in landscape so if I were to resize
this out again and then resize the
height instead and just make sure we can
actually see what's going on here like
so now it's in landscape mode because
it's actually wider than this tall so if
I were to resize from the width till we
actually hit that certain width that we
want which is right there you guys to
notice that we do still have a larger
width than height and we did get below
the 768 pixels that we chose inside our
styling so right now it did actually
turn red so that's how essentially we
you can style different kinds of
responsive designs now there's one more
thing I want to talk about which is an
issue that some people run into later on
when I do that coding and it's kind of a
workaround to fix an issue that you
probably should have thought off before
you started making the website now if
you want to or at least if you're
planning on making a responsive design
at some point when you are done making
the website
you need to consider from the beginning
how the layout is gonna be because you
need to be able to take the website and
just move around the styling a bit for
example if I have a new section down
here I want to move all of them down
below each other once we do actually get
to cell phone size because right now if
I were to view them on a cell phone and
everything is sideways it's gonna get
very tiny so maybe I want these to be
look below each other instead once I hit
the device and we need to make sure we
actually set up the HTML in a way that
allows for us to just through styling
make these appear underneath each other
and right now we have them floating and
we do have the same width like the same
margin each on each side I'm kind of
stuttering here on each side of the
posts so we would actually be able to do
this from this kind of layout we made
here but let's say I did actually not
think about making a responsive from the
beginning and now I'm sitting of the
issue that I can't really change this
now the way to fix that would be or at
least the way I've found to fix that
kind of issue is if I were to go back
into my HTML sheet and take for example
our let's go and take off form down here
in the bottom and say okay this form is
not very good to make responsive I need
to change the layout for a HTML but I
don't want to change the layout on the
browser version on the computer because
it does actually look quite nice but
once I go to the device I need to be
able to move this around so that it
actually looks nice on the device as
well so what I'm gonna do here is I'm
actually gonna go ahead and copy my
entire form then I'm gonna paste it
below here and then the class of this
form is gonna be form desc box - device
because now we have two forms going next
to each other we're gonna have one
that's actually been styled inside our
browser here and we're gonna have one
below which hasn't really been styled as
you guys can see and that's because
right now we added all this styling to
our first form which was inside this
class called form - box and now because
we have the second form we can actually
go into our style sheet and say inside
the regular code not inside the media
code but in
set the regular code at the bottom here
we can just kind of go ahead and say we
have a class called forum - box - media
and this styling or at least this dip
box if I open up the code here you would
like to display as none again
this is an I don't recommend doing it
this way you should have everything
prepared for responsiveness from the
beginning but if you do actually at this
point you can do this okay cuz I know
some people will tell me out there that
this is you know you shouldn't write
unnecessary code and it's just kind of a
thing about you know browsers loading a
little bit fast and that kind of thing
but if you run into this issue this is
how to fix it so right now if I say
display:none for this form and I go
refresh my browser you actually notice
that our bottom form is still there for
some reason let's actually find out why
let's go back into form desk box that I
spell something wrong form - box -
device ah okay it's not that's media
it's actually test device save it
refresh the browser and you'll notice
that our button form disappears so now
what we can do is we can actually go
ahead and take this dialing copy it go
into our media styling down here with
the portrait paste it in here and
instead of saying display:none we're
gonna say display:block so now actually
let's go ahead and do one more thing
let's actually take the form that sparks
styling not the device but the box
itself and tell it to display none once
we hit this so right now what we're
doing is that once we do actually hit a
maximum width of 768 it's gonna hide the
first form down here and it's gonna show
the second form which is meant for
devices so if I were to refresh the
browser and just kind of go into device
mode here you guys will notice that
right now we do see the form you just
paste it in that has no styling if I go
ahead and refresh a little or like
resize it well suddenly we get to do
form popping up so if I go down again
you can see that the dust
actually pop in and out between these
two and the reason you can do this and
it will actually work is that you can
actually go into the second one we made
like the actual form inside the HTML and
just kind of move around everything in
here so if you don't want to add breaks
let's say the breaks are the thing that
destroys it from being you know a good
responsive design you can actually just
go into it and remove these breaks like
so like so like so and I know this is
not gonna look very pretty
once we do actually refresh our browser
but they actually notice that we have
two forms that does the same thing but
they have different styling and because
we teams to HTML we can also do
different styling to them and make them
behave differently okay so we have two
completely different forms that looks
the same so this is the lacy workaround
to fix an issue that you should have
fixed from the beginning I can't say
that enough you have have to keep in
mind if you want to make it responsive
but this is how we're gonna make
everything responsive inside our browser
so hope you guys enjoyed this episode
and I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
