different windows we have inside our new
project and as you guys can see we have
four windows we have a tool bar and we
have a disk Volcom down the right side
now we also have different taps in
different windows that we can choose and
we're just gonna talk about what some of
these can actually do and what we need
to use them for when we have a project
going up in the left side we have a
window and inside this window we have
four different tabs now as you guys can
see we have source where it says right
now we have no clips because we don't
actually have any clips inside our
project but this is basically where we
can preview our clips that we pulled in
before we actually put them into the
timeline we also have an effects
controls panel which is one we're going
to use quite often when we choose
footage down in our timeline and we want
to add effects to it and then tell it
what to do with the effects so this one
you're gonna use quite a lot we also
have an audio clip mixer which tells
your information about the audio in a
clip you have chosen and then we have
something called metadata which simply
tells you information regarding the clip
you have chosen on the right side we
have our preview window inside the
preview window we can see what is
actually going on inside our timeline
down here which is the final product or
at least the sequence that we put
together down our timeline which could
essentially be the timeline for our
final movie so can actually see how the
entire movie is going to look like when
it's cut together and edited down here
in the bottom of the window
we have different options for playing we
can step forward slowly we can go to the
end we can go to the beginning we can
mark in and out which basically means we
can you know tell it where we want to
extract footage and just remove some
part of the video we can also go down
and loop the video if you want to so we
can keep watching the same thing over
and over again and we can take
screenshots and all kinds of fancy
things if you want to add more stuff
down here inside your toolbar you can
click the plus over here and then you
can simply take a button and drag it
down to your timeline or down to the
toolbar if you want to use it at the
bottom here we have a timeline and the
timeline like I said it's used for
actually seeing what you're actually
cutting and editing together
now the time line is also we're gonna
choose your foot tips or drag effects
onto your footage if you want to make
changes to the actual movie on the right
side of timeline we can see the decibel
counter which basically tells you how
loud your footage is as it's being
played this one used to keep an eye out
for because a rule of thumb at least for
me is when you make a movie you don't
want your sound to go above six or minus
six decibels because then when it gets
to the red part at the top it's gonna
start peaking your audio which doesn't
sound very good on the left side of our
timeline we have a toolbar more inside
this toolbar you can find tools for
editing your timeline which can be for
example if you want to cut something
with the eraser tool on the left side of
the toolbar we can see we have a project
window what we dragged all our footage
into if you want some footage that you
can drag onto your timeline inside this
project window as well you can also set
up new adjustments you can create new
sequences you can create black videos
which is basically just a black
background if you want to have some sort
of you know black background with text
on it you can also set color mats and do
all kinds of fancy things down here
which we'll talk about later on inside
the same window we also have effects
which is actually where you're gonna
choose your effects that you're going to
add to your footage now once you add
effects to your footage up here in the
effects controls once you click the
footage you add an effect - you can
actually adjust the effect and change it
we also have a media browser down here
which is basically a place where you can
go and look for your footage and import
it into your project we also have
libraries if you did actually create a
library for this footage you want to use
and we got some other things down here
that we don't really need to talk about
yet so for the beginning we're just
gonna go ahead and stick with this
information for now now the last thing I
want to show you guys inside our panels
here is that we also have a menu at the
very top here inside our menu we can
choose what we want to focus on when
we're creating our video right now it's
set to editing as a default which
basically means that right now we just
focus on editing our footage if you want
to do more coloring in your footage you
can change the layout and as you guys
can see when you click
it changes everything you have in here
so now all the windows adjust themselves
so you can be more focused around what
color a white balancing the footage has
you can also focus on effects audio
titles and we're just gonna go and stick
to editing for now because that's
basically all we have to do in the
beginning here I hope you guys enjoyed
this episode and next one we'll talk
about how sex is set up a new timeline
which is called a new sequence that we
can use to actually drag footage into
hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
