about paragraphs and the reason I'm
gonna do this is because there's
actually quite a lot to can do with text
inside a browser and I'm also going to
talk about the differences between text
inside a browser compared to text on the
newspaper or like a magazine or
something so if you take a look at the
paragraph here we did actually create
one in the last episode underneath a
header and as you guys can see inside
our browser we didn't do any styling to
it yet now before we get started under
styling part I do want to mention like I
said once you write text inside a
browser compared to any kind of physical
magazine or newspaper or something like
that you should know the test is proven
that if you have the font size smaller
than 16 pixels it's actually going to
decrease readability quite a lot now I'm
saying this because this is what test
has proven but personally I never have
my text as 16 pixels in size because I
think it's too much
but I also like to say once you know the
rules you can start breaking them so I
just want to mention to you guys that
the tests has proven like I said 16
pixels is the minimum so that's what
we're gonna stick to in this episode so
going inside our styling inside our
style sheet we're gonna go ahead and
start starting our text and we're gonna
go ahead and copy our 82 styling up here
and just kind of paste it underneath
here then we're going to change the h2
inside our path to AP instead since
we're styling the paragraph and then we
can start changing some of these
variables that we have down here inside
our code for example the font weight I
think should be 400 pixels or not 400
pixels but just 400 the font family
we're gonna keep at lat o the font size
we're gonna say 16 pixels like I said
before that's the minimum text align we
are gonna keep at censor for now padding
bottom we're gonna go and remove down
one because we don't need it
text turned a text transform we're gonna
go and remove as well because we don't
want it to be uppercase then we can save
this and if I go refresh the browser
you'll notice that we do actually get
some changes now when we have text like
this right now everything looks very
crammed together
it's nice to have some spacing in
between the lines meaning that we're
gonna go back and touch down seed we're
gonna go down another line I'm gonna say
line - height and set it to something
greater than 16 pixels because right now
if I were to set it to 16 pixels it's
actually gonna have the same line height
that's the one we write we have right
now inside the browser so it has to be
greater than 16 pixels so let's go ahead
and say something like 22 pixels
save it refresh our browser if i zoom in
for you guys before I refresh you guys
will notice that you do get some spacing
so having this spacing is always nice
and of course like I said inside a
browser in a newspaper you might see
every text is like very cramped together
inside a browser you want a lot of space
around the stuff that you're reading
because the whitespace is gonna make it
more comfortable for the eyes to look
inside the browser at least in most
cases so having this line spacing or
line height it's gonna have a lot with
readability so once we have this we can
actually go ahead and start talking
about some other stuffs like for example
if you want some spacing around our text
let's say we have our text inside a box
which we do actually have right now so
if I were to go ahead and go into my
wrapper which is up here I'm gonna go
ahead and give it a actually node let's
go ahead and go down to our intro box
and give it a background color as red
for example
there we go red save it refresh the
browser you guys will notice that right
now we have this big red box now if I
were to go inside my wrapper which is up
here give it a background color as green
refresh the browser you guys will now
notice that we can actually see what we
have inside our text box or like our dip
box which contains all the text so let's
say I have a box like this and I want to
have some text in here but I don't want
it well I do actually want the text box
to have a background color which means
that right now the text is actually
touching this
and do not want it to because it's gonna
look not very nice so if I want to push
away to text from the edges of my box
what we can do is I can go into my code
go down to my text styling then I can
say padding and then set it to maybe 20
pixels then it's gonna create a twenty
pixels space from all the sides of the
text so if I go refresh my browser you
guys will notice that we get some
spacing away from the edges of the box
which is something that's gonna be very
useful when you create text boxes now if
you want to create the same type of
spacing but you want it not to be
increasing the size of the box then you
use margins instead and I can actually
show you guys if I change my padding to
margin and save and refresh you know you
guys will notice that the text States
the same place but now the green box is
not gonna increase in size like so and
these in the bottom it's not gonna do it
so having it this way is quite a nice
way to increase text size around the
text and it's some of the different ways
we can style our paragraphs okay so this
is essentially what I wanted to show you
guys when it comes to paragraphs now we
will probably be doing some more styling
and messing around with paragraphs a
little bit later in these episodes but
for now this is just kind of the basics
of getting started with something like
text so let's go and end it here I hope
you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys
