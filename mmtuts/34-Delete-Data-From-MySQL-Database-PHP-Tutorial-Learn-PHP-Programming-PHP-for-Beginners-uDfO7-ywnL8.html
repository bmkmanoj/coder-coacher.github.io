delete data from our tables using SQL
code and this is also something that
you're going to find useful when we
write PHP code in fact all the SQL code
we're going to write inside PHP myadmin
for these couple exercises you will find
useful using PHP code so I'm just going
to say it again you need to memorize
these codes because you will be using it
in the future so having said that it's
actually going to make sure we have our
PHP lessons data bit chosen and go into
the SQL tab up here in the top now in
here we're going to go ahead and delete
our information from our post table as
you guys can see we do actually still
have our what you call it our row in
here where we have an ID as one subject
this is a test content this is the
content and then we have a date so we're
going to go ahead and delete this row so
we have no rows left inside our database
table so going back to the SQL coding
part let's go ahead and write delete
space from space and then we need to
tell it what kind of table we want to
delete from now in this case we're
deleting from posts and then I'm going
to go ahead and say enter to go to the
next line and again you could just write
space and write where if you wanted to
but just so it looks a bit nicer I'm
going to put it down to the next line
where space and then we need to tell it
where we want to delete from again if we
do X I have many different types of
posts inside our database table then we
might not want to delete all of them
because right now this was actually
delete everything from post and we don't
want that so let's actually go and
delete where ID this equal to one so now
if I do actually go ahead and run this
you guys can see one row delete it if I
go back into my posts you guys can see
we have no post left so this is the
basic way to delete stuff inside the
database and in the next episode we're
going to talk about one more thing which
is called order by and after we talked
about that will actually start talking
about how to actually do stuff with PHP
code so run this SQL code inside the
database without having to go into the
database and do this so after we've done
that episode we can actually start
talking about creating a lock
system so hope you guys enjoyed and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
