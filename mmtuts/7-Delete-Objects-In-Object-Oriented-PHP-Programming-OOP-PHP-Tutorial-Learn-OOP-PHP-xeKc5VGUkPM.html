to create a constructor and a destructor
inside object-oriented programming now
in this episode we're gonna learn how to
delete an object after we instantiated
it as you guys can see right now inside
my index file have an object here called
objects which is an instantiation of new
class which is inside my file called new
class and what I did underneath it was I
went ahead and echoed out the method
called gets property now what I want to
do here is as you guys remember from the
previous episode is we created a
constructor and a destructor now the
destructor is a function that runs as
soon as the object yours as soon as the
class is done loading so when we do
actually instantiate an object and
insert it inside for example our index
file like I did here it runs the entire
code inside the class including the
construct and the destructor which runs
at the end and what we want to do here
is we want to run the destructor or
trigger it and actually run the
destructor in order to exit delete the
object so what I want to do here is in
between my instantiate the class and the
echo down here is I want to run a
destructor before we acquire the method
to show you guys that once we do
actually destroy the objects we can't
use it anymore
now the leading an object is something
we can choose to do if we have a bunch
of objects and we don't want to use all
of them so some of them we have already
used we don't need to use them anymore
and we can go ahead and delete them so
what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna go
and go in between the instantiated
object or the instantiate the class and
the echo and I'm gonna cut and say on
set which is a function that will go
ahead and unset or destroy the object
that is inside the parentheses by
actually running the destructor function
inside the class so we're gonna go ahead
and copy the object inside on set and
what you guys will notice is that we do
actually get an error message inside the
browser I wanted to actually refresh so
as you guys can see now the browser can
actually find the variable called object
because we unset it here and it can't
find the function called get property or
the method inside the class called get
property and that's because right now we
did actually unset the object by true
the destructor inside the class so this
is how we can unset or destroy objects
after you create them I hope you guys
found this useful and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
