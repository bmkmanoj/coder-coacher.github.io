how to import bootstrap inside our
website before we get started actually
creating the website and as you guys can
see we do actually have the necessary
links here you know in order to get
started programming so in this episode
we're going to talk about how to
actually get started programming
bootstrap so as you guys may notice we
do have a very basic html5 set up inside
our index page here now before we get
started on doing any kind of bootstrap
coding we need to make sure that this
document itself to stand out when we
want to use bootstrap now a couple of
things to notice is that we need to use
html5 when we code bootstrap as you guys
may notice I do like to have an html5
set up up in the top where have the
exclamation mark doctype HTML which is
the indication that we're starting up an
html5 document now we need to include a
couple of more things before we get
started which is that inside the HTML
tag that we have here we need to include
the language that we're using so I'm
going to say a language and I'm going to
set it to English now the next thing
we're going to include is a couple of
meta tags the first one is going to be
right after the title and it's going to
be the charge set that we want to use
inside the website so we're going to go
and set a meta charge set to the equal
to double quotes I'm going to go ahead
and say UTS - 8 which is just a standard
that pretty much everyone uses when they
set up a basic website now we need to
use one more meta tag which is a bit
more critical when it comes to bootstrap
directly so underneath our first meta
tag the meta charset we're going to go
to include a another meta tag now this
meta tag is going to have a name so I'm
going to say name it's going to be equal
to you port now as you guys may remember
in the first episode I explained the
bootstrap is for mobile first meaning
that when we do actually you a website
on mobile we need to make sure that the
view that we see inside cell phone is
proportionally correct so what we're
going to do with this meta charset
is make sure that all devices you the
website the same way so the second
attribute inside the meta tag
is going to be content we're going to
set it equal to double quotes and the
first code we're going to write in here
is going to be something called with
equal to device - width so what we're
basically doing here is we're setting
the width of our webpage to follow the
screen width of the device or viewing it
meaning a cell phone or tablet okay now
the second parameter we're going to set
is something called initial-scale
I'm going to go ahead and set this one
equal to one so what this one is
basically doing is that the zoom level
of the page when we first loaded inside
out device whether it being a cell phone
tablet inside the browser is going to be
proportionally correct so now that we
have this code we can actually get
started on coding bootstrap so what I'm
going to go and do is I'm going to go
ahead and go down to my body tag so we
can actually do our first piece of
bootstrap code now when it comes to
bootstrap we like to use containers
meaning that we have a for example a tip
box or a div element that has a specific
class which defines what kind of
container you want to build for our
website so I'm going to go ahead and
create a div tag just so we have some
kind of container and I'm going to go
and give this one a class name which is
equal to container now having the class
container means that inside the CDN
files that we have up here inside the
CSS file we load in a class called
container now container set a fixed
width of our website which is defined
inside the CSS file we imported meaning
that the content won't go all the way to
you know the width of the browser now if
you want to have it as a fluid design
which I prefer to do in this series here
we can go ahead and set another class
name called container - fluid like so
meaning that all the content is going to
go from the left side of the screen to
the right side of the screen with a
small piece of spacing before it
actually hits the you know beside the
browser because we don't want that so
what I can do is I can go inside this
container
we created and for example creates some
kind of tack I'm going to say hello
world and then we might have some kind
of paragraph with some random text in it
I know this is just random and what we
can do now is we can actually go ahead
and load up the website so I'm going to
refresh now as you guys can see we now
get hello world now forward to well we
can't really see it right now but if
there were to be more content than just
the hello world this will actually be
responsive design because if it were to
resize the browser it would actually
change according to the browser width so
this is how we do the first setup when
we want to start programming bootstrap
so now we have a container we talked
about what kind of container we can use
and we talked about what's necessary to
do inside the starting tags of our
website so you guys enjoyed I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
