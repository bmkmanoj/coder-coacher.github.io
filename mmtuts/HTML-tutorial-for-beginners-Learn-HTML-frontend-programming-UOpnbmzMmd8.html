first episode how to basic HTML and CSS
now in this series we'll be talking
about how to build a complete website or
at least learn the tools to build a
complete website only using HTML and CSS
now I should probably mention that we're
using the latest version which is html5
and css3 the reason we're doing that is
because it's been off quite a while now
so I don't see any reason not to use the
latest version which is of course the
one everyone is using at the moment so
what we're going to do in this episode
is first of all I want to mention that
once we get started on actually coding
stuff I'm going to be explaining stuff
very thoroughly I'm going to explain you
guys to you guys why we're doing
different things we're doing and what
they do because it's very important you
guys don't just learn like memorize the
code you do actually need to understand
what it is for coding it's kind of like
learning a new language you know you do
actually need to understand what you're
saying and not just learn phrases so you
can go to other countries so you want to
be able to do this fluently and actually
understand what we're doing when we code
websites because coding is kind of like
learning a new language so what we're
going to do in this episode is we're
going to talk about what kind of
software you need we're going to talk
about how much it cost to build a
website and the first thing I can
mention is that it does not cost
anything to build a website of course
you need a computer which you need to
pay for but once you have the computer
you don't need to pay anything on your
computer you will actually have a
program called notepad or something
similar on Mac which you can actually
use in order to make a website because
this is a basic text editor and of
course notepad is not going to be the
one we're gonna be using but just to
give you guys an example you can
actually just get started straightaway
without needing a text editor or you
know without the need to download
anything but of course like I said we're
not gonna be using this one now I do
actually want to give you guys a couple
of examples of different software that
we can use in order to get started and
it doesn't really matter which one you
decide to use because we just need a
text editor and the only differences
between the different software's is you
know how much they have inside of them
you know syntax checking and colors and
you know layouts and that kind of thing
that's the only differences they all do
the same
you type the same code in them so what
we're going to do here is we're going to
take a look at a couple of different
software's and I do actually have four
different links open and the first one
I'm going to look at is one called
NetBeans now NetBeans is a text editor
for I would I wouldn't say nerds but for
people who are very much into learning
and more complicated or like a more
in-depth program I like software for
coding this one has a lot of
functionalities and if you just start
out coding I would not recommend you
guys using this one because it will take
your day to get to know NetBeans and a
lot of tutorials online and on how to
get started on it so I do recommend not
using this one if you're you know fairly
new at coding but did you actually have
different versions they have different
versions depending on what kind of
coding you want to do and if you want
the complete package with all the codes
you can get that one too but if you do
want to use NetBeans and you're watching
this tutorial you should probably be
getting the one called html5 and PHP
okay now another text that we're going
to look at is one called notepad plus
plus and yes you heard right it is
notepad plus plus meaning that is a more
advanced version of the regular notepad
we just looked at to begin with but it
does have some different syntax you know
it shows different errors and it has
different colors in it and it is meant
for coding I guess but it is it is a
free to download the same as NetBeans
it's also free so you can just go in and
download one of these two if you want to
use one that's three the last one we're
going to look at which is also free and
I need to admit I have never used
notepad plus plus before but the one I
am using is the 1 cause of blind text
sublime text it's also free to download
version but you can pay for it if you
want the you know the another version
which is I do not remember what they
call it but it is one way you can
actually earn money on it if you could
call it that
so if you want to pay for it you can
actually earn money on it I have no idea
how to check that kind of stuff I do
have the paid version but if I were to
just get the free version and sell a
website I don't know how they would
check this kind of thing so just
mentioning May
sending it for you guys but you can
actually get this one now the last I'm
going to look at is the one called Dream
Weaver and this one is a fairly
expensive one you do need to pay for
this one and this one is a very nice
text editor it's very good for getting
started on coding and it does provide a
lot of functions that the other two that
were free which is not NetBeans doesn't
provide so this one is actually one need
to pay a membership one and depending on
what kind of person you are if your
student or if you if it's a company
account or depending on what you want to
you know what kind of person you are you
can get different offers like different
money you need to pay every month I do
have the the complete version down here
as you guys can see I do actually have
most of the programs down here but we're
not come using Dreamweaver because of
one simple fact which is I cannot zoom
in on the text for you guys so we will
in fact be using sublime text and I did
actually write some stuff in here just
to kind of show you that there is stuff
to write in here now sublime text you
might be asking why does it have a dark
background and that is for a simple
reason which is it does not hurt your
eyes if you sit in code for a long time
a lot of people say they have a little
bit of trouble seeing on my videos when
I do tutorials what I'm writing because
of the dark background but I need to
mention to you guys it is better to have
a dark background than a white
background because it will not hurt your
eyes or give you a headache so this is
actually essentially one need to get
started I did mention that it does not
cost anything to start coding and I do
mean that you don't need internet you
don't need a server you don't need
anything other than a computer you can
actually view your website in your
browser without internet so you don't
need to worry about that kind of thing
the only time you need to pay stuff is
when you do want your complete website
to go online because then you do
actually need to have internet and you
need to pay for server so at the very
end of these tutorial series I will
actually talk to you guys about picking
a server and how to get started and
uploading everything but for now this is
the introduction and in the next couple
episodes we will actually talk about how
to actually get started coding so if you
guys enjoyed this episode and I will see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
