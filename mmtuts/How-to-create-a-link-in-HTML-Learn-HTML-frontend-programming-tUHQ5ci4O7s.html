about how to make a link and the reason
we're gonna do this is because in the
next episode we're gonna talk about how
to make a navigation and before we can
make a navigation we need to know how to
make links so what we're gonna do here
is we're gonna go into our index.html
and then we're gonna scroll down to
where we see the section tags and inside
the section tags we're gonna make our
link now I should probably mention that
any kind of code we write inside our
HTML file it's gonna get deleted after
this episode because you don't actually
need it for the upcoming episodes but
you guys should still follow along
because it's good practice and we will
actually be keeping the styling that
we're gonna write in this episode so
what we're gonna do here is we're gonna
go ahead and make something called an
anchor tag now an anchor tag is what
creates the link so any kind of text or
images or divs or any kind of object
that goes in between these anchor tags
is gonna become a link so the way we
write this is by opening up the code
writing a close it and then we need to
close off the a anchor tag like so so
anything that goes in between these two
are gonna be a link so for this example
we're just gonna right click here
exclamation mark and then we're gonna go
and save it and if i refresh my page
collection notice that we do have some
text here now if I were to click this
however you'll notice that nothing
really happens we can't even see the
hand symbol we usually get when we hover
on top of a link with our cursor so it's
not actually a link yet so in order to
make it link somewhere and the reason we
don't have anything going on when we
click it or a hand symbol is because it
doesn't know where to link to so inside
our HTML file we're gonna go inside our
opening anchor tag we're gonna say space
8r e F equal to and then quotation marks
so right now we're telling it where to
link to afterwards after we click it of
course so in here we're gonna go ahead
and write contact dot HTML
so right now when we click this text
it's going to link to something called a
contact that HTML file which we haven't
actually created yet and this is
actually going to be a contact page
inside our website so if you actually go
ahead and save this and refresh our
browser you'll notice that our link
actually changed color and it also
created this underline below it and we
do have the hand symbol now but like I
said we don't actually have the contact
that HTML page so if I were to click it
it's gonna say this web page is not
found because like I said we don't have
it inside our root folder but what
you'll notice is that if you go up into
the URL we do access here that it's
linking to contact that HTML so if we go
back once more and take a look at the
way it's styled you'll notice that it
looks very ugly and this is just a
default way a link looks like when you
create web sites so if you want to
change this even after you include a
reset style sheet you need to change
this and to make a little bit more
pretty so what we're gonna do here is
we're gonna go into our style sheet and
then at the very top where we have our
own code we're gonna go ahead and write
that everything all anger tags inside
this website space I'm gonna open up the
code with the curly brackets has to have
a certain color so we're gonna write
color and then we're gonna make it into
a black color and the black color code
is hashtag zero zero zero save it so
right now we're telling it that every
single anchor tag inside the website has
to be black if i refresh this you'll
notice that suddenly turned black now we
also have some underlying going on and
we also want to get rid of that and
that's actually something called text
decoration so inside our anchor tag
inside our style sheet we're gonna tell
that we also don't want any kind of text
decoration so we're gonna write text -
deco raishin colon spaced Oh would you
actually need to write text not test
like so
and we need to tell to have none so
right now we're limiting I mean any kind
of text decoration that might be going
on inside any anchor tag so if I save
this refresh my browser you'll see that
the underline disappears but we still
have a link because I can actually still
click it so this is essentially how you
create a link and like I said you can
create dip boxes and all kinds of stuff
and just put it inside the anchor tags
and it will actually become a link
actually to kind of test this and show
you guys if I go back to my index.html
if I copy the opening tag of the the
link and then put it before our logo and
then I close it after the logo and save
it if I go refresh the browser you'll
notice that I can actually click my logo
and it goes to another page so like I
said I mean anything that goes in
between the anchor tags will link to
whatever you tell it to link to so this
is how you create links in the next
episode like I said we're gonna learn
how to create a menu so hope you guys
enjoyed now let's do you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
