about something called assignment
operators inside PHP and this is going
to be a very short episode because
assignment operators are really not that
difficult to understand so I'm just
going to give you guys some examples to
show you guys what they are so as you
guys can see on the screen here I did
actually write that we have a variable
called X which is equal to 100 and then
underneath Thea I just simply echoed out
X so inside my browser you can see we
get 100 now let's say that before I echo
it out I want to change the value of X
now the way we could do it is by saying
well we do have a variable called X
which is equal to variable X because we
did actually set it already plus 20 so
right now if I were to echo out this
inside my browser you can see we get 120
now because we as PHP developers don't
like writing a lot of code we can
actually write this in a much smaller
way so instead of writing you know
variable X equal to variable X plus 20
we can actually just write 20 on the
other side of the equal sign and before
the equal sign we're going to go ahead
and write plus this automatically means
that we're going to take variable X and
put it on the other side of the equal
sign as well and then it's going to be
you know either plus or minus or
whatever right before the equal sign to
the number we have behind here so if I
actually go ahead and refresh the
browser now we should get the same
number which is 120 so we can also go
ahead and use the module list we can
also use the other you know
exponentiation if you want to use that
that we talked about in the last episode
so if I were to write you know divided
by 20 you can see that we will actually
get 5 or like you know 5 inside the
browser so this is basically what
assignment operators are and this is
basically what we're going to cover in
this episode so I'm just going to leave
it off here and in the next episode
we're going to talk about comparison
operators inside PHP so hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
