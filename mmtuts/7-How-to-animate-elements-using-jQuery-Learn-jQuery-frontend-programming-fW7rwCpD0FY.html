animate function inside GA curry and the
animate function is very similar to some
of the previous functions we learned
which is show/hide fade in fit out and
slide but the difference is that the
animate function actually allowed force
to customize the animation that happens
inside our website so to give you guys
an example here let's actually go and
take a look at fade-out now when we use
fade-out inside our code basically what
we're doing is we're taking some kind of
HTML element inside the website and
we're telling the code that we want to
change the opacity from 1 to 0 and then
afterwards we want to have a
display:none so this is basically what
happens inside the code and this is
something we can't teams inside our code
now using animate allow us to do the
exact same thing except for we can
actually customize to code or customized
animation that needs to happen to
whatever object we choose so basically
what we're doing is we're actually
changing the CSS code of that object we
actually choose so to give you guys an
example let's actually go and take a
look at what I have inside my code right
now I have a link to a style sheet which
I used to style what I have down here
inside my body tag which right now is
the div box that has a class as content
box inside the box I have two paragraphs
I have one called content before and I
have one called content after so
basically what happens at my browser is
a blue box that I can click on and then
something needs to happen so I'm going
to go and create an animation using the
animate function inside jQuery no tax it
display this text to have inside content
after inside the paragraph down here so
I'm going to go and go up inside my
script tags at the top here first of all
we need to tell the code that we want to
load in jQuery at least the jQuery code
after everything else inside the website
so I'm going to go and say we have a
selector inside the selector we have a
document dot ready semicolon inside the
ready parenthesis we're going to say we
have a function the nice tax you run
once you do actually load the inside
document afterwards you want to actually
run the jQuery code that we want to use
know to animate stuff inside the browser
so I'm going to go and say we have a
selector parentheses double quotes and
then I'm going to go and select the
content
we have down here and today I want to do
something to it wanted to actually click
the content box so I'm going to say we
have a click event EXO parentheses
semi-colon and inside the click event I
want to say have a function parentheses
curly brackets the needs to actually run
once you do click this content box now
inside the content box we're going to go
to an animate stuff inside the website
so I'm going to go and say we have a
second selector and inside this selector
I want to animate the actual content box
that I click on so I'm just going to go
and copy/paste
and again we need to make sure we do
actually say we have classes called
content box by adding the punctuation in
front of it and then afterwards we can
actually use the animate function inside
the jQuery code so I'm going to say
animate parentheses semicolon and then
inside the parentheses you have three
different parameters we can use the
first one is going to be the actual
animation that needs to happen the
second one is going to be the speed and
the third one is a callback that we can
use if you want to be notified that this
is actually working so the first one
we're going to do in here is we're going
to go and add all the CSS styling do we
want to actually change inside this
object so I'm going to go and use a
couple of curly brackets I'm going to
move it down to the next line just to
make sure it look somewhat nice to look
at because we can actually add multiple
stylings inside the curly brackets so
we're still inside the first parameter
when we used to curl the brackets here
so inside the curly brackets I want to
say that I want to change something
about this box that I chose which right
now is blue it has a certain width and a
height it has a border radius so I can
actually got an animate whatever I want
to do inside the styling of this thing
well except for a couple of things that
you can't animate inside jQuery which
for example would be the background
called we can actually change that using
jQuery unless you download a separate
library for it but he can in fact team
stuff about its size or whatever we want
regarding the box except for the color
so what we can do inside the code is I
can go and say well let's X go and
change the width of this object here so
I'm going to say you have a width
: space single quotes and inside the
single quotes I can write the new width
of the active box here so if I go inside
my style sheet you guys consider my
constant box right now has a width as
240 pixels if want to change that I can
write for example 500 pixels now if you
want to add a second parameter inside my
animation I can say comment
new line and then I want to say I might
change the height of this object : space
single quotes and I can write something
like 300 pixels now if I decide that the
height needs to be the last animation
inside the first parameter here I need
to make sure I don't add a comma at the
end here because it doesn't make sense
if you were to actually have this on a
single line instead of multiple lines I
could do here so you need to make sure
you don't add a comma at the last one so
this is the first parameter if I were to
actually go ahead and add a speed to
this which is the second parameter
inside my animate function I can go
after the curly brackets a comma space
and then add the second parameter so
right now I could say I want to have it
fast or slow by saying fast or slow or
we can actually make this into a number
so I can say a thousand milliseconds
which is one second so I'm going to go
ahead and add just a thousand now the
third parameter is also optional as well
as the second parameter and we can
actually go ahead and do something if
you want to so it could actually alert
something inside the website if I want
to actually be notified that this is
actually working now I don't want to
actually have a third params inside this
example here so I'm just going to go and
delete it now just to sure guys - this
actually works inside the browser let's
actually go ahead and refresh the
browser then click the button and you
guys can see we get some kind of
animation now let's actually go and
animate the text inside this box here so
I'm going to go inside my code and I'm
going to go ahead and create another
selective below what we actually
animated the first one up here so I'm
going to say we have a second selector
I'm going to select the actual paragraph
called contents
- after and one thing you need to note
here is the right now
I actually have the content down here
inside this paragraph
set to a display:none now we talked
about setting a background color inside
the animate function we have up here
that it's not possible because j.crew
doesn't allow it now when it comes to
displaying
geekery also does not allow for display
block or display:none inside the animate
code so need to make sure we do this
some other way because right now for
what to go inside my stylesheet you guys
considered the content after right now
is set to display:none so we can
actually see it inside the browser so we
need to somehow make a display block in
order to see it and then afterwards
animate the text so the way I'm going to
go and do this is when we select the
content after I'm going to go and do
some kind of jQuery function that allow
files to actually set a display block
inside the browser now we already
learned one function called show which
again like I said show hide fade and
slide are all variations of the animate
function Kevin year that allow us to do
one specific thing you know to the
objects we selected inside the code so
right now by using show we set something
to display block so the first thing we
did is we said okay we want to have
content after you want to display block
and then afterwards punctuation
I want to animate it like so and now we
can execute inside the animate
parentheses say we have a couple of
parameters and in this case just restore
gasser you don't have to put it on
multiple lines I'm going to go and write
this in one line of code and then sir
guys the difference between doing it on
multiple lines and inside a single line
so the only thing I want to do inside of
here is change the opacity because right
now we set it to display block but I
don't want it to be entirely visible yet
so I'm going to go and say we have a
opacity : and I want to set it to 1 and
again because this is a number and not
and it doesn't have any pixels inside we
could just say one if you wanted to but
I'm just going to go and write it inside
a pair of single quotes and say one now
one thing I need to point out as well is
that inside my estancia did actually set
opacity to zero as well as having it
display none so we changed it from the
current one which is C
- one after we say display:block okay
now after setting the opacity to one I'm
going to go and add the second parameter
which is going to be the speed so right
now I'm going to say we have maybe three
seconds and now before we go inside the
browser and refresh it let's actually go
to make sure if we selected a class
called content after I'm going to save
it go inside the browser refresh and as
you guys conceded now after three
seconds the text animates in so this is
how we can use the animate function
inside caker but there's one more thing
I want to show you guys which is that in
some cases let's say we have this
content box and let's say inside my
website I don't actually know the exact
width or the exact height of this
content box so what I can do here is I
want to say well I want to add maybe 200
pixels to it but since I don't know if
it's 300 and height I can't say I want
to add 500 pixels then because you know
we need to add 200 but if I don't know
it's actually 300 pixels I wouldn't know
that I need to write 500 pixels in here
so what we can do instead is I can go
and say well I want to add 200 pixels to
the height so I'm going to go and say
200 pixels and then in front of the 200
I'm going to go and say plus equal to
and then save it because now it's
actually taking the default value and
just adding 200 pixels to it so if I
were to go inside my browser click it
you guys considered now we get 200 pesos
extra if I click it again it adds 200 I
click it again it adds 200 and so on and
so on and so on
and again this also works with - so if
we were to write - instead of plus if I
were to refresh you guys can see it
actually gets smaller and of course
right now can't get any smaller because
it's below what the actual height is
inside the stylesheet
so this is how we can do adding and
subtracting a certain pixel amount if
you want to from these numbers inside
the animate function hope you guys
enjoyed I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
