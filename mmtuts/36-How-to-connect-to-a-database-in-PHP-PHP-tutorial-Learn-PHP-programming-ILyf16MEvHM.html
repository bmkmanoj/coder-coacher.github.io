about how to create a database and how
to insert and manipulate data inside a
database now in this episode we're going
to learn how to actually access our
database directly from our websites so
as you guys can see in front of me here
I have a very basic index of PHP file
there's really this is like the bare
bones of an index file and what I want
to show you guys is how to actually
connect to the database and then in the
next episodes we're going to talk about
how to actually select data and how to
insert data and how to manipulate the
database directly from our website so
the first thing we need to do here is
we're going to create a new file because
we want to have the connection in a
separate file so you can refer to it
later on inside our code so inside my
new document I'm going to go ahead and
create the PHP tags so we have a opening
tag now I'll get asked quite often
because usually when I have a pure PHP
file like this one I don't put in the
closing tags and that's because since we
only have PHP code inside this file it's
just a common habit of programmers to
just leave out the closing tag since the
only thing this one does is that close
off the PHP code and then allow for us
to write other code afterwards now since
this is a pure PHP file I'm just going
to leave this one out so inside the code
here I'm going to go ahead and first of
all include four parameters we need in
order to connect to the database which
is going to be the server name the
username the password and the database
name for our database so the first one
here is going to be a variable that says
DB server name like so and it's going to
be equal to the actual server name of
our database now I'm going to save this
just so we can get the color that we
want inside the code so I'm going to
save it inside my root folder inside a
folder called includes so I'm just going
to go ahead and right-click first create
a new folder call this one includes now
the reason I'm doing this is because
inside my main directory of my root
folder I have my index file which is an
actual page inside my website now just
to make this a little bit neat
and this is not something you have to do
it's just a common habit that I like to
do inside my websites is that I like to
create a folder called something like
includes or additional files of
something that has all the code inside
of it that is not seen directly inside
the website but has scripts that runs in
the background of the website so inside
my includes folder I'm going to save
this file as DPH which stands for
database Handler dot ink dot PHP and now
again I have people asking me why do I
include dot Inc inside the file name now
this is just naming okay this is just
for naming purposes this does absolutely
nothing
technically so if we were to delete the
Inc we just do like debase to PHP if you
want to does the exact same thing we can
also go ahead and write
- Inc if you wanted to you can do all
sorts of things with the naming I just
decided that dot Inc sounds better so
I'm going to say DBH studying the PHP
going to save it and now we can actually
get the colors that we want inside the
code so after we have the two double
quotes I'm going to write a semicolon
and inside the double quotes I'm going
to write the name of our server now
because right now I'm using a local host
server which is using xampp if you're
using an online server we need to change
the name but because I'm using a local
server I need to write localhost so if
you guys are following the exact you
know same exact program that we used to
actually get the server running then you
also need to write localhost now the
next name is going to be the database
username so I'm going to say DB offer so
we need to create a variable called DB
username and this one if you're using
xampp is going to be equal to groups Roo
T now this would only be changed if you
are an online server because you will
have a different user name for your
database this would also be teams if you
by yourself actually change the username
and the password inside your local host
database so as a default xampp is going
to be root
inside the next variable which is going
to be variable DB password I'm going to
set a password equal to nothing now that
it again is a default inside xampp that
when you installed as a default is going
to have no password if you created a
password inside XM when you installed it
then you need to change it if you are
using an online server you also need to
change the password inside the actual
Kobo writing here so you need to include
the proper password for your online
database inside the next line we're
going to include the database name so
I'm going to say we have a variable
called DB name which is equal to double
quotes semicolon and inside the double
quotes I'm going to write the name of
our database now in my case I decided to
create a database called login system
because in a couple of episodes from now
we will be talking about how to create a
login system from scratch using PHP code
so I'm going to call my database login
system and again you can call whatever
you want it depends on what you created
inside your database inside PHP myadmin
okay now that we have the four
parameters we need to actually get the
database connection running I'm going to
include a variable called con which
stands for connection it's going to be
equal to a PHP function called my sqli
underscore connects parenthesis
semicolon and inside the parentheses we
need four parameters and guess what we
just include those four parameters up
here so we can just put them inside the
parenthesis I'm just going to paste in
first of all the server name the
username the password and a database
name now the reason we decided to write
the variables in this order up here is
because that's the order that you need
to include them inside to connect
parentheses down here so we need to have
the server name first then a user name
then the password and then the database
name okay so now that we have this we
can actually go ahead
create the actual connection to this
file inside for example our index file
now typically we would actually include
the connection inside some kind of PSP
scripts that needs to access the
database to for example insert a pull
out data from the database but just to
show you guys how to actually get and
you know this access to the database
using this file I'm going to use the
index file so let's say I have some PHP
code inside my body tag down here where
we need to select data from the database
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
include the database connection at the
very top so I'm going to say we open up
the PHP tags and then I'm going to write
include on the score once single quotes
semicolon and then I'm just going to go
ahead and include the path to this file
so I'm going to say it's inside a
includes folder because that's the way I
decided to do it forward slash and then
I'm going to say DB X dot Inc dot JSP so
now we have access to the variable up
here called variable con which is the
connection to a database so if I were to
actually connect to the database inside
my PHP code in the later episodes you
know a couple episodes from now when our
server guys have to pull out our insert
data directly from the website if you
want to access the database we just need
to refer to variable con inside our code
so that's the way we actually connect to
the database and this file here is
everything we need to actually do that
so we guys injoyed in the next episode
we'll talk about how to actually show
data from a database directly from our
website so if you guys enjoyed and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
