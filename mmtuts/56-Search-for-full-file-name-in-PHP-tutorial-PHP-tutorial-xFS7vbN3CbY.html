the entire name of a file inside a
website root folder in case we don't
know the entire name of the file or
maybe we don't know the extension of it
so an example of this could be let's say
we have a website where we allow users
to upload images to it now because you
might not know the user name or maybe
the extension of the file that they
uploaded such as JPEGs or PNG images
then we can pinpoint the file even
though we don't know the extension of it
so the way I'm going to do this is I'm
going to continue this off the previous
episode where I showed you guys how to
delete files from a website now in case
you guys didn't follow the previous
episode I'm going to go ahead and leave
a link in the description where guys can
download the files that I have in front
of me here or you can just go ahead and
follow this because it's very simple
what we're going to do so based off the
example we did in the previous episode
as you guys can see we have a very basic
form inside our front page with a button
in it that goes into a root folder and
deletes a file so right now the file
that gets deleted is the one we have
inside our uploads folder inside the
root folder called cat the jpg so in
order to delete this image here when we
don't know the extension we need to go
into the script that actually goes in
and deletes the file that I have right
here now right now as you guys can see I
have a path to the image and then I
simply run the function that actually
goes in and deletes the file now what we
need to do before we actually delete the
file is we need to go ahead and search
for a file that has a certain string
inside its name so right now up here in
the path what we actually know if you
don't know the extension would be cat
something so it's inside the uploads
folder called cat something and what we
can do here is we can actually go ahead
and say okay well we don't know what
comes after cat so what we can do here
is we can go ahead and write
multiplication or the star symbol which
means that right now we know that the
stringer has uploads forward slash cat
something which is what the star symbol
means and then we can go ahead and do a
function called glop
now the glob function inside PHP goes
into your path and searches for every
single file that has this specific
string inside the name and prints them
out inside an array so if you have more
than one file with this name inside of
it then you're going to have more
results than one so we can do here
inside the next line is we can go ahead
and say
variable file info and set it equal to
glob parentheses and then inside the
glob we're going to go ahead and include
the path to the file that we want to
find so if I were to do this and
actually go ahead and print our what we
have here that's actually just going to
comment out what we have down here so we
don't get anything is we can go and see
what happens when we do actually use the
glob function so I can say print our
like so and say we have the file info
variable which we want to print out
inside our screen so we're to refresh
delete the file you guys can see the
right now we have an array down here
that has the first piece of data which
is equal to uploads forward slash cat
the jpg so right now it's actually
finding the right file now let's say we
have more than one image with this
specific string inside the name just to
show you guys I can go ahead copy this
image that I have here so not right now
it's called cat - if I were to go ahead
and go back refresh you guys can see we
now get two different data inside the
array one is called Catlett jpg and one
is called cat to the jpg and that's
because it's getting all the information
from our folder while these all the
files with this specific string inside
its name so now we can get all the
different information like these all the
files out they want to get so now that
we know this we can actually go back
inside our folder is we can go ahead and
delete the print our and write a new
variable called file actual name and set
it equal to the file info we have up
here but we have to make sure we get the
correct array data which means we have
to add brackets and include a cero in
between it because right now what we
want to get is the first data which in
this case is uploads cat the JPEG which
has to name a cero so we're going to go
and refer to that one so now we should
get the entire path name to it so we
were to go back down and uncomment my if
statement here and instead a variable
path I'm going to go and say file actual
name so now if I go back into my website
as you guys can see right now we do
actually have the cat image in here if I
delete the second one too so we have one
if I were to run this function here at
least the script as you guys can see we
now get delete success and if I go
inside my folder the CAD image has been
deleted so this is how we can get the
entire name of a specific file so this
is basically what the glob function does
inside PHP and this was just to show you
guys how you could search for files
inside a root folder using a PHP
function that would actually go in and
search for any kind of file they had
that specific name inside its name so if
you don't have to full name the file you
can just search for part of the name so
you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
