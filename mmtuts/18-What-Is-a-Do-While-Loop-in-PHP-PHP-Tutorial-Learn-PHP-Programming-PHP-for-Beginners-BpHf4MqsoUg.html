about loops inside PHP and as you guys
can see we're going to talk about
something called a do-while loop in this
episode now I still have my code here
from the last episode
where we basically had a variable called
X which is equal to 1 and then we have a
while loop down here that says while
this statement in here is true then it's
going to do whatever is down here so in
this episode like I said we're going to
talk about a do-while loop which is a
little bit different than a while loop
so in order to explain it let's actually
go ahead and write one out I'm going to
go ahead and go on till my while loop
and I'm going to write do curly brackets
and I'm going to take all the code we
have down here inside the wild brackets
down here I'm going to copy it and
delete it and paste it inside my do
statements now I'm going to take the
curly brackets from a while loop delete
them and instead I'm going to write
semicolon after the parentheses end so
this is how a do-while loop looks like
and you might be asking what is the
difference between a do-while loop and a
while loop well in a while loop is not
going to write anything in the screen
unless the condition in here is true a
do-while loop is always going to write
whatever's in here once even if that
statement down here is not true it's
always going to write this once and then
afterwards that one time it's going to
start looking at the while loop
meaning that right now if I were to
actually go ahead and say you know X is
equal to 10 instead of 1 it's actually
not true to the while loop meaning that
if I just had a while loop it would
actually not write anything on the
screen because you know the statement is
not true in here but if I do actually
save this go into my browser you guys
can see it says hi there and that's
because it will always write out this
statement once and then check if this
statement is true now if I do actually
go ahead and write that X is equal to 1
instead it's going to go and write this
out five times so let's actually go
ahead and go in here refresh and you
guys will see says hi there how are they
high day or five times and that's
because our while statement is true
until it hits five so that's the basic
difference between do-while loops and a
while loop there's not a lot of
difference like I said the only
difference is real
that we just always echo out this
statement here once before we start
checking for the statement inside the
wire loop so we guys enjoyed this
episode and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
