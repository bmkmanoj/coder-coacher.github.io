and data inside our websites without
having to refresh the browser first and
we're going to do this using Ajax and as
you guys can see in front of me here
have a very basic example of what
exactly a Tex can do inside a website so
what do you guys see in front of you is
a very basic comment field now right now
there's nothing to comment on it could
be a post or a video but right now we
have a comment field with two posts one
is by Daniel and one is by John and
let's say I have a thousand comments to
this whatever I'm posting on in here now
instead of showing a thousand comments
when you insert a page which would
actually take up a lot of resources each
time you have to load the page because a
thousand comments is a thousand comments
we can limit the comments by saying we
only want to show two of the comments
and then if the user wanted to we can
actually show more comments by clicking
a button now this is something we can
actually do without using Ajax but if I
were to do without a text we would have
to refresh the browser each time click
the button meaning that if it were to
load a hundred post I would have to
scroll back down to the comments each
time I click the button because it
refreshes the browser and takes me back
to the top each time so Ajax allow for
you to do this without having to refresh
the browser each time which is a very
cool feature to have inside programming
so this is what we're going to learn how
to do today using the jquery function
called load which allow us to do this
now this example that I'm serving you
guys here if I were to actually click
the button you guys can see I'm actually
loading in more posts and I'm not going
to get taken back to the top each time I
click the button which is what we want
to do now this example here we're not
going to build today we're going to do
that in the next episode because it
involves using PHP code and since you
don't have to use PHP code to use the
load function inside key Acree
I'm going to go ahead and show you guys
without using PHP code and databases
first and then afterwards in the next
episode we're going to do it using
databases because the thing a lot of you
guys came here to learn how to do this
using databases so if I were to go
inside my coding document you guys can
see a very basic HTML 5 set up and what
we're going to do in here is we're going
to go ahead and include a div box down
in the body tags that has some content
in it
then when we click a certain button
we're going to go and load in some new
data or some new content and put it
inside this dip box here so let's start
out by creating a dip box so we can
actually show you guys the load feature
inside 8 X and inside this dip box I'm
going to going to include a paragraph
tag I'm going to say this is the first
content like so and we're going to go
and get this div and ID so we can
pinpoint it using 8 X so we're going to
say we have an ID which is equal to
tests just to give it something I'm
going to save it then I'm going to go up
inside my script tags which are decided
to include inside my head tags so we
need to make sure we include a function
that only allow for us to load the
script tag last when we load the page
because of the lights all the jQuery
code is going to get loaded first we
don't want to do that want to load it
last so in order to load it last we're
going to going to include a selector
since our jQuery and inside the selector
we're going to go ahead and choose the
document were inside of right now come
on state document dot ready parentheses
semicolon and then whatever goes inside
the parentheses is only going to get
loaded after the entire website has
actually loaded so we're going to say we
have a function in here that it's going
to get run when we actually have the
entire website loaded and inside this
function we're going to go include all
the jQuery code we're going to have
inside our website so the first thing
we're going to do in here so I'm going
to consider gasps the exact jQuery
function that allow us to use HX and get
data from the server and insert it
inside somewhere inside our website so
the way we do that is we want to going
to include a selector we're going to go
and choose the exact place they want to
insert the new data from where we get it
from so I'm going to go ahead and say
we're going to insert it inside this div
down here called ID test so we want to
say hashtag test and afterwards once a
dogs load now inside the jQuery load
function which is using a tanks we have
three different parameters we can use
one is the URL who needs to point to the
actual path you know to the file we want
to load in the second one is going to be
data we want to include
when we want to send a request for the
new data that we want to load in and the
third parameter is a callback which
allow for us to do something once it's
done loading in some kind of data now
right now we haven't actually set some
kind of events before we load in the
content because right now for were to
just run this thing then we would never
actually see this text down here because
it's just going to load as soon as the
document has loaded so what we're going
to do is we're going to go and include a
button and I'm just going to go ahead
and go beneath my div down here now do
pay attention to not include any kind of
button inside the div tags because
everything inside this div tag here it's
going to get replaced once we do
actually click the button so the button
needs to be below the actual div tags
now inside the button I'm going to
include some text I'm just going to say
click to change or to use Ajax or
something cool and I'm going to go and
get this button on i.t so we're going to
say we have an ID set to BTN
so button then I'm going to go back to
the top and then before to jQuery a text
function down here I'm going to go and
say we have a selector that selects the
button but saying we have an ID called
BTN then we want to say dot click
parentheses to include a click events
and then inside the parentheses we're
going to go and say we want to run a
function once we click this button down
there so I'm going to say we have a
function parentheses curly brackets and
then we want to insert the load function
with jQuery inside this event like so so
now we basically need to fill in the
parameters inside the load function here
but before we do that we need to
actually have something to insert inside
our div down here so I'm going to go to
no come up in your documents and I'm
going to go and save it as some type of
document we can do a HTML document we
can do a text document we can do a PHP
document we can do all sorts of
documents that we want to insert inside
the div tags so in my case I'm just
going to create a very basic text
document so I'm going to call this one
data dot text txt and I'm going to go
and save it inside my root folder now
inside this document I'm going to go and
create maybe something like
a new paragraph so we're going to say we
have a pee tag and inside the P tag we
have something like this is the new data
it's going to mason mark we're going to
close the P tags again like so I'm going
to save it and I'm going to go and put
back inside my index file because inside
the load function inside geekery we need
to tell it the URL to the actual file
they want to insert which is data to
text so we're going to go and say double
quotes inside the first parameter and
say we have a data dot txt and this is
basically all we need to do to actually
load in the data but just to let you
guys know we do I have two more
parameters we could include if you
wanted to and in the next episode we
will actually be using one of these
parameters but for now this is basically
all we need to do in order to load end
data inside our website now there's one
more thing we need to do before we can
actually get this working because right
now if we were to go back inside my
website and actually click the button we
just included you guys can see that
nothing happens inside the browser and
that is because right now I didn't
actually include a curry inside my code
so we need to go in and download jQuery
first what is link to it using a CDN so
I'm going to go and go into jQuery dot
come and inside taker comm I'm going to
go and say download jQuery
I'm going to scroll down and use a CDN
which is basically just that we load in
the bakery code from online without
having to download the entire Taylor
library so I'm just going to go and use
the CDN and down here what does actually
say using Diego with the CDN there's a
button that takes us into code jQuery
comm I'm going to go and get the
minified version of the latest one so
I'm going to click it then I'm going to
copy the code and include it inside my
head tags that has to cover just wrote
in here I'm just going to include the
script tags right here which is the link
to the actual jQuery this will make so
it looks nice like so and like so so now
this would actually be working so we'll
go back inside my browser now we loaded
n ta karae so it would actually use
k-crew down here to load a text
the rewards I don't go inside our file
refresh you guys can see when I do
actually click the button it changes to
the new data now before we end off the
episode I want to sort of guys the last
two parameters we have inside the load
function inside jQuery so if we were to
go back down inside our code and go
inside our load function down here you
guys to notice that the first parameter
like I said is ul to the actual file
then the second parameter by writing a
comment it's going to be some kind of
data we want to include inside when we
load the data inside the txt file now if
you know about basic HTML forms you'll
know that we have something called the
post method and a get method so when we
do actually you know click Submit or
something inside a form inside a website
then we send a post or get method to a
certain file which means that it passes
some data to the file which then means
we can use the data inside the next
documents so this down here is basic the
same thing when we do actually have the
second parameter we load in data using a
post method to the next file which in
this case is beta txt so if it were to
include some data in here and go ahead
and write curly brackets and then say we
have the first data called I don't know
let's call data one meaning that when
you get the post method is going to be
called data one call one and then equal
to whatever needs to be equal to so
right now I could say that theta one is
equal to Daniel which is a name we could
actually change this to name and then
ask words if I want to include more data
and go and say comment space the last
name Col one Nilsen if I wanted to I can
also move this down to next time to make
sure it looks a bit nicer like so and
like so so now we have two pieces of
data inside a string they want to pass
on to the data duck txt document so we
can actually get the data either using
JavaScript or PHP so we can actually do
something with it so if you want to pass
data you can do it this way now the last
parameter we have is something called a
callback
now the callback like I mentioned is a
piece of code that we want to run once
it's done loading this load function
here so which they want to have a
function
and inside this function that we do
actually run once it's done loading the
text in we want to alert something
inside the browser so I'm going to say
alerts and I want to alert hi there like
so if we were to save this going to stop
my browser now the second parameter to
be included inside our load function is
not going to do anything we can actually
see inside the browser because it's only
going to pass on data to the data txt
document created and because not doing
anything with the data inside that
document we're not going to do anything
inside the browser here but the third
parameter which is the callback is going
to do something once we click the button
it's actually going to show us a message
inside the browser so if we were to
click we get some kind of confirmation
that the load function did actually run
inside our browser then I can click OK
and you guys can see that the data
changes inside our website so this is
basically have a component data from a
server hope you guys enjoyed I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
