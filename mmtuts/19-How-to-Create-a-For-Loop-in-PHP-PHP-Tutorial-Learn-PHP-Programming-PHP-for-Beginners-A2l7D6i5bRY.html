something called a for loop inside PHP
and a for loop is a little bit different
than a while loop which we then actually
talked about in the past two episodes
because in a while loop we don't know
how many times we're going to loop
something out but in a for loop we know
exactly how many times we're going to
loop something beforehand so to give you
guys an example of a for loop let's
actually go ahead and write one out I'm
going to say for parentheses curly
brackets now in a while loop inside the
parentheses we're just going to put in a
condition that needs to be true in order
for to keep looping something out now in
a for loop we're going to put three
different parameters inside the
parentheses which are going to tell us
how many times you need to loop
something so the first parameter we're
going to put inside the parentheses is
something called an initializing counter
which basically tells the loop where it
needs to start so inside the parentheses
we're going to put in the first
parameter which is going to be a
variable I'm going to go ahead and call
this one X you guys can call whatever
you want and we need to set it equal to
something now I'm just going to put it
equal to zero because that's just a
typical habit to do when you do examples
and I'm going to go ahead and separate
this one from the last parameters by a
semicolon so basically what we're saying
is that okay we need to loop something
and we need to start at zero now the
next one is going to tell us when to
stop looping so inside the second
parameter we're going to go and set
variable X lesser than or equal to ten
so now we're saying okay we start at
zero and once you reach lesser than or
equal to ten then you need to stop
looping because like we talked about in
the past couple of episodes if you have
an infinite loop you might end up
crashing your browser so we want to make
sure that the loop actually stops at
some point so the last parameter we're
going to put in here is basically what
tells us or like tells the loop how many
times you need to increase each time you
loop something out now I'm going to go
ahead and set this one as variable X
plus plus which means to just add one
more each time we're done looping we
could also say plus three if you want to
but we're just going to go to news plus
plus because that means incrementing by
one now I'm going to go ahead and put an
echo inside my actual loop in here I'm
going to put it as
I'm going to put it as a string I'm
going to set it to high then I'm going
to add a break just so we can see go to
the next line and I'm going to end it
off with a semicolon of course so after
we put this in here we can actually go
to our browser refresh and you guys will
see we get high high high high high
until reach 10 I think let's see if we
actually do have ten get five we do
actually have eleven because we did
actually start at zero meaning that it's
going to read you know it's going to
count zero and then till 10 which is 11
so we did actually loop something out 11
times we could change this to 9 if you
want to to do about 10 times or we can
just set X equal to 1 if you want to
loop out nine times so as you guys can
see we get 10 loops not not 9 like I
said so this is the basic idea behind a
for loop which allows for us to actually
tell it beforehand how many times we
want to loop something now of course X
can always be changed by the user at
some point but the basic idea here is
that we can you know provide these
different statements in here where we
decide how many times you need to
increase or what the limit is for this X
so if the user types in X is equal to 2
then 2 is of course going to be you know
counting out less loops than 1 so this
is basically what I wanted to talk about
in this episode for the next episode
we're going to talk about something
called the for each loop so I hope you
guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys next
