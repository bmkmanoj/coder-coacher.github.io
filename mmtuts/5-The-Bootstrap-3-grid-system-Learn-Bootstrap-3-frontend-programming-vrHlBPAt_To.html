set up the content inside a bootstrap
website in the previous episode we
talked about how to get into the
developer tool and view the website as a
cell phone or a tablet if we needed to
see it like that so today we're going to
talk about the grid system we have
inside bootstrap which is used for
actually setting up the content inside
our website so what we're gonna do is
based off the not the previous lesson
but the one before we're gonna go ahead
and add more content inside the body tag
of our website so down inside our body
tag where we created a container called
fluid or container fluid which means
that we have all the content going from
the left side of the browser to the
right side without including our content
inside a wrapper we can actually go
ahead and go underneath the paragraph
tag we created in here and start setting
up this section for our website now when
it comes to bootstrap you have a class
called row which we use inside our
container fluid or inside our container
class in order to divide up the content
we have inside you know our actual
website so if I were to go inside the
container fluid div tag and say okay I
have a section inside my website that
needs to be split up into three parts
what I can do then is I can go ahead and
create another div box now this dip box
is going to have a class called row
inside the row class we're going to go
ahead and add a couple more divs and
this is because like I said I wanted to
divide up the content into three
different parts now when I do this we're
going to go and add a specific class to
each of these divs and these in this
case into one three divs I'm gonna go
ahead and add just three of them like so
and inside these divs I'm gonna go ahead
and give them a class now the class name
is going to be Col which stands for
column I'm gonna say - and then we need
to decide which specific device we want
to optimize this specific section for so
let's say I want to view this website
inside a tablet then we can actually
make the content move instead of just
resizing - left and right we can
activate the content go underneath each
other automatically by telling it which
device we wanted to start jumping around
for when we get to that device so let's
say I have a tablet and I say okay well
the tablet screen is quite small so once
I view this website on a tablet at least
a section here
then I want the content to go underneath
each other instead of next to each other
because it makes sense on a tablet now
when it comes to these devices we have
different keywords for each device for
phones is called XS for tablets is SM
for desktops is MD and for larger
desktop such as you know much bigger
screens we can do LT so just to give an
example here let's actually go ahead and
optimized for tablet so we're gonna go
and write SM - and then we need to tell
the code that we're actually dividing up
into three parts inside this little
section here meaning that we want you
know a grid system that goes equally
three across so we need to make sure we
take the number 12 and divide by 3
meaning that we're gonna go ahead and
get 4 inside each of these classes here
so 4 plus 4 plus 4 equals 12
because inside bootstrap we have 12
grids going across so if you want to
divide these up into equal sections then
of course each section across is going
to be for grids so this is how we can
divide up the section inside our website
if I were to add some content to this
like adding some text I can go ahead and
say this is the left side I can actually
go ahead and copy this and paste it
inside these are the two and then we can
say this is the center let's go ahead
into the each side and this is the right
side so if I were to go ahead and save
this and go inside my browser so you
guys can see that now we have three
pieces of content going horizontally
inside this website if I were to give
these a background color this actually
go ahead and do that so I'm gonna go to
add a stylesheet so I'm just gonna go
and save this inside my bootstrap root
folder gonna say style dot CSS I'm gonna
go ahead and say we have a class called
content 1 - left curly brackets I'm
gonna go ahead and say background color
is going to be red then we're gonna go
and copy this class two more times
because you have three different pieces
of content going horizontally I'm gonna
call this on center
and the last one is going to be right
then we're going to change the color to
green and purple
I'm gonna go ahead and save this and I'm
gonna go ahead and add the actual
stylesheet inside or index file so I'm
gonna go ahead and go to top here right
underneath where we have our meta tags
I'm gonna say link I'm gonna go and
linked to a style sheet again you guys
know how to create this link to a style
to it by now so I'm just gonna gonna do
really quickly like so and what we can
do now is we can actually go to add
these classes we just created inside
this talented to each section so we can
actually see them so I'm gonna go ahead
and say we call this one content one
left like so just gonna copy it so it's
much faster I say Center and right so
now I should actually see the background
color of this constant here so as you
guys can see you know how grid system
going three across now you might be
asking well you know right now it's
actually quite small it's not very tall
at all we want to have content let's say
I want to have a background color inside
a much bigger section with the text
being centered in the middle of the
actual box and I want this to be some
kind of link going somewhere else on the
website well what we could actually do
is we can go ahead and change the
styling of these you know contents these
boxes we have inside the grid system so
I could actually just go ahead and add a
height and say we want to have it 400
pixels as an example I'll go back inside
the website you guys will see we now
have much bigger grid systems so we can
actually put constant inside these boxes
here of course right now doesn't look
very pretty but once we do actually have
let's say a really nice background
picture maybe three different background
pictures that goes well together we
could have an inside each of these we
could have the tech center it may be a
little icon or something then we get
something that looks more like a website
now the next thing that I want to circus
is regarding the class that we gave the
columns right now with the DAX you set
it to SM which means the right now
actually optimizing for tablets meaning
that all the content inside the website
is gonna jump underneath each other when
we hit that tablet with so if we were to
actually go inside my browser and resize
it so we can actually see it right now
we're still in desktop mode but if I
size it down just slightly you guys will
notice that all the content is jumping
underneath each other which is what we
want when we're inside a tablet
so if I were to resize it up just
slightly till we're not inside tablet
mode anymore then go inside my code
again and change this to the desktop
optimization we're gonna say MD instead
I'm gonna resize my browser and what you
guys will notice is that all the content
jumps underneath each other again
because right now we said that okay and
we hit the desktop mode then we want the
content to look like like this again
okay so right now we do X I need to get
much more beyond a regular monitor
inside a desktop I do actually sit on a
2k monitor right now so I can actually
resize it out to a point where you know
inside a larger desktop so now that we
know this we can actually go ahead and
mess around with the number here just to
show you guys before we end off the
episode because if I were to delete the
middle one like so right now this is not
going to be good because we need to make
sure that these numbers here add up to
12 and right now it only adds up to 8 so
if I were to do it this way I would
either need to change these two sixes
since 6 plus 6 is 12 and then would
actually get a different type of layout
where it's going to be 5050 or we can
actually go ahead and say well let's
actually change this one to three and
then what I can do is change this to a
nine so now we get a different layout
because 9 plus 3 is actually 12 so this
is okay but if I go and refresh the
browser you guys will notice that now we
get a different proportion so now this
one is going to be three grits and this
is going to be nine grits so this is how
we can mess around with the layout
inside bootstrap I hope this was
something you guys fun useful and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
