something called data types inside the
other script I'm going to learn about
five different data types we have in
here
at least for now a data type is
basically when we have some kind of
information and depending what type of
information it is is going to have a
different data type so I'm going to go
ahead and create a variable here I could
learn about in the last episode called
person and set it equal to something now
I'm going to go and set this equal to a
string to start out with which is a data
type by writing double quotes and inside
the double quotes I can write some text
now when you use double quotes is called
a string and as you guys can see inside
my editor at least it turns yellow which
means that right now it's seen as plain
text now I can also go ahead and write a
number in here if I want to which is
still going to be seen as number one but
the data type is a string if I want to
create a number data type I'm just going
to go and write 1 or 2 or whatever I
want to write in here some kind of
number and this is going to make the
browser see this as a number data type
and not as a string ok and the
differences between using you know
simple numbers or a string like so
depends on what kind of function you're
creating so you might want to create a
string at some point or a number so it
depends on the purpose of it now the
third piece of data we're going to talk
about is something called an array so I
can actually create an array by writing
a size to go ahead and keep a variable
person here
I can write brackets which is the one
without the Curly's that we might know
from CSS and then I'm going to go ahead
and write some kind of string in here so
I'm going to say Daniel because this is
person I should actually change this to
persons' because we create an array we
can store different types of information
inside one variable so right now I have
Daniel I have leads there and I might
have Susie which should be a string
there we go
could also store something called a
number data type if I wanted to without
the the quotation marks now basically
what this does is that it allows for us
to create different types of data inside
one variable which can be useful for
creating something like a loop which we
haven't actually talked about yet but
later on you might want to store
different data types let's say you have
a person who writes different types of
information you know more than one piece
of information and submitting it to your
website and you want to save it inside
you know a variable then you can do it
this way to store many different types
of information inside one variable
instead of having created three
different variables for each person
which is going to lessen your code and
also be more useful for you now the
fourth data type we're going to talk
about is something called an object
we're going to get more into objects
later but for now I just want to show
you guys what an object is so you guys
have a basic understanding of it and
when it comes to objects you can also
store many informations inside one
variable but the difference here is that
we actually have something called
properties and a value so if I want to
go ahead and delete this array which was
with the brackets I can actually go and
use curly brackets open and close it and
inside the curly brackets we can start
up by saying okay we have a person which
is the object so right now we're
actually creating an object called
persons and well that's actually change
that the person and this one person has
different types of properties let's say
it's me we're talking about
my name is well just a pro right name
which is the first property and the
value of my name is Daniel do you notice
that I use the string which is a data
type and after we have this one property
which is the name which is Daniel
because that's my name I can write comma
and say okay another property of me
could be my age
and that one could be equal to 25
because that's what I am right now and
then can add another property which
could be my book couldn't really be my
height because I don't actually know my
height but we could say number of legs
because I know I do actually have two
legs there we go and this is a basic way
we can store properties to a object and
actually have different you know have
the properties equal to something and
this is something I'm going to use a
little bit later on when we have
something slightly more complicated and
what we learned in the beginning here so
for now this is what I want to talk
about when it comes to data types and
the last couple of two examples here
with arrays and objects like I said
we're not going to be using them in the
beginning here but slightly later we
will be using them so we guys enjoyed
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
