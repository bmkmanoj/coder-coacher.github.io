something called scopes with India the
script when it comes to scopes we
basically have two different types you
have a global scope and we have a local
scope now to give you guys an idea about
what exactly a scope is I'm gonna go
ahead and make an example for your
gangster can actually see it and as you
guys can see I do have a very basic
website here I just have a script tag
inside the body tag there's nothing
special here and inside my script tags I
have a function now right now the
function is empty there's nothing inside
of it so if were to actually go ahead
and you know use the function and write
it out inside the website you guys can
see when i refresh there's nothing now
if I were to say okay what if I have a
variable outside dysfunction I'm gonna
declare it with BA and I'm gonna go
ahead and call this one person when I
set it equal to my name just so we have
something to spit out now if I were to
take this variable and use it inside my
function I can do that because this
variable is outside in the global scope
now what that means is that it's outside
a function and can be used by any kind
of script we might be writing with
JavaScript so forward to actually go
inside my function say documents dot
rights parentheses which simply writes
out something inside the browser I'm
gonna go ahead and say I want to write
out the variable called person so if I
go ahead and save this refresh you guys
can see it says Daniel now because the
variable is outside in a global scope
like I said we can use it inside a
function but what if I were to take this
variable and put it inside my function
now it's inside the local scope of this
function here meaning that this function
can actually use this variable if I were
to refresh my browser you guys can see
if still says Daniel because this
function can use Daniel but let's say we
go down and delete the function as you
guys can see i refresh the website we
don't get anything because we're not
actually calling on the function if I
were to go down here and just simply say
document right
person which is the variable we have
inside the local scope if I were to save
this you guys can see we get nothing and
that's because our variables inside the
local scope of this function here so we
can't actually use it down here okay so
that's the basic idea behind local and
global scopes you need to make sure that
if you want to create variables that you
want to use in multiple functions you
need to have it outside in a global
scope if you have a variable or some
kind of data that you only want to use
inside a certain function then you can
create it inside the local scope like
we've done here okay hope you guys
enjoyed this episode and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
