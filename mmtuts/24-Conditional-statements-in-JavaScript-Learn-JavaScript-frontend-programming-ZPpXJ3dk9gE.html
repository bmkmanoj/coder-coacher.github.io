something called conditional statements
inside JavaScript and conditional
statements is something used very often
inside the Alpha script whenever we want
to build some kinda application that we
want to show inside a website so you
will need to learn about conditional
statements at some point so the way
conditional statements work is that we
have some kind of statement that has to
be true in order for the JavaScript to
run a specific blogger code so to give
you guys an example here I built a very
basic html5 set up I have a paragraph
tag that has an ideas test and inside my
script tags I'm gonna go ahead and say
that we have a variable called X which
is equal to five so now that we set
variable X equal to five I can go and go
underneath the variable and I can start
writing a conditional statement so I'm
going to go ahead and say if which is
actually one of the three conditional
statements we're going to talk about
today we also have something called the
switz we're going to talk about in the
next episode so we're just going to
stick with the three first ones so we're
gonna say if parentheses curly brackets
which means that right now I'm checking
if whatever's inside the parentheses is
true then it needs to run whatever's
inside the curly brackets so inside the
curly brackets I can actually go ahead
and say document dot get element by ID
parentheses and inside the parentheses
I'm gonna go ahead and say if you want
to get test which is the paragraph you
have up here dot inner HTML which is
equal to a string called it works like
so so right now if whatever is inside
the parentheses is true it's gonna go
and print out it works inside the
browser which right now as you guys can
see we have nothing in here if I go back
inside my code I can go inside the
parentheses and I can say well if X is
equal to two then we can go ahead and
write it works inside the browser but
because right now X is not equal to two
it's equal to five if I go inside the
browser as you guys can see
you get nothing if I go back inside my
code and change this to 5 which right
now as you guys can see it is equal to 5
you guys can see we get it works so this
is the basic idea behind a conditional
statement with basic to just go in and
say well if this is true then we're
going to go ahead and write whatever's
inside the curly brackets now of course
right now this is a very simple example
we could also go in and check the time
we talked about the time format in one
of the previous episodes we could
actually go in and check the amount of
seconds that we have since 1970 and say
well if the date right now is past a
specific date then it's a right
something inside the browser for example
so this is the first conditional
statement we have inside JavaScript
called if now of course sometimes you
want to check more than one statement
what if I want to check well if this is
equal to one then I want to write
instead of it works I want to say it is
one now if I have another statement that
needs to change according to whatever
the value is I can go ahead and say well
we also have something called a else if
parentheses
currently brackets so right now I'm not
checking if this appears true I'm also
checking if whatever's inside the
parentheses down here is true so I can
actually go ahead and copy what we have
up here paste it in and say if X is
equal to two then we want to write
whatever is down here which is the
document get element by ID but instead
of saying it is 1 I want to say it is 2
so if I were to go up and change X to 2
you guys can see the right now it's at
the browser it says it is 2 so basically
what it's doing here is at first goes
down to the if statement and text is
this actually true because X is not
equal to 1 it's gonna go and ignore this
block of code and go down to the next
one so right now it's taking is it equal
to 2 then it's gonna go and print this
code if X is equal to 2 now of course
right now let's say we have some kind of
user input from a website and the user
decide to type something that we don't
have inside one of these statements here
let's say they said
forty-eight thousand nine hundred thirty
eight which is you know we're not gonna
make you know fifty thousand different
statements down here because we don't
want to take for each individual
statement so what we can do instead is
we can go ahead and write something
called an else statement which is also a
conditional statement so we're gonna
write else curly brackets and then
whatever is not equal to one of these
statements is going to run inside the
else statement so I'm gonna go to copy
the block code here paste it inside and
say it is something else
now if I were to go inside the browser
refresh you guys can see it says it is
something else because it's not equal to
one of these two statements here so one
thing you guys need to know about
conditional statements is that when we
have an if statement we basically start
up a conditional statement line of code
and when you write a else if statement
afterwards which you don't have to but
you can if you want to we could
basically just remove this else if
statement so right now it's just gonna
run the else statement if the if
statement is not true it really depends
on how you want to make it but one thing
that's important for you guys to know is
that right now when you start up an if
statement it's gonna go ahead and start
up a series of checks which means that
when we have an else if statement right
after the if statement is going to go
and see these two as a connected unit so
if this is not true it's just gonna go
ahead and jump to the next one if the
else if statement is not true it's gonna
run to the else statements so these all
connected right now so what we can also
do here just to show you guys is we can
actually go ahead and copy the else if
statement we have here remember the if
statement is always the first statement
whenever we have a second statement or a
third one or fourth one we need to
create an else if statement so for were
to go past the else if statement here
and just paste in another else if
statement I can go and change this one
to three like so and right now it's just
going go ahead and run these one by one
until it hits one of these that are
actually true so right now this is not
true this is not true this is not true
hey we have one here called else which
is a
true because it's just gonna go and run
if one of these are not true okay so
this is how conditional statements work
and the reason I was out to do this one
is because it's very important we know
about these sort of statements when we
start doing any kind of exercise the
reason we haven't done any exercises so
far inside this series here is because
we practically used if-else or else if
statements in a lot of applications so
we need to know about these first so I
hope you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
