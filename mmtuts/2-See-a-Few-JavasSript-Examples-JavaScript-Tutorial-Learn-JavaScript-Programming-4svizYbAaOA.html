couple examples of how we can actually
use JavaScript inside websites and as
you guys can see I made a small demo
just to kind of demonstrate at least
three different ways we can use
javascript now do bear in mind that
there's so many ways you can create
stuff on website with JavaScript and
this is just three of the different ways
that you could possibly use it so just
to give you guys a feeling about what
exactly it can do I decided to make this
small demo for you now we will not be
learning in this episode how to actually
create this stuff but like I said it's
just to give you guys a feeling of what
we can actually do with it now in later
episodes we will learn how to do this
stuff but not right now since we're
still pretty early on in the process of
learning how to do JavaScript so the
first thing I want to show you guys is
that I made this small interactive menu
and what it basically does is that when
you click the closing button up here in
the corner it actually closes the menu
and this is something you can see if you
go to YouTube for example you have your
small you know menu in the top where you
can actually open or close to subscribe
a list and this works in a similar way
as you guys can see also decided to move
the main content as I open and close
this menu but you don't actually have to
do that you can do whatever you want
with JavaScript I just chose to design
it in this way just because I thought
look cooler okay now the second thing I
want to show you guys is that with
JavaScript you can do stuff like adding
elements to your website so let's say
you have a portfolio like the one I made
a demo of here and you have many many
many different cases that you can show
off to people when they want to take a
look at your portfolio now sometimes it
is not good for websites if you have a
hundred different different cases that
they all load at once as well as website
is loaded so instead we can make this
thing where it only loads a couple of
them and then when you click for example
load more cases it will actually pop up
with some of the more cases you've made
in your past again just an example of
something you could do with JavaScript
now do bear in mind this is also
responsive so if I were to actually
you know resize everything you guys can
see all the elements get moved around
and that's just basic HTML styling that
has nothing to do with JavaScript now
the next thing that I want to show you
guys at least the last thing is that I
made this little input down here and
this is just a basic form that has just
one input in it and when I type inside
this input you guys can see that the
text in here actually gets rewritten or
like projected underneath the input so
we can see what we actually wrote down
here so you can say hi there and again
just a couple examples of how JavaScript
actually works this right here you
cannot do with only HTML and CSS CSS is
not that great yet that we can do this
stuff even though CSS has actually taken
over some tasks that JavaScript used to
do in the past such as hover effects and
that sort of thing you have to do it do
that with JavaScript in the past but now
I can do it with CSS but see it says
it's not that powerful
yet so stuff like this we would have to
use JavaScript for so I hope you guys
enjoyed my little demo here of how to do
a couple of things in JavaScript and I
can't stress enough that javascript is
such a powerful language that you can do
almost anything inside a website that
you wanted to and what I showed here is
some very basic examples this is just
you know small things compared to some
of the major stuff you can use
JavaScript for so I hope you guys will
enjoy the series and I will see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
