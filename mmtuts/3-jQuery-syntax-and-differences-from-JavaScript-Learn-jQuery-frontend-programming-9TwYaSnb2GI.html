syntax inside jQuery and as you guys
contained in front of me here at the
code from the previous episode we've
included Cakery inside our website so in
this episode we're going to talk about
how to taxi right to take a recode and
we're going to talk about the
differences between the jQuery code and
Java scripts so the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to show you
guys how to X include jQuery code inside
our website now there's two ways we can
do it just like in JavaScript either we
can include a couple of script tags
inside our code somewhere whether it
being inside the head tags or inside the
body tag and I can go ahead and write to
decra code directly inside the script
tags we just need to make sure that the
script X comes after the script tags up
here where we did X include to take
recode now the second way we can do it
is by including a document by opening up
a new file saving it let's say inside
our JavaScript folder which we created
in the previous episode and save this
one as something like main is you guys
can call whatever you want it just needs
to be called dot J s at the end so after
saving it we can actually write the code
inside this document here and then in
order to actually link to this file we
need to go back inside our code I'm just
going to go and delete these script tags
here and in order to actually get to
take recode inside our front page we
need to link to the file called mint
ideas so I'm going to go and save we
have a couple of script tags inside the
head tag up here and inside the script
tags we need to add a source attribute
so I'm going to say source equal to
double quotes and then we're going to
say we have a TS folder and inside the
folder we have a main dot TS
so now we're linking to the jQuery code
inside our main the J's folder now the
way we're going to do it in the future
episodes is we're actually going to go
ahead and just try to take record
directly inside our front page just
because it's easier for me to actually
write the code and show you guys at the
same time as I'm actually doing stuff
inside the front page so that's the way
I'm going to go ahead and do it in this
episode now in order to see regards to
takers syntax that's actually going to
create a paragraph tag here so I can
just give you guys an example so let's
say you have a paragraph and we have a
piece of text saying this is a paragraph
like so now using javascript and again
if you guys are not familiar with
JavaScript
jump directly into jQuery I'm just going
to go and explain this inside JavaScript
we will go ahead and write a couple of
script tags and then inside the script
tags we'll go ahead and target this
paragraph by giving the paragraph an ID
we could actually say we have an ID set
to test and then inside the script tags
we would say documents dot get element
by ID parentheses double quotes inside
the parentheses and then would actually
target dydy appear called test so
basically what I just did here is I said
we have a document and inside this
document here we have a ID inside a
certain HTML elements like the paragraph
tag up here and ID is called test so
right now just targeted this paragraph
up here then afterwards we can do
something to the settlement by writing
dot and then write do some things over
to say on click equal to function then
we can actually do something to this
paragraph once we click the paragraph so
could actually say alert then say clicks
like so so what this actually does if we
were to go inside my website here
refresh you guys can see have a
paragraph up here I'm just going to zoom
in for you guys when I click it we get
this little message here that says
clicked so this is basic JavaScript and
jQuery works the exact same way now if I
were to write the exact same thing using
jQuery justit using javascript it would
look something like this
I would exit say double sign parenthesis
dot click parenthesis semicolon this can
move the JavaScript down so you can
actually see and inside the first
parenthesis I'm going to go and say what
did we actually select inside the
website I'm going to go ahead and say we
chose an ID called test and we do that
by using the hash tag just like we do in
CSS then inside the click function here
I'm going to go and say we have a
function parentheses curly brackets move
down to the next line and then I'm just
going to do the exact same thing as we
did down here by doing the alert clicked
inside the daiquiri
and just going to leave the child script
just to show you guys that this actually
works inside the browser so I'm going to
going to refresh click it and as you
guys can see it now is clicked so doing
it the Jaykar way it's much more simple
there's a lot less code and it's very
similar to the javascript in the way
that in JavaScript when we want to
select something which is implicit
document.getelementbyid e then we
actually write the ID of the thing if we
want to select and then we have the
event handler over here
you know what the user actually needs to
do inside the website in order to do
something and then afterwards what needs
to happen when the user does something
the same thing goes with jQuery we
select something then what needs to
actually happen in order for something
else to happen and then we tell it what
needs to happen so it's the exact same
thing now when it comes to care and
JavaScript there's a couple of
differences because right now if I were
to actually include JavaScript inside a
website we need to make sure that
JavaScript loads last because it's just
a rule of thumb inside a website because
javascript usually manipulates HTML code
so we need the HTML to look first and
then the JavaScript code having said
this it means that we need to include
the JavaScript code at the very last of
the documents because a document loads
from top to bottom so we need to have it
at the ends now when it comes to taker
you can actually go ahead and include
the code inside for example the head tag
if you want to because we have a
function inside to a query that actually
allow for us to load the code after
everything else has been loaded now just
as Sarah gasps this code I'm going to go
and include it here I'm going to go and
say we have dollar sign parentheses
again just like at the bottom here just
going to make some spacing and then
we're going to go and say we have a
document dot ready parentheses semicolon
and then inside the parentheses just
like underneath here when I'm going to
include a function so I'm going to say
friend Aziz curly brackets and then
we're just going to include the TA curry
code inside this line of jQuery code up
here which basically now says that once
the document has been loaded then it
needs to go ahead and load the jQuery
code okay so connect to include this
code at the very top of our document
here right below deck to link to jQuery
because it won't actually look before
everything else so that's a
nice feature when it comes to jQuery so
now we just talked about selecting stuff
inside the website like the paragraph
down here doing something to it and then
depending on that doing something with
the jQuery inside the website like
sharing and click methods now when it
comes to Jaykar you can select a bunch
of stuff using javascript we would have
to write something like get element by
ID and then actually write the name of
the ID you want to get you know to do
something to it like we did down here
just go and delete that for now
now with Jaykar you can just go ahead
and select that these providing has tag
tests because that's the way we do it
inside CSS if it were to select a class
inside my document here can write dot
test which is a class called test if I
want to select all the paragraphs inside
our website and just write P if I wanted
to same thing goes with divs so just a
simple feature here actually makes
shaker is so powerful when it comes to
simplifying our code and making it do
things for us now when it comes to the
thing right inside the parentheses is
what we call a selector inside jQuery so
this entire thing here is a selector now
inside the selector we can do a bunch of
stuff like if we were to say we want to
select the ID called test I can say we
have a test ID and then down here I can
write another selector so I can say
dollar sign parentheses dot and if we
were to say okay now we selected the ID
called test and then if we want to do
something with this element I can say
this and then afterwards we can say for
example hide like so so now watch
actually click the paragraph called
test as an ID the paragraph would
actually hide so for to save this
refresh my browser you guys can see when
I click it it disappears so we can also
use something like this inside of you to
select something inside our website we
could also go inside to select up here
and say we want to select a paragraph
that has a class called test so you
could select any kind of paragraph with
a class called test and then do
something to it so there's a bunch of
these I'm going to go to leave a link
the description so you guys can see all
the selectors we have inside a career if
you want to but we will get more into
them later on we do actually continue
with this series here so this is
basically all I wanted to show you guys
in this episode in the next one we're
going to talk about events
which is actually the thing that we did
right here called clique parentheses so
basically event is what we actually do
two elements inside a website notice
actually do something with jQuery so
we'll learn about the different events
inside the next episode so if you guys
enjoyed not see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
