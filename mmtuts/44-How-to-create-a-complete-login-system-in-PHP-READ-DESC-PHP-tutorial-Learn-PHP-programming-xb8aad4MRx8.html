a complete login system from scratch
using PHP code I want to say a complete
login system I really do mean an entire
login system from scratch in a way that
even beginners who just started doing
PSP can follow this lesson now for your
more experienced people who want to
maybe touch up on some things or just
learn specific parts of a login system
I'm going to include chapters inside the
description of this video so you can
skip ahead to the part where you want to
learn for example PSP or the database
setup so what we're going to do today is
everything from creating the actual form
that we're going to use to actually sign
up or login inside a website using HTML
and CSS we're going to set up the
database together and we're going to go
and write the PHP code together now when
it comes to a login system just in case
you are completely new to it and maybe
you haven't really done anything big in
PHP before a login system is actually
really simple to create as long as you
know the concept that goes behind
creating it so before we get started and
actually coding anything I'd like to
serve as what exactly we're going to be
building in this episode and explain
what exactly is going on inside this
demo here so as you guys can see in
front of me here I have a very basic
demo of the login system I'm going to
create and yes I know this is not a
really pretty website but this does in
fact have a login system that works who
can actually sign up we can actually log
in and once you do actually log in it's
going to display some content inside the
website that will only show if you
actually logged in as a user so the
basic concept that goes behind a login
system is that we want to write the
front-end part using HTML and CSS such
as having a log in from the top here or
inside the signup page a signup form
once you guys you click sign up we're
going to run a piece of PHP code that
inserts the data that we wrote in inside
first name last name email user name and
password is going to insert that inside
a database and we need to have a
database connected to a website in order
for the website to actually remember the
information under users that actually
signed up so if you're completely new to
databases don't get scared because I do
have a tutorial on how to exit setup a
database locally on your computer
very easily and very fast so I will
leave a link so you can actually see it
and learn how to set up a local database
and it's very easy to do okay so what we
need to know for this tutorial here is
we need to know how to do HTML CSS a
little bit of PHP and we need to know
how to handle databases and again I will
actually show even beginners how to set
up the for example of the database
inside our website so if you're a bit
unfamiliar with databases don't get
scared because we will do everything
together and everything will get
explained very thoroughly okay so what
we need to do to start with is we need
to actually have a database now if you
have never setup a database before I do
expect that you by now have watched the
tutorial inside the description of the
video
that explains how to setup a database
once you have a database setup we will
go into phpMyAdmin which again is also
explaining that video and inside PHP
myadmin
we're going to setup a new database we
do have a database for this website here
so inside databases inside the databases
tab at the top I'm going to go and
create a database called login system
again you guys can name whatever you
want but if you want to follow this
specifically you can go out a name it
the same way as I do I'm going to click
create and now we have a database for
our website now after creating the
database called login system we need to
make sure I've selected so on the left
side here I'm going to go down to where
it says login system I'm just going to
click it to make sure we did actually
selected and then I'm going to go to the
top here and click on sq out now inside
the SQL tab we get this editor we can
actually write something in I'm just
going to zoom in for you guys and inside
this editor we're going to create some
code using SQL code that will actually
create a database table called users now
inside this user table it's going to be
where we insert the data for all the
users meaning that if the user type in
the username or the first name of the
last name of the email of the password
we need to save this data somewhere
inside the website and we do that by
inserting it inside our database inside
a table so going to create this table of
stores information on the user now the
way you create the table is by saying
create
table and then we need to give this
table some kind of name I'm just going
to call this one users space parentheses
semi-colon so all the information we
need to save on the user such as first
name last name username and password
needs to be inserted into a separate
column and these columns we need to
create inside the parentheses here so
the first column of information we need
to have under user is going to be
something we call an ID now an ID inside
a table is going to be unique for each
user we have inside for example the user
table or each piece of data we have
inside any kind of table because we need
to be able to refer to a specific data
inside the table using an ID which means
that we cannot have different data that
has identical IDs because then we can
actually refer to that specific data and
again if this is a bit confusing for new
people who hasn't done anything with
tables or anything like that inside
databases just go ahead and follow this
lesson here so the first column inside
our table is going to be named user on
the school ID which is going to be a
specific data type which is going to be
an integer which means numbers and
inside the parentheses of this Institute
data type we're going to set a limit to
how many introduced that can be inside
this table when it comes to the user ID
column I'm going to set this one to 11
which does not mean and again for new
people it does not mean that we can only
have 11 users inside the table it just
basically means we can have 11
characters behind each other inside the
user ID column meaning we can have nine
nine nine nine nine nine nine up to 11
characters inside the use-ip color okay
which is quite a lot of users inside a
website after the claim the data type
inside the user ID column we're going to
include not null afterwards which
basically means that the data inside the
user ID cannot be said to know which
basically means nothing inside coding
which is not the same as having an empty
field inside a table it just means that
the data cannot be said to know okay
there's a difference here and for newer
people if you get confused by it too
don't worry too much about it okay the
next statement we need to include inside
this first column is going to be ought
to underscore increment which basically
means that each time a new piece of data
is inserted inside the user table it's
going to increase our integer by one
automatically which means that the first
user I want to do actually sign up
inside the website it's going to have a
user ID set to one then when we sign
another use of his ID is going to be two
and so on and so on and so on it's going
to automatically increase the ID after
setting the order increments we're going
to set this one as a primary key now
like I mentioned earlier when we do is
to create tables inside a database we
need to have at least one column that
has a primary key and what that does is
that it allowed for us to refer to that
specific user or that specific row of
information using a unique number which
is going to be this first column inside
the users table okay so this one
basically declares that this is going to
be the unique ID for this table on the
next line we can actually start creating
the active information that we want to
store on the user so the first
information is going to be at least in
my case here inside my login system a
first name so I'm going to write user
underscore first now the datatype for
the first name is just going to be
regular characters such as ABCD efg and
the way we declare that is by writing we
want to have a vodka which is characters
with a limit of 256 which again means
that we can have 256 characters behind
each other which again I don't think
anyone has the first name that is that
long so I think 256 would be plenty in
order to write a first name now
afterwards we're going to set this as
not null just like the previous one and
this is basically all we need to include
for this column here so I'm just going
to copy and paste it below and then
we're going to change the name from user
first to user last which again is going
to be the last name of the user and
again this is basically all except for
this column so just go and copy down one
time now the next one is going to be the
email address so I'm going to say user
underscore email and again we're just
going to go to news watch as the data
type we're going to save so not now and
this is basically all you need to do
here and the next time we're going to
paste it in again and we're going to go
insert a username which I'm going to go
ahead and call user underscore UID which
stands for user ID and again you can
call whatever you want inside the table
I just decide to call it
UID but do you bear in mind that later
on when we do actually need to create a
login system on a website we need to
remember what we typed in inside these
columns here so we need to remember the
names of them okay on the next line
we're going to go and paste in the last
one which is going to be the password
for the user so we're going to say PWD
and again you can name whatever you want
I'm going to set the bar test to 56 as
well
now before we run this code inside the
data page who need to make sure we
delete the last comma under the last
line of code because it's only if you
have something more on the next line
that they need to include the commas so
we need to make sure to delete the last
comma so now that we have this we can
actually go down and say go which means
that we're actually going to run the
code inside our login system database
and now you guys can see on the left
side here we have a user's table now
right now if we're to swim a bit out you
guys can see there are nothing inside
the users table because there's no data
here but once there's the insert data we
should be able to see it so now that we
have the login system database set up we
can actually go ahead and get started on
actually creating the code inside the
website so what I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to go ahead and open up
my website and a new tab because this is
what we will actually be creating right
now there's no documents inside our
website so right now we have nothing
inside the website so the first thing
we're going to do is we need to create
an index file so we can actually have
something to show when we do actually
access our website up here so I'm going
to go inside my code editor I'm using
sublime text I'm going to create a new
file I'm going to save it inside my
login system root folder as index dot
JSP now inside the index dot PHP file
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to go ahead and create the
bare-bones I'm an html5 set up so I'm
just going to say we want to have a
basic sm5 page
again you guys can do whatever you want
with this code I'm just going to do a
very basics of an html5 page because I'm
more focused about the login system so
you guys can customize it any kind of
way you want to inside the body tags I'm
going to include a header tag which is
where we're going to include the login
system you know the username and
password and the login button so I'm
just going to go and create a couple of
header tags and then below the header
tags I'm going to include a section tag
which is where we're going to include
all the content for the actual front
page so inside the header tags we're
going to go to include an app tag which
is where we're going to include the
navigation for the website inside the
net tag I'm going to include a div
because I want to include a wrapper
inside the website to make sure all the
content does not go all the way to the
left and right side of the website so
I'm going to go and give this div a
class called main - wrapper and when you
tax me style this so the next thing
we're going to do is we're going to go
inside the head tag we're going to go
and include a link to our statute which
we haven't actually created yet so I'm
going to say link to the style sheet you
guys know how to do this by now and
inside to have a reference I'm going to
write style dot CSS so now we're going
to go and create another file we're
going to save it inside the root folder
style dot CSS now before we include any
kind of styling inside the website I
want to include some reset code that
allow for us to reset all default
styling inside most browsers so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go to my
browser I'm going to go to this website
here called html5 dr. calm and I'm going
to use this reset code in order to reset
all the styling inside most browsers so
I'm just going to copy it here and paste
it inside on top of my stylesheet and
then I can actually go understand my own
styling below here so I'm just going to
write a comment that says my code so now
we did this and we have reset all
default styling inside browsers we can
actually go ahead and style our own
website so what we're going to do and by
the way I'm actually going to go and
include the link for this website here
in the description in case you guys want
to cover the same code
so inside this town see what I'm going
to do is I'm going to go ahead and style
the main wrapper we just created inside
the front page so I'm going to say they
have a class called main - wrapper curly
brackets I'm going to set a margin to
zero out so and next I'm going to set a
width to maybe a thousand pixels I'm
going to save it go back inside my index
file make sure that has been saved and
then I'm going to go ahead and reset my
website now you guys can see we have an
empty page because right now we do
actually have an index file it connects
a find now and is included anything
inside the website which is why does
nothing so inside I'll wrap it inside
the index file I'm going to go ahead and
create an unordered list because need to
actually have a navigation inside the
website so I'm going to go and create a
pair of ul tags inside the UL tags we're
going to include a listed item then I'm
going to include a anchor tag inside the
list item and inside to have a reference
link I'm going to link to the index file
because it needs to link to our front
page when we click this first link which
is going to be the home button so I'm
going to say index dot PHP and inside
the anchor tags I'm going to say home
now you guys can go and include more
pages inside the website if you want to
I'm just going to go and include one
link so we just met a home button in my
example here so I'm just going to leave
this for now underneath the UL tags I'm
going to create another pair of div tags
because I want to have a container for
all the login system information inside
the header so I'm going to go ahead and
give this div a class name I'm going to
call it nav login NAB - login and inside
this div box I'm going to create a form
which is come speed actor login form
inside the header I'm going to say we
have a HTML form and inside the form we
have an input like so we're going to set
the type in the first one as text we're
going to set a name as you ID which is
going to be the user name and then we're
going to set a placeholder so we can
actually see what we need to type inside
is input set to username or email so the
user actually has an option when he
wants to type in inside this input so
you can actually choose username or the
email address you signed up with we're
going to go ahead and copy this input
and paste it below then we're going to
go and change the type to password and
then we're going to go ahead and change
the name to PWD and then the placeholder
is going to be password like so below
here we're going to go and include a
button so we're going to say button
we're going to set a type inside the
button as submit which means that when
do I see click this button is going to
submit the form then we're going to set
a name equal to submit as well because
one to do I say click the submit button
and we need to run the PHP code that
actually checks if all this information
is correct we need to check if the
button has been clicked which again is
not something that is required but
because it improves security inside our
PHP script I want to include inside my
button here after setting the name we
need to go inside the button and
actually have some kind of text inside
the button so I'm going to say login and
the last thing we need to do to actually
get this form working for it to be
completely done is to include a couple
of attributes inside the form tag now
because they want to confuse newer
people I'm not going to go and include
the X in the method attribute inside the
form text just yet but once we get to it
I'll explain what they do so now that we
create the login form we can actually
include a sign up button next to login
forms you can actually click on it and
go to a page that will actually allow
for us to sign up so underneath the form
I'm going to go and say we have a anger
tag that has to have a reference the
links to a signup page which is called
sign up the PHP which we haven't created
yet but we will in just a second and
it's going to have some text called sign
up so now that we inserted some code
inside our header tag let's actually go
and style it so going back into a style
sheet underneath our main wrapper we're
going to go ahead and say we want to
style the header now I'm going to go
ahead and set a width
to 100% so it goes all the way from the
left to the right side of the browser
I'm going to set a height to 60 pixels
again you guys continue to whatever
style you want to I'm just going to go
and make my way here I'm going to set a
background color set to white now right
before the navigation styling I do also
want to include a background call inside
the website so we can actually see the
navigation at the top so I'm going to
say we have a body that needs to have a
background color set to s tag CCC which
is a light grayish color so now if we go
back to the website and refresh you guys
can see we now have some information
inside the website we have a great
background color for the actual website
we have a white background for the
navigation up here and as you guys can
see we have the buttons and stuff we
created inside the index file now when
you tack this style is because right now
it doesn't look very pretty so going
back to our style sheet underneath our
head of navigation I'm just going to
copy paste what we have here I'm going
to style the unordered list inside the
navigation I'm going to say we had a UL
tag I'm going to just move what we have
here and inside of this one I'm going to
say floats left because I want the
navigation that has the home button to
float to the left side of the wrapper
then I'm going to copy/paste what we
have here and actually style the list
item inside downloaded list I'm going to
go ahead and set a float:left and a list
style set to none because you don't want
to have bullet points inside our
navigation the next thing we need to do
is access style text inside our
navigation so I'm going to say we have a
anchor tag inside the list item I'm
going to say we want to have a fun
family which is set to Arial again you
guys can use whatever fonts you want I'm
just gonna use Arial because it's a very
standard fonts it doesn't we're pretty I
agree but just to have something the
next thing we need to include is a font
desk
size which I'm going to set to 16 pixels
I'm going to include a color set to has
tag 1 1 1 which is a very dark grey
color and then I'm going to include a
line height
set 263 pixels which will somewhat
centered inside our navigation inside
the header of our website so now we have
this you can actually go ahead and see
what we did inside the website so if i
refresh you guys can see we get some
styling I would also like to route the
underline underneath my links so I'm
going to go back inside the styling go
to the very top here right before the
body tag and say I want to style all
anchor tags inside the website and
remove text decoration set it to none
now if we go back refresh you guys can
see we have no underlines so the next
thing we need to do sexy style the login
form up here so I'm going to go back
inside my stylesheet and then we're
going to go and say we have a header
space then we have a class called nav -
clock-in which again inside our index
file is going to be the container for
our entire login form here so going back
to the style sheet we can actually style
this one and say you want to float right
to make it go to the right side of the
browser then I'm going to go ahead and
copy the path here paste it below and
say I want to style the form inside the
never look in box to be included inside
the front page I want to have it float
not write the left and then I want to
include a padding top as 15 pixels
and the reason I'm doing that is because
I want to set my height of the actual
inputs that we can write inside of
inside the form - 30 pixels in height so
we need to say 30 pages minus 60 which
is the height of our navigation and then
say what is left over is going to be the
spacing from the top and bottom which is
going to be 15 pixels after doing this
I'm going to copy what we have here
inside the form pasted below and change
the path so it says input after the form
then I'm going to go and change the
styling here so we say we don't have a
padding top but instead we have a width
set 240 pixels again you guys contains
whatever you want to inside the width
and the height and that sort of thing
I'm going to set a height like I said
the 15 pixels here work
created depending on it having a height
set to 30 pixels afterwards we're going
to include a padding I'm going to set it
to zero pixels from the top and bottom
and 10 pixels from the left and right
we're going to include a Martin right to
get some spacing between the inputs so
we're going to say margins that's right
set to 10 pixels I'm going to include a
border:none because I don't want two
inputs to have a border I'm going to do
the background color set to maybe
hashtag CCC which again is a very light
grey color I'm going to set a font
family and again we can just copy the
font starting from up here and just
paste it below here I'm going to include
a line height to 30 pixels because my
input is 30 pixels high so we need to
include the same thing inside the line
height I'm going to change the font size
to 14 pixels so now we had this we can
actually go ahead and save it and again
copy what we have the and paste it below
because now we need to style the button
inside the form so I'm going to cancel
to button and inside the button we're
going to say we want to float:left we
want to change the width to 60 pixels
instead 140 the height is going to
remain as 30 pixels the padding is going
to disappear because we don't want to
have it the margin right is going to
stay that because it needs to have some
spacing from the sign up button also
going to include the border none' we're
going to change the background color to
f3f3f3 which is a very light grey color
I'm going to go and keep the font
styling inside of here now the last
thing we need to include is we don't
want to have a line height but instead
we're going to set a cursor to pointer
which basically means when we hover our
mouse cursor on top of the button it
needs to show the little hen icon we
actually that shows that we can actually
click it so now that we have this I want
to include a hover effect so I'm going
to actually put the mouse cursor and
tell the button that we can actually see
that we have selected the button so I'm
going to copy off your head here pasted
below I'm going to delete all the code
inside okay except for the background
color like so I'm going to
change it to something like CCC which
again is the same background color as
our inputs up here so now that we have
this the last thing we need to style is
the signup button next to the login form
so I'm going to go ahead and just copy
some of the code we have our P I'm just
going to copy the header styling here
just so we have the same styling inside
of it and I'm going to change the path
so right now it's going to be header
then a class called man - login and then
the anchor tag inside this path here now
I'm also going to go and include a
display:block because I want to include
a width and a height inside this button
here so I'm going to say display:block
then we're going to say width and set it
to 60 pixels roughly then we're going to
set a height to 60 pixels like so I'm
also going to go and include a border
none' we're going to set a background
color as white and then at the end here
we want to include a cursor which again
is going to be a pointer to make sure we
have the right icon on our mouth swim to
actually hover on top of the button so
now we have this let's actually go and
see what we have so far I'm going to go
ahead and refresh the browser that you
guys can see that quite a few things in
here now we do actually have a button
that jumps below here which is because
we forgot to float:left inside the
button styling so I'm going to say float
left and then again refresh the browser
like so so now we have some different
inputs and I can actually see we also
forgot to include the hover right behind
the button styling down here so we want
to make sure that the hover color does
actually have hovered behind the path so
now this would actually work like
intended so not only style all the
elements inside the header we can
actually go ahead and insert some
content inside the body tags down here
so I'm going to go down inside my index
file and say we want to have a wrapper
inside this section just to make sure we
have everything on a straight line just
like inside the header up here
so I'm just going to say we have a
detect with a class set two main tasks
wrapper inside the wrapper here we're
going to include a h2 tag which is going
to have a home text which basically just
tells us when to type the home page so
now we have this we can actually go
ahead and include the styling inside the
section here just to make sure we have
it which I'm going to call main desk
container and the reason for this is
just so we can actually target the
specific section here which is going to
contain all the content inside our pages
so I'm just going to go and copy the
main - container class name here go into
the style sheet and go to the bottom
here then I'm going to say they have a
class called made - container and inside
the curly brackets I'm going to include
for padding desktop set to 40 pixels
just so that when we do actually refresh
the browser the home button gets pushed
down 40 pixels all the content starts
from here now inside the stance you also
want to actually style the h2 tag inside
the main container so I'm going to copy
the path here and say I want to target
the 82 elements I want to include some
of the font styling from up here just so
we have something paste it in and then
I'm going to go and set the font size to
maybe 40 pixels or something then I want
to include a line height set to maybe 50
pixels refers to browser and now you
guys can see we have some styling now
I'm also going to go and censor it just
to make sure you have it in the middle
of our website so we're going to say
text align Center and there we have it
now the front page is actually done now
before we create the signup page I want
to make some changes to the front page
because right now if we were to create a
second page inside our website I would
have to retype everything inside the sub
page so what I want to do here is I want
to take the top content of my index file
and insert it inside a new document
called header the PSP so I'm going to go
ahead and copy everything from the top
of the website all the way down to where
the section starts here I'm going to
copy it
delete it create a new file paste it in
and save it as header the PHP or say
header dot PHP then afterwards we're
going to go back to the front page
include some PHP tags and sets out the
website and link to the head of the PHP
file so I'm going to say include
underscore once
single quotes then we're going to say
header dot PHP semicolon then I want to
do the same thing at the bottom here so
I'm just going to copy pasted and say
want to link to a footer dot PHP and
then just copy the footer tags down here
delete them save it
create a new file paste it in and save
it as footer dot PHP so now we do
actually have the exact same thing going
on inside our website upward to go back
to the front page and refresh you guys
can see it looks identical which is
because right now we're just linking to
the header from the front page meaning
that when we do is to create a second
page such as sign up dot PHP we can
actually go out and link to all the
content inside the header just using
these PHP tags so we're basically just
reusing the code on every single sub
page so we don't have to retype
everything which is quite nice I'm going
to copy all the code from the front page
paste it inside the signup page and
basically all we need to do is change
the section content so right now the h2
tags you not say home but instead signup
so now if I go ahead and refresh the
browser click on the signup button up
here you guys can see we go to the
signup page so now we just need to
include the form that allow for us to
sign up as a user inside the signup page
we're going to go balota it's to tag and
include a form tag inside the form tag
we're going to include a thing for tag
which is going to have a type set to
text we're going to set a name as first
because this is all the information we
want to insert inside a user table so we
need to include the exact same data as
when we created the table inside the
database so we're going to set the first
data as
they were going to set a placeholder so
we can actually see what we need to type
in as first name now I don't actually
know if this is one or two words so
we're just going to go and include first
in like this kind of code and copy it
paste it below four more times we're
going to change the second one to last
which is the last name I'm going to
change the placeholder text to last name
the third one is going to be the email
I'm going to set the placeholder as feed
as mail the fourth one is going to be
the username so we're going to use ID or
UID the placeholder is going to be
username and then the last one is going
to be a password type so I'm going to
save password then inside the name we're
going to set it as PWD and then the
placeholder is going to be password then
we're going to go and include a button
below here inside the bottom tag we're
going to set a type 2 equal to submit
then we're going to set a name equal to
sub mix and then we're going to include
some text inside the button so we're
going to say sign up now just like
inside the login form we do need to
include some data inside the form tag up
here but because our next created those
files yet I want to wait with doing that
so I can actually explain it I want to
do X to get to it for the new people who
hasn't actually done anything like this
before
now the next thing we need to do is
access down this form inside our style
sheet so I'm going to actually give this
form a class name we're going to say
class equal to sign up desk form like so
I'm going to go into my style sheet and
at the very bottom here I'm going to
create a comment because I want to
actually say that now we do actually
start to styling for the sign up dot PHP
file I'm going to go and say they have a
class called signup - form space curly
brackets and inside the styling I want
to set a width
inside the form so I'm going to say we
have a width set to 400 pixels just have
something again you guys can change
whatever you want in a year going to set
a margin as zero how to I'm going to set
a padding top because I want some
spacing from the h2 tag of about 30
pixels then I'm going to copy the code
we have here paste it below and then
include an input styling so we're going
to say input and again we can just go to
the top here where we have the input for
the actual form just going to copy
everything we have here paste it below
and we're going to go and remove a
couple of things we don't need the
floats want to set a width not to 140
pixels but 100% because we're inside a
form that already has a width so we can
just set this 100% I will turn into 400
we're going to set a height to 40 pixels
I want to set a padding as zero pixels
from the top and bottom and then because
you have percentage inside the width I
want to set the panning from left and
right to 5% which means that we also
need to change the percentage inside the
width to 90 percent so 90 plus 5 plus 5
for the left and right turns into a
hundred percent we're going to delete
the margin right we're going to keep the
border none' we're going to change the
background color to white
so ffff I want to keep the font styling
inside the code here but change the font
size to 16 pixels and then I want to
change the line height to 40 pixels
because we're inside a input with a 40
pixels height now the last thing we need
to include is a margin bottom because I
want some spacing between all the inputs
so we're going to say Martin - bottom -
maybe 4 pixels now the next thing you
need to style is that - a button at the
bottom here so I'm going to just
complicate the input styling
I'm going to change the to button and
I'm going to change the styling so we
have a display block at the top here I'm
going to change the width to not 90 but
30% because I don't want it to be the
same width as all the inputs the height
is going to stay at 40 pixels
and delete the padding because we don't
need that I'm going to need the margin
bottom I'm going to keep the border
none' and I'm going to keep the font
styling now the background color I want
to change to maybe two to two which is a
dark gray color and I want to make sure
we have a nother line height but a
cursor set to pointer like so then we do
actually hover on the button I want to
change the background color so we're
going to just copy paste delete all the
styling is set for the background color
make sure we have colon hover behind the
path and change it to 1 1 1 so now if
you go inside the website refresh you
guys can see we have some stuff going on
here now there's a couple of things you
need to change the guarding the buttons
I'm just going to go back into it I'm
going to make sure we have a margin set
to zero Alto and also a color of the
text as white like so so now looks like
I wanted to so now we have all the front
end code done it will actually get
started on the actual PHP code that
would like to create the login system
want me to actually go into the signup
form and the PHP code that handles the
login form up here so back inside the
text editor the first thing we need to
do is actually create the connection to
the database so you can actually insert
and select data from the database inside
our website so we going to go and create
a new file I'm going to save this one
inside a folder called includes now the
reason I printed this includes folders
because this specific file is not going
to be an actual page inside the website
this file it's only going to have some
code that runs in the background of the
actual website so all the different
Fosters don't actually see inside the
website but only has some functionality
purposes I decide to include inside my
includes folder you don't have to do it
but I think it's a neat way to do it so
inside my includes folder I'm going to
save this file as DBH dot Inc dot PHP so
now there's going to be people asking
you why did I include the link inside
the file name
well it is only for naming purposes it
does absolutely nothing inside the file
it is only so that we can see that this
file is an include file inside my
include folder you could also if you
wanted to delete it and just call it DPH
the PSP or you could write - Inc dot PHP
if you wanted to I just decided to call
it dot Inc the PSP because I think
that's a neater way to name it so I'm
going to save it inside the includes
folder and inside this file we need to
create the connection to the database so
I'm going to say we have the PSP tanks
and I'm only going to include the
opening tag because since this is a pure
PHP file there's no reason to close off
the PSP tags okay this is actually a
practice that is preferred by people who
does PSP programming when you only have
PHP code inside a file so inside this
PHP file we're going to create four
variables which are going to be the
connection to the database so right now
the first information we need is the
server name so I'm going to write DB
server name it's equal to double quotes
semicolon I'm going to copy this down
three more times so we have all the
information we need the second one is
going to be not the server name but two
username so once a user name the third
one is going to be the password and the
fourth one is going to be the database
name we're just going to say DB name so
now we need to type in the information
inside these four variables so right now
set the first one which is the server
name we need to type in the name of the
server we're currently running on so
right now i'm actually using xampp which
again is what I showed in the tutorial
in the description of this video out
sides install so because I'm using a
local server you need to write localhost
now if you're actually running an online
server need to actually go to your
hosting company's website log in to a
control panel and figure out what the
server name is now because I'm using a
local server inside the user name I need
to type groups that's my username so if
you're also using xampp in order to do
this you need to tag root as well unless
you actually change that manually
inside exempt inside the password we're
going to go to be with empty because XM
does not have a password as a default
again if you change the inside exam you
need to change it as well and type in
the correct password inside the input
here in the last one down here we're
going to go to type the database name
which is going to be in my case the
login system because that's what we call
the database inside PHP myadmin we
created the database at the very
beginning of this tutorial here so now
that we have all this information we can
actually use a PHP function in order to
actually activate the connection so I'm
going to create a variable called cont
which stands for connection which is
equal to a PHP function called my sqli
underscore connects parenthesis
semicolon and inside the Connect
parenthesis here we need to include four
different parameters and guess what we
just created them up here so we're just
going to go and paste them in with a
comma separating them like so like so
and like so and now we do actually have
a connection to the database so now we
just need to refer to this file each
time we need to connect to the database
now the next thing you need to do is
actually allow for users to sign up
inside the website and we're going to do
that using the signup form and a small
PHP script so inside the sign up the PHP
file we're going to fill out the rest
the form tag which we didn't fill out in
the previous section so inside the form
text I'm going to say space and I'm
going to include a execute called action
now the action attribute actually tells
the form which file we want to load want
to do actually click the submit button
now in our case we're going to create a
file called signup dot Inc the PSP so
I'm going to say we're going to go into
an includes folder which we create it
inside our root folder and inside this
folder we have a sign up dot Inc dot PHP
like so now after including the action
attribute we need to include a method in
which you want to pass on data into this
file we have two different methods we
can choose from either we can do a get
method or post method now when we use a
get method we can actually see all the
information with
as on inside the URL now because we have
stuff like passwords and that sort of
thing we don't want to pass on this
information in a visible way so what
we're going to use here is a post method
which is going to hide everything inside
the URL so I'm going to include a method
attribute I'm going to set it equal to
double quotes and say post so now we
have everything we need to include
inside the form in here and we can
actually go ahead and create a new file
we're going to save it inside our crews
folder and save it as sign up dot Inc
dot PHP so not only have this file we
can actually get started actually
handling the data that the user typed in
inside the form and tell the database
what to do with it which in this case is
going to be inserting it inside our user
table so the first thing we need to do
in here is actually open up the PHP tags
like so and we're going to create an if
statement because I want to actually
check if the user has actually click the
submit button then it's going to run the
script in here so this is just a extra
security measure in case a user decides
to go inside your website and go up
inside the UL up here and after the
force let's say includes forward slash
sign up dot Inc a PHP now they can
actually do that and it's going to
actually run the file that we're
creating right now we don't want people
to be able to do that and just see all
the code so we're going to make sure
that people has to have clicked the
button inside our form to be able to run
the code inside this document here so
inside the if statement going to check
if we did actually click the button and
we do that using a PHP function called
is set which is going to check if
something is existing inside this file
here so I'm going to check if we do
actually have something called a dollar
sign underscore post brackets and inside
the brackets we're going to say single
quotes and check for submit so this is
going to take our data from the previous
form which we pass to this file using a
post method and it's going to take for
the name called submits which is in fact
if you go back to the signup form the
button down here which we gave a name as
submit so it's going to check this
button has actually been clicked and
then test it inside this file here now
in case we didn't actually click the
submit button I want to write an else
statements because I want to do
something else if the user did not click
the button in this case I'm just going
to send them back to the signup page so
I'm going to say header which is a
function inside PHP and I'm going to say
double quotes location with a big L
colon space and make sure you don't have
any space between location and colon
here because then it's not going to work
after the colon we're going to say space
dot dot forward slash which is going to
take us back a directive and then a
swatch we're going to say we want to
load up sign up dot PHP so basically
what we're doing here is we're actually
saying that if people access this
document and they click the button
inside our signup form then we can
actually load up whatever code needs to
be loaded up inside this file here if
people actually enter the URL of the
website and just simply wrote the
address for this page here then we're
going to send them back to the signup
page immediately okay and we need to
make sure we have a semicolon at the end
here so after we do this I also want to
write a exit function which actually
closes off the script now in this case
it wouldn't really matter too much
because we don't actually have other
code after the exit function here but
basically what exit does is that it
actually closes off and stops the script
from running if there's anything after
the exit function so we're just going to
use this one just to have it here so we
can actually use it when we do actually
get into the if statement here so inside
the if statement the first thing we're
going to do is we're going to include
our database file which we just created
in the previous section so I'm going to
say we have an include on the score once
single quotes semicolon and inside the
single quotes I'm going to link to vp8
dot Inc dot 50 and I'm not going to
write includes for slabs in front of it
because we're already inside the
includes folder when we
this document open afterwards we're
going to get the actual data from the
form which you have inside sign up to
PSP now the way we do that is the exact
same way as we did up here but we need
to do something extra after we do
actually write the post method like we
did up here so we're going to create a
variable that is going to be called
first which is equal to dollar sign
underscore post brackets and then the
name of this post method is going to be
first because that was the name we
included inside the first input inside a
signup form now when we do this we do
actually allow for users to write
something and send it to this form which
we then insert into the database now
because this can be a bit dangerous in
case people decide to write code inside
the input we can actually risk that the
user actually inserts code inside the
input and sends it to a database we
don't want people to do that so what
we're going to do is we're going to go
and escape all the text that they do
actually pass on to this file using a
PSP method which basically means that
we're not going to see this as code if
the detect a write code inside the input
but instead is going to convert it to
text so to add a bit of security to this
post method here we're going to go ahead
and go in front of the post method we're
going to write a PHP function called my
sqli on the score real underscore escape
underscore strength parentheses now the
first parameter inside the parentheses
is going to be the database connection
so we're going to write variable come
comment space and then we're going to
include the post method at the second
parameter in here like so so the
database connection here the variable
con we do have access to because we
included the database file up here so we
can actually use variable con from
inside the database file which is right
here okay after this we need to include
the rest of the data that we do actually
have inside the signup form so I'm going
to go down and just paste it in a couple
more times we're going to change the
second one to last the next one is going
to be equal to email the fourth one is
going to be UID for the username
and the last one is going to be the
password so we're going to say PWD so
now we do actually have the data from
the signup form and we made sure people
can actually write code inside the
inputs and we pass it on to this
document here so the next thing we need
to do is actually create something
called error handlers because right now
if I were to write a bunch of stuff
inside these inputs I might want to
check if the user left anything empty
such as the first name or the email
because then I don't want to allow for
users to actually sign up if they didn't
fill in everything correctly so what
we're going to do is I'm going to go and
create a comment that says error
handlers like so and the first one here
is going to be what we check if
everything has been filled out and
there's no empty fields so we're going
to say check for empty fields just as a
comment and then underneath here we're
going to create an if statement I'm
going to say if and then inside the
condition we're going to say if
something has been left empty by saying
empty which is a PHP function which
basically just checks if we for example
include the first variable up here if
there's any kind of data attached to it
so we didn't fill anything inside the
first input then we don't have any data
inside this variable here it's just
going to be empty so what we're going to
do is we're going to check if this one
is empty then we're going to check for
the next variable which is the last so
I'm just going to copy the empty
function here right last now these two
vertical lines here means or inside PHP
which basically means that right now I'm
taking is this one empty or this this
one empty and then we're going to keep
adding on these variables afterwards so
if one of them is actually empty then is
going to create an error message okay so
we're going to keep passing on these
variables in here so I'm just going to
paste them in paste them in so we have
about five of them and then I'm going to
include the rest of them so we're going
to copy paste copy paste copy paste like
so
so not only pasted them all in we can
actually go and create an error message
down here inside the curly brackets of
the if statement now one thing I want to
mention is that is
habit to always take for errors first
before you check for success so as you
guys can see right now we did actually
check if there was an error and then we
create the error message and then
afterwards we create an else statement
that then runs the next piece of code if
there was no errors in here so it's a
good habit to always check for errors
first so inside the if statement I'm
going to say the same thing as down here
we're just going to copy paste and we
need to make sure we include the exit
function as well because you want to
stop the else statement from actually
running in case something wrong happens
we just need to make sure the entire
script stops as soon as this error
message actually gets activated so
inside the location I'm going to say
we're going to go back to the signup the
PHP file but I'm also going to go and
include a message so if I did actually
get this specific error message I'm
going to say question mark after the
path we have in here then we're going to
say signup is equal to MC which means
that we now have a error message that
says sign up is equal to empty which is
going to be inside the URL when we go
back to the previous page so this is
going to tell us what kind of error
message we have inside the deform when
we do actually submit it and depending
on the error message we can actually go
ahead and include some styling inside
the signup form an example here would be
to actually start from the input fields
red to show the users there's some
fields that actually empty so we connect
to use this in some quite creative ways
inside the else statement I'm going to
go ahead and jump to the next part
because right now if everything was
actually filled in you want to activate
the next piece of code which in this
case is going to be what we check if the
input character is actually something
that we want to allow inside the
database so inside the else statement
inside the curly brackets I'm going to
write a comment that says check give
input characters are ballot like so then
on the next line we're going to create a
if statements and then we're going to
create something called preg match which
is a PHP function that goes in and
checks if we have certain characters
included that we don't allow inside the
inputs
inside the if statement condition I'm
going to write correct underscore Matt's
parentheses which is the PHP function
and X it goes in into X if we have
certain characters inside a string so
we're going to write double quotes and
then inside double quotes we're going to
tell it which characters we allow inside
the input so we're going to say forward
slash then we're going to use this arrow
which points up then we're going to
write brackets and inside the brackets
we're going to tell which characters we
allow so we're going to say all letters
from small a to set and then we also
want to allow capitalized letters from a
to sets then after the brackets we're
going to write multiplication and then
dollar sign and save it and then after
the double quotes are going to include
the string that we want to check for
these characters so we're going to say
variable first like so now basically
what we're doing here like I said is
we're checking if they will first
include these letters and then it's
going to say okay so it did actually
include these letters and it is passed
and then we're going to go ahead and run
this code down here but like I said we
want to take four arrows first so what
I'm going to go and do is I'm going to
go and go up inside right before the
print Maps function and write
exclamation mark which basically says
that now we're not checking if the
characters does actually exist inside
the first but now actually checking if
there's characters that are not these
characters existing inside first okay so
we kind of turn it around now this is
when we want to check for the first name
now what if I also want to check for the
last name as well what we can actually
do here is I can actually go after the
function here and say you have these
vertical lines again and simply just
copy paste in what we have in front of
it then I'm going to change the last
variable to last so now we're checking
if both first name and last name has
characters we don't allow inside the
inputs and then if you do actually have
some characters we don't allow then it's
going to run this code down here so I'm
just going to copy paste the header
function and the exit function and
inside the header I'm going to say we
have another aramis it's not saying
empty but instead invalid like so after
we have this we need to include an else
statements because now we did actually
say that if we do actually have
valid characters then is going to
continue on to this else statement here
and now the next thing we want to check
for is to make sure that the email is
actually a valid email because in case I
wrote some email but forgot to leave in
the @ symbol then you want to throw an
error message so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to write a comment that says
check if Iman's
then then the next time we're going to
write a if statements inside the
condition I'm also going to use a
function called filter on the score bar
which is going to go ahead and check a
certain string using a specific method
inside the PHP language so I'm going to
say filter underscore bar parentheses
now the first parameter in here is going
to be the string that we want to check
so in this case we have a variable up
here called email I'm going to check for
that one then we're going to say comment
space and then we need to tell what kind
of method want to use inside the filter
bar
function now in this case since we're
taking for a valid email we do actually
have a method called filter underscore
validate underscore email and then what
this does this basically tells us if the
email address is actually valid then is
going to run this code in here but again
like I said you want to take four errors
first so in front of the filter
underscore bar I'm going to say
exclamation mark so now it's going to do
the opposite is going to check if this
is not valid then it's going to do
whatever is inside the curly brackets so
again we're going to go and copy the
header and the exit function paste it in
and I'm going to change the error
message to invalid email or maybe just
email like so then we're going to create
the else statement just like before
curly brackets and then the next thing
we could do here is actually check if
the username you typed in inside the UID
has already been taken inside the
database because we don't want to allow
people to use a username that already
exists inside the database so what I'm
going to do here is I'm going to go
inside the curly brackets of the else
statement and I'm going to create a
connection to the database and go in and
check if we have any kind of users with
that username
so I'm going to write a variable called
SQL which is equal to double quotes
semicolon then inside the double quotes
are going to write a SQL statement that
gets courage inside the database so i'm
going to say want to select all from
users where the UID actually not the UID
put the user on the square u ID is equal
to single quotes variable UID like so so
now if there is any kind of uses inside
the users table that has this username
inside the UID column then it's going to
return some kind of result so the next
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go
to the next line and actually run this
code inside the database I'm going to
say we have a variable called result
which is equal to my SQL I underscore
query because we want to execute this
inside the database parentheses
semicolon and then I'm going to go
inside the parentheses and the first
parameter is going to be the connection
to the database which again is variable
column and the second parameter is going
to be the actual variable we have a be a
called variable SQL which is the actual
statement want to run inside the
database so after we have this we need
to check if we had any kind of results
now the way we do that is we can
actually go and create a variable called
result check which is equal to my SQL I
on the score num underscore rose
parentheses semicolon and then we're
going to pass in the variable called
result inside these parentheses so it's
going to take this Koree the run inside
the database and check if we had any
kind of rows as a result and a row is
actually what's going to get returned
each time we get a result from the
database so if we do in fact have any
kind of results here then we want to
throw an error message the way we do
that is by using a if statements that
says if dollar sign results check is
greater than 0 then we want to throw
a error message okay so we have more
results than zero which means that we
have the user inside the database with
that username then I want to take the
user back to the signup page that says
user take it or something
afterwards we can actually go ahead and
include a else statement because now we
did in fact check if the user existed
and the last thing I'm going to do here
is to hash the password because right
now forward to actually take the
password that we included from the form
and just put it inside the database we
can actually read it from inside the
database now since the password should
be secure and we want to make sure that
nobody can actually see the password
even me if I had access to the database
I need to hash it to make sure that it
looks unrecognizable okay so what I'm
going to do here is in order to have the
password and make it unrecognizable is
I'm going to first of all write a
comment that says hatching the password
and then underneath here I'm going to
create a variable called hash PWD which
is equal to a function called password
underscore hash which is going to allow
for us to actually hash the password and
insert it inside the database afterwards
so inside the parentheses I want to
include the password that i typed in
inside the input so I'm going to say
variable PWD which is the one we have on
top here then the next parameter is
going to be the method we want to use in
order to has the pass which I'm going to
say we have password underscore default
which is just a default hashing method
so after we did this we can actually go
to the next line write another comment
and then say insert the user into the
database so we do actually insert the
user inside the database let's actually
make sure we spell out correctly like so
now the last thing we need to do is
actually insert data inside the database
so we're going to do here is I'm going
to do the same thing as up here I'm
going to write a variable called SQL
which is equal to double quotes
semicolon the names are double quotes
I'm going to write an insert statement
that inserts data inside our database so
going to say insert into users which is
the table name want to insert it into
then we're going to say parentheses
space values space parentheses semicolon
so now we just need to fill in the
information here so inside the first
parentheses we need to type in the names
of all the columns we want to insert
data into now the first column inside
the users table is going to be the user
underscore ID but because we set this
one to auto incremented when we created
the user's table we don't need to
include this inside the insert statement
because it does it all by itself now the
first one we need to include is the
first name so I'm going to say user
underscore first car math user
underscore last which is the second one
then comment user underscore email
comment user underscore UID comment and
then the last one which is going to be
the user underscore password inside the
second parentheses we need to include
the actual values you want to insert
inside these columns here so inside the
first one we're going to include the
first name which is going to be up here
at the top where we got it from inside
the input we're going to copy it and
paste it inside a pair of single quotes
like so then asteroids are going to
include the last name again inside a
pair of single quotes so I'm going to
say variable last then the third one is
going to be the email the fourth one is
going to be the use IDs are going to say
variable UID and the last one it's not
going to be the password from inside the
input but instead going to be the hash
password we created down here called
variable hashed password like so so
after we did this we just need to write
a result is equal to masculine
underscore query which then takes this
data and inserts it inside the database
now one thing I want to point out is
that I did axe
use the same variable name as up here
which is something we can actually do in
this example here because we don't need
to use this code after we went through
this check up here so this is actually
something don't need anymore
so we can actually rename the variables
down here if you want to inside the
second line here we're going to say
variable results is equal to my sqli
underscore query parentheses we're going
to include the first parameter which is
the connection so conceivable con-com
math and then we're going to include the
variable SQL up here like so so after
including this we did actually run the
code inside the database which means
that we insert all the data into the
database now one thing we could actually
do here because it's not really
necessary is to delete the dollar sign
result is equal to because we just need
this function here just runs the code
inside the database you don't actually
need to use this one anything so we can
just write my score line underscore
query without those summersault now the
last thing we need to do is actually
take user back to the signup page once
it's done signing up so afterwards we're
going to include a header function we
can actually just copy what we have up
here and instead we're going to say
signup is equal to success so let the
user know he actually succeeded in
signing up and again we want to include
the exit function here now before we go
back to the website and test out the
signup form I want to go back inside the
code and just fix the small typo I made
inside the code because I forgot to
include a forward slash where we check
for valid characters in front of the
dollar sign inside of pragmatic function
so I'm going to include that in both of
them and now can actually test out the
signup form now I want to mention one
thing before we do so which is that
right now we did x include a bunch of
error handlers such as checking if
characters are valid or if the email is
valid or if any of the fields are empty
now we could also wanted to just to name
a few more check if the password had a
small letter and a number if we wanted
to make it more secure what we could
also take the user type in admin as the
username since we don't want the use of
the called
admin because they might confuse some
people there's quite a few my error
handlers we could do if you wanted to
but these are just the basic ones that I
think at least should have in
at a sign-up form so now can actually go
back inside our website and forwards to
go ahead and refresh my browser inside
the signup form I can write Daniel
that's my first name Nelson that's my
last name
I can say used and I'm toups at
gmail.com the username could be admin
like I said if we did actually have an
error handler that I could actually
check for this sort of thing I could
allow myself not to write at minute for
one or two inside the password down here
I'm going to say test one two three then
when I click sign up you guys can see
I'm in the URL it says sign up is equal
to success and I can exit go into my
database refresh the users table and now
you guys can see we have a user inside
the table so right now we have Daniel
Nelson my email address the user name
and the password which right now looks
like a bunch of gibberish which is what
we wanted to limit it actually has the
password because right now as you guys
can see I can't access you with the
password actually is and that's a good
thing
so now that we have this we just need to
create the PHP script for the login
system up here in the header so we can
actually go up here and type username or
email and password and then sign
ourselves up inside the website so I'm
going to go back inside my coding files
i'm going to open up a new document
which i'm going to save as login dot inc
dot PHP and I made sure to save it
inside my includes folder so inside this
document here we're going to do a bunch
of the same things as we did inside the
signup form which is first of all we're
going to open up the PHP tags then I'm
going to say we have a if statement that
should be is sets parentheses and check
if we did actually click the submit
button so go and say dollar sign
underscore post brackets single quotes
and submit so a lot of this is going to
be repeated from the signup form inside
the if statement I'm going to say want
to include the database connection so
we're going to say include DBH dot Inc
dot PHP semicolon on the next time I'm
going to include the actual data from
inside the lock
form right now for which to go back
inside my header file you guys consider
right now we just have two inputs we
have one for the username or the email
and the password so I'm going to go back
and set up a login script here and I'm
going to include the two inputs so I'm
going to say we have a beer who called
UID it's equal to dollar sign underscore
post frag gets single quotes UID and now
again just like inside the signup for
many times to include some security to
this so we need to make sure we use the
my sqli underscore real underscore
escape underscore string function which
basically goes in and make sure that
people can type any kind of malicious
code inside the inputs so we're going to
include the connection as the first
parameter then we're going to include
the actual post method in here I'm going
to capitalize this because that is in
fact important and then I'm going to
carve this down to next line then we're
going to get the password so I'm just
going to change this to PWD and then
we're going to go down to the next line
and start the error handlers so I'm
going to write a comment that says error
handlers then I'm going to write a
comment that says they want to check if
these inputs are empty just like we did
with the signup form I'm going to create
an if statement that says if there were
any kind of empty fields inside dollar
sign UID then it needs to run the code
inside the curly brackets or if there
were any kind of empty fields inside our
password then it's going to run whatever
is inside the curly brackets so we also
want to make sure we include the else
statements afterwards so we do actually
need to go after the first if statement
to say else and then say we want to take
the user back to the index page if they
try to access this page without having
clicked the active login button so we're
going to say header parentheses
semicolon double quotes location with
the big L colon space then we're going
to go back on directory by saying dot
dot forward slash
index dot TSP question mark because I
want to say lock-in is equal to era or
something then I'm going to include the
exit function like so just to make sure
we exit the script afterwards so now we
have this we can actually go and include
a else statement inside what we just did
the if statement that takes four empty
fields and inside this else statement
the first thing I want to do is actually
check if the username exists inside the
database so I'm going to say we have a
variable called SQL which is equal to
double quotes semicolon then I want to
write a select statement that selects
any kind of user from the user table
with this username up here so I'm going
to say select all from users where user
underscore UID is equal to single quotes
the use ID from up here like so then I
want to X to run this inside the
database by covering it so I'm going to
say dollar sign result is equal to my
sqli
on the score Corre parentheses
semi-colon and include the first
variable which is going to be the
connection and then the second variable
which is dollar sign SQL then after we
have this we need to check if we had any
kind of results just like we did inside
the signup form so going to say dollar
sign results check is equal to my sqli
on the score num on the score rows which
again returns any kind of indicators
that tells us how many rows was actually
found inside the database using these
search parameters so now we're going to
include the double somersault inside the
parentheses and check if we had any kind
of results so going to say if we had
dollar sign results check that was
lesser than one meaning that we had no
results inside the database then we're
going to return some kind of error
message like I said we need to take the
errors first so we want to check for
error messages first I'm going to copy
the code
down here so we have a header and an
exit function now I'm not going to
change the login is equal to error
because I don't want to give users a
chance to actually get some of the
values inside these inputs so I'm going
to keep this one as log in Eco 2 error
since it doesn't really tell the user
what kind of error message it is so I'm
going to copy this again paste it inside
our first day of statement because we
did forget to do that and do the same
thing where we say lock and equal to
error or in this case since this one
does really tell they use anything say
empty so this is a bit more secure since
it doesn't really tell the user anything
other than you need to fill in both
fields to actually log in so afterwards
after the if statement here we're going
to say else and then we're going to
actually see if the user did in fact
type in the correct password that
matches with the user inside the users
table that we found here so inside the
else statement I'm going to create an if
statements and inside the condition I'm
going to take the data from the user up
here and insert it inside a variable
called dollar sign row I'm going to set
it equal to a function called my sqli
underscore fetch underscore I suck
parentheses then I'm going to take that
to a query from up here called dollar
sign result and insert inside the
parentheses so basically what we're
doing here is we're taking all the data
that we got returned from the database
when we did access search for user and
it gets inserted inside an array in PHP
called dollar sign row means that we can
actually go down inside the if statement
and if want to echo out the user from
inside the database of course simply say
echo dollar sign row brackets and then
inside the brackets a single quotes and
then write the name of the column that I
want to echo out so if want to echo out
the user name I could say user
underscore UID but now we didn't
actually check if the password were the
correct password so we don't want to do
this just yet but just the surrogate is
how would actually do it so inside the
if statement I'm going to check if the
password that the user type in matches
the password from inside the database
now you might be asking well the
password inside the database right now
it's been hashed so one
really mess the password that the user
typed in inside the login field well
we're going to actually has passwords we
also have ad has your function inside
PSP that matches the password that the
user typed in just now with the password
from inside the database if that
password user typed in were to behest so
the way we're going to do this is I'm
going to start by writing a comment that
says be hashing the password then on the
next line I'm going to say we have a
variable called test PWD check it's
equal to a function called password
underscore verify parentheses which is
going to take the password the user
typed in into the login field and match
it up with the password inside the
database so the first parameter is going
to be dollar sign PWD which is what the
user typed in and the second parameter
is going to be the password from inside
the database which in this case like I
showed is go sign Road brackets single
quotes inside the brackets and then we
say user underscore PWD so now we're
matching up the password with the
database password and the next line
we're going to actually check if this
return as a false or true statement
because if the two passwords too
actually met then we're going to get a
true result but if they don't match
we're going to get a false so underneath
a I'm going to say we have an if
statements and inside the condition I'm
going to take the has password check and
saying if it's equal to false because if
it's equal to false then we need to give
some kind of error message and send the
user back to the front page so I'm going
to copy the header and the exit function
up here paste them in and return the
user to the front page with login is
equal to error but if we did actually
get a true statement here then I want to
lock the user in so I'm going to say we
have a else if statement parentheses
curly brackets and then inside the else
if statement I want to take if the hash
password check is equal to true
now you might be asking why did I not
include a else statement instead of an
else if that is because right now we
want to check if these two are in fact
the results if I were to just take for
false up here and the results somehow
end up as a number or character or
something which I don't know how could
happen but in case something weird
happens that doesn't return false is
going to run this code down here if we
don't use an else--if statement so we
need to make sure we use else if in
order to check if the has password is
equal to true okay
so inside the else if statement here we
can actually go ahead and lock in the
user inside the website so I'm going to
write a comment that says block in the
user here now when it comes to locking
in the user inside a website we do it
using something called assessing
variable which is a super global inside
PHP that simply says we have a variable
that we can access inside all pages
inside the website as long as we have a
session going inside our pages so what
we can do here is we can actually go
ahead and set a system variable equal to
the use of data from inside the database
so I'm going to say we have a dollar
sign underscore session brackets is
equal to dollar sign row which is the
data from into that database semicolon
and then we just need to give this
session variable a name so we're going
to say single quotes and I'm going to
call this on you underscore ID because I
want to set the ID of the user which is
equal to dollar sign row brackets single
quotes user underscore ID which is the
column name from inside the database
then I can actually go in and copy this
paste it down a couple more times so we
have about five of them then I'm going
to change the you underscore ID to you
on the score first then the second one
to last which is the first and last name
then I'm going to change the fourth one
to the email and then the last one to
use ID which is to use the name then we
also need to change the dose on row
variables over here so I'm going to say
the second one is the first the third
one is going to be last
the fourth one is going to be email and
the last one is going to be use ID so
now we did this we can actually go ahead
and copy I'll hit an exit function up
here paste them down and send the user
back to the front page with a login
success and then exit the script now
when it comes to these session variables
this one more thing you need to do
inside this file here because like I
said we need to have a session running
inside our website in order for the
session variable to actually work inside
the website so at the top of this
document before we do anything we need
to start a session and when it comes to
PHP we have a very basic function called
session underscore start parenthesis
which simply starts up the session
inside this website here so I'm going to
copy the session underscore start and
paste it in inside my head of the PHP
file as well at the very top of the
documents because I want to start a
session and all my pages inside my
website otherwise we cannot have the
user logged in inside that page so I'm
going to start it here now inside the
header file we also need to scroll down
to the form because we forgot to include
the action and the method inside the
form tag so we're going to say form
action is equal to include folder
forward slash login dot Inc dot PHP
which is the family just created inside
the separate file over here we also need
to include a method inside the form so
I'm going to say method it's equal to
double quotes host and now can actually
go inside the website and test this out
so I'm going to refresh and I'm going to
say that the username is going to be
admin and the password is going to be
test123
login and now I gasp can see we get
lock-in equal to success so now we are
in fact locked in inside the website and
everything is working like it should so
now we can actually go inside our code
and test out the login system box
including some content inside our pages
that we couldn't usually see if you were
not locked in so I could actually go
inside my index file go down inside my
section here underneath the home h2 tags
next include some PHP code that spits
out some kind of content inside the
website if I'm locked in so inside the
PHP text I'm going to say if is set
which is the same function we used
inside the signup script and the login
script so I'm going to check if we have
a session variable set inside the
website then it's going to do whatever's
inside the if statement so I'm going to
say it's set dollar sign underscore
session brackets single quotes and if we
had a u underscore I'd be set in
variable then it's going to do
whatever's inside the if statement so I
can actually say echo you are locked in
then we can go inside the website
refresh and you guys can see it says you
are locked in because we are in fact
locked in right now so now the basics
are working we need to do a couple of
changes because right now we only made
it so that you need to type in the
username and the email in order to log
in and we also need to change it so that
when you do actually log in we see a
logout button at the top here so the way
we do that is by going back inside our
login script inside login letting the
PSP and the first thing we're going to
do is we're going to go ahead and allow
for people to write in the email order
user name inside the input so I'm going
to say we have the select statement here
this is like all from users where use ID
is equal to use ID I'm going to say or
afterwards user underscore email is
equal to single quotes the use IB
variable up here because the user ID
variable is going to get either the user
name or the email from inside the login
form so we need to make sure we check if
it's equal to either the user name or
the email inside the database okay so
now we did this we can actually go ahead
and use the email to log in so what we
can do is after you create the log out
button is check out if we can do this
using an email as well so inside our
website here we're going to go inside
our header file and we're going to make
a few changes to our forms to make sure
that it only shows if we are not logged
in and if we are logged in
want to show the lockout form instead so
I'm going to say we have some PHP code
by opening up the PHP tags in fact the
PHP tags we're going to say if is set
just like the for parentheses we have a
session variable that has the name as
you on the school ID then we want to
show a lock out from inside the website
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to go and create a logout form down here
just we can write it in HTML and
afterwards pasted in inside the PHP code
up here so I'm going to say we have a
form that has an action set equal to
includes /log bounce dot Inc dot PHP
then also want to include a method which
is going to be a post method because we
don't have any kind of data we want to
pass inside the Lockhart form we
technically don't need to have this
method here but just to have it I'm
going to include it so inside the form
tags I'm going to say we have a button
that says go walk out then inside the
bottom tags we're going to check for a
submits so we say we have a type submits
and the name that's equal to submit like
so now the reason we don't need to
include any kind of input C is because
we just need to click the button and
then load the lock out that inka PHP
file which simply locks us out without
needing to have any kind of theta from
inside this form here so we just need to
have the button in here so after we do
this I can actually go ahead and copy
this code can we just wrote and paste it
inside an echo inside the if statement
so going to say echo I'm going to say
single quotes and then paste in the code
and just move it also looks a bit nice
like so then we can actually go and
write an else statements which basically
means if we're not locked in then it's
going to show the login form so going to
copy the login and signup form from down
here
delete it and insert it inside the else
statements and again I'm going to use
single quotes
just so we don't get confused about our
double quote to use inside the HTML code
so just going to move everything up so
it looks nice like so and now we just
need to include the lockout the link the
PHP file by creating new documents
saving it as to lock out dot Inc dot PHP
inside include full of course inside
this file we just need to open up the
PHP tags we're going to say if it sets
fantasies taller sign underscore post
brackets then we're going to check for a
sick mix and then I'm going to go down
inside the curly brackets and write a
couple of different functions which is
basically going to lock us out inside
the website so the first function is
going to be session underscore unset
which basically mean we're going to
unset all the session variables inside
the browser then we're going to write
one called session underscore destroy
which is just basically going to destroy
any sessions inside the browser so we
don't have any sessions running inside
the website and then we're going to
simply take us back to the front page so
we're going to write a header function
going to say double quotes location call
one dot dot forward slash index dot PHP
now one more function we need to include
in here is a session start because we
need to actually have the session
running inside this document here in no
tax to destroy it to noose a station
underscore start at the very top here
and this is basically all we need to do
inside this file we can also go ahead
and include a exit function if one or
two like so and now if I go back to the
front page refresh you guys can see we
have a logout button because right now
we're actually locked in meaning that we
shouldn't be able to see the login form
or the signup button so can either click
logout and as you guys can see now we're
locked out from the user again I can go
up and actually type in the email
address this time use MN suits F
gmail.com and then I can type in the
password as test123 and click login now
you guys can see we're locked in again
so this is basically how we can create a
complete login system from scratch using
HTML CSS a database and PHP code if you
want to get the lesson files from this
lesson here you can go and download them
in the description and I hope you guys
completed this tutorial without having
any kind of big errors inside your code
so if you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys
