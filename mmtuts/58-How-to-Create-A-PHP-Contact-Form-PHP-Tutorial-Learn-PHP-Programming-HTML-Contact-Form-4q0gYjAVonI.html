contact form inside our website and this
is something guys a requested of me to
do so today we're going to do it as you
guys can see here I have a very basic
index page that has nothing special
inside of it except for maybe a pair of
main tanks and inside the main text is
what we're going to create the contact
form using HTML that it's going to send
the email from our website to some kind
of email address we have now one thing I
want to point out here is that I'm not
going to style in this lesson here
because it's not really the main purpose
of today's tutorial but I did actually
create some styling that I'm just going
to apply after we created the form just
so we have something nice to look at
inside the website so if you guys want
to style it just go ahead and style it
after we created the contact form okay
so the first thing I'm going to do
inside the main text is I'm going to
create a paragraph because I would like
to have a title for my contact form so
I'm going to say send e-mail just so
people know exactly what they're doing
inside this form here and underneath
here I'm going to create a pair of form
tags now I just use to shortcut by
clicking tap and inside the attributes a
we're just gonna go ahead and add a
class to the form tag I'm gonna call
this one contact - form and again this
is for styling purposes we don't really
need this in order to actually get this
working technically but I'm just gonna
go and include the class now the action
we're going to change to contact form
that PHP like so and the method is going
to be a post method now inside the form
tags we're going to create the first
input tag we're just going to be set to
text we're gonna set the name to name
because I would like for people to
actually send me the name of you know
whoever is sending me an email so I'm
going to have that as an input I'm not
gonna set a value but I will set a
placeholder which I'm going to set to
full name then I'm just gonna copy the
input paste it underneath here a couple
more times
and then I'm gonna change the second one
to mail because we want to have an email
from the person who sent us an email
we're going to change the placeholder to
your e
male now the third input we're going to
change the name to subject we're going
to change the placeholder to subject now
underneath the input we're going to
create a text area and we're just going
to go ahead and change the name to
message we're going to change the
placeholder which we don't have yet so
I'm just going to copy it from up here
and replace the other attributes we had
as a default when I created the shortcut
and I'm going to change the placeholder
to message underneath the text area I'm
going to insert a button I'm going to
change the type to submits and the name
is going to be submit like so inside the
button we're going to have a piece of
text that says send mail and that is
pretty much all we need to have in order
to get this form working so what you go
inside the browser refresh you guys can
see we have a very basic form it's not
stylish yet so it doesn't look pretty
but if we were to go inside my index
page and just add my stylesheet to it so
I'm just gonna create a link to my style
sheet so I'm gonna say style dot CSS I'm
also gonna go ahead and import a new
font inside the website because I would
like to not just use the default fonts
and again this is basic HTML so I'm not
really gonna get too much into how to
import fonts you guys should know that
by now so we're gonna save it refers to
browser and as you guys can see we now
have a slightly different looking
contact form so we can actually type
things inside C if you want to and right
now nothing is going to happen when we
do actually click send mail so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go back
inside my website and I'm going to
create a new page or a new file I'm
going to save this file inside my root
folder as contact form dot PHP like so
and inside the contact form the PHP file
I'm going to open up the PHP tags so you
can actually create some PHP code
and the first thing I'm going to create
is an if statement because we need to
actually check if we did actually submit
the contact form so I'm going to say is
set which is a function then I'm going
to check for a post method called
submits because that's what I call the
button when I clicked it then inside the
curly brackets we're going to start
creating the actual script that will
access send the email so the first thing
we need to do is we need to get the
actual data that the user wrote inside
the inputs and the text area so I'm
going to say we have a variable and the
first one is going to be named name
which is equal to dollar sign underscore
post brackets semicolon inside the
brackets we're going to say we have an
input that had a name as name I'm going
to copy this line of code paste it
underneath three more times because we
had four inputs in total including the
text area I'm going to change the second
one to subject inside the name over here
as well inside the post name and I'm
going to change the third one to mail
from because you want to know who sex is
sending the mail and the way I usually
do it is by saying meal from when I name
a variable here I'm going to change the
post name to male because that was the
email the person sent to us and then the
last one down is going to be message and
I'm going to change it inside the post
method as well like so so now we have
all the data from the contact form and
the next thing we need to do is we need
to prepare a PHP function called mail so
we're going to say we have a method
called male parentheses semicolon and
inside the mail function we need to have
at least three parameters the first one
is going to be the email that we want to
send a mail to which is going to be us
because it's other people going inside
our website sending an email to us the
second one is going to be the subject of
the mail the third one is going to be
the actual message of the mail now we do
also have a couple of optional
parameters after
the actual message and the one that
we're going to focus on this episode is
the one called a header so what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to go back
up in between the data we got from the
person and the mail function and I'm
going to create some of the ones that
were missing inside the mail function so
right now we need to have a variable
that has the email that the mail needs
to send to so I'm going to say we have a
variable called mail 2 which is equal to
some kind of email address and that's
going to be my email address which at
the moment is Danny ants mmm toots dot
net like so now one thing I need to
point out here is that if you want to
send to your own gmail address it's not
going to work because Gmail or Google is
going to block the emails that you send
using the mail function built into PHP
so you will not be able to send to your
email address if that's what you wish to
do but I do have a way for you to get
around it if you want to have the mail
sent to your Gmail so I will show you
guys how to do that at the end of this
episode here ok so after we have the
email address we need to have the header
that I want to include so I'm going to
save a variable called headers which I'm
going to set equal to and inside the
headers we can actually add extra
information to the mail when they do X
send it to us this could be who the mail
is from so you can actually see you know
when you receive the mail who it's
actually from it could also be a CC if
you want other people to receive the
email when the two exes ended there's a
couple of things we can add in here but
the one we're going to focus on is going
to be who the mail is from because
that's the one I think is really
important so we're going to say double
quotes then we're gonna write from with
a big F :
space now we could just write from my
website if you wanted to and then it's
actually going to say that it's from
your website when you receive the email
but I would actually like for it to show
the email of the person who sent the
message to us so I'm going to go after
double quote write dots and then include
the the email from the person who
actually filled in the contact form
which is the mail from up here that we
got from the person there we go
underneath the headers I'm going to
include one more piece of information
which is going to be the actual message
that we're going to receive inside our
email you
might be thinking well didn't the user
already write a message up here well
sometimes we want to have a customized
message when we have it sent to us so
we're going to do that as well so I'm
going to save a variable called txt
which stands for text which is equal to
double quotes and then I'm going to say
that we have a message saying you have
received an email from space and then
after the double quote I'm going to say
dots then the name of the person which
is up here pasted in and now what I want
to do is I want to end up this line here
with the punctuation go down two lines
and then actually write the entire
message to person sent to us and the way
we're going to do this is first of all
we need to change back to a string and
then we need to add the punctuation at
the end of the line and then in order to
jump down to lines
I'm going to say not forward slash but
backslash n which means that we're going
to a new line then we're going to add
one more because we want to jump down to
lines to get a bit of spacing between
this message here and the actual message
the person sent to me which again if you
guys are confused about this I'll show
you guys when I do actually receive the
email okay
afterwards we're going to say
punctuation and then I want to add the
message so I'm going to say we have a
variable called message semicolon and
now we have the entire message sent to
us so what we need to do now is we just
simply need to fill in the mail function
that we have down here so we're going to
say we have a function called mail -
which is up here comma and then we want
to have the subject which is going to be
up here I'm gonna paste it in comma and
then the third one is going to be the
text or the message that is being sent
to us comma and then I want to include
the headers here because I want to have
who it's from and there we go now the
last thing we need to include is of
course a function that takes us back to
the front page when this page has loaded
and it's done so I'm going to say header
parentheses after the mail function and
then inside the parentheses I'm going to
say we have double quotes location with
a big L colon space index dot PHP
question mark
sent just so we get some kind of
confirmation that the male has actually
been sent and the contact script has
actually been loaded okay so now what we
need to do is we need to test it out now
this is where you're going to run into a
problem because this might not work if
you're using localhost as your way to do
the PHP lesson here with me again you
guys can see i'm also using localhost to
actually show you guys so there's two
methods we can choose if you want to
actually test out if this is actually
working or not one being that we need to
change the PHP dot ini file inside our
localhost server which we downloaded
using xampp or we can simply upload this
to an online server such as a website to
actually test if it's actually working
now I chose to not do the complicated
thing and change my PHP ini file so I
simply uploaded it to my mmm toots net
website and just put it inside a
different directory just so we could
test it out so as you guys can see this
is acting my online version that that
has all the code working so what I'm
going to do before we actually test this
out is to show you guys that I have a
inbox from inside one that come with
which are the people that are actually
hosting my website right now and inside
my inbox I have no messages that I
deleted everything so we could test it
out and what I'm going to do is I'm just
gonna go ahead and send an email to
myself so I'm going to write Danielle
Nelson I'm going to say that my email is
use mmm toots at gmail.com and again
remember this is not the email that
you're going to send - this is the email
address that I'm saying that my email
address is as the person visit your
website so this is not going to mess up
anything because it's at email address
I'm gonna go down to the next line and
I'm going to say we have a subject
saying hi there or something then I'm
going to write a message that says I am
testing with this email function inside
your website then what we can do is we
can actually test out the message and
send in and as you guys can see up
inside my UL I do get a mail send
confirmation if I go inside my webmail
you guys can see that if I
fresh after a few seconds I've received
my email and as you guys can see it says
that it's from yous mmm toots which is
what I wrote inside my contact form and
the subject is hi there
if I opened it up you guys can see that
we have a from a2 and the missus down
here that has spacing in between it
because he wrote the backslash n
backslash n you know together on a new
line so this is basically how we can get
this email system working now the last
thing we're going to do here is I'm
going to show you guys how you can
actually receive emails using Gmail if
you want to so what I'm going to do here
as the solution is that right now I'm
inside my hosting service I'm actually
logged in to my dashboard over here in a
different tab and if you're familiar
with your hosting service you should
know that if you go inside the dashboard
you can go inside the email settings and
then you can forward messages that you
receive inside your hosting service so
the mailbox that I have here which is
inside one that comes on website I can
actually forward these messages to my
email address if I want to so I can
either create a new alias down here and
forward it so I'm always going to
receive the emails in some and email
address as well so this is how we'll
actually go around fixing this if you
want to have messages sent to your email
address okay now this was basically one
one to show you guys today so hope you
guys enjoyed I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
