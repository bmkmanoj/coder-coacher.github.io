combine text with JavaScript code inside
JavaScript code and we're also going to
talk about how to include other coding
languages inside JavaScript now the
reason I want to do this is because for
the past couple episodes we talked about
how to include or how to combine
variables with strings inside JavaScript
code but I haven't actually explained
how or why you need to do so
so just to spend one episode explaining
that we're gonna do that today so as you
guys can see right now I have two
variables up here one call first and
we'll call last and then I have my first
name and my last name inside of them as
values I also have a function called
full name and the basic idea here is
that when I call out my full name
function down here I write out my full
name with a space in between so if I
were to combine two variables inside my
function here I can go ahead and write
return so make sure we actually return
some kind of value that we can write out
inside the browser down here I'm gonna
write return first just to see how this
looks like I'm gonna go and refresh the
browser as you guys can see right now it
says undefined because I have nothing
inside my function so it doesn't really
know what to write so just write
undefined if i refresh now you guys can
see it says Daniel if I were to put my
last name behind my first name the way
to do this is not by writing space and
then writing last because if I do this
we get some we get basically get nothing
because it doesn't understand what this
is so I'm going to combine two different
variables we need to separate them with
a plus because we're saying okay we're
attaching something behind this piece of
JavaScript code you know this is one
piece of JavaScript code and this is
another piece of JavaScript code so we
need to combine them by writing plus if
I were to refresh the browser now you
guys can see it says Daniel Nelson but
we have no space in between and that's
because it's going to combine it
directly behind it it doesn't matter if
you wrote a space in between the plus or
not it's just gonna combine it as one
piece of text so if I want to have a
space in between them we need to include
a string and the string is just going to
be a basic string with a space in
out of it so if I were to go right after
the plus simple and say okay so we have
JavaScript code now we need to have a
string right after it we're switching
from JavaScript to a string and we also
need to separate it by a plus symbol so
if we go after the plus I'm gonna write
a string all right in double quotes and
then I can write space so now we have a
space in between them but wait we have
another piece of JavaScript code after
the double quotes so we need to make
sure we also have a plus symbol in
between these two so for where to
refresh the browser now you guys can see
we get a space in between so basically
when we switch from javascript code to a
string we need to add a plus and when we
go back from a string to JavaScript code
we need to add a plus and we can do this
as many times as you want so this was
how to include a string and of course
you know I could write some text in
between here would also show inside the
browser like so but let's say if I want
to style this piece of text I want to
style Daniel Nelson by including you
know HTML code around it what I can do
here is I can go ahead and go right
before first and I can include another
string separating the string from first
with a plus symbol of course because we
need to do that and then I can go ahead
and write HTML code directly inside the
string so forward to right lesser than P
greater than which is a paragraph tag in
HTML code then we can basically start
out our HTML code around you know the
first and last name variables of course
at the end here we also need to have the
paragraph closed so we need to include
another string when we close off the
paragraph tag okay zoom out a bit so we
can see everything and this is basically
how we can include HTML code
right now we have paragraph tags around
it but if I want to style it I can just
simply style it inside here I want to
again we need to write to single quotes
because we do have double quotes around
here or we can include a class like so
that's basic you know it's just basic
HTML styling so I'm not gonna go into
how to style this confuse you should
know how to do this by now but that's
basically how I can do it now when it
comes to PHP code if some of you guys
have a PHP background let's actually go
ahead and delete what we have here so
now I just have a basic string if I want
to write PHP code a typical habit from
coders that has you know PHP as a
background is to write the opening PHP
tags and then go down a couple lines and
then close the PHP tags but wait we get
an error message and that's because we
have a you know a document right or a
return and we want to write PHP code we
can't have lines in between like this so
we basically need to have everything on
one line like so and then we can for
example echo out I don't know some kind
of string again in PHP but it could be
hi there if you wanted to so that's
basically how would include PHP code
inside JavaScript do you remember we
cannot go down to the next line like we
would in PHP code because otherwise it's
not gonna see it as you know part of the
return string up here or the return line
so that's basically how we can combine
you know JavaScript with other pieces of
code or combine strings with JavaScript
I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
