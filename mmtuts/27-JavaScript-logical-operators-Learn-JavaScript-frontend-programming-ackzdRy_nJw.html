something called logical operators
inside JavaScript and logical operators
very much go hand-in-hand the previous
episode we did where we talked about
something called comparison operators so
as you guys can see inside my document
here have very basic item if I've set up
I have a paragraph that has an ideas
test and inside my script tags I have a
variable called X which is equal to 10
and then inside my if statement down
here I'm basically checking if X is
equal to 10 so what we can use logical
operators for is we can go ahead and
include another condition so right now
I'm just taking X is equal to 10 but I
can also go ahead and check if another
condition is true as well so just to
show you guys if I were to go inside the
browser right now X is equal to 10 as we
can see up here meaning the right now
inside the browser we should be getting
it works if I go ahead and go inside my
browser as you guys can see we get it
works so if I want to check for a second
condition I can go ahead and go after
the first condition here and say
ampersand ampersand which is you know
the ends simple we have inside most
languages and I can go ahead and include
my second condition so for were to say
if X is also equal to 5 which right now
we know it's not I can go ahead refresh
the browser and as you guys can see we
now get nothing so right now inside the
if statement what were actually doing
here is what checking if both of these
are actually true if X is equal to 10
and X is equal to 5 now what we can
actually do here is instead of saying
and is we can actually go and say or to
check if just one of them has to be true
so if I were to change the ampersand to
what we call a pipe or a vertical line
inside you know the keyboard language
which look like this we can actually go
ahead and check if one of them are true
so if I go ahead and save this go inside
my browser X is in fact equal to 10 so
one of them are true X is not equal to 5
but we should still get whatever's in
here because just one of them has to be
true so inside the browser as you guys
can see we get it works so these are
what we call logical operators
and these are quite useful when you want
to set multiple conditions inside a
statement now what we can actually do
here is we can actually go and insert
more logical operators inside one if
statement by adding another variable up
here but we can say well we have X we
should also have a Y which is equal to
five and then what I can do is I can
actually go inside the if statement and
say well if Y is equal to five and X is
equal to ten or equal to five so right
now Y has to be equal to five because we
have an ampersand symbol down here but X
can either be 10 or it can be five so
and always goes first and then
afterwards we'd go in and check if one
of these are equal to you know
whatever's up here if I couldn't save
this go inside my brows as you guys can
see we now get it works because you know
it is in fact true because Y is equal to
five and one of these are equal to ten
now the last logical operator we're
going to talk about something called a
not operator and basically what this one
does is that it's X if a certain
statement or condition is false so as
you guys can see it actually changed on
my code right now we have X is equal to
ten Y is equal to five what I'm doing
here is I'm gonna go ahead and check if
X is not equal to Y now the way we do
that is by putting X is equal to Y and
inside another set of parentheses like
so and then at the beginning of the
inner parentheses we have inside of here
we have X is equal to Y we're gonna go
ahead and set an exclamation mark
so right now whatever's inside these
parentheses here it's gonna go ahead and
check if it's false or if it's true if
it's false it's gonna go ahead and write
whatever is down here if it's true it's
not gonna write whatever is inside the
curly brackets so if we go ahead and
save this go inside my brows as you guys
can see it now says it works if I were
to actually couldn't change Y so it is
in fact equal to ten it means that this
operator here is not going to be equal
to false meaning there right now you
should not spit anything inside the
browser if you go ahead and refresh you
guys can see we get nothing so this is
the basic idea behind logical operators
there's three of them we have the and/or
and then we
the not operator hope you guys enjoyed
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
