there's a couple of things I want to
explain which didn't really occur to me
until later that this is something that
you guys might want to know and this is
why I have a different background I have
a different operating system I just
simply created this video like five
videos ahead of where we are right now
and then shoved it back as one of the
first videos in this series so you guys
could know this before you get started
now what I want to talk about is what
you can do with HTML and CSS because I
expect you guys to be at least if you're
watching this series I expect you guys
to be fairly new when it comes to
programming and you might have been told
that well if you want to learn how to
make websites you need to start out by
learning HTML and CSS well that is true
if you want to make websites you can
make a complete website only using HTML
CSS but without any other kind of coding
languages there's going to be a lot of
functionalities missing from your
websites to give an example using HTML
and CSS you'll be able to create a lot
of different designs you will be able to
create a lot of different front-end
programming which is what you call the
stuff that you can actually see on a
website for example I have MS on that
come open here as an example and this is
a site in case you didn't know that
sells a lot of different things which
means that it has a lot of design
elements it also has a lot of back-end
elements so when we have this site we
can see that it has a header up here
with a menu down here it has a search
bar it has a lock in system over here it
has a card and down here in the body we
have a banner we have some products and
at the very bottom we have a footer with
some different menu links on it now with
HTML and CSS you can create all of this
you can create the look of it but you
can't create the functionality behind
some of the buttons we have here for
example you can code this link over here
that says hello sign in and then your
accountant name can click the sign in
button but you won't actually be able to
sign in using HTML CSS in order to
create a locking account you're going to
need to know for example a coded
language such as PHP ok so you can
create websites that has
the look and has links that takes you to
other pages and that kind of thing but
if you want to create a login system if
you want to create a card if you want to
have a system that automatically updates
what kind of items you have down here in
your shopping I like inside your shop
then you're going to need to learn out
the languages such as JavaScript or PHP
or something else HTML CSS is only for
front-end which is what you call you
know the stuff that you can actually
physically see on this website now when
you get into this series we will talk
about how to create a complete website
and yes you can like I said create a
complete website with only HTML and CSS
and we'll talk about how to do this but
it also means that we won't be able to
create all these other stuff so when
people tell you oh you want to learn how
to build a complete website yes you do
need to get through how to do a 2-month
CSS because without HTML CSS it's going
to be very tough to build a website only
using PHP for example PHP JavaScript
jQuery all that stuff is something that
you build on top of
HTML CSS and HTML and CSS are kind of
like the foundation of what you need to
know in order to build a website ok so
that's what we're going to be doing in
this series we're going to be learning
how to build a website the look of it of
course after we design some kind of
design we can create a website and then
when you want to add the functionalities
and all the cool you know animations on
top of the website and that kind of
stuff then you will have to learn other
different kinds of coding languages okay
so just so you guys keep in mind that
that is what HTML CSS is it's only to
design you can code how it looks like
but if you want to have functionality
such as a login system or something like
that then you're going to need to use a
database which means that you need to
learn something called PHP or something
else okay so hope you guys enjoyed this
episode and we will get started on the
next episode and actually doing
something with the site</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
