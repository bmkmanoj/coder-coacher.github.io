series now to optic go into programming
using PHP code now the Custis is the
first episode and optical range of
programming I'm going to spend this
episode explaining what exactly optic go
into programming is because it's very
important that you guys understand what
it is if you have never done anything
with object-oriented programming before
so if you're completely familiar with
object-oriented programming you don't
need to watch this episode the reason I
want to do a small episode on just
explaining what exactly it is it's
because I remember back when I was
learning up to go into programming you
know back when I'm studying my
bachelor's the teacher had a specific
way of explaining optical into
programming that didn't make sense to
the entire class so it's very important
to me that I understand this in a way
that you guys understand it and know
exactly why we need to use optical into
PHP programming versus the other way we
do it in the past okay now when it comes
to PHP programming the way we've been
doing it in my other series that's just
called PHP we use something called
procedural programming now what that
means is that when we have a website
such as there's a regular website with a
login system you would just go ahead and
create the PHP code and insert it inside
the document whenever we needed to use
it meaning that if I had a signup form
inside my website I would just create
the PHP code inside the HTML page or
inside the PHP document where I had the
signup form whereas in after go into PHP
programming we create separate documents
only meant for PHP code that has
something in it called classes now
classes contain something called
properties and methods that we use
regarding one specific thing inside our
website now if that sounded confusing it
will sound confusing you've never done
anything with Optical into PHP program
before so don't get scared that you
don't understand what classes and
properties and methods are just go ahead
and follow the lessons and you will
understand in no time so the basic idea
here is that let's say we have this
login system inside a website and I need
to create the PHP code for this login
system now what I can do
you instead of just creating the code
where I need to use it inside the PHP
documents I'm going to go ahead and
create a separate document that has a
class which is just a very big container
to a lot of code that I use regarding
login systems so this class might be
called login now inside this login class
we have properties and methods which is
another way of saying we have variables
and functions that are saved inside this
class now don't get me wrong properties
and methods are not the same as
variables and functions but they work in
a very similar way okay
so inside this class regarding logged in
systems we have code that does something
regarding the login system and because
we do it this way if I were to do
anything else inside the website you
know in another page regarding a signup
form I can reuse the code inside the
class rather than creating the code
again inside the website okay so we can
actually reuse code again and again and
again which is one of the benefits from
using off to go into PHP programming now
another benefit from optik go into PHP
programming is that when you if you want
to work at a marketing agency you know a
place where they actually create
websites for companies in that sort of
thing it's pretty much a standard today
that you need to understand off the
grounds of PHP programming because low
key
which is what we call a big range of PHP
programming is a format that all
programmers understand with procedural
code I have one way of coding it another
programmer has another way of coding it
meaning that we might not understand the
code that each you know each person
wrote so after going through PSP
programming kind of solves that problem
because we need to understand what other
people program when we have other people
that we work with now you might be
asking well it's after going to PHP
programming better than procedural
programming you know we just create the
code wherever we need to use it inside
our document well if the code is just
meant for you to use and you just create
the code for small applications then no
it doesn't matter to do after go into
PHP programming or procedural
programming like a login system
I would say it's borderlining you know
where you need to start considering
using off to go into PHP programming
because now you're starting to create a
larger application but I just want to
highlight that a lot of people at least
a lot of programmers don't believe that
obstacle onto PSD programming is better
than procedural some people think that
do exactly the same thing where a person
like me think that updater into PHP
programming if used right can do a lot
more beneficial things when it comes to
larger applications so if you're
watching this series and thinking well
after going through PHP programming
sounds much too complicated or might be
too difficult to learn versus what
you're actually getting out of it then
you shouldn't look at it as a bad thing
to just want to go with procedural
programming just remember that if you
want to work with this in the future
you're going to need to look into
optical into PHP programming but it's
really not that difficult to learn I
just want to emphasize that because it
really depends on who's explaining it to
you now another thing I want to mention
regarding optical into PHP programming
which is one thing that if you guys have
actually been googling it looking for
tutorials is that when you go to
different tutorial sites optic go into
PSD programming will be taught
differently by pretty much everyone and
the reason for this is that we have
different patterns in optical into PHP
programming now what patterns means is
that when you have opted run to PHP
programming you have a specific formula
or a specific pattern that you create
the code in meaning that if I were to
learn this from one website they might
be using something called constructor
patterns where another tutorial series
might not be using constructors which is
something that we will be talking about
in this series here because constructors
seem pretty important when it comes to
having the proper format of
object-oriented PHP programming but it's
different what people teach you when it
comes to object-oriented PHP programming
so I just want to mention before you get
started in this series that what we're
going to be doing is we're going to go
ahead and use what's called an MVC
pattern which stands for Model View
controller and it's a pattern that was
created quite a while back which was
used mainly for other types of
languages but has been incorporated into
PHP when it comes to Hopi programming
and we're going to go and use in this
series here now in the next episode I
will be explaining what exactly an MVC
model is you know motor view controller
and why we need to do it this way at
least when it comes to my tutorial
series here in the future we might be
looking into other design patterns but
for now in the beginning here we're
going to focus on the MVC pattern since
it's pretty popular out there so I hope
you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
