talk about the differences between a
class and an ID and when we need to use
them because you did actually use them a
couple of times in the past episodes but
I really want to make sure that you guys
understand exactly what the differences
are so when we take this one for example
we did actually create a div then we
named wrapper by adding a class to it
and the reason we did that was so we
could target that specific element
inside our style sheet now the main
usage of classes and ID's is so that we
can target specific HTML elements such
as headers divs images you know any kind
of HTML tag we have you can apply a
class on ID too and then you can target
them inside a style sheet now there's
also a couple of other differences first
of all I want to mention that classes
can be used multiple times for example I
can take this class a Pico wrapper I can
copy it apply to my header my image my
nav my section I can add it everywhere
and it's not going to give me any kind
of error if I want to use IDs however if
I were to go ahead and give this header
a ID equal to put say to Mark's test if
I were to copy this one like this would
actually be okay but if I were to copy
it and apply it to my nav tag down here
it would not like it and the reason it's
not going to like it
it's because ID simply cannot be used
twice inside the same page or inside the
same element so we want to be careful
about when we need to use e either one
of them and a good rule of thumb is that
if you don't have a specific reason for
using IDs don't use IDs because classes
can simply be used for when it comes to
something like styling so you might be
asking now well if you justice might use
classes why even have IDs well there's
some times like there's some examples of
where you actually do need to use IDs
instead of classes in CSS for example it
doesn't really matter if you're using
IDs or classes because CSS doesn't care
now if you were to use JavaScript which
is another kind of coding language it
will actually care if you're using IDs
or classes another thing is that IDs to
actually have some browser
functionalities such as if I were to
let's say I'm going to give the footer
an ID equal to test and then I go up to
the very top here and inside my header I
create a link and a link to create by
writing a a inside the HTML tags and
then you write href to link to something
if I were to link to the ID that I added
to the footer by writing hash tag test
and I were to click on this link it
would actually take me down to the
footer on the same page so you can
actually link to other parts of the page
rather than just on other pages so
there's a couple of differences between
using IDs and classes and we are
probably not going to be using IDs in
our tutorial series but mainly going to
focus on classes since we're only doing
HTML and CSS so when I when there's no
reason to use IDs if you don't have any
reason in mind
don't use IDs at least that's my rule of
thumb for you guys don't use IDs then so
last thing before we end off if you do
want to apply multiple classes and you
have a question about how you do that
for example let's say I have this
wrapper up here and I want to add
another class to it all you have to do
is go inside the class equal to and then
after the first class has been applied
with this wrapper in this case I'm just
going to write space and then write for
example another class called tests then
we do have two classes applied to this
one so now that we got that straightened
out and I kind of got explained what
classes and ID's are I think we can I
think we can continue with this series
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
