import footage inside premier and as you
guys can see we do actually have a
timeline down here but we don't have any
clips who connected put inside of it now
in order to import footage we could do
it in a couple of different ways we can
either double click down at the project
window down in the left side and then we
can actually browse for Clips we want to
import we can also go ahead and right
click click import or you can simply
find the footage somewhere in your
computer highlight it and drag it inside
your project window now I do have two
clips here one is of a air show that I
attended a couple of weeks ago and the
other one is up my workplace so I'm just
going to go ahead and drag them inside
my project window once we add them in
here we can actually go and drag it
inside our timeline now the thing about
dragging footage inside the timeline is
that when we set up our sequence which
is the actual timeline down here we told
it that we wanted it to be 1920 by 1080
30 frames per second now in a lot of
cases when you try to drag footage it's
inside your timeline if that footage
does not match those specifications it's
gonna ask you a question so let's
actually go ahead and drag one of the
clips in here right now it says clip
mismatch warning which basically means
that the footage does not match the
timeline settings so we have two options
here either we can change the sequence
settings which means that the sequence
will actually match up with the footage
settings or we can actually go and take
the footage and just simply put it in
and be a mismatch to the sequence now
typically I choose to actually keep the
existing settings which means that the
footage will not match the sequence
because we want the footage to be the
same as the sequence which means you
have to change the footage afterwards
rather than changing the sequence
settings so I'm going to go ahead and
say keep existing settings now what you
guys would notice
or maybe you can't see it because you
haven't actually seen the clip yet but
part of the footage is actually missing
on the side here because the resolution
of this footage is 2560 by 1440 so the
way we contains this is we can actually
go and click the footage and then you
guys can see we get some
since up in the effects controls and
without having put any kind of effects
on the footage you will have some
default things you can change in here
I'm gonna go ahead and go to motion and
then I can actually change the size of
my video clip and right now this should
actually be you know 1080 or 1920 by
1080 which it is not right now it's 1440
so I'm gonna go ahead and scale it down
to 75 from 100 which means that right
now it's actually 1920 by 1080 so that's
basically how we can import footage and
drag it into the timeline and actually
change the settings if we need it to so
as you guys can see we do have it inside
our preview window we can actually play
it and as you guys can see I'm just
simply getting some you know just basic
recording my my workplace and that's
essentially how we input footage and use
it I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
