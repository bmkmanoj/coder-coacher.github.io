automatic method inside of the ignorance
of programming
now this Mantic method is called to
string and it's used in order to avoid
errors who do actually want to echo out
the entire object we have inside while
instantiate a class to give you guys an
example let's actually go and see what
we have here so far inside my index page
to have an object called objects then
instantiates the new class class now
what I want to do here is I do actually
want to output objects inside an echo
now this is something that we usually
don't do but in case we for some reason
do it by accidentally doing it through
some kind of scripts I want to sir gasps
what kind of error message we're getting
so right now as you guys can see if we
were to echo out objects inside the
browser we get this error message that
says catchable fatal error object of
class new class could not be converted
to string in blah blah blah line 13 so
if this words will happen inside a
script we want to give it some kind of
methods instead of having this you know
error message showing inside our website
so a way to to actually fix this is to
use the magic method called two string
if we were to go inside my class and go
down underneath my constructor here you
know just anywhere inside the class I
can go ahead and say we have a public
function and it's going to be called on
the score underscore two string and we
need to make sure we use a big s so a
capitalized s after you have moved the
function we can go ahead and write some
kind of message in here either by simply
echoing something or we could go ahead
and point to one of the properties we
have inside this class here what we
could actually do is I could actually go
in and create a second property which
shows the error message I can go and
call this one error and I can say this
is the class called new class like so so
now what we can do inside the to string
method in here we can actually go ahead
and refer to this property by saying one
to echo to string method colon space and
then I'm gonna jump down to neck
slide and say want to return a property
from this class called this we're going
to point to error save it and then go
inside the browser refresh and as you
guys can see now we'll get to string
method this is the class called new
class now another thing we could do just
to show you guys is if I want to refer
to the class I'm inside of as you guys
can see right now I just wrote it as a
string called
new class if I were to refer to this
class I can actually go ahead and
instead of using a string to simply say
we want to write a piece of PHP code
called on the score underscore class and
capitalize letters underscore underscore
so right now we're actually referring to
the current class where inside of by
doing this piece of code so we were to
go back inside my browser refresh you
guys can see we get the exact same thing
because right now we echo out the class
name just like we did before but using
PHP code so this is basically one one to
show you guys today that we could
actually go in create a two string
method that would echo out some kind of
error missives if we were to
accidentally call on the object we
created inside you know the instantiated
class
so were to just echo out the object we
get this error message hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
