content inside a website using jQuery
and you might be thinking that well we
already have a way to do this using
inner HTML but when it comes to using
inner HTML we delete everything that we
have inside this element that we want to
insert into and in some cases like the
one I have here when we have a container
called container that has a bunch of
paragraphs inside of it I might not want
to delete all the paragraphs before
inserting elements into it so when it
comes to JavaScript or jQuery we do have
a way to insert elements without
deleting everything inside the container
they want to insert into so instead of
using inner HTML we have something
called append which inserts elements
inside the container either before or
after the existing content inside the
container or we can even insert the new
content before after the actual
container so we're going to be talking
about this append method inside ta cur
today so as you can see in here I do
have a div which is the container talked
about with the paragraphs inside of it
and as you can see inside my browser we
have these paragraphs showing now I did
also bring in my developer tool so you
can actually see what's going on inside
the website SP to actually start
updating with new code and at the bottom
of my index page you can see I do have a
couple of script tags so we can actually
write the area code down here so the
first thing I want to do inside the
script tags is someone to actually grab
the container we have up here and insert
a new paragraph inside of it so what I
can do is I can say we want to select
the container appear so we're gonna say
we have a ID called container and then I
want to go ahead and do something called
append now based on what we know from
JavaScript we know that when we use
something like append we basically
create an element that we then insert in
between content inside the website
instead of like I said using in HTML we
delete content and replace it with
whatever we want to replace it with so
inside the append parentheses we can go
and add some data I could say we want to
just add some text like a new paragraph
like so and as to save it you guys
consider updates and we now have a new
paragraph added after all the paragraphs
you have inside the container and if you
were to take a look
to develop a tool you can actually see
that the paragraph has been inserted
inside the container after the other
paragraphs elements okay so it's going
to be inserted after the existing
content now we can also use is something
called pre pens which then inserts it
before all the content inside the
container now you might be asking well I
just insert a text book Hemi insert HTML
code as well because I might want to
wrap this inside a pair of paragraph
tags so were to go inside my string down
here we just simply create a pair of
paragraph tags if you want to like so
save it and now we have it wrapped
inside paragraph tags as well as we can
see inside to develop a tool now this is
all good and nice but what if I want to
add this content before the actual
container or after the container well
then we can use something called before
instead of append and then you guys can
see nothing really changed inside the
actual website but if you take a look at
inside the developer tool like Tasya we
still have the container with all the
paragraphs inside of it but we have the
paragraph that we just inserted before
the container if we were to say after
you can then see it gets inserted after
the container instead okay now there's
another thing I want to show you because
we can also add multiple elements before
and after and in between the the
container and such instead of just one
so we can actually go inside the water
to scroll to the side here we can go
inside the parenthesis of whatever we're
trying to do here let's actually change
it back to append and what we can do is
we can actually add another paragraph if
I want to so go ahead and copy paste it
in and say we have not a new because
that's the same we want to say another
paragraph then you guys can see we get
both a new paragraph and another
paragraph okay
now let's actually go ahead and try out
something else because like I said using
JavaScript we usually create elements
first and then appended inside elements
at least if we had to do it using pure
JavaScript that's actually going to do
an example here going to create a
variable I'm gonna call this one and
create la just to create something
and I'm gonna set it equal to documents
dot create elements which is a
JavaScript function then inside the
parentheses I want to say what kind of
element I want to create a could for
example say a paragraph elements not
wrapped inside the actual starting and
closing arrows just for writing P then I
can go to the bottom here and say create
LM dot and then we can say inner HTML
and set it equal to some actual text so
we have some content so we can say a new
new paragraph close it off here and then
I can actually go ahead and say we want
to grab this create la variable and
actually insert it as a third parameter
so we can insert three elements right
after each other and now you guys can
see we have a new new paragraph and
again like I said their pen function we
have inside jQuery basically goes in and
does something similar to what we did up
here it creates a elements then inserts
data into it and then append it to
whatever constant we have inside the
website and we can like it did here do
it this way as well even though the
shorthand for it would just be to create
the text and code directly inside the
append function down here okay so this
is how we can insert new constant inside
a website without having to delete the
old content first I hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
