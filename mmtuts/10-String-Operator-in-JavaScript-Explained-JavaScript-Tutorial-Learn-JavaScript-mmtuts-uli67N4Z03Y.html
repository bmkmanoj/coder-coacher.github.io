a next episode on how to program
JavaScript now in this episode we're
going to talk about something called a
string operator and this is something I
purposely didn't talk about in the
previous episode since it's a little bit
different than using mathematical
operations and that sort of thing
so when it comes to something called a
string operator we use it quite often in
Santiago scripts when we have some kind
of string that needs to be combined with
other types of data so as you can see an
example of here I have two variables
have one called age which is equal to 27
and I have a variable called info that's
equal to a string that says my name is
Daniel I am 27 years old so what I want
to do here is I want to replace 27 with
a variable because later on on my
teamsters 228 if I turned 20 at some
point hopefully I do but I would like to
replace 27 inside the string with age
since we can update age at one point and
then update my 8 inside the string so
what we can do is if I want to combine a
variable with a string for example we
can use something called a string
operator so if we were to go inside
variable info and delete 27 and instead
I'm gonna cut and close off the string
and open it back up again so you can see
we get these double quotes inside the
string now if I were to include
something in between here you can see
it's not green because it's not part of
the string so what we can do is we can
go ahead and tell the JavaScript code
that I want to add in some other kind of
data it can be a number it can be a
variable it can be anything that is
going to return some other kind of value
so what I can do is I can say that we
want to add something between here by
saying plus plus and in between the
pluses I'm going to add for example the
variable so I'm gonna say we have age
now don't see the pluses as we're adding
something because we're not adding like
in in math we're just saying they want
to attach some other kind of value or
some other kind at ax to this string
inside of it we can also do it at the
end of the string if you want to so I
could say afterwards that I want to add
another kind of data that would be equal
to
I'm not ten if I just want to do that we
can do that as well and I want to point
one thing out which is the factor right
now this would actually say my name is
Daniel I am 27 years old and it's not
going to have a space in between old and
10 if it works actually console locked
is say con soul dot log and actually try
this out inside the browser so we're
going to console log info so inside my
browser you can actually see that if we
were to actually look at this inside the
console it says my name is Daniel I am
27 years old and old and 10 is inside
one word so one thing you need to be
aware of when we do this sort of thing
is that we need to go inside the string
right before we add 10 to the text and
add a space so we can do that so we've
go to where to go back inside the
browser you can see now it says 10 after
old so it's not one word now there's
another thing I want to point out which
is often we use variables or string
operators just to add space in between
certain things so for were to say we
have a variable called numbers and it's
equal to four and five then in order to
get a space in between the numbers we
can't just say we want a space like I
just did here we do need to add a string
to it and then say space inside the
string in this sort of way so if we were
to save this and console lock this
instead or also console out this inside
the browser there we go then you can see
we get 4 space five but if I were to go
back inside the code and just go ahead
and do it this way it's not going to
work so as you can see we get a uncaught
syntax error because it's not the way is
supposed to create space inside a string
so just going to go back here so this is
what we call a string operator and
something is quite often inside
javascript in order to create all sorts
of combinations with strings inside a
website so I hope you guys enjoyed I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
