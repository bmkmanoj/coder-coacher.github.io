something called string methods inside
JavaScript when it comes to string
methods is something that's really
useful when we have primitive values
inside JavaScript such as a variable
that's equal to some kind of value that
doesn't really have properties or
methods inside of it now a couple of
episodes ago we talked about optics and
as you guys can see right in front of me
here we have a very basic object which
is called person that has a first name a
last name and a method where we call out
the full name of the person now what a
primitive value is is when we have a
variable that doesn't have any of these
properties or methods inside of it so if
I were to create a variable and call it
dog we can go ahead and set equal to
some kind of string for example so I'm
going to say this dog is called Frieda
now because this dog is a primitive
value we don't have any properties of
methods which means that we can actually
go down into document right and say okay
we have a dog that has some kind of
property of method inside of it so we
can actually put something behind here
now because of this you might think that
we can't actually call on any kind of
property of methods inside dog because
we haven't created any but we do
actually have some already existing
properties and methods we can use inside
JavaScript inside the JavaScript library
so if I were to delete this person here
just to serve as an example from a
previous episode and just focus on dog
which is just a string we can go inside
our document write dog dot and call on a
property called length now length is not
something we have created inside dog but
it exists inside the language of
JavaScript so if I were to save this
refresh my browser you guys can see it
says five so what this basic property
does is it goes in and takes our
primitive value which is freed out and
says ok what is the length of this value
so right now we have five letters so we
get 5 so we have primitive property of
not primitive properties but we have
properties you can use inside primitive
values to get some kind of result now
you might be thinking work would
actually use this but let's pretend we
need
to figure out the link of the URL inside
a website or maybe we need to figure out
the length of a password or username
that somebody is writing inside a
website when they have to sign up for
something then we can check by writing
dot length you can also do it as in PHP
but if you want to do it with JavaScript
you can do it this way so this was a
property we could use on a primitive
value but we also have methods so if I
go ahead and delete length and instead
right for example character hats which
is written like this and we can actually
go ahead and say okay which character is
at location number three if I were to
quit and refresh my browser you guys can
see we get D because right now D is
inside position number three we do need
to start counting from zero meaning that
F is zero R is one I is 2 and D is 3 we
also have another one called search
which is actually quite useful when you
do want to make a website which we're
just going right in here search where we
go in and search for a specific set of
characters it can be one character can
be a string of characters so if I were
to go in and say ok let's go ahead and
search for AI it's gonna go and give me
the starting position of AI inside this
string up here if I go back to my
browser refresh you guys can see we get
two and again we need to start at zero
so it's zero one two we can also go in
and look for Leda which is part of the
word that we have up here I can refresh
and you guys can see get one because it
starts at zero one so we can search for
entire sentences inside this little
method here so there's a complete list
of methods you can use and be called
properties you can use on primitive
values such as dog that we have up here
so I'm just going to go ahead and give
you guys the link for a place we can
find some of these in the description of
this video so hope you guys enjoyed and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
