website we're creating here in bootstrap
inside different devices so we can
actually see the website inside the
environment that we want to program at
for so as you guys can see we do
actually have a very basic setup here we
have all the imported CTN files we need
to have an alt tag to get started on
bootstrap and we also created some basic
text now next question is how do you
actually see this in action inside the
devices do we want to use it on because
bootstrap is meant for mobile first
meaning that we should be able to see
this inside a mobile environment so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and go
inside my browser do you notice that I'm
actually using Chrome which is my
preferred browser and inside most
browsers as well as Chrome Firefox and
Safari we do actually have a developer
tool now the developer tools basically a
environment inside the browser where you
can see the code that goes on behind the
actual web site so I'm gonna go and
right-click on the website I'm gonna
select inspect and inside the browser
you guys can see we get the small window
now you now your window may be attached
to the browser on the side or depending
on how it pops up but you'll get this
small window here with different buttons
on the top and different options as you
guys can see when I do actually
highlight some of the code we can
actually see what I highlight inside the
website so what's really important to
notice here is that right now I'm
viewing a bootstrap website inside the
browser mean the right now actually
viewing it on a desktop now what I want
to do here is I want to see how does
this website look like inside a cell
phone so the way we can do this is by
going inside the developer tool on the
left corner I get this button here that
says toggle device toolbar if I click it
you guys can see we now get a different
view so inside my view here it says iPad
pro we can flip the device if we want to
we can view other types of devices we
can see for example an iPhone 6 iPhone 5
we can see a galaxy s6 there's different
devices in here so I'm gonna go and
select an iPhone 5 and as you guys can
see this is how website looks like
inside an iPhone 5 you now of course
this doesn't look very impressive since
we don't really have any
special content inside the website we
have so far so I opened up my own
website here where I have a basic PHP
course going on in here if I were to
right click inspect element you guys can
see that now the website gets loaded
inside you notice view here and it
responds to the view size I mean that
right now as you guys can see this is
actually responding as word to be on a
cell phone we can open up the menu we
can choose other courses you can do a
bunch of stuff in here okay so this is
how we can view and you don't actually
see what we're doing inside bootstrap on
different devices and you don't actually
need to upload to an unlined server so
you can actually see it inside your cell
phone which is kind of a difficult way
to you know to do it every time you want
to see the changes you make so just
loading it up inside the developer tool
makes it a lot easier so if you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys next
