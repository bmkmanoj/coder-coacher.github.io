function called order by inside SQL and
this is a way to select something from
the database and order it by either a
vertical order or by number you know
smallest to biggest or biggest to
smallest so what we can do here is we
can actually go ahead and go into our
database now I do actually have some
data inside our table called post I'm
going to go ahead and leave this text or
at least SQL code a row to insert this
into my database table inside the
description of this video so you guys
can go ahead and copy it in and get this
inside your table as well so after you
have this in here you can actually go
ahead and go into your database again go
to the SQL tap and then we can try to
select something and order it by a
certain type of data so what I'm going
to do here is I'm just going to go ahead
and write a select statement select all
from posts we're exit let's go ahead and
not say where because we do actually
want to select everything you know all
the different rows so we're going to
select everything and say order by
instead and then we're going to go out
and say that we're going to order it by
a certain column and then we need to
tell it if you wanted to be ascending or
descending so I'm going to order it by
ID and I'm going to go ahead and order
it by ascending ASC which means it's
going to increase as we start spitting
it out so if I do actually you know run
this that may actually go and copy it
first you guys to do that as well you
guys can see we get two pieces of data
well two rows of data we get one where
the IDS one is at the very top and the
ID is to is at the bottom now if we go
back in here write the code again and I
change ascending to descending providing
des see run it you guys can see that now
we do actually have number two at the
top and number one at the bottom so now
it seems to order what we did actually
spit it out so we can also go back again
and paste it in one more time and this
time we're going to go ahead and order
it by subjects
now if I order by subject is not going
to count the numbers of course because
it's not an integer it is in fact text
we have inside the subject but now it's
going to take it after the alphabet mean
that a is going to come out first and
set is going to be the last one so if I
do actually go ahead and do this by
ascending well right now our what you
call our subject does actually have the
exact same thing but because we have
subject 1 it's going to look at okay
everything is the same all the text is
the same and then when it hits the first
character where there's something that
comes first then it's going to spit that
out first so sub take 1 is actually
gonna be at the very top here so if you
actually go back again paste it in and
say want to order by descending and of
course not by ID you want to order it by
our subjects now you guys will see it
changed again because subject is in fact
a string and two even though that's
number is part of the string which is
going to come after one of course and
because it's descending it's going to be
the first one that gets spit out so this
is the basic way we can order something
inside the database and there's actually
one more thing that we could talk about
which is called group by but for now
we're just going to go ahead and eat
that one you guys I'm going to look it
up on Google is not well later on it
might become relevant but for now when
we do actually want to create a locking
system it's not very relevant so we're
just going to leave it at this and in
the next episode we're going to start
talking about how to actually write PHP
code and use SQL code inside our PHP
code and how to actually do something
with a database using the PHP code so if
you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
