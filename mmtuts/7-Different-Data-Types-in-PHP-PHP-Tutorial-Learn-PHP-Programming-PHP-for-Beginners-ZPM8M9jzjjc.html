about some different data types we have
inside PHP and we did actually talk
about some examples already
for example strings and integers but
before we continue our lessons I really
quickly want to cover just a couple more
of the basic ones before we do anything
else in PHP so the first one we're going
to talk about is of course the string
and we did actually talk about the
string in previous episodes but there's
just a couple of things I want to
mention regarding strings so let's
actually try and create an example here
we create a variable called name equal
to a string and of course the way we
write a string is by writing double
quotes two of them and then we write
some text inside of them so we can
actually say coding is fun and this
would actually become a string so
anytime you put characters inside double
quotes it does actually become a string
so this is one way of writing a string
but it's actually another way we can
write it so if I actually go ahead and
delete the double quotes and write
single quotes instead this also becomes
a string and there's actually no
difference between using single or
double quotes the difference though is
that let's say we're writing a long
piece of code and we did already use
double quotes once in this line of code
were writing now if I want to include a
string inside this piece of code I'm
writing which already has double quotes
around it then I'm going to be
cancelling out the double quote
beginning tag since I have you know four
double quotes inside one line of code so
they're going to cancel each other out
now this is one example where we might
want to consider using single quotes
inside our string instead since it's not
going to interfere with the double
quotes we already used so this is just
some basic stuff regarding strings let's
go on to the other one called an integer
so an integer is basically when we're
talking about numbers so let's actually
go ahead and copy our variable up here
and instead of having a string in here
we're just going to ahead and write for
example 20 which is going to be an
integer now if I were to include some
decimal points behind it it suddenly
becomes something we call a float now a
float is also a number but it does
actually have decimal points behind it
so we can actually 5 7 8 4 for example
and it acts it becomes what we call a
float now why would you want to know
that these are different names
well when we do actually get to the
point will need to create databases we
do actually need to tell the database
what kind of data it should expect to
get when we do to have something into
the database and if you write that you
want for example a float on integer
you should put integers and float into
the database so you do need to know the
difference between using floats and
integers so you can't just call all
numbers for integers now the next we're
going to talk about is something called
a boolean and a boolean is basically a
true and false statement and the reason
we want to use these is because a lot of
times in PHP you will actually be using
something called conditional testing so
let's say the user does something
specific and you want to check if the
user has already done it so if the user
clicks on this button you could for
example check if they already clicked
another button beforehand and this is
going to return either a true or false
statement so when we talk about true and
false statements we do actually get a
value for example if we do get a true
statement back then we're going to get a
value as 1 if we do get a false
statement then we're going to get a
value called 0 so if you do actually
check for something for example if you
go in and check if a database has you
know a certain type of data and it
returns back 0 it means that there's no
data available inside the database now
if it returns as 1 it means that there
is in fact something in there so this is
something at least an example of using a
boolean now the last data type we're
going to talk about is something called
an array and I do know that there's more
data type than these but I don't want to
cover them yet since it might get a
little bit difficult at least as early
on so I'm going to go ahead and talk
about arrays as the last type so an
array is basically when we have data for
example you know how we can create a
variable that is equal to for example a
string or a number or something else
let's say we have a lot of variables
that are connected to one specific thing
well and a lot of times then it's going
to be easier to connect them all to one
object on one array so what we can do
here is we can actually create a
variable called names with an S behind
it because we have more than one now and
set it equal to an array and the way we
write an array is by writing array
parentheses and inside this array or at
least inside the parentheses we can
start putting data in here so for
example I'm just going to go to include
a couple here like so we can actually
put in some double quotes and make sure
you separate them with commas and then
inside the first double quote we can for
example write Daniel the second double
quote we can write denis and the last
one we can write Michael like so now if
you want to spit something out from this
array we can actually on next line echo
and then we need to refer to the
variable called names and ask for which
kind of data inside the array we want to
spit out and the way we do that is by
writing brackets single quotes and
inside here we're going to go ahead and
say either 0 1 2 3 4 and so on so on so
on depending on which data want to spit
out in this case Daniel will be 0
because you always start at 0 when we
count positions so it's gonna be 0 1 2
so if I spit up 0 and actually go ahead
and refresh my browser I'm actually
going to go and delete this up here
because this will probably give me an
error if we do take it in the browser so
if we refresh you guys can see we spit
out Daniel if I go ahead and write 1 you
can see we spit out denis and so on and
so on and so on so this is how an array
works and you will actually using arrays
quite often I do actually remember in
the beginning when I learned about PHP
and I heard about a raise I was thinking
to myself well I couldn't really see it
up any examples where we would actually
be using a raise but you will accept
using quite often even if you don't
really see how you could use it quite
often right now at some point we've get
further in these lessons you will be
using them quite often so I hope you
guys enjoyed this episode this is all I
wanted to mention about different data
types I just want to throw a couple out
there these some of the basic ones that
need to know about and you don't really
need to memorize these you just need to
know that there's in fact different
types of data out there so if you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
