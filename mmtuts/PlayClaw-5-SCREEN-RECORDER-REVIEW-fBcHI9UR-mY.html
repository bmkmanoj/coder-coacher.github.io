review
in this episode I'm gonna take a look at
a new screen recorder that I bought
called play cloth 5 which is the third
screen record I've bought so far so I'm
sort of wasting my money away here in
screaming quarters but at least I can
get some sort of accurate you know
detail about which ones are good or not
since I have something to compared to so
the reason I decide to get play called 5
was that you know I was supposedly told
that this one does not spoil the
framerate of the game while you you know
record your gameplay this is a big issue
if you have done screen recording before
you may know that a lot of screaming
quarters such as fraps or action or you
know all the big ones out there they may
spoil your framerate and you know to me
while I do some sort of gameplay footage
I don't want to you know record it if it
ends up spoiling my experience of the
game because of low framerate so let's
just go ahead and take a look at this
program and I'm gonna give you guys my
opinion on it and tell you guys about
the issues I've had with this program
while you know testing it out on my
gameplays so as you can tell play Call 5
has the you know Windows 8 flat design
on it I personally love the flat design
because I'm a web developer I'm supposed
to love it so you know it looks very
simplistic because to use that even
though it looks very simple it is very
detailed and is like setting some stuff
so don't get confused by that as you can
tell we have a video setting we have
audio setting screenshot settings
overlays which is actually a really cool
feature I'm gonna show you guys in a
second we have two hotkeys we have
folders you know you want to save your
your video clips into and then you have
general settings and then down here we
have something called blacklist which
I'll tell you about also in a second so
let's go ahead and start with our video
settings which is called day encoder now
the encoder settings here it took me
quite a while to figure out what I need
to set it to because I had huge issues
recording with this you know screen
recorder at start the you know default
settings is the mjpeg as you can tell
you have two settings here you have fast
and MJPEG and then you have some encoder
settings here and you can set it to like
quality you know 50 being the worst but
the fastest one and then 100 being the
best but the slowest one down here you
can use like some sort of compression
setting after you're done recording and
then you can also choose if you want
like a full range color setting now to
using the mjpeg has caused my video
clips to come out of sync with the sound
which means that i would put it into my
video editing program at the end after
it's done recording and then my video
would go a lot faster than my audio and
it would start skipping and I couldn't
even preview my video clip I had to
actually drag it onto my timeline and
watch it that way and still it would be
spoiled and I spent countless hours
online trying to figure out you know if
other people have the same problem and
it seemed that nobody had well at least
some of them had but everyone told them
that you know it was because you didn't
have the right codec you know inside
your editing program and stuff like that
but the solution I came out with that
fixed it for me was that don't choose
MJPEG choose the fast one because the
difference between these two is that
your mjpeg actually records your
gameplay and then the raw file did you
get afterwards is a video clip in itself
you can you can play on everything if
you choose to fast setting it compresses
it you cannot you know double click on
your video clip afterwards the raw file
and then watch it you actually have to
drag it into a video editing program but
doing it this way does not spoil your
clip which is my you know what I came
out with so just a little thing for you
guys because I had huge issues with this
down here you can set your custom frame
size
I just set mine to 1600 and 900 because
that's my screen size you have to
capture frame rate and as you can tell
we have
from five to sixty but you can also type
in a customized you know framerate if
you want to compression threats I'm not
quite sure what that is it's the better
graphics card you have you can set it
higher I know but I don't know why you
can set it higher you can have a setting
down here called smooth frame flow which
means that some times on your clips you
can improve like the frame flow if you
check this one off I just decided not to
draw cursor you can actually click on
this one and you know uncheck it and
then you can't see your cursor while you
record which you know if you play
strategy games or something like that if
you don't want people to see you occur
so you can you know check that off
max pre quarter buff the size this is
actually a really cool feature when you
record a gameplay actually when you're
not recording a gameplay but have play
call five open let's say you play call
of duty or something like some sort of
shooting game and you get this awesome
kill that you did not record you can
actually click a shortcut button and it
will actually save the last ten seconds
of your gameplay which is kind of cool
which means that play call five is
always running in the background you
know saving you gameplay just a little
bit down here you have you can convert
to stereo which I of course checked off
if you don't have that there's gonna be
mono which sucks you can mix the audio
into one track I have that on too so I
don't have like you know eight different
tracks going down down here you have
right audio and separate files if you
check this one off you will get your
video clip in one file and you get two
audio files afterwords one being for
your gameplay sound and then one thing
from your microphone in case you had
that you know add it on let's go ahead
and take a look at the audio in the
audio settings you have you know you can
use the default sources which in my case
is two speakers and my microphone I can
actually I'm gonna turn that off because
I use them to record my sound you know
not inside my gameplay I recommend you
turn that off too if you do not record
your own voice you know into the sound
itself that is
inside the game so just so you know over
here we have screenshots you can of
course you know do screenshots like any
other thing down here it says Auto
screenshot interval seconds
it actually automatic the same
screenshot which I set to nine nine nine
you know nine because I did not want it
to save screenshots all the time down
here we have a really cool feature
called overlays which is basically you
know when you record a gameplay you're
gonna have some sort of number it could
either be the framerate or like a time
that says how long have you been
recording like it's gonna be going on in
the corner somewhere down here you can
choose what you want to see in the
corner while you record you can also
decide if it's just you who wants to see
it or if you should also show it on a
video clip so let's take the frame rate
per second here I have it enabled in my
overlay it's actually the only thing
I've been able so far and I can choose
if I want you know to show in video and
screenshots of course I'm not gonna do
that because I don't want you guys to
see it but you can choose that as an
option you have like clock you have CPU
you can tell you know the CPU details up
there the TPU details image if you want
some sort of image like a logo if you
have a local for YouTube channel you can
have that in the corner somewhere you
have like recording statistics you have
stopwatch you have text you have timer
teamspeak and webcam you can even have a
webcam showing I think this is kind of
cool did you have all these customized
settings you can uncheck and check off
if you want to use them now if you take
a look at the hotkeys you can tell that
well this looks like any other screen
recorder program you can basically set
your hotkey here a couple of differences
though in here you can actually pause
the video with a you know clicking a
certain button or you can cancel the
recording itself by clicking you know
some sort of button if you won't decide
you want to you can also choose to
actually show the interface what you're
seeing right here inside the game if you
decide to you know do so if suddenly you
want to change some settings you can do
that folders inside the folders here you
can of course the sideway want to save
your you know your video clip or
screenshots it's very basic you just
open it up and decide where you want to
save it as a default it will save it on
your videos for the inside your
documents on your computer so you know I
recommended you get an external hard
disk for this general settings in here
you can decide some different things
like it's a face language you know if
you want to minimize the whole window to
this like the system tray if you want to
start up the program minimized if you
want it to take an updates and stuff now
here's the difference though you scream
recorder you know you can record both
the desktop and gameplay with this
screen recorder but if you're running on
Windows 8 right now they're working on
making this you know doable but at the
moment you know I can decide to your
desktop mode okay which means I can
record my desktop but look what happens
when I click it I get this one cannot
initialize mail slot client which means
that because someone Windows 8 it is not
optimized for it so I cannot record my
desktop which kind of sucks but you know
it's just really annoying but if you're
not on Windows 8 you know you can record
it desktop all you want they say they're
gonna fix this in the future which I
hope they will do so don't have to use
you know a bunch of screen recorders for
different things but just so you guys
know let me just close this down there
you go and the last thing is the
blacklist now let's say you have steam
open and you're playing a game of course
you know if you play game over Steam it
will have steam open let's say you get a
little notification or like a pop up
message from one of your friends and
it's suddenly you know jumps in front of
the screen while you're recording that
can get a little annoying for someone so
you can actually blacklists right now
you can see I have chrome blacklisted in
here I have something called Pro Tools
which is my sound recording and this
means that if you know there's some sort
of message that pops up from the program
the screen recorders gonna ignore it
and just ignore whatever's in the back
of that message so it's not gonna record
the message itself but I think it's
really kind of cool so
that's basically you know to setting
some stuff just to give you guys my
opinion of it I got so angry when I
bought this one because you know I mean
the gameplay itself was a hundred times
better because I had no framerate issues
at all it was like I didn't even have
the screen recorder on but the fact that
I had to spend countless hours fixing
you know the you know the fast video was
so annoying at least now that I fixed it
I'm happy but you know as a gameplay
recorder they should at least have this
fixed
basically the MJPEG is completely
useless unless you have the correct
codec inside your you know video editing
program but other than that you know I
have seen no issues with it it's very
easy to use you know if you have to
choose between fraps and this one I
would recommend getting this one because
fraps has just huge files when you're
done recording it is a very good program
no doubt about it
most people who use fraps but this one
has more settings and stuff you know
like the overlays and the blacklist and
it just makes it so much easier to use
so yeah that's basically it I hope you
guys found this useful go ahead and
leave a like if you did it helps a lot
subscribe to see more stuff for my
channel and I will see you guys later
