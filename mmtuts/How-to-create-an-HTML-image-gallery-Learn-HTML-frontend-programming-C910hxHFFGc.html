about how to add a gallery inside our
gallery page and as you guys can see I'm
EXCI inside my gallery right now and we
don't have anything inside our section
so if we go into our code inside our
website here I do actually have all my
sub pages open here from the last
episode so let's actually go to the
gallery HTML page and just kind of close
down all the other ones since we don't
really need them right now so inside my
gallery page I'm going to go ahead and
go down to my section but we did
actually create a dip box in the last
episode called class gallery - box so
we're going to go and use this one to
put in our gallery now inside this dip
box I would like to add a wrapper as
well so I'm going to open up another div
and then I'm going to go ahead and give
it a class equal to quotation marks
wrapper so now all our images inside our
gallery will actually be within this
wrapper so they don't go all the way to
left and right side of the screen so now
we can actually start adding images now
depending on what you want to do in the
gallery because you could do it in a
couple of different ways the way I'm
going to recommend you guys to do is to
not just insert images one after each
other because let's say you want to do
some kind of hover effect on it like I
did actually have a guy asking me inside
my youtube channel what if you want to
hover your cursor on top of a gallery
image and you wanted to increase like
you wanted to pop out a little bit an
increase in size once you hover on it
now in order to do that we're going to
have to set it up in a specific way and
this is a certain way I would like to
recommend you guys to set it up every
single time so let's just go ahead and
take it from here
inside the wrapper we're going to go and
create the first image and we're going
to do that by creating a dip box so
inside this div at least we're going to
name this class or like name just dip
box at class by saying class equal to
quotation marks then we're going to set
this one to IMG - single so now we're
saying that this is a single image now
inside this div and if you go to move
down to next line we're going to go
ahead and add an image now I do actually
have an image inside my image folder
inside my root folder
called cat the jpg we're just going to
go ahead and use that one as well if you
guys want to you can go ahead and find
your own images or I will actually go
ahead and leave a link you guys can
download it from in the description of
this video
so in here we can actually go ahead and
say image and open up the code well I
have a quick function here you guys to
write image space source equal to
quotation marks and then we're going to
go ahead and add just consuming figures
then I'm going to go ahead and add an
image in here so right now I have a
folder inside a root folder called image
backslash and then I'll need to tell it
what kind of image I want to paste in
there so I'm going to go ahead and say
cats dot jpg save it and right now if
we're go ahead and take a look at our
browser you guys will notice we have a
cat image now right now I would like for
my cat image to well right now our dip
box is actually adjusting to the size of
the cat image and I would like for the
cabinet to adjust to the size of the dip
box so going into my code again if we go
into the stylesheet which I have right
here right below our footer I guess
we're going to go ahead and add some
code for the gallery just going to go
down a few lines so we can see what's
going on and down here I'm going to go
and say okay so we have a class called
image - what is it called image - single
not quite sure what it actually call it
let me just go and check image - single
then we're going to open up the code and
in here we're going to go and give it a
certain width and a height now my cat
image right now it's actually a certain
width and height so if I actually go
ahead and look at the properties of it I
can see that it is 173 times 120 pixels
so we're going to say with 173 pixels
and the height is 120 now we could also
do it in another way since we will
essentially be adjusting this exit let's
go ahead and do this another way let's
go ahead and take a look at our wrapper
for a second which is all the way at the
top of our code and you guys will
actually see that right now it's 960
pixels wide now depending on how many
images I want in here let's actually go
and calculate that so if I want let's
say eight images going across like going
across in the next line there's eight
more images then I actually need to get
a calculator to calculate exactly how
many pixels wide my image needs to be if
I want let's say five or ten pixels
margin in between each image so if we
take a look at our website actually
let's go ahead and paste in our image a
few more times so let's say we take our
div called image single and paste it
below eight times so four five six seven
eight
refresh my browser you guys will notice
we have eight cat images now if actually
go ahead and go into my stylesheet go
down to the bottom again where we have
our styling for the image single I'm
going to go and say float:left so we can
actually see them next to each other
save it refresh my browser and you guys
will notice two next to each other
now of course our footer will actually
go up here and we did actually talk
about that a couple of times that once
we do have floating elements inside a
div box the next dip box underneath that
won't recognize the floating elements
because our current dip box can actually
see the size of it so in order to fix
that we need to go into our image single
underneath our float we're going to say
overflow:hidden and now we will actually
recognize okay it does actually not
recognize it we need to recognize this
by oh of course we don't actually add
the overflow:hidden to the image single
we need to actually add it to our dip
box around our image single which is
inside our gallery so if we take our
gallery box which is what is called so
if we take our gallery box in here and
copy it create a class paste it on top
of here and add the overflow:hidden to
this one
like so just copy it up there and we can
might as well delete it from below here
save it
refresh our browser and you'll notice
that now it does actually recognize the
spacing so what we can do now is say
okay
as you can tell our images are way too
big right now so if we were to take our
calculator right here and start
calculating because we need to do a
little bit of math now to actually
figure out how wide we need the images
to be if you want a certain margin so
right now we want 10 pixels between the
cat images meaning that we want 5 pixels
on each side so we're going to go ahead
and save 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 and then
of course we have the edges we will be
80 so there's going to be a margin of
total of 80 pixels between all the
images together so we're going to say we
had a wrapper that was not having 60
pixels wide you want to say minus 80
because that's the amount of margin we
need to leave space for equal to 880
divided by 8 because we have 8 images
you'll notice if you get 110 so going
back to our code we can actually set the
width of our image single needs to be a
hundred and ten and width now the height
we might not know right now what needs
to be but let's just go and keep this
one for now so now what we want to do is
you want to style the image itself
inside this box so we're going to go to
copy this code paste it below and say
image that single spaced image then we
want to set the width as 100% so it goes
all the way to the edge of our image
single then we want to set the height to
100% as well save it and now let's go
ahead and well let's go and delete the
float:left because we don't need that
part now if we go ahead and save the
website and we go and refresh it you
guys will notice that the image is
actually adjusting to our dip box which
is what we want it now the height right
now it does not look like it should so
let's go back into the code and adjust
to hide a little bit so instead of 120
pixels let's go ahead and say 90 and see
if that looks okay refresh
and that looks somewhat okay it's still
a little bit too too much so let's go at
it and use a tea like so I think that
looks quite nice so what we're going to
do here is we're going to go ahead and
add well we should probably add a
padding to our gallery box because right
now a foot is touching the images and
it's actually touching the header so
let's go into our gallery box and say
padding not left but just padding and
then say we're going to give it a
padding from top and bottom we're going
to give it eighty pixels space and then
zero pixels from left and right like so
refresh and you guys will notice we have
some spacing now so now we did actually
leave spacing for each image to have ten
pixels between each image and then five
on the side so going into our code we're
going to go down to our image single
class down here I'm going to say margin
then we're going to say from top and
bottom we want a well we should probably
have a 10 pixels margin since we do want
them to not touch each other below each
other I want to do actually get another
row of images so I'm going to say 10
pixels and left and right we're going to
say 5 pixels save it so now if I go and
refresh you guys will notice that we get
the spacing we want and it's actually
going all the way to the edge here on
each side except for 5 pixels which is
very small amount that we don't really
notice but if you want to add what do
you call it if you don't want to have
spacing on each side of the row then we
actually going to have to do the coding
a little bit differently which we'll
talk about in another episode in the
future so right now this is how we have
it and what we can do now is we can
actually go ahead and add another row of
images inside our gallery page so I can
actually show you guys what we've done
here so I'm just going to go and copy
the entire row here and I'm just going
to go ahead and go twice down so I can
actually see the differences between the
rows and then I'm pasting all them in
once more so if i refresh my browser now
you'll see that we do actually get some
spacing now we should probably not have
said 10 pixels because it's 10 from top
and bottom so going back to our styling
see let's go ahead and say 5 pixels from
top and bottom
at the margin instead and now we have
something that looks somewhat good so
now we can do is we can actually go
ahead and go and add a hover effect so
once I have our damage it'll actually
increase in size a little bit so what we
can do now is we can go inside our
stylesheet and then we need to add some
coding to each of these which you guys
haven't seen before which allows for us
to actually move around these things we
have in here so I'm just gonna go ahead
and zoom a little bit so we can see more
now we're going to add some styling to
our image single and our image single
image which is called position now the
position element that we're going to add
inside the styling is going to do
something specific to the element if I
were to go inside my image single and
add position and set it to something
called relative what we're essentially
doing now is saying okay relative to
where the image or like the the image
that single is right now where do I want
to move it so if I were to add top 30
pixels save it refresh my browser you
guys will notice that our images will
move 30 pixels from the top relatively
to where they are right now like so
that's what position:relative does and
we can actually go out and say we can
say top left right bottom and like to
move around but position:relative is not
something you want to use frequently you
know instead of margin or something like
that because if I were to set this one
to 230 pixels now using
position:relative or any kind of
position element will actually take our
object and put it on a separate layer
meaning that right now all the other
elements on our website doesn't
recognize that these things are getting
moved around so if we were to refresh my
browser you guys will notice that our
footer doesn't adjust to our images
that's because it doesn't recognize the
images because we're using position to
move it around so a little tip for you
guys don't use positioning to move stuff
around unless you have a really good
reason to actually doing so now we don't
actually need to add a top or bottom or
left the right to the positioning we do
need to have to position relative
inside our image single and I'll explain
to you guys in a few minutes why we need
to have that in there so download inside
our image image inside image single let
me actually go and refresh the browser
there we go inside my image single image
down here we're going to add another
kind of position this one is called
absolute and what this one does is that
it does actually go in and say okay if
we're inside some kind of box I would
like for it to go all the way to the
edge and then just kind of sit there so
right now if we were to save this and
actually delete my position relative up
from our image single refresh my browser
you guys will notice that oh the image
is actually just as big as our window
inside our browser and just going all
the way you know from where it starts
till the edge of the screen or like
further past the edge of the screen
because it needs to go all the way to
width of the browser so it kind of
messes it up right now but if we go in
and add the position relative to the
image sits inside of it's actually going
to recognize the dip box it's inside of
and see where the borders of that box is
so if I go refresh my browser now it's
actually stretching all the way to the
edges of this box we're inside of now
the reason we need to do that is because
well you might be asking why do we do
this we have a width and a height as
100% isn't it already going from the
edges of the box that's inside up well
yeah it is
but once we want to add a hover effect
to make this zoom in a little bit when
we hover on top the image we will
actually need to add this precision
element to it so down here what we're
going to say is we're going to say
position absolute then underneath that
we're going to say from the top it's
going to be zero pixels from the right
it's going to be zero pixels from the
bottom is going to be zero pixels from
the left it's going to be zero pixels
now you might be asking why we're doing
this and in a few seconds when we do
actually get to the hover effects I'll
actually show you guys what exactly it
is this is doing so what we can do now
is underneath here we can actually start
adding some hover effects so let's say
that once I do actually a
on top my imaged as a single so that's
so let's go ahead and actually just copy
this below here once I hover I left by
adding the hover effects I wanted to do
this so what we're going to do here is
we're going to go ahead and say well I
would like for it to have a set index
which we haven't talked about before I
think now essentially what set index
does is that it takes this element and
like I said before elements can have
different layers inside the website so
if I have a set index like let's say
this image here has a set index of a
thousand and I have another element
right below it that has a set index of
five thousand then the element below
inside the HTML sheet will actually be
on top because it's on a layer that's
higher up then this element which only
has a thousand so set index essentially
tells the object you know how far in
front of the screen it needs to be so
right now having a set index of a
thousand is more than a default which is
essentially just zero so right now when
I hover on this element it's always
going to be in front so we want that
so once we've added this we actually
don't need to add anything else so I'm
just going to go ahead and copy our
image that single code paste it below
here and say once I hover on top of this
image I would like it to do this so what
we can do here so we can actually go
ahead and say we would like the width to
be 110 percent so now we're actually
extending it outside the box but if we
do this and I save it refresh my browser
you guys will notice that it actually
kind of pops over to left up to the
right side and we want it to be centered
so in order to do that that's why we
added our precision absolute because now
we can actually say that from our top
and from the left side let's actually go
ahead and go down here from the top and
from the left side we would like it to
be minus a certain amount so now we can
actually say - if I can find my - on my
keyboard - 10
percent and I'm going to go ahead and do
that as well for my left we don't
actually need right and bottom I don't
know why we added that in there top and
left is going to be minus 10% once I hop
on it so if i refresh my browser now
you'll notice oh that was actually too
much we need not 10% we need 5% like so
refresh and you guys will notice it's
actually centered now if I go ahead and
add more than 10% and actually show you
guys what the setting decks did if I add
20% and change this one down here to 10%
like minus 10% relaxing notice that now
attacks getting so big that is actually
going to go outside there are the dip
boxes we have out there but it will
always go and tubba them because we have
a set index of a thousand and all of
these has to default which is zero so
we'll always be on top of it so now what
we can do is we can actually go in and
add a hover effect on top of these
images by adding a transition so we did
actually talk about how to add the
transition so I'm actually just going to
go ahead and what we do actually need to
add this to the image I'm just going to
go ahead and add the shortcode I have
inside my software right here by adding
a transition to all elements I'm setting
it to let's go and set it to 200
milliseconds I'm going to go and set it
to ease in ease out I'm going to save it
refresh my browser you guys have noticed
we get this little nice effect going on
right now if I were to click any of
these they don't do anything I mean in
purely HTML CSS this is all they can do
you can actually make them do anything
other than open up in a new page which
we can actually do right now so if we go
into our gallery what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go ahead and take the first
image we had and I'm going to go ahead
and add an anchor tag on the outside so
I'm going to go to make sure I close it
after the div and open it before the div
now we also need to add something else
in here which is we need to actually add
the path to our image because it needs
to actually open up the image so we
don't actually add a path to a certain
page we do actually add the path to the
image so if I saved is you fresh click
on the image you'll notice if you
actually open the image in a separate
browser
so in order to actually make it do
something much more cooler which would
be if we click an image and actually
pops up in the center of the screen like
in a little window you can you know we
can click Next and in the previous and
close it down and full screen mode and
all that cool stuff will actually go to
need to add something called even
lightbox or fancy box which is actually
part of JavaScript or jQuery so that's
also another kind of programming
language you will actually need to know
in order to do this and for now we're
just not going to do that I think we'll
actually wait till acts do get a
JavaScript and jQuery series going and
then we'll talk about how to do that so
I hope you guys enjoyed this episode and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
