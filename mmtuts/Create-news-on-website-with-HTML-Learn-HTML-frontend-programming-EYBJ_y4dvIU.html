how to include a new section into our
front page so if you take a look at the
front page we have so far gasps we'll
actually see that right now we have a
video we have an intro but we don't have
much other than that going on inside our
front page so my thought was we could
actually include a new section below our
intro that's going to have different
posts going from left to right with
maybe five different posts in it and
then we can just have them going right
next to each other so I need to mention
before we get started though that
because we're only using HTML CSS if you
want to update some of your new sections
you're going to have to go into the code
and update it if you want to be able to
update it using a CMS system which is
called a content management system
you're going to have to use another kind
of programming lab language than HTML
and CSS so now that we know that we can
go into our code inside our front page
and we're going to go into our section
where we have two different dip boxes
which has each of our content in it we
have one for the video and we have one
for the intro so I'm just going to go
ahead and copy the one for the video I'm
going to go ahead and go below our intro
and paste it in here I'm going to change
the class name of the outside dip box -
index - news and then I'm going to go
ahead and keep the rap in here now I
will delete the video of course because
we don't need the video but I'm going to
go ahead and leave a wax gonna be using
some HTML tags if we talked about in the
beginning of these tutorials which is
something called an article tag so
that's what we're going to create inside
the wrapper so I'm going to say article
of course we need to open and close it
and in between here is going to be one
news article post so inside my post if I
go ahead and save this I can actually go
ahead and go to my stylesheet and right
on top of our footer we can actually go
ahead and style this that we already
have so far so I'm going to go ahead and
create a class called index - news I'm
going to open up the code and I'm going
to go ahead and just copy the the code
we have inside our index intro which is
a width of 100% and a padding of 80
pixels from top and bottom I'm just
going to go and use that
and then I'm going to go ahead and copy
this part paste it below and then after
index news I'm going to go ahead and add
article so now we're styling every
single article inside our new section so
of course you don't want a hundred
percent width of this one we actually
want to have twenty percent since we
want five of them going across meaning
that we need to have 20 times 5 equals
100 which is very simple math but I'm
just mentioning it so we can actually
get a get rid of our padding so another
thing we want to include inside our
article here is a background color
because right now we don't actually have
any way to tell if our articles are
being styled so I'm just going to go
ahead and add a red background color now
inside my index that's new so I'm going
to go ahead and copy my background color
and put it in there but instead of
having our background color as red I'm
going to say hash tag CCC which is a
very light grey color so we can actually
see what's going on here so after we
saved this I'm going to go and refresh
my browser and as you guys will notice
we now have the gray background color
which we styled but we don't see the red
color yet which is because we don't have
a height inside our post yet and we
won't get a height until we actually add
some content to it so inside our article
tags we're going to go ahead and include
some content so we can actually see the
article box so what I would like to do
inside my news post is include a image
then I'm going to include a header then
I'm going to go ahead and include some
text so the first thing we need inside
the article is of course a image now
instead of creating this image tag we
learned about in the image episode
inside this tutorial series we're going
to go ahead and create a dip box because
like I mentioned in that episode there's
two ways to create an image either you
can create a dip box or you can create a
image so we're going to go ahead and use
a dip box so we can actually add some
hover effects on top of our image which
is going to look really nice so below
our dip box we're going to go ahead and
create a header which is going to be a
h3 header this is not that important and
underneath this one we're going to go
ahead and create a paragraph so we're
going to go ahead and give this dip box
you have inside the article a
styling so I'm going to go ahead and add
a class to it equal to quotation marks
I'm going to go ahead and call this one
news
- IMG for image inside our header we're
going to go and say this is a news title
and inside our text we're going to go
ahead and go inside our browser go to
Lipson calm copy some text and as you
guys can see I did actually have it
prepared I had it open here so in case
you got on what you guys want to know
you need to go to lip zoom calm and you
can find the text now I'm just going to
go and paste it in here add some
placeholder text so we have something we
can see for now and after I've done this
we can actually go back into our styling
and start styling some of the stuff but
before we do that I would like to
refresh my browser just to see what
we've done so far and as you guys will
see that we do actually have a red box
with a post in it so right now you can
see the header you can see the content
but we can't see the image yet because
we haven't styled it yet so inside our
stylesheet we're going to go ahead and
go down to our news section styling here
and inside my like below the article we
styled we're going to go ahead and open
up another piece of styling by open up
opening up a class called news - image
IMG open up the code and inside here
we're going to go ahead and give it a
width as a hundred percent so it goes
all the way from left to right inside
this post and underneath here I'm going
to go ahead and include a height as 120
pixels so we have a height for the image
I'm going to go and save it and I'm
going to go and give it a background
color just to kind of so we can see
what's going on so I'm going to go say
hashtag zero zero zero which is a black
color save it again and then I'm going
to go ahead and open up my browser and
refresh and as you guys can see now we
have a dip box now of course instead of
a background call it we could
essentially go into the code and say
background - IMG or like background test
image just go ahead and make it here so
its background
- image and then connect to say URL
parentheses and inside here we're going
to go and include some as semicolon up
semicolons single quotes and then we can
actually write the path to our image but
since we don't have anything yet I'm
just going to go ahead and comment it
out for now so now we're just going to
use the background color as a reference
so we know where the picture is so now
that we have this we're going to go
ahead and start styling our text inside
our website so underneath here I'm going
to go ahead and said okay so we have a
class called index - news and inside
this one we have a h3 I'm going to go
and open up my code and then I'm going
to go ahead and scroll up to the top
where I have my h2 styling for the index
intro I'm just going to go and copy that
since that's much faster and easier
paste it in here then I'm going to go
ahead and change my font weight to maybe
400 and then I'm going to go ahead and
change my font size to 18 pixels I'm
going to go ahead and make sure that the
text is aligned centered because of it
like that
I'm going to go ahead and add some
padding to the bottom as well so I'm
just going to keep that for now and I
would like to keep my uppercase take
text transformation one other thing I
might want to add is a color which we
don't actually have an h2 which should
probably have that inside our h2 so I'm
gonna go ahead and include a color as
black which is again has text your zero
zero
now I'm gonna refresh my code and as you
guys will notice our text changed we
might want to include a padding from the
top as well so I'm going to go back into
my code I'm going to go and copy the
padding bottom paste it below and change
the bottom part to top so refreshing the
browser you guys will notice that we now
have some distance now we can get
started on styling the paragraph and we
essentially just need to go ahead and
copy the class we just copied from the
h2 paste it below here change it from 83
to P as in paragraph change the font
weight to maybe 300 actually let's go
ahead and keep it at 400 and change the
text to 14 pixels I'm going to go ahead
and keep our padding-bottom but I'm
going to go in
remove my padding top and then I'm going
to go ahead and eliminate my text
transform to uppercase because we don't
need that as well I'm going to go and
save it and then I'm going to go and
refresh my browser as you guys can see
me now has since in the center text now
this might be quite a lot of text for a
news post maybe not I'm just going to go
ahead including this for now so now we
need to talk about adding other kinds of
articles next to each other we can
actually go ahead and keep the
background color which is red for now
since we need to use it to see what's
going on once we add all the other news
sex like news post so going inside our
index file we can actually copy our
article paste it below five times three
four five so now we have five articles
now as you will notice when i refresh my
browser all the images are like old
articles will actually go below each
other because we didn't tell them to
float next to each other so going inside
my code again inside my stylesheet I'm
going to go up to my article styling and
say float left refresh my browser and
you guys will notice we now have five
articles going next to each other now
this is a perfect moment to talk about
something called clear:both because i
might have mentioned it before but once
we have something that is floating some
elements after the floating is going to
float as well it's not going to
recognize our content inside the dip box
if you don't have a fixed height inside
out div so right now now you guys
consider the footer and our dip box
doesn't actually know the height of our
post that's because we're floating them
so we need to go back inside our styling
and we need to go down inside our our
index news and we need to add a piece of
code called overflow and set it to
hidden I'm going to save it refresh our
browser and what you guys will notice is
that now it recognizes all the content
again now one more thing because right
now you can see all our images are
touching each other and we might want
some spacing between them is that we do
actually want to go back inside our code
here and I'm going to go ahead and
include a or like not include but
inside our article we're going to go and
say with as 18 percent instead we're
also going to go ahead and include a
margin in here which is just going to be
margin we're going to make sure we have
no space in the top and bottom but you
do want some space from left to right so
we're going to go ahead and say zero
pixels from top and bottom and then
we're going to go ahead and say 1% from
left and right so doing it this way
since you have 18% width plus 1% plus 1%
because if we have on each side of it
it's going to add up to 100 once we have
five of them so I'm going to go ahead
and go into my code refresh and you guys
will notice we now have some space going
on so this is how we can essentially
create some news articles I'm just going
to go ahead and delete some of the stuff
such as for example our red background
color I am going to go ahead and refresh
to see how it looks like because right
now it doesn't look it doesn't look
pretty
but of course there's a lot of styling
can do to it but right now this is how
you include a news article so like I
said because we're using HTML CSS you're
actually going to have to go back inside
your code and you know change all this
text manually you can't actually do it
inside a CMS system so for now we're
just going to go and keep this now if
you want to use an image I'm not going
to do it in this episode because I don't
actually have an image prepared I should
probably done that but if you want to
include an image inside our Dib box you
can just go ahead and look up our
tutorial how to insert an image which is
tutorial number 9 which will show you
how to do that so I hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
