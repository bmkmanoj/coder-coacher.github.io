about how to comment inside PHP and this
is going to be a really short episode
because commenting is really not that
difficult so what we're going to do here
is we're going to go ahead and take a
look at these two lines that I wrote
here and let's say I want to comment out
one line of code now in order to do that
we're going to go ahead and go in front
of the code then we're going to write
backslash backslash and as you guys can
see we just commented out just one line
of code now what if I want to comment
out more than just one line of code what
we can do is we can actually instead of
the backslash backslash we can write
backslash multiply and everything that
comes after this comment tag is going to
get commented out so everything down
here even the HTML tags are going to get
commented out now I'm going to stop this
again after the part where we wanted to
stop we're going to say multiply
backslash so just the opposite of the
starting comment and everything that's
in between these two tags are going to
get commented out so one reason you
might want to comment in again you know
this is basically just a tick comment
but a lot of times when you have PHP
code you're going to see people who
write something like let's say I'm
writing a function that does something
specific I can say this gets something
from the database I can actually leave
this comment and everything that comes
after here I can actually you know start
writing code we can do you know like
function or we can do something that
there's some kind of code in here so now
we know that this function get something
from the database so you're going to see
a lot of commenting inside PHP because
PHP can get quite messy and it's really
important that you do actually comment
what stuff does when you code PHP
otherwise in the future you won't
actually be able to tell what something
does well you might be able to tell if
you look through the code but it's just
much easier just to have a comment that
says what this specific code actually
does so if you guys enjoyed this episode
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
