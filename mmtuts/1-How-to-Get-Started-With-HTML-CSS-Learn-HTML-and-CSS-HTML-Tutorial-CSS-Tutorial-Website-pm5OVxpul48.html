episode now to HTML and CSS now this
course here we're going to talk about
what HTML CSS is and how you can use it
to create complete websites now this
first episode we're going to talk about
what exactly HTML CSS can do and what
you need to have in order to get started
when it comes to making websites now
HTML stands for hypertext markup
language which basically means we can
take HTML wrap it around some content
inside some kind of coding document and
by doing this we then tell the browser
what exactly this content is so
basically we can tell the browser using
HTML that a specific section is the main
content of the website another section
might be the menu of the website so we
can use HTML to mark up specific parts
of a website and tell the browser what
it is so it's important to understand
that hTML is basically a language that
describes the structure of the content
inside websites now we talked a bit
about what exactly hTML is but what
about CSS now CSS is a language that you
don't need to learn in order to write a
website using HTML but without CSS you
can actually style the content inside
the website mean that it can actually
decide how the concert should look like
so let's take an example if I had a menu
inside my website the CSS code is
actually what decides how the menus will
look like you know how big the letter
should be what color the text should be
or where inside the website it should be
positioned so we need to learn CSS if
you want to make a website pretty and
structure the layout inside the browser
now CSS stands for cascading style
sheets which again explains that you can
style content inside HTML so now we
talked about what exactly HTML CSS is I
would like to serve as an example of how
HTML actually looks like so inside my
text editor here I'm going to go into
the second file I have and as you guys
can see you have some very basic HTML
code now like I explained HTML it's
basically used to wrap tags around
content such as text that you then
display inside a website now we're not
going to get into what these tags
specifically means at this time in this
episode but just to give you guys a
basic idea of what exactly HTML CSS
looks like this is how it looks like
so what we're going to do now is we're
going to go ahead and take a look at a
few text editors like the one I have
open here that we can use to create
websites so if you have any questions
regarding how we actually make the
website such as the actual process
basically we have a folder on our
computer which contains all the
documents and images and basically all
the media they have inside the website
it contains all these things and then we
later on upload this folder to an online
server and it's the documents inside the
folder that we'll need to create using
HTML CSS like the one I have in front of
me here so now let's talk about the
tools you might need to add to create a
website now like you guys may guess you
need a computer which I have in front of
me here and you need to have a basic
text editor another one I'm using is
called sublime text which is free so if
you want to download it you can go ahead
and go to sublime text come and then
inside this website you can go and
download sublime text now this version
is actually free like I mentioned but if
you don't want to get pop-ups from time
to time that says please buy the full
version then you will need to pay a
small amount now the other text editor
I'm going to show you guys that you
could use which is also free it's called
notepad plus plus and you might think
well you haven't heard about no plus
plus plus before we do actually have a
program on our computer called notepad
which is the basic version of this text
editor which you can actually use not to
create websites but since notepad is not
really good for that since it doesn't
have any kind of colors or indicators to
whether or not the code is correct I'm
going to recommend notepad plus plus
which can also be used as a basic text
editor now this one will not come up
with any kind of pop-ups if you do not
buy it so if you don't feel like paying
anything in you're tired of popups
inside upon text you can go and use this
one instead and of course there's other
software out there you could actually
use for creating websites but I'm just
going to mention these two because these
are the more basic ones that doesn't
confuse new people now at this times a
few questions before we actually get
into the next lesson because there are
some questions that I get asked quite
often when it comes to creating websites
which first of all is can you in fact
create a website without being connected
to the end
that yes you can because you can in fact
have your website inside the fold on
your computer like I said this is how I
actually create a website and open up
the documents inside your browser
without having to be connected to the
Internet another question that sometimes
get is can I in fact if I code a website
inside sublime text open up the same
documents inside another editor such as
notepad plus plus yes you can because
the text editor is not something that
create specific documents of files only
used inside these programs so if you
were to create this HTML file here and I
save it I can open up inside any kind of
text editor the next thing I want to
mention is some people also ask me about
how long it takes to actually learn HTML
before they can make a website like I
said in the beginning it depends on you
if you like to have a long sitting we
just learn episode after episode until
you can actually upload a website then
you could potentially do it in just one
day but again I think if you want to do
more complicated websites you might need
to learn a few more episodes than just
you know what you can do in one day now
the next question I'm going to answer is
regarding what it can actually do inside
a website using HTML CSS so as you guys
can see I have my YouTube page here
which is in fact due to website and
inside this page we have a bunch of
elements on the top here we have a bar
that has the YouTube logo that links
back to YouTube front page we have a
navigation at the side we have a search
bar we also have a couple of tools like
profile related tools over in the right
side we have my profile page with that
banner and some logos and some videos
down here at the bottom with some
different buttons here now when it comes
to HTML CSS the only thing we can create
using HTML CSS is the visible part
inside the website so we can in fact
create everything inside this page here
but we can't create all the
functionalities inside the page so we
could using HTML CSS program this bar up
in the top and the look of it and insert
all the images and all that stuff we
need to have in here you could also
create the search bar if you wanted to
but without using all the programming
languages we can't create functionality
meaning that if I were to actually type
something up in the search bar and
access
for it is not going to be able to work
at least not without using other
languages so we can create everything in
here we can insert images we can insert
links so we can actually go back and
forth between pages but we can create
stuff like subscribe login search bars
even the videos down here
I actually loaded in from a database
which requires another language not to
actually interact with the database so
we can create videos and the text you
guys see down here but we have to code
it in manually inside the code we can
actually get the data automatically from
a database and now max to talk about
databases which some of you guys might
not know what is actually used for
inside a website but the main thing I
want to get across is that you can
program everything you see inside the
website but not the functionalities okay
so we can make everything but you just
need to hard code it meaning that if you
need to change something you have to do
it using code each time which again is
totally doable but it might be easier
when you have functionalities that allow
for you to change stuff using other
languages later on the last thing I want
to mention before going to the next
episode is that the color scheme inside
my sublime text if you decide to get
sublime text does not look exactly the
same as yours if you just download
sublime text and installed it and open
it up because I'm actually using a
different color scheme inside sublime
text so if I write some code inside my
editor and it does not the same color as
yours don't get freaked out
the colors inside your screen doesn't
mean there's any kind of errors it is
just basically because I have another
color scheme okay so this is basically
what I want to save the first episode in
the next episode we're going to learn
how to get started on our first website
naps actually create the folder that I
talked about which we call a root folder
and how to create our first document
inside this root folder which is going
to be the front page of our website if
