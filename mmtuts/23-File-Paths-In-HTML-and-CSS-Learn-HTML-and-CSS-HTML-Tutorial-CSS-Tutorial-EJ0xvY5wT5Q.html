very short episode and something called
file paths now as you can hear I'm still
kind of sick so I have a really hard
time for some reason pronouncing path
when there's a th on the end with my
voice being like this but hopefully I'll
get through through this episode so a
lot of you had questions when it came to
the file path and I figured up just you
a short episode covering this so when it
comes to file paths we have two
different types of links we have
internal links where you can link to a
file let's say I have a folder that's
named folder and inside this folder I
have something like a file so I can
actually link to gallery dot HTML which
could be a file and then we could do it
in this way now we also have something
called URL paths paths which can link to
external websites if you want to and I
went ahead and link to my YouTube
channel here just to show an example so
it's a very simple process if you want
to do that now I'm just gonna go ahead
and delete the URL path and instead
we're gonna go and focus on file path
the path this so right now you guys can
see I just link to a file inside a
folder and in order to do that we need
to write the name of the folder which in
this case I just said folder it could be
includes if we had a folder called
includes and we can do that by simply
writing the name of the folder and then
for words less mean that we're gonna go
into that folder and then the name of
the file you want to link to now if you
want to go back a directory or pack a
folder let's say I'm inside a folder
called folder and I need to go back a
directory and then go inside the
includes folder then I can actually go
and say dot dot for slash which means
that we're gonna go back a directory
before we start doing all this path
thing going on here now there's a third
thing we can actually do which is
something that's not really considered
best practice but you can do it which is
if I just were to include a forward
slash in front of my path here let's say
I'm somewhere really really deep and
complicated inside some weird directory
deep down inside my website and I need
to go all
way back to you the main directory of my
website where we have the index page
then I can just write a forward slash
which means that we are referring to the
main directory inside the website and
this is one thing that you guys have
been asking me about because we can go
back to the main directory and just
simply link from there arriving forward
slash but like I said it's not really
bad best practices since in some cases
it can sort of screw up your you're
linking inside a website since we change
the mains and that sort of things so but
he can do it if you want to and if you
have an example we can actually do it so
this is what I want to say about file
paths I hope to see you guys next time
I'd like to say thank you to all the
people supporting me on patreon advance
to the next benefit such as lesson
materials then go ahead and visit the
link to do see on screen here and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
