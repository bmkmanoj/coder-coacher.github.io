write something inside the browser using
javascript and when it comes to writing
stuff inside the browser you know to
generate some kind of output there's a
couple of different ways we can do it
not just writing inside the actual web
site but also writing other different
places inside the browser so you might
not have seen before so the first
methods we're going to use is something
called alert now when we alert something
inside the browser it means that we are
writing some kind of text that will pop
up in a small alert box that you're
going to see inside the browser so I'm
just going to go ahead and show you guys
so you can see what I'm talking about
here so let's actually go and start out
by as you guys can see I have a very
basic HTML 5 layout here I'm going to go
and create my script tags so we can
actually start writing something now in
between my script tags I'm going to go
ahead and write alert parentheses
semi-colon and inside the parentheses
we're going to write a string which is
when you put quotation marks and write
some kind of text inside of here when
you use quotation marks is going to see
the you know the text as actual text and
we're going to talk about that in a few
episodes from now you know like the
different data types but for now
quotation marks means a string which is
text so I'm going to go ahead and say hi
there
make some beta mark which means the
right now if I go back into the browser
refresh it it's going to run that alert
code and as you guys can see I get a
small message that says hi there and I
can click OK so that is what happens
when you alert stuff let's actually talk
about writing stuff inside the actual
browser so if I were to delete this code
again and instead write document dot
write parenthesis semicolon and again
we're going to write a string inside the
parenthesis I'm going to say hi there
sexy go ahead there we go and if i
refresh the browser you guys will notice
we get hi there inside the actual
website
so using document write what we're
basically doing here is we're saying
okay we have a document and we're going
to use a method called right
which just basically writes something
inside out documents which is our file
here so that's another method we can use
node to actually write something inside
the browser you know some kind of output
now if I were to do something a little
bit different where let's say I have a
dip box inside my website and this dip
box has maybe an ID of something and
this by the way it's basic HTML so you
should notice by now and let's say this
dip box has an ID as test just for the
sake of this exercise what we can do
then is we can actually go ahead and
start over here and we're going to go
ahead and say we have a document which
again is this page here and inside this
document we want to get some kind of
element you know an HTML element that
has a specific ID so we're pointing
toward something they want to do
something to so I'm going to say get
element by ID notice that I did use a
big e a big B and a big I because it is
case sensitive so if you don't do
correctly it will not know what you're
trying to do with this piece of code
here and then I'm going to go and say
okay I have some kind of element inside
the website an HTML element and it has
an ID as test so now we're pointing
towards this thing up here and notice
that we do have a starting tag and a
closing tag of this element now
afterwards I'm going to say dot then I'm
going to write inner HTML with big HTML
and then I'm going to go and set equal
to something now it doesn't have to be a
string it could possibly be a number of
something and again we're going to talk
about different data types in the later
points but for now I'm just going to go
and keep you know using strengths so I'm
going to say hi there
now everything does move down on a new
line because it's not you know there's
no more space on the right size I'm just
going to zoom out a bit here now what
it's going to do is it's going to go
ahead and say okay we have an element
that has an ID as test which is this up
here and I'm going to go in between the
open and closing tags because we're
going inside you know
in the innerhtml and then we're going to
go ahead and you know output something
which in this case is a text called hi
there so if I go back again refresh you
guys can see there's no change because
the ID is still up here and now it's
writing out hi there again you know and
I did actually delete our document right
examples so that's not the thing going
again just pointing that out and that's
another way we can actually do this and
this one is slightly more complicated in
simply writing document right but
there's a lot of cases where you would
want to do something like this
which we'll get to you know in a later
episode now the last example I want to
show you guys is when we actually log
something inside the console of the
browser now you might not know what the
console is if you haven't actually done
anything
you know besides HTML and CSS but if I
were to write console dot log
parentheses and again now we're not
pointing towards our document now we're
actually pointing pointing towards the
console of the website you know of the
browser which I'll show you guys where
is afterwards and now we're using method
call log I'm going to go and write a
string in here I'm just going to go
ahead and write hi there and now I'm
going to go ahead and go in and refresh
my website again and as you guys can see
we get nothing inside the actual website
but if I were to right click inspect
elements or just inspect you guys can
see we get this little window here I can
actually go ahead and just do like so
inside our actual website that shows
different types of information we can
actually see the HTML elements of our
website here we can see the body tags
and we can actually see the JavaScript
code we wrote in here if I were to go up
to the console part at the top here you
guys can see it says hi there and you
might be asking what do we need to use
the console for well for JavaScript it's
really good for doing you know testing
and see if stuff is actually working
like it showed inside the website so at
a later point we will be using the
console for stuff let's say for example
I had to do something with you know
uploading images or something we can use
this console in here to see what's
actually going on
so that's basically it for the console
for now we'll get more into it later on
so that's the four different methods we
can actually write stuff inside the
browser and we did actually use
different things down here you know with
punctuation and we haven't actually
talked about what this stuff does you
know why do you write something with
parentheses on some of these things
we'll get to that in a future episode
for now that's a couple of basic things
that you need to know first before we
can actually dive into for example
objects and properties and methods and
so we're just going to go ahead and
cover a few of the basics first and then
we're going to start getting into
objects which we'll be using all the
time when it comes to JavaScript and
again just like with the PHP tutorial
series
I should probably you know mention that
a lot the stuff you learn inside
JavaScript is stuff that in the
beginning doesn't really make sense you
might not see what you need to user for
but in a later episode I will come up
with some exercises to serve as examples
of how we could use the JavaScript to
actually do something inside our website
because I know how frustrating it can be
or how boring it can be to learn
something and not know why you're
learning it it's really important you
guys understand exactly what the purpose
is of the stuff you learn inside these
tutorials so I think in a couple of
episodes from now we will actually start
talking about an example because
JavaScript is fairly quick when it comes
to actually doing examples so I hope you
guys enjoyed this episode and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
