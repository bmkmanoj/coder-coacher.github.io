every toots and I would like to welcome
you to my patreon now before we get into
the video I would like to thank you all
instead it's only because my subscribers
that I was able to actually jump into
patreon so again I just want to say
thank you in this video I would like to
talk a bit about Who I am and why I set
up a patreon account and what you can
actually get from becoming a patron on
it so a bit about me
currently I live in Denmark and way back
when I was studying at the University I
set up a YouTube channel in order to
help my classmates become better at what
was taught in school and today that is
what became mmm toots now educational
background is in multimedia design and
web development with a media design is
the study of all sorts of media such as
animation programming video production
and graphic design
now web development is a study of how to
create websites and how to communicate
the content on the pages and get to use
a good experience when they visit your
site so mm to taxi stands for multimedia
tutorials and even though there's many
programming lessons on my channel right
now I hope to in the future have a wider
variety of media courses such as you
know graphic design video production
animation user experience design you
know all those sort of courses that goes
under multimedia right now the upload
schedule is set to Monday Tuesday and
Thursday mainly because most people see
my videos at the beginning of the week
and just because I want to spread out
the days that I upload a bit I decided
not to go for Wednesday but instead
Thursday now the goal of my YouTube
channel is to make teaching available to
everyone for free all over the world but
having said this making things for free
is not really the best way to earn a
living
now with patreon I hope to offer rewards
that you can't get on my youtube channel
such as even better less material that
describes the courses or the lessons an
even better detail that are doing the
videos I'm also going to offer the
opportunity to download my videos so you
can actually have the videos on your
computer and I'm also going to offer you
guys wish to promote yourself on my
channel if you wish to
and finally on patreon you're going to
have access to the videos before they
get uploaded to YouTube because I tend
to upload the videos and then schedule
them for the upload so with this video I
hope that you guys understand exactly
what I want to do with my patreon
account and I hope to see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
