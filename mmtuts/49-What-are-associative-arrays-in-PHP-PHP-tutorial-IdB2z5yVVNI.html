something called associative arrays
inside PHP and associative arrays is
slightly different from what we've done
in the past where as an example like the
one I have here is what we call an
indexed array now an indexed array is
simply where we have a variable that's
equal to an array that has some kind of
data inside of it so right now I have
Daniel Nelson and my age so we have
three pieces of data inside this array
now when we want to echo this out inside
the browser I can do an echo but we say
they have variable data brackets and
then we can write some kind of number
inside the brackets for example if we
want Daniel inside the browser I can
write zero because my data is numbered
like zero one two so we always start at
zero so this is what we've done in the
past now what if I want to do something
that makes a bit more sense where we
actually named these data inside their
race then we can do something called an
associative array now the main
difference here is that instead of
writing numbers inside my echo when I
want to echo it out instead we can
actually write some kind of name that we
name these different data so let's say I
want to echo out Daniel I'm just gonna
refresh the browser as you guys can see
I do actually get Daniel I can go back
into my code and I can create a key for
each of these data we have inside the
array now a key is basically the name
that we put inside the data brackets
down here in order to get out the
specific data want to get out now in
order to create a key we can go back
into the array we can say we have a
string that is called
maybe first as an first name then I'm
gonna go and give this key a value by
writing equal to greater than which
points to a value which is Daniel so now
I've basically just named this data
first now we can go ahead and do this to
the second data as well by going into it
and writing double quotes because you
create a string call this one last and
then again we point to a value which in
this case is nelson now just to make
this a little bit easier to look at I'm
just gonna go and move this down to next
line so after each comma we get this in
separate lines
like so so now we only have one piece of
data left which is my age so I'm just
gonna couldn't give this one string as
well I'm gonna say H and then again I'm
gonna give it a value s 25 so right now
we named these different data and I can
actually go into my code down here where
we have echo data and teens the value
not just to show you guys if we're to go
and refresh you guys can see you get
undefined offset zero because it doesn't
understand what 0 means inside my echo
now if I go in and say that we have a
string called first and save it you guys
can see we get Daniel because now we
change the name from an indexed array
which is numbers into whatever we want
to call this data inside the array now
this is very useful to naming things cuz
right now if I were to get out the first
name of this array I wouldn't understand
we're in the sequence it is if I created
this array long time ago and I don't
remember the you know the order of the
data now another way we can create an
associative array is if I go ahead and
delete this data or at least delete the
first part of it or the last part of it
where we have variable data I can say
brackets create a string so I can say
this one is called first then I consider
equal to a string called Daniel if I can
spell that correctly there we go so now
we have the first data inside our data
where our data array which is equal to
Daniel and we already named it first of
course and go ahead and copy this down
two more times and just change the data
we have in here are the names to last
and to age then again change the values
to Nelson and 25 if I were to echo this
again you guys can see we still get
Daniel if we were to print our this just
as yeah it looks like like so and put
the variable data inside the print our
function we can actually see the full
array inside the browser so as you guys
can see we have the array then we have
the first data which in this case is not
zero anymore its first
which points to a value as Daniel then
we have last which punch to a value as
Nelson and then we have aged the points
to 25 so this is how we can create an
associative array and this is something
we can mix in with the other types of
Arabia inside PHP in order to create
something that we can understand was in
the next example what we do actually
talk about multi-dimensional arrays if
you were to pull out data from a
database like we did in a couple
episodes ago and put it inside an array
it would actually automatically become
an associative array where we get the
name of each column inside the database
so if you guys want to learn about that
you can go back a few episode and see
that video on that so this is the basic
idea behind associative arrays in the
next episode we're going to talk about
multi-dimensional arrays so we guys
enjoy it I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
