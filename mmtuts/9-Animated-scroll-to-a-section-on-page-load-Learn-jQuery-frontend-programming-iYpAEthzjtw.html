step so gonna learn how to create
something that allow for us to click on
a link which will then take us to a sub
page and then scroll down to the content
that we want to link to so to give you
guys an example why decide to do this
episode right now if you were to just in
HTML
create a link like a heaven type a
document here that links to for example
a ID called section 3 we can do this but
only if ID section 3 is inside the
current page that I'm inside of right
now and we can't actually do this on a
sub page without having to do it with
JavaScript or jQuery so what I would
like to do is when I click the link go
to a sub page which we can't do Justin
HTML and then afterwards go to the
section that we want to go to and just
to add a little bonus to it
I'd like to animate this so it actually
Scrolls down to the section without just
jumping down so what we're going to do
here is first of all as you guys can see
right now I have two pages I have a
index.html and a sub page that HTML
which right now we can see inside my
browser here so inside the index file I
have two buttons and have a go to
section 3 which will make sense when we
get to the sub page and I have a go to
the post section so if I were to go to
section 3 well which is right now
doesn't work because rather we haven't
actually created the JavaScript
particular function that will actually
allow us to do this you guys can see we
have two sub page here with different
sections in it so right now at section 1
to 3 which is what I was supposed to
scroll to and then we have the post
section down at the bottom here so what
we're going to do is when I click one of
these buttons
I should scroll down to the section that
I want to go to inside the sub page so
the way we're going to do this just to
explain how to set up my documents here
if we were to go to my index file you
guys can see have a very basic HTML file
set up I have my link to jQuery because
we will be using Jaykar in this episode
since this is a jquery series and I do
have a link to the script that we're
going to create in just a second which
will actually have the jQuery code that
allow for us to scroll down to
section then I have a title tag which
right now has nothing inside of it I
have the styling of what I have inside
my page here which is just basic styling
you know so we can actually see the box
they want to click on and then I have
the actual links down here just to links
with a box and then some text inside of
it now one thing to note here is that I
did actually put a link to the sub page
which is going to be called or which is
in fact called sub page HTML and I
included the ID that I want to scroll to
so right now I set section 3 in the
first one and that D called post in the
second one so we were to go inside the
sub page that HTML and scroll down as
you guys intuitive styling here just
like in the index file if I were to
scroll down to the section see you guys
can see they have four sections which I
showed you guys inside the website and
each of these have a class so we can
actually see different background colors
and the last two sections which I want
to create some kind of scroll event for
has an ID and these are the IDs that we
will have inside the index file now do I
pay attention to that I have an ID post
an ID section three but inside the sub
page we call its scroll - section three
and scroll - post and this is going to
make sense in just a second when we do
actually create the actual script for it
so what I want to do now is I would like
to create my main dot JS file which is
going to have the jQuery code inside of
it so I'm going to open up a new tab and
save it inside a root folder as main dot
KS and inside this file we need to go
ahead and create the actual document
ready function which we have inside the
accrued that allow for it to just load
all the code after loading everything
else inside the website so I'm going to
go and say dollar sign parentheses
documents dot
ready parentheses then we're going to go
ahead and say function inside the
parentheses here so once a function
parentheses curly brackets move down to
the next line and of course remembers
having the semicolon and then inside of
here we can actually go ahead and create
the code
that we need to actually do this so the
first thing I would like to do is when I
click this button here and go to my sub
page I would like to when the page is
loaded check if we have some kind of ID
inside the UL because right now the
words actually click on one of these
buttons such as the post section you
guys consider instead my URL I have sub
page that HTML ID post so I want to
check if we have any kind of IDs inside
the UL up here ok so inside my code I
would like to say we have a variable
which is just going to be a JavaScript
variable called
page underscore URL and it's going to be
equal to window dot location dot hyper
reference semicolon which is basically
just going to get the URL of the current
page the way inside up then I'm going to
go down to the next line I'm going to
create another variable which is going
to be the ID that we get from the page
URL so I'm going to say we have a
variable called page underscore ID is
going to be equal to page underscore URL
so basically getting URL from up inside
this variable here then we're going to
say dot and create a function called
substring which means we're going to get
part of this string we have up here
which is going to be the actual link to
the website or the page when set up to
and say for entities and inside the
parentheses here I would like to go
ahead and say we have the page
underscore URL and I would like to get
the last index of which is another
function of inside JavaScript index of
do pay attention to that I'm using a
capitalized I and a capitalized Oh
parentheses and I want to check if we
have any kind of a simple or something
inside this string here which is going
to be the UL now I do that by saying I
want to check for a hash tag or an ID
and then afterwards I would like to say
ok now we have the position of this hash
tag inside the UL
but it's not the hashtag on to get the
position of I want to get whatever
string is inside what comes after the
hashtag so we're going to say plus one
right next to it here so we're getting a
index of the hashtag which is going to
be the location of it but we don't want
the location of the hashtag want the you
know what comes afterwards to the saying
plus one so after we have this we can
actually go ahead and check if we have
an index that we got from up here which
is equal to any of the strings that we
have inside our IDs inside the page
inside the sub page at least so what can
do is we create an if statements and
inside where we check the condition
we're going to say if page underscore ID
which is the value of what we have up
here is equal to a string called section
three then I would like to do something
down here just compile it down now what
I want to do is I want to animate the
scroll inside the website so if we have
sex and three inside the UL let's
actually go ahead and just to show you
guys I'll lure it out what we have
inside page tidy when I click a button
like so if I were to go back to the
website just refresh you guys can see
now we echoed out the location of where
we are right now if we were to click one
of these buttons you guys can see we get
section three because there are six and
three inside D ID here if we were to go
back click on the post section here you
guys can see we get post so going back
and going into our code I would like to
delete the alert because I just want to
use it for testing purposes and inside
my is statement we're going to create a
selector which is going to select our
HTML and body so we can actually you
know grab the HTML body and change the
scrolling of our document inside the
website so going to say HTML
common space body so we're selecting
both elements inside the selector here
and then I would like to animate the
scroll position so we're going to use
the animate function or the animated
effect we have inside ta curry it's
going to say animate
then we're going to say parentheses and
then inside the parentheses we're going
to say curly brackets will dance the
next line and of course you want to add
a semicolon at the end here then inside
of our animates we would like to say
want to animate something I'm going to
select the scroll talk inside our
website we're going to say colon which
means the right now going to make
changes to the scroll top inside the
website which right now tells us the
current position of the scroll from the
top of the browser so right now for
what's actually load the page scroll
table is going to be equal to zero
because with zero pixels from the top
then I want to change it so it's not
your pixels so we're going to add a new
value right afterwards here meaning that
we're going to get the current position
of the ID that has a section three
inside of its name the way we do that is
by creating another selector we're going
to say select double quotes and we want
to select the ID that has a scroll - and
then whenever the name is inside the
pates ID up here it's going to be the ID
that we want to scroll to so I'm going
to say space plus and then add the page
underscore ID so we can actually combine
the string with our ID from inside
that's a variable up here
okay so right now this is going to be
equal to scroll - section three for what
- click the first button now you might
be asking why did I decide to use scroll
- in front of what we did here that is
because if it were to go inside my sub
page here you guys come to add it inside
that D and the only reason I've done to
do this is because if I were to call
anything inside this website section 3
then we're going to confuse the code so
to make sure that this ID has
specifically meant for
actually getting the scroll at the time
to just name it scroll - okay so to make
sure we didn't get any kind of errors in
the future inside of here again inside
our main decay s I'm going to say well
right now we're going to grab this ID
here but I also want to get the position
of the scroll - section 3 or post so I'm
going to say we want to have a offset
parenthesis from the top which is going
to have a value based of how far from
the top it is inside the website so
right now for were to save this and just
go down to the next line here because we
need to add a second parameter I'm going
to say comma space which is going to be
the amount of time it needs to take to
scroll down to the bottom so I'm going
to say we have maybe a thousand
milliseconds which is going to be one
second if we were to go back inside the
browser now you guys will notice that
when i refresh click on section three we
then scroll down to the section three
inside the browser here now there's a
couple examples to where when we scroll
down to section three for example if
whatever I targeted with that D is not
going to be let's say I scroll and it
stops here which is not good or it may
maybe it stops here because the ideas
inside the text and not inside the
container then it's going to mess up the
title a bit if it stops right here
because it doesn't look nice so maybe I
want to stop it a bit too for the actual
section where it starts so to show you
guys an example of this let's actually
go ahead and go back inside the code and
say that okay so now we check if we
clicked on section three let's go ahead
and check if we click on the post button
so I'm going to say else if parentheses
curly brackets and I'm just going to
copy what we have inside the condition
up here but instead I'm going to check
for posts then I'm going to copy what we
have down here because we need the same
code like so and after we say top so
again basically we're doing is we want
to say want to set and you scroll
which is going to be a new position from
the top of the browser I want to set it
to the position of the element that I
chose which is the post ID and check how
far from the top the post ID is and said
that as the new value but what we can
also do here is after we say okay we
want to get the value from the top with
the ID we can then add or subtract a
certain number of pixels so we would say
I want to subtract 20 pixels I could say
20 just like so if I were to go back
inside the browser and go back to the
front page refresh click the post
section you guys notice it Scrolls down
well we can't actually see it here
because we can't access go further down
the page let's go back and do this to
our section 3 instead go back refresh
click it now guys will see that it stops
20 pixels before getting to section 3
again if I wanted to do it after I can
just add a plus instead let's actually
change this to a 100 just to do a bit of
exaggeration go back refresh and go to
section 3 you guys can see it goes down
100 pixels below the section 3 section
so this is how we can actually scroll
down to a certain link or a certain
section of a sub page using jQuery which
is something that a lot of people use
when they want to you know go to another
page with information but they don't
just suddenly want to jump to the
content that they want to have to have a
animated scroll or something going on to
make it look a bit nice so if you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
