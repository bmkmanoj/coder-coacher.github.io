loops inside the other script and
because we now know about loops I
thought it'd be a good idea to talk
about the different statements we can
use inside a loop so what I'm talking
about is the right now inside JavaScript
we have a statement called break and one
called continue so if I were to go ahead
and run a loop like the one have inside
my screen here this is just a very basic
for loop that goes ahead and prints out
numbers inside the browser each time it
loops through the numbers so write down
set the browser so we get 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 and 9 now if I were to go ahead and
use a break statement inside this loop
it's gonna go and say that
well let's AXA consider one specific
statement is going to be true once we
loop through one of these loops then
it's gonna go ahead and break and stop
looping through the rest of the loop so
right now for where to go inside this
for loop and say we have an if statement
there's to demonstrate what exactly a
break actually does and say that I right
now is equal to 4 then inside the curly
brackets we're gonna go ahead and say is
to go ahead and break the loop so to say
break semicolon now what this basically
does is that when it starts looping and
we get to the number 4 it's gonna go
ahead and check well oops is equal to 4
therefore as you break the loop and
therefore it's not gonna continue the
loop once we hit a specific points so if
I go inside my browser refresh you guys
can see that the loop stops after the
fourth loop because right now we told so
break is not gonna continue looping now
if we were to go back inside my code and
say well instead of breaking when we hit
number 4 inside I when I is equal to 4
let's actually go ahead and write
continue now this basically does is kind
of the same thing as break but instead
of stopping the entire loop after I is
equal to 4 it's just gonna go ahead and
skip past the loop where I is equal to 4
and then it's gonna continue looping
through the rest of the loop so right
now for what to save this refresh the
browser you guys consider we get 0 1 2 3
but 4 is missing then we get 5 6 7 8 9
so these are two different state
means we can use inside loops whether it
being a for loop a for in loop a while
loop or do-while loop so hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
