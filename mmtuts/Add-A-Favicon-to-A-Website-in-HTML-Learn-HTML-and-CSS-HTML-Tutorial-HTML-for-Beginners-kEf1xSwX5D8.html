a favicon inside our website and if you
don't know what a favicon is it's
basically the small icon that we see up
in the tap when we view a website inside
the browser so as you guys can see in my
browser behind the side inside Google
over here we do like to have a small
icon up in the top here that shows you
know two small Google logo now inside
this website here that I just created
which is just a basic empty template we
don't have any kind of icons so inside a
professional website it makes sense that
we want to have the website logo or
something else inside the tab so before
we get started this one thing I want to
do here since my monitor is quite big
and the icons up here is quite small and
you guys can really see what's going on
in here I'm just going to go and sue
mout what you guys can see here so you
can see whop in the top and so you guys
can actually see what's going on inside
the tabs now in order to get a favicon
working I went ahead and went inside my
root folder of my website which is right
here as you guys can see I have my index
file and I created a folder called image
now inside my image folder I have a
image of my youtube channel logo which
are designed to call that I con dot PNG
well I didn't really decide to call it
is I recommend you guys call it this
because you need to have a separate
image for your favicon now one thing to
note about this image here which is of
course the icon we're going to insert
inside our tab is that it should not be
very big now I do actually have a very
big logo here because I did not prepare
a small image but if you were to use a
favicon you need to make sure that the
icon is not a huge image that's like 500
times 500 pixels instead you should try
and make it very small to save up space
you know the larger the image is the
more resources need to be loaded inside
the website and since the favicon is
going to be on every single page of your
website you don't want it to be very
resourceful
okay so now that we have an image or at
least this image view of which you guys
can download in the description of this
video if you want to have it just for
practice and we're going to go ahead and
insert it inside our website so inside
my HTML document inside the head tag
we're going to go ahead and include
with a link so I'm just going to go and
include a link tag and inside this link
tag we're going to go ahead and include
a rel attribute inside the rel attribute
we're going to set this type of link to
shortcut space icon now after the rel
attribute we're going to go ahead and
set a type attribute the type attribute
is going to be a image /p and D and
after the type we're going to go ahead
and set a link to the actual image so
I'm going to set a hyper reference to
the folder called image we're going to
dig inside of it with a forward slash
and we're going to go ahead and set this
one as Feb I con dot T and G so now
we're actually linking to the image we
can go inside our browser and as you
guys can see when I do actually refresh
the browser we get a favicon so this is
a very simple thing to do it's not
really complicated so we're not going to
spend too much you know time in this
episode so hope you guys enjoyed it and
learn how to insert the Save icon and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
