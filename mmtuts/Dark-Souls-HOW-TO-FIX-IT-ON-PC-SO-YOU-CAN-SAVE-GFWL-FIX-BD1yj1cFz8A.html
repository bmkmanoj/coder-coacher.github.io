episode I'm going to be talking about a
huge issue the do PC gamers are going to
have if you try to play Dark Souls on
the PC now whether you got it on Steam
or if you have it on disk you know you
will have issues with it
Dark Souls was made for the consoles not
for the PC which means that it is pretty
much unplayable if you try to use your
mouse and keyboard so I'm not going to
talk about how to do that in this
episode but I have another video I'm
going to go and put the link in the
description where I show you guys how to
hook up a PlayStation or an Xbox
controller to your PC ok so go ahead and
check that out if you don't know how to
do that
in this episode however I'm going to be
talking about the fact that you cannot
save your game in Dark Souls unless you
have GIMP games Windows Live hooked up
to your computer so I'm going to show
you guys how to fix this and don't make
this overcomplicated it is very easy to
do and I swear I was spending three
hours on the internet trying to figure
out how to fix this and there was some
forms where people just overcomplicated
it and it doesn't have to be difficult
it is very easy to fix okay now as you
may notice I'm on Windows 8 I'm not on
Windows 7 that doesn't matter so don't
freak out okay if your Windows 7 it's
fine you can use the same method as I
use to fix this so first thing you're
going to do is well you need to
uninstall games Windows Live okay you
cannot do anything before you've done
that so go ahead and open up you know
programs and features inside the control
panel and so it's for Microsoft games
and you should have these two programs
here one of them is called Microsoft
games with Windows Live redistributable
and the other one is called Microsoft
games of windows marketplace you need to
uninstall both of them to make this work
okay
uninstall both of them and then restart
your computer and get back to this
tutorial and I'll show you guys what to
do from here on so after you've done
that and I expect you guys to be back
now after you've done that you're going
to go ahead and open up your browser
well you're probably already in the
browser if you're watching this tutorial
go ahead and go to this link that I have
provided in the description it is a link
to the Xbox you know comm website where
you can in fact download a game from
Windows Live Marketplace installation
just like that before
download that and then we will go
through how to install this the correct
way now when you get it after you
download it you should have this little
file here to set up for it
do not start installing it instead you
need to right-click on it open up the
properties inside here go to
compatibility and then down here you're
going to want to go down to run this
program in compatibility mode for and
then choose whatever program you have or
what kind of system you're running your
computer on if you have Windows 7 you
choose Windows 7 if your Windows 8 you
choose Windows 8 now I'm gonna windows 8
so I'm going to keep it like that make
sure you check off the little box that
says run this program in compatibility
mode for blah blah now after you've done
that in the bottom here it says run this
program as an administrator check that
one off to say ok or apply and then ok
ok and then go ahead and install games
Windows Live here just double click it
or right-click and save run as
administrator after you've done that you
see get this window that looks similar
to this we can lock into games windows
marketplace now it should not give you
an error if you did not you know choose
Windows 8 if you had Windows 8 or
something like that inside what we just
did it it will give you an error but if
you did it correctly it should not so it
opens this up and you can log-in and
everything if you do not have an account
go ahead and create an account because
you're going to need it and that's
basically all you need to do here now if
you go ahead and open up your game your
Dark Souls game instead of saying that
oh you're not logged in to games in
Windows Live or whatever you cannot you
know you're going to have to play this
game in offline mode and you cannot save
the game it's not going to say that
anymore it's going to pop up with just a
little dashboard from the top from games
Windows Live we can lock in and after
you login you can in fact save your game
inside with dark souls ok it's very
simple that's
all you need to do it will now work for
you okay I hope this was really useful
for you guys I swear I spent a long time
figuring this out there's like no
tutorials anywhere on how to do this
stuff okay I hope this was useful go
ahead and leave a like if it was
subscribe to see more stuff for me
yeah it helps a lot and I hope to see
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
