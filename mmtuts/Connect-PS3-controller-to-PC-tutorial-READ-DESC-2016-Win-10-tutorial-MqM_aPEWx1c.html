we're going to talk about how to connect
the PlayStation 3 controller to PC you
can actually play video games with it
now this is a video that works for
Windows 10 which means that I think this
is pretty updated at least compared to
the last video I did on Windows 7 this
should be pretty updated so we're going
to talk about how to actually set up the
controller we're going to talk about
what kind of software we're going to
need and we're going to talk about an
issue that you guys may run into when
you set up the controller which is the
fact that the software going to use is
not going to recognize your controller
so the first thing we're going to do
here is we're going to go ahead and
download the software we're going to
need well the first thing you guys to do
is probably get a PlayStation 3
controller and USB cable so you can
actually hook it up to the PC but just
go ahead and wait with that don't
actually hook it up yet so the software
you're going to need is going to be a
software called motion joy which I do
actually have right here I'm going to go
ahead and leave the link in the
description so you guys can just go
ahead and download it and once you
download and install it we're going to
go ahead and get another software that
you're going to need in order to make
this a little bit easier every time you
connect your controller to the PC
now the second software you going to
need is one called better ds3 tool which
is like I said a software makes it
easier and faster to connect to control
each time you need to use it so you can
either download from this link that I
have here or from the same website as
before which is also linked I'm going to
put it in the description so you guys
can get it from whichever website you
want to get it from now the thing we're
going to do here is we're going to go
ahead and open up the first software
which is called motion joy and this
software looks really Naughton
user-friendly it doesn't look very good
but we don't need to do a lot of things
in here so don't worry about it now what
you're going to do is you're going to go
and open up the software you're going to
take a controller you're going to take
your cable you're going to hook it up to
the PC so and like so and we get a
beeping sound as you guys can see it's
actually hooked up now this lights in it
now once this is hooked up what you need
to do is you're going to go ahead and go
into your motion joy again and as you
guys can see does actually recognize my
controller here now this is because I've
already set up my controller but just to
show you guys what you need to do in
to get this working is you need to go
into driver manager because your control
is most likely not going to be right
here inside connected game controllers
so you're going to go to driver manager
and it's going to open up a new window
where you can actually see the control
in here so if you can actually see it go
ahead and check it off and say load
driver and it's actually going to load
the driver for the controller now some
people run into the error where as you
guys can see mine does actually say load
driver Papapa completed some people are
going to get a red error message that
says that the controller could not be
loaded or something like that and this
is the fix that we need to look into
just after we look into how to actually
do this sort of thing like actually
connecting the controller so at the end
here we're going to talk about how to
fix that issue so if you did actually
succeed and is connected you can
actually go back to your profiles and in
here you're going to go ahead and select
the control life if it did not select it
already for you and then you're going to
go down and set the input as xbox 360
controller emulator and yes I do notice
this a PlayStation 3 controller but
trust me on this one just go ahead and
choose Xbox 360 controller after you've
done this you can actually do a
vibration test to test it it does active
vibrate and you can say enable once
you've done that we can actually close
down the program afterwards you're going
to go ahead and open my better ds3 exe
which is the other tool be downloaded
and as you guys can see my controller
now shows up inside the program now
after I have it in here you can actually
go ahead and say new and then create a
new profile because we do X need to tell
it how the buttons should be laid out so
we're going to go ahead and choose the
one called excel input once you're in
here you can actually go ahead and give
it a name I'm just going to call this
one ps3 controller of something and then
you're going to go ahead and make sure
that it says that the controller
template is set to Dualshock 3 and then
you're going to say autofill Xbox 360
and yes I know it says autofill Xbox 360
but just go ahead and click it and you
guys can see it does actually change all
the buttons at this the layout follow
the buttons in here
once you change all the layouts it
should be set up as a PlayStation 3
controller even though
xbox360 so just go ahead and do that
once you've done that you can just say
save profile so now that you saved it
you can actually go ahead and select the
profile down here and as you guys can
see I have my ps3 controller I select it
I can actually hit apply and that's
basically it now I can start up a game
and use the controller so every time you
need to set up or like startup the
control we need to use it all you need
to do is open this program not motion
joy and just simply select your
controller and you know select the
profile and click apply and then you can
use it now if you did in fact run into
the issue that I talked about before
where the controller did not get
recognized then I have a fix for you
because I did actually get quite a few
comments of people saying that they did
not get it recognized and I just
upgraded to Windows 10 not long ago and
I had to reinstall this software which
means that I did actually need to set it
up again and I ran into the same issue
so if you did actually run into this
issue I have a link for you here and
this is basically a small description it
says down here step one step two step
three and so on so on and so on on how
to set up the driver for the controller
because right now your Windows operating
system does not allow the driver for a
controller to be recognized so need to
allow it to do that so the first thing
you're going to do as it says is you're
going to go and you know click the start
menu you're going to go to settings just
go and drag it over here inside your
settings you're going to go to update
and security now depending on if you're
on Windows 7 or Windows 8 or 8.1 it
might look a bit different but just go
ahead and go to update and security
inside your control panel in here you're
going to go to recovery which is over
here in the left side and down here
which says advanced startup you're going
to go ahead and click restart now but
not quite yet because I'm not done
talking
once you hit restart now it will
actually restart your computer and boot
it up in some kind of mode where you can
actually go in and change settings on
the computer and that sort of thing once
you're in there like it says inside the
guide you're going to go ahead and click
troubleshoot which is one of the buttons
in there you're going to click Advanced
Options you're going to click startup
settings and in here you're going to get
a
different options after reboots again a
thing is going to reboot again and you
can actually choose to disable driver
signature enforcement after boots up the
second time now the way you're going to
choose that is by clicking f7 like it
says here and once you do that it's
going to restart your computer and boot
it up normally and that's all you need
to do just to make sure that it doesn't
block your driver for your controller so
once you've done that and go back to
motion joy and load the controller
software if you do actually go back to
motion joy here let me just go ahead and
open it up you're going to go back into
motion joy you're going to go to driver
manager
and once I hit that you know load drive
after you take it off load driver it
should not give you an error message and
then you can just follow on this episode
from the beginning so I hope you guys
enjoyed I hope this work for you I do
not know what's wrong if it does not
work for you I get a lot of people
asking me you know if it does not work
what should they do I don't know but it
did actually literally take me five
minutes to figure out how to do this so
you know a quick google search should
make you guys figure out something when
it comes to not connecting the
controller so hope you guys enjoyed and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
