something called user-defined functions
inside the other script and this is
something that's really important to
know because you will be using functions
all the time whenever you create some
kind of JavaScript application so I did
actually think that I had created an
episode on this before but looking back
on my series here I realized that I
forgot to do so so we're going to do
that today because we will be using it
in the next episode when we learn how to
create an image banner inside a website
from scratch using JavaScript so when it
comes to functions that we call use of
defined functions is slightly different
than what we call built-in functions a
building function is a function that we
have inside the JavaScript language and
a user-defined function is a function we
build ourselves okay now what's
important to know about functions is
that one function does one specific
thing
so one function has one task whether
that being calculating a price for
website let's say you have a shopping
cart or if you want to print out certain
names inside the browser then one
function to do one thing and the reason
for that is that functions are something
that should be able to to call on
whenever we need to do one specific
thing okay so if we were to create a
function that does a bunch of things
inside the function then it might end up
being so complicated that we can only
use it for one thing inside the website
so we need to make sure that one
function is so flexible that we can use
of multiple times inside our website now
to give you guys an example let's say I
have a website that has a image banner
you know one of those that rotates and
slides every couple of seconds inside a
website if I were to take my mouse
cursor and move my cursor on top of the
image banner and I wanted to pause
whenever the mouse is on top of the
banner then we use a function to
activate the pause each time we enter
with the mouse if it were to leave with
the mouse again I wanted to continue and
then we invoke another function that
continues the loop inside the banner so
those two functions has one specific
task one needs to pause the banner and
one needs to start the banner so we
start out by writing a function by
writing the keyword function which tells
the browser that this is a function then
we need to give the function some kind
of name so we're going to say
and for my function again you can name
it any kind of name you want I just
decided to call it my function here then
afterwards you need to write curly
brackets and then whatever code goes
inside the function needs to go in
between the curly brackets so basically
what we have here is a very basic
function with nothing inside of it so we
don't have any code in here that will
actually run when we do actually call on
the function so if I were to say that
this function has to have a purpose
let's say I want to write out which
person goes to which meeting let's
actually go ahead and do that by saying
document dot get element by ID
parentheses and say I want to get this
paragraph up here that has an ideas test
and I want to insert some kind of text
inside this paragraph whenever a call on
this function so let's actually go ahead
and say we have a inner HTML which is
equal to some kind of text so for word
to say Daniel is attending the meeting
on Friday like so so whenever I call in
this function it will write Daniel is
attending the meeting on Friday
inside this paragraph up here so for
watch actually go ahead and go down
below the function and say that I want
to invoke which is actually call when we
do actually call on the function you
know actually activate it
I want to invoke the function called my
function I'm going to say my function
parentheses semicolon and then if we
were to actually load up this website
inside the browser you guys can see
Daniel is attending the meeting on May
11th so we do actually get the text
inside the browser now this was actually
one way of doing it because right now as
you guys can see I did actually insert
the text directly inside the function so
it would actually pop up inside the
paragraph up here but typically inside a
function we do something called return
which is when we return a value inside a
function that we can use later on inside
our code so if I were to go and delete
what we have to at least delete the
first part until the equal sign now
you guys can see we have to message and
what I can do instead it's a return
daniel is attending the meeting on
friday then below here where did
actually call the function i can instead
say document dot get element by ID
parenthesis dot inner HTML is equal to
my function let's actually go ahead and
spell that correctly like so call on the
ID called test this is actually how we
do it because right now we're turning
the value inside the function and then i
went ahead and took the value and insert
it inside the statement down here so now
if i were to go back inside a browser
you guys can see we get the exact same
thing well I could actually change the
text to John is attending the meeting on
Friday so now you guys can actually see
we've got a different value inside the
browser now just to show you guys
another thing when it comes to functions
right now we have some kind of code to
run inside the function we could
actually go and say something different
which is we could actually go ahead and
insert parameters inside the function
which is actually something we do quite
often inside JavaScript code so if I
were to go inside the parenthesis of my
function and say well at some point
inside the function I'm going to
actually call on it we will be using
some kind of data from the outside the
function so it can go inside the
function and say we have a piece of data
called
person comma because we want to have a
second piece of data called date so
basically what I'm doing here is I'm
saying that at a later point when I want
to use two function multiple times I'm
going to go and insert some data inside
the function which is then going to take
and do something with inside whatever is
inside the curly brackets so right now
we did access eight John is attending
the meeting on Friday I'm going to go
and delete John and before the double
quote I'm going to say person because
this is a variable we call person I
didn't mention that but this is in fact
variables I inserted inside the
parentheses and then afterwards instead
of saying Friday we're going to go and
delete what we have here and say plus
so now we're getting the variables from
inside the parentheses and inserting
them inside the statement here so right
now for words I actually go back inside
the browser and refresh you guys can see
it says undefined is attending the
meeting on undefined and that's because
right now we don't have any kind of
value inside the parentheses here right
now we're just saying that we want
variable person a variable date to be
inserted inside this return statement
and if I were to go down when we do
actually call on the function we have no
data inside the parentheses so we need
to insert two pieces of data because I
entered two pieces of variables up here
so we can actually write them out inside
the browser so if we were to go inside
my function down here and say we have a
string called Daniel sexy fill out
correctly like so and I have a second
piece of data called Thursday like so
then if I go inside the browser you guys
will notice that instead of undefined we
get the data we inserted so Daniel is
attending the meeting on Thursday so
this is how we can write functions
inside the other script now one more
thing I want to mention is that when we
want to activate functions we can either
do it by doing it directly inside dava
script code like we did here we can also
do it whenever the person does something
you know any kind of user does something
inside a website like putting the mouse
cursor inside a banner that we have on
our website that's an example or if the
user were to click on something inside
the website we can actually activate
these functions so it's important to
note these functions don't actually run
until we invoke them so you shouldn't be
afraid that we do actually use the
function before we have actually invoked
it functions are just something that
keeps data and stores it until we
actually call the function so it's not
going to do anything till we invoke it a
third example of when a function does
actually run could be if I were to say
it had to run automatically at a certain
points by writing some kind of Java code
that actually runs it automatically then
we can also do it that way
so now that we talked about functions
let's actually talk about what we're
going to do in the next episode because
in the next episode we're going to learn
how to create an image slider inside a
website and we're going to create a
really easy image slider that looks
really cool that actually slides between
the
images and has buttons in it so we can
actually switch the images ourselves and
each slide might actually have some kind
of text inside of it that actually
slides with the image so it contains the
text as we go so if you guys enjoyed
this episode and I hope you guys will
look forward to the next episode we're
going to actually do something using the
JavaScript we've been learning in all
the episodes we've done so far
so if you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
