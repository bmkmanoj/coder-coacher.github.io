review and this one will take a look at
the hmm sound of Liam microphone just
you guys are aware i'm actually using
the test cam dro five this review so
before we get started here i want to
mention i'm using the actual microphone
with this entire review now I did
equalise the sound so later on this
little video here I will actually do a
sound test where I have not done
anything to the sound clip now the
person making the microphone is actually
located in Thailand and supposedly he's
hand making them himself now in the
beginning us a little bit skeptical but
the person told me about this microphone
is it sound specialist so I decided to
try it out an order at home so now you
guys know bit about the microphone let's
go ahead and actually see the product
and see how it came to me when I ordered
it ok so now let's go and take a look
the microphone as you guys can hear the
sound quality is a bit different because
i'm actually not using the microphone
right now i'm only using my task on
recorder to record my voice so if you
think that the sound quality is a bit
different right now it's because i'm not
using the microphone so as you guys can
see it did actually show up in a
packaging which i did not expect i
actually thought i had to go out and buy
a little box forward so I you know it
didn't get screwed up at some point when
I was traveling which i think is a
really nice detail about this microphone
so if i omit up here you can actually
see that it comes with four different
compartments for extra equipment and has
one compartment for the microphone ok so
just to show off some of the equipment
it came with here it did actually come
with a clip on as you guys can see here
this clip on is meant for going on the
shirt or something when they
interviewing people which you know a
microphone like this needs to have so
that's pretty much standard that it came
with that one it did also come with this
little microphone and piece that you can
actually put on top of the microphone in
order for it not to get messed up when
people are touching stuff it also came
with a foam ball that you can put on top
of the microphone to limit all the s
sounds when you talk or if you're
standing outside and there's some wind
blowing it can also be really useful so
if you take a look at the microphone
here it did actually come with not just
a microphone in here it also came with
this little add-on for iphones i think
it is which i'm not really going to be
using because i don't have an iphone i
don't have
you know I don't have a need to record
inside a phone so I'm just going to keep
that out there but as you guys can see
the microphone is pretty heavy on the
end here which it should be it should
not be easy to break it looks like a
standard microphone and I'm need to
mention that if you do use this
microphone you need to have phantom
power on the device recording into all
you need to have something called Mike
power which i'm using my tascam okay so
now I look back I would like to do a
short sound test like I promised you
guys I would do without equalizing the
sound so here it goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 this
is a test I am now testing to see how
the microphone sounds like when there's
no background noise removed and I did
not equalize the sound the only thing I
did to you was to raise the desert bells
so the volume sounds just about the same
surest in this video on 2 3 4 5 this is
a test okay so a few last things before
we end up this video here want to
mention that i did buy this microphone
because i needed a microphone i could
clip onto the color of the people I
interviewed when I had to go to clients
and stuff I did not have it for very
long yet so i cannot tell you guys how
good it is compared to other microphones
but for now i think i'm pretty much
satisfied with it so i hope you guys
enjoyed this little video here i hope
you guys find it useful and i hope to
see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
