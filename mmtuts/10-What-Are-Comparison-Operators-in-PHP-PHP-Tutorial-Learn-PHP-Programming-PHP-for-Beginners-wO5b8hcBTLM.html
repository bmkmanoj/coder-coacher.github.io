about something called comparison
operators inside PHP and this is
actually a really important episode for
you guys because you will actually be
using comparison operators quite often
when you write PHP code so as you guys
can see I did actually write some stuff
on the screen already I wrote that
variable X is equal to 5 and variable Y
is equal to 10 I also wrote something
down here
which we didn't actually talk about yet
called an if-else statement now the
basic idea behind an if-else statement
is we're going to put something inside
these parentheses and if that is true
then it's going to do whatever I put
down here if whatever's inside the
parentheses are false
then it's going to jump down to next
line and do this down here instead so
what we can do here is we can actually
go ahead and take our variables called x
and y put them inside the parentheses
and then write something in between them
to compare them to each other so that's
what we mean by comparison operators
whatever we put in between these two
variables are going to be the comparison
operator so I can actually go ahead and
check if these are equal to each other
by writing equal equal now you need to
understand the difference between
writing equal equal equal and equal
equal equal because there's actually a
difference between them so when we write
equal was saying that X is equal to 5 if
you write equal equal I can actually
write it up here as well then Y actually
checking if X is the same as 5 so there
is a difference between using different
types of equal signs and this is
something that some people might get a
little bit confusing in the beginning
when you start learning PHP so as long
as you learn these differences you
should be fine so right now we're
actually checking if X is the same as Y
and as we can see it's not so if I go
ahead and refresh the browser it should
actually say false and as you guys can
see if i zoom in a little bit it does
actually say false now we can also go
ahead and say well ok so these are not
equal to each other if I do actually go
up and change my 10 to a 5 now that
should actually be equal to each other
and say true so if i refresh the browser
you can say so it's true now we can also
go in and say okay but what it what if I
want to take if these are not equal to
each other
we're actually going to be using a
symbol called exclamation mark and put
it in front of equal signs and we're
actually going to remove one of the
equal signs
so we're basically replacing one of the
equal signs with an exclamation mark
which basically says if X is not equal
to Y then it needs to print out true and
right now it should actually say false
because X is in fact equal to Y they're
both five so if I go refresh the browser
you guys can say it says false so if you
go back again and change the five back
to a 10 refresh the browser it will in
fact say true now let's actually go
ahead and talk about the next equal sign
when you put three in here basic what
we're saying here is that if X is equal
to Y and it's the same data type then it
should print out true so if I go ahead
and refresh the browser it should
probably say false because both x and y
are not equal to each other so one well
actually both of these condition
actually no one condition is not true
right now because they're both the same
data type but they're not the same you
know number so if I actually changed my
5 to a 10 it will actually say true
because now both conditions are true
it's the same number and the same data
type now if we actually go in and change
the Y to a string instead of putting you
know double quotes around the 10 refresh
the browser you guys will notice it will
actually say false and that's because
right now the X is a 10 which is an
integer and Y is a string even though it
says 10 if I do actually move one equal
sign it does not check for data type
meaning that these are in fact the same
numbers so if i refresh the browser it
says true even though they're not the
same data type now we do also have some
other ones and let me actually just go
ahead and go back a little bit so we
have 5 for X and 10 for Y so if I go in
and delete the equal signs inside the if
statements we can actually say if X is
lesser than Y then it should say true by
using the lesser than symbol if I go
refresh the
you'll say it says true because X is
five which is lesser than ten if I
change this one to greater than it says
false now we also have one that says
lesser than or greater than and equal so
we can actually say if it's greater than
and equal it still says false so right
now I can actually set it to let's say
we both have 10 for X and 10 for Y so
right now it's not greater than that X
is not greater than Y but it is in fact
equal to mean that we will actually get
true so we have a bunch of different
statements here and there's a lot of
them out there well there's not a lot of
them out there I think we did actually
cover most of them there's one more that
we didn't actually cover xe2 we didn't
cover yet which is if you want to check
if something is not the same number and
datatype again you just replace one
equal sign with an exclamation mark okay
so that's the basic difference here
another one we can use to check if
something is not identical or not equal
to each other which would be the same as
this right here which we talked about in
one of the first ones we can actually go
ahead and write lesser than and equal to
lesser than and greater than and it will
in fact check if this is not equal to
each other and it's the same thing so I
usually don't use this one because
there's another one that does the same
one but that's actually the last one
we're going to talk about so that's the
basic idea behind comparison operators
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
