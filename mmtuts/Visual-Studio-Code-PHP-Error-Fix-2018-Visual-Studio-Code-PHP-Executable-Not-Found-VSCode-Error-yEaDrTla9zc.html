to turn how to fix a specific error
message inside Visual Studio code so
what I did here is a completely clean
install Visual Studio code my computer
in order to actually get this error
message so what I'm going to do here is
I'm going to open up a new file and I'm
going to go ahead and set this one as a
PHP file by clicking the plain text
button we have down in the right corner
and I'm going to set it as a PHP file
and you'll immediately see that we get
an error message says cannot validate
since no PHP executable is set PHP
executable not found install PHP seven
and add it to your path or set it to PHP
executable path setting okay so because
Visual Studio is a bit more non user
friendly than other text editors such as
atom or sublime text it does want you to
set a executable path to PHP now if this
is your first time seeing this error
message you might be thinking what I
need to install PHP in order to actually
do this in which I have to say well we
kind of do because remember when we do
need to use PHP locally on our computer
we need to install a server which is
going to be locally set on your computer
so we need to install a local host that
we can access to inside the browser
meaning that there's a lot of software
out there you have vamp you have examp
you have MAMP
there's a lot of them out there and the
one I have installed on my computer is
the one called xampp which looks like
this okay now xampp is just one of the
possibilities it doesn't matter if it's
exempt or vamp or MAMP or any of these
software that we have out there the fact
is that you just need to have one of
these to have a server running on your
computer
remember when you do need to access PHP
code on your computer or at least inside
the browser you need to have this htdocs
folder where you need to insert the
websites into okay so this is the thing
I'm talking about now inside this
software if I were to go back inside my
xampp main directory you know what we do
actually install it on our computer
you'll notice that we have a folder
called PHP now if you have vamp or
something else then you should also have
a folder called PHP inside the main
directory so what I'm going to do here
is I'm going to open up this path
and you'll notice that we have a PHP
executable inside this folder right here
and this is what we need to link to in
order for this error message to go away
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
copy the path into this specific folder
where the executable is I'm gonna copy
it and then what we need to do is we
need to set the path that is asking for
inside a visual studio code and we do
that by going inside this computer I am
aware that my computer's and dana's I'm
sorry about that I need to change that
but you're going to right-click on this
computer then you're going to go to
properties which is at the bottom here
then you're going to go to advanced
system settings on the side again I
apologize - and Danish once you go in
here you're going to go to advanced and
then you're going to environment
variables I believe it's called it's the
button here at the bottom okay you're
gonna click it and then you're going to
get a bunch of things going on in here
now what we want to do is we need to set
use the defined variables for that
specific user so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to double click on path and
then you guys can see we have a bunch of
things open here and you're going to
click on new at the top right corner
then you're going to paste in the path
that you just copied from inside example
vamp or whatever you might be using and
then you're gonna click OK okay then I'm
gonna click OK again and now if we were
to close down visual studio code open it
back up we should no longer get this
error message that as you can see we
still have our PHP file here this is the
one that's open I can actually open it
again if you want to and just contains
this one - PHP and now you guys will see
we have no more error messages so this
is how we can get rid of it inside
Visual Studio code and again it's sort
of a fun thing because I used to use
Visual Studio code a lot on a previous
computer and then I started getting into
YouTube tutorials where I would teach
using atom or sublime text and the
reason that I didn't start teaching
using Visual Studio code inside my
YouTube channel is because we do run
into errors like like these so it's not
really that user-friendly if you're
completely new at web development okay
so
just go ahead and stick with Adam Oh
sublime text if you think there's too
many errors with this software so this
is at least how I can fix this error
when it comes to appear to be another
tip for you is if you were to go back to
the welcome page to connect to see we
have some tools so when you can actually
install so if you want to get tools for
PHP or Python then you can actually
click geared and it will go ahead and
install tools for those specific
languages so I do recommend you start
doing that once you do x install your
code for the first time okay so hope you
guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys next
time I'd like to say thank you to all
the people support me on patreon engines
the next benefit such as lesson
materials then go ahead and visit the
link to do see on screen here and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
