loops inside the other script and loops
is something I've used quite often
whenever we want to create some kind of
JavaScript application so it's very
important to learn about loops another
one we're gonna talk about today because
there's actually quite a few loops to
choose from is the one called a for loop
now to give you guys an idea about what
a loop actually does basically when we
have a bunch of information or a bunch
of data like the array that I have here
that has a bunch of names inside of it
and I want to spit out all the names
inside the browser we can use a loop in
order to loop through the array and get
all the data and spit them out one by
one so to give you guys an example here
let's actually go and see what we have
inside my document right now have a
paragraph that has an IDs text and I
have my array down here with my names in
it and then I also have a
document.getelementbyid e that spits out
something inside the paragraph up here
now right now I'm actually not spitting
anything inside the browser but we will
be spitting out the data I wants you to
execrate the for loop so in order to
create a for loop let's actually just go
ahead and get started so you guys can
see how it looks like I'm gonna go ahead
and write four parenthesis curly
brackets and this is basically how a for
loop actually looks like now inside the
parentheses we need to insert three
different parameters now two of these
parameters are actually optional we can
actually decide if we want to include
these inside the parentheses or not so
we're just going to go and use all three
of them and then I explain what exactly
we need to use and which ones you can
decide to leave out so inside the for
loop inside the parentheses we need to
write some kind of condition the
condition is something that's going to
keep looping as long as the condition is
actually true inside the code so right
now that's actually going to say we have
a variable called I which is equal to
zero semicolon now what this basically
does is that it says okay when we loop
inside this for loop we have a variable
called I which starts out being zero
when we start the loop then later on as
we do actually loop through this loop
we're going to increase I by one each
time we loop once meaning that I is
gonna change over time
depending on how many times you do
actually loop out this loop then what we
want to say is that
after we declare that is equal to zero
you want to say that well as long as I
is less than some kind of number which
could for example be five in this case
then we want to keep looping now this
number here is very important because if
you don't declare some kind of number we
create something called an infinite loop
so if we don't put a limit on how many
times which is actually loop out this
loop then it's gonna keep looping inside
the browser and essentially it will end
up crashing the browser so it's very
important we don't create these infinite
loops so basically what I've done here
is I've said okay is equal to zero and I
want to keep looping as long as I is
lesser than five so right now we do have
an infinite loop because we don't set
any kind of incrementals inside our for
loop meaning that we want to increase I
by a certain amount each time we loop
through it so the last parameter is
going to be the amount that we want to
increase I each time we're done looping
so right now I can actually go and say
we have I plus plus which is an
incrementer that says that each time
we're done looping is to go ahead and
run this condition here which right now
says that I has to increase by one so at
some point I will become greater than
four which means that this condition
here is no longer going to be true so
what we can do is we can actually go
ahead and do something inside this full
loop so what I'm going to go ahead and
do here just to show you guys is I'm
gonna go and set a variable right on top
of the for loop I'm gonna say we have a
variable called
text which is equal to nothing right now
now inside variable text I'm gonna go to
insert data each time we loop through
the for loop so inside the for loop I'm
gonna go ahead and say we have variable
text and I want to set it equal to
variable text plus some kind of data so
right now could actually set it plus
variable I up here which means that
right now when we loop out variable text
we should be getting 0 1 2 3 4 inside
the browser so if I were to actually go
ahead and say we have variable text
inserted inside my insert statement down
here and actually refresh the browser
you guys can see we get 0 1 2 3 4 so now
I
looping out these numbers now remember
variable I when we start out to group is
zero and it's gonna keep increasing
until we get to the number five so we
should be getting zero one two three
four now what we can also do here using
this array up here is you can actually
go ahead and say we want to get the
length of the array and insert it inside
our parameters down here instead of five
so I can actually go ahead and say we
have names and I want to insert it
instead of five and then I want to get
the length of this array so right now we
should actually be getting five because
we have five pieces of data inside this
array then each time we lose through
this loop down here I want to actually
spit out the names one by one so what we
can do instead of saying text is equal
to text is we can actually go in delete
text here and the plus sign and right
before the equals sign we're gonna go
and say plus meaning that text is going
to be equal to itself plus whatever's
after the equal sign so doing it this
way is the exact same way it's doing it
this way okay so we're just gonna write
it more simple now if you guys asking
why do we need to set text equal to text
you know itself and then plus it by
whatever data is inside the loop it's
because each time we spit out something
inside the paragraph tag down here using
the get element by ID in HTML it deletes
the data we have inside the paragraph
and inserts the new data from the new
loop so we need to say that text should
be equal to itself first before we start
adding the other data okay otherwise
it's just gonna keep the leading itself
and we will only get the last number or
the last data from inside the loop to
actually show you guys this let's
actually go ahead and go back and say
text is equal to text plus I and
actually go ahead and delete text plus
you guys can see the right now we're
going to get four so we need to make
sure it's a text equal to text so I'm
gonna go ahead and say we have text plus
equal to I and in this case I don't want
to say I anymore I want to say names
brackets and then inside the brackets I
want to insert I so right now the first
time we loop through this loop is
concern aimes brackets and then 0 inside
the brackets then
increase by one the next time which
means that now we're gonna get text is
equal to text plus names one inside the
brackets and then it's gonna keep going
until we get lesser than the amount of
data we have inside this array in here
so now if we were to go back inside the
browser you guys can see we now get
Daniel Jane John Sarah and Toby we could
also go ahead and say we have a break
like so include the plus symbol here and
then now if we do actually go ahead and
refresh the browser you guys can see we
get Daniel teen John Sarah Toby on
different lines so this is how we can
loop through data using a for loop
inside JavaScript now I did actually
mentioned that two of these parameters
inside the parentheses are actually
optional so let's actually go and talk
about that right now
we have variable I said equal to zero if
I wanted to I could actually go ahead
and take this copy it delete it and
insert it before the for loop up here
like so and it would actually go ahead
and accept this as a parameter because
we have the variable I up here which is
equal to zero and then we still have the
second parameter in here to says that I
has to be lesser than you know five
because we have five different data
inside this array up here so it's still
going to go ahead and count I even
though the is outside the parentheses of
the for loop so we don't actually need
the first parameter in here but you do
need to include the semicolon first now
the second optional parameter is going
to be the last one here where we say I
plus plus we can actually go ahead and
copy it delete it and insert it at the
end of our for loop down here so right
now will actually increase I by one
right at the end of the for loop so this
is the same as putting it inside the
parentheses if I were to save this
refresh the browser you guys can see we
get the exact same data so we get no
errors or anything like that because it
does the exact same thing the only
parameter that you have to have inside
the for loop is the middle one that says
when do we need to stop looping now in
this episode the for in loop is a loop
that handles objects meaning that if I
were to have an object like they want to
have up here called person I can spit
out all the data from person using a
four in loop so as you guys can see
inside
my screen here right now I have a
paragraph that has an ideas text I have
a optical person I have a variable
called text which is equal to some kind
of string we don't actually have any
kind of data inside text yet and then I
have a for loop down here from the
previous episode which we're going to
change into a foreign loop then down at
the bottom I simply spin out the data
from inside text so what we want to do
here is inside the for loop in order to
create a for in loop I'm going to go and
delete all the data inside the
parentheses now what we're going to
insert instead is going to be first of
all some kind of variable then we're
going to use inside the loop when we do
actually get inside the curly brackets
so right now I'm gonna save that
variable called X and then I'm gonna go
and use the keyword in some kind of
object which is going to be in this case
person because my variable up here my
object up here is called person so right
now what I'm saying is that each time
you reference to X inside this loop it's
going to spit out piece of data from
person so if I go inside the loop here I
can actually go and say we have person
and then inside instead of Pi I can
actually use X so right now we're saying
okay when we loop the first time it's
gonna take a look at person which is up
here and it's gonna go ahead and say
well we have X meaning that we want to
get the first data and spit it out then
we're gonna go to the next line then the
second time we loop we're gonna check is
the more data in here yes there is
there's the second piece of data called
hair color I'm gonna go and spit that
out inside the browser again because we
reference to person and then the
variable X which symbolizes one piece of
data from inside person up here so if we
were to actually go inside my browser
now and refresh the browser you guys can
see if I were to zoom in here is that we
do actually get Daniel brown and blue
which is the three different data that
we have inside person up here today
we're gonna learn about the while loop
inside JavaScript and the while loop is
a personal favorite of mine because I
use it quite often
whenever I need to create any kind of
application so in order to explain the
while loop inside the parentheses of
this while loop that I have inside my
screen here the basic idea is kind of
the same as an if statement inside the
parentheses you write some kind of
condition that has to be true
and if it's true it's gonna go ahead and
run the code inside the curly brackets
now in this case because this is not an
if statement this is a while loop it's
gonna go ahead and spit out loops as
long as the condition inside the
parentheses are actually true so to give
you guys an example here let's actually
go ahead and say that we have variable X
up here and as long as it's lesser than
10 it's gonna go ahead and loop out
whatever's inside the while loop inside
the browser so right now just like in
the previous episodes I went ahead and
took text from up here which right now
is empty and went ahead and said they
wanted to take text and set it equal to
whatever comes after the equal sign so
right now we do actually have something
from the previous episode let's actually
couldn't delete that and instead we're
gonna go and spit out X because right
now X is equal to zero meaning that it's
gonna keep looping out X as long as this
condition appears true now right now we
have something called an infinite loop
and this is not something we want to
have because if a were to refresh the
browser as you guys can see right now my
browser is actually loading and loading
and loading and it's actually not doing
anything so oh snap something went wrong
because my browser ran out of memory so
we want to make sure we don't have this
infinite loop inside our loops so if I
go back inside the code I can go and say
well okay the first time we loop through
the while loop we want to increase X by
a certain amount so on an eighth here
I'm going to go and say we have X and
then I can set it equal to itself plus
one if I wanted to and then it's going
to keep adding 1 to X each time we loop
meaning that at some point X is going to
be greater than 9 and this loop is not
gonna run anymore now we do actually
have an easier way to write this which
is just X plus plus which is an
incrementer so we're just going to do it
this way instead now for were to save
this refresh my browser so you guys can
see that now we get 0 1 2 3 4 all the
way to 9 because right now set the limit
to 10 we could also change this into 20
if you wanted to and now we'll get a lot
more loops going on inside the browser
and this is basically how a while loop
works inside JavaScript now the next
thing I want to show you guys is that I
did actually include and
lay on top of the coat here now what I'm
gonna do
using the while loop is I'm gonna go
ahead and loop out all the data from
inside the array so what I can do here
is I can actually go ahead and say well
first of all we need to get the length
of this array here so right now I have
five pieces of data inside of it but I
need to get that in some kind of number
so what I can do here is I can actually
go ahead and say we want X to be lesser
than the number of data we have inside
the array by saying names dot length
like so and then inside the while loop
we can go ahead and say we want to
insert the names data inside text so the
way we do that is by saying we have
names brackets around the X and then
we're going to go to insert X inside the
bracket so the first time we loop
through this X X is going to be equal to
zero meaning we're gonna get the first
data from inside the array then the
second time we're increasing X by one
meaning that the second time we get Jane
so four words go inside my browser and
refresh it you guys can see we get
Daniel Jane John Sarah and Toby so just
to show you guys we don't have to use
the for loop if we want to get our data
from inside arrays we can actually
modify it and get our data using a while
loop as well and there's a lot of
different possibilities using loops and
a lot of times you'll actually notice
that you can actually choose which loop
you want to use depending on the purpose
of the application today we're going to
continue learning about loops and in
this episode we're gonna talk about the
do-while loop now the do-while loop is
very similar to the while loop we talked
about in the previous episode but the
main difference here is that in the
while loop we first check is to
condition inside the parentheses true
and if it is then we run the block of
code we have inside the curly brackets
now when we have a do-while loop it's
the exact opposite so first we run the
block of code and then we check if the
condition is true and if it is it's
gonna go and continue running the block
of code afterwards so to give you guys
an example here let's actually go and
create a do-while loop on top of this
while loop here so the first thing we're
gonna do is going to write do curly
brackets and then after the curly
brackets we're gonna go ahead and write
while now after the parentheses we're
going to go and end off the code we
semicolon so now what we're gonna do is
we're gonna go to copy the text we have
down here and insert it inside to do
curly brackets so right now
the first thing that's gonna happen is
that the do is gonna go ahead and run
the block of code and then afterwards
it's gonna check is the condition still
true so right now if we were to insert X
is lesser than 10 and delete what we
have down here like so first of all it's
gonna go and run the block of code and
then it's gonna go and check if X is
lesser than 10 if I go inside the
browser you guys can see it this is from
the while loop where we have from 0 till
9 because X has to be lesser than 10 if
we were to refresh you guys can see we
get the exact same thing again the main
difference here is that in the do-while
loop we run the block code first and
then we increment X and then we check if
the condition is still true so there's a
main difference here depending on what
application you're building personally I
don't actually use to do while loop very
often but just to show a ghast if you
actually have one called
a do-while loop now the do-while loop is
actually the last loop we have inside
JavaScript so in the next episode we're
going to start doing some kind of
exercise using all the loops we've
learned so far inside JavaScript so if
you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys next
