methods inside JavaScript when it comes
to date methods we can use in order to
write a specific date or specific time
inside the browser so we're going to
continue this off the previous episode
we talked about a date constructor which
is basically when we create an object
that has information inside of it such
as properties or functions that we can
use in order to do specific things with
the dates so what I'm going to do today
is I'm going to show you guys how to
write a customized date inside your
website and we're also going to talk
about how to set a custom date inside
your website so as you guys can see
inside my code here I have two
paragraphs one has an IDs test a and one
has an IDs test B so inside test a we're
going to go ahead and show the date
inside the browser
you know customize date and inside test
B we're going to go and set a customized
date so inside my script tags the first
thing we're going to do is want to go
ahead and create a new constructor so we
actually have an object we can use in
order to customize the date we want to
set inside the browser so I'm going to
say we have a variable called get date
now of course you guys can call this
whatever we want it just makes sense to
me to call it get date I'm going to set
it equal to a new date parentheses which
means that we now are creating a new
date object based off this new date
constructor we have here so now that we
have this we can actually go ahead and
customize the date you want inside the
browser using the date methods we have
inside or date objects so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to go ahead and go
down to the next line and we're going to
say okay we want to go into the document
and want to get and elements by ID and
we want to get the one called test a now
inside test a we want to insert some
text so we're going to say inner HTML
and set it equal to whatever we want to
insert so because we want to insert a
specific date that we can customize
because we now have this date object up
here we can actually go ahead and just
write something customized so we can
actually say we have a string called the
date is space
then afterwards you want to add some
JavaScript code and remember each time
we switch from the string to JavaScript
we need to add a plus symbol now after
the plus symbol we're going to go ahead
and say we have a variable called gets
date which we create up here which is
actually a object created from this
constructor here that has information
inside of it such as properties and
methods so these methods we have inside
the date object just what we're going to
play with right now so right after the
get date variable we're going to go
ahead and say okay we have this get date
object you want to go into the object by
writing a punctuation and we want to get
the method called get dates parentheses
because it's a method which is basically
a function inside an object so if you
guys are confused about functions versus
methods a method is technically a
function that's inside an object such as
the one we just created up here because
we have you know an object with
properties and methods inside of it of
functions inside of it so basically
referring to a function inside this
object here called get date now what
this one does is it goes ahead and
writes the date or at least the day of
the month that we have right now inside
the browser
so for were to go ahead and close off
the code here and just go ahead and
refresh the browser you guys can see we
get the date is four which is right now
as I'm making this tutorial the fourth
of January meaning that we get the right
date so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go and say well after the get
date method here I'm going to go ahead
and switch to another string so I'm
going to say plus because of switching
from JavaScript code to string double
quotes forward slash followed after the
string by another piece of JavaScript
code so we can execute and just copy
what we have up here called get date dot
and get date now don't get confused by
these two names being the same this is
the name the variable we created and
this is named a method that exists
inside the JavaScript language so don't
get these two confused by each other so
we're going to go and change get date to
get month and then afterwards we're
going to go ahead and say plus double
quotes
because now we get the day and the month
we want to get the year now so we're
going to just add a space then we're
switching to JavaScript code again we're
just going to copy what we had over here
paste it in and change the last one to
get full year so now we basically just
did is we went ahead and say well the
date is the fourth forward slash of the
month which right now is the first
because it's January space and then the
full year so if we go inside the browser
refresh you guys can see we now get this
date in here so this in sound we can
customize the date and we do actually
have quite a few different ones of these
methods here I'm going to leave a link
in the description so you guys can
actually go in and find a list of these
methods but the next thing we want to
talk about is how to actually set a
specific date let's say I want to say
well inside the browser let's actually
go ahead and say we want to go a month
or maybe a year ahead of time or back in
time we can actually go ahead and set
the current date so we can say well
right now if you were to go in to see
the date it's going to tell us that at
least my case is the 4th of January 2017
I can go in and say well let's change
the you to 2020 so what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to go down a couple
lines I'm going to go ahead and just
copy the constructor we have up here
create a new one I'm going to call set
date after creating this construct and
by the way you don't actually have to
create a new constructor I'm just doing
it so we have a different name variable
because it just makes sense for this
exercise here you could essentially just
use this one up here inside the next
part we're doing here but I'm just going
to go and create a new construct because
why not
so what I'm going to go ahead and do is
I'm going to go ahead and write the same
thing as in the previous part documents
dot get element by ID parentheses and
then we want to get test be dot inner
HTML is equal to something now in this
case I'm actually going to go ahead and
just say we want to set it equal to set
date that we have up here now just to
show you guys if what
do this go inside the browser refresh
you guys can see now get the second part
which is actually the as I told you got
right now is Jenner at the fourth 2017
of these where I am and at 6:00 p.m. so
right now we're getting the current time
so what I'm going to do now is I'm going
to go and set a new time by changing
maybe perhaps the year so I'm going to
say instead of 2017 has actually changed
to 2020 so before we start echoing out
but these up putting the text inside the
browser before that I'm going to go
ahead and change the dates so what I'm
going to do in the next line here in
between the variable and the
document.getelementbyid d is I'm going
to go ahead and write set dates which is
the name of the variable we have up here
dot and then I'm going to go and create
a method that also exists inside the
JavaScript language called sets for Year
parenthesis semicolon and inside the
parentheses I can actually go ahead and
set a new date so I'm going to go ahead
and say 2020 because why not we could do
whatever we want here and now what we
did is we actually changed the year to
be a fixed year called 2020 so if I go
inside the browser you guys will notice
that instead of 2017 we get 2020 now
again we have quite a few of these
function here called set something we
could for example go in and say instead
of set for a year I could set the
seconds so if I were to say set seconds
to 5 so right now we will always be in
the fifth second of each minute so if I
will go in refresh you guys can see that
right now we have 5 seconds as our
counter if i refresh you guys will
notice it keeps staying at the same
second so this is how we can do date
methods inside JavaScript and this is
something that's quite useful if you
want to write specific dates or maybe
want to set a specific time maybe in the
past or you know in the future doesn't
really matter there could be some kind
of purpose for it and I hope this is
something you guys find useful now in
the next episode we're going to start
talking about something called arrays
inside JavaScript which is something we
use quite often when we want to
manipulate data inside
javascript so guys enjoyed i'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
