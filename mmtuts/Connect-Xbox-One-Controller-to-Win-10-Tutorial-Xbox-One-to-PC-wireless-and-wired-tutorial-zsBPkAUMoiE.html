episode we going to talk about how to
connect the Xbox one controller to the
PC so we next play video games with it
now when it comes to connecting a xbox
one controller there's two ways we can
do it either we can use a wired
connection or we can do it wirelessly so
I'm going to talk about how to do both
ways in this episode since some of you
guys are interested in doing it
wirelessly but we're going to start off
by doing it with a wire so if you want
to connect it using a wire at least
Windows 10 we have native support for it
meaning that right now if I were to just
plug in my USB cable that comes with the
controller into my PC and then inside
the controller I can actually get this
working straight away now there's a
couple of conditions though because you
need to make sure you have the latest
updates where we understand operating
system because the feature at least the
native support for Xbox one controllers
is inside a update for Windows 10 so if
you're one of the type of people that
don't update your operating system ever
you're going to have to you know update
the operating system so the way to do
that is by going into your Start menu at
the bottom go into settings go down to
update and security and then inside of
here you can update your system so it's
pretty easy to do so if you have your
system updated you can actually just
plug in the USB cable plug it inside the
controller and get this working and I'm
going to show you guys how to do that or
these you know demonstrated is actually
working but before I do that I need to
mention that people who are not on
Windows 10 that may or may not be a
native support for Xbox one controllers
I'm not sure but if you do not have
native support for it meaning that you
cannot just plug it in and play I have
another solution for you okay so just
for now focusing on Windows 10 let's
actually go and plug this in and see if
it's working ok so disconnected the USB
cable inside my PC I'm just going to go
ahead and connect it inside my
controller like so as you guys can see
it's actually lighting up so we do
actually have a connection going and if
I were to start up any kind of game
inside let's say steam I'm going to go
ahead and pop up dogs those three just
to see that it's actually working I'm
just going to load it up here in window
mode
okay so just buffed up the game as you
guys can see how
my screen here if I were to take my Xbox
one controller and start moving around
my you know analog sticks or something
as you guys can see it's actually
working I can actually you know do stuff
inside the game which means that I do
have a connection going to the game now
just to show you guys if you're not on
Windows 10 I'm just going to go ahead
and close down the game here I there we
go if I were to go inside steam and go
inside steam store we have a application
called controller companion which is
actually a application meant directly
for Xbox controllers you know whether
being xbox 360 or xbox one so if you
have problems connecting it directly
inside the operating system you can go
ahead and buy this from Steam which
right now it's actually on sale 33
percent off which is quite good
it's very positive meaning that a lot of
people do actually think this is working
so it's not just my vote it's other
people's world as well I do actually
have this what you call this software so
I know that it's working so if you're
not on Windows 10 Emmit and it's not
working you can go ahead and try this
out to see if it works
so now that we just talked about
connecting and using a cable let's
actually talk about connecting it
wirelessly because Wireless is slightly
different than just plugging in a cable
and then it works if you want to use a
wirelessly you're going to need to buy
something called a Bluetooth adapter and
yes I know a lot of people just turned
off this video because it said bye but
you will in fact need to buy something
called a Bluetooth adapter which is
something that Microsoft did actually
make for the Xbox one controller mean
that you can get one of these plug it
into a PC using a USB cable and then it
will in fact work with your controller
directly as soon as you plug it in and
it will install the drivers necessary to
get this working automatically when you
plug it in and I will leave a download
link in the description for you guys to
actually get one of these if you're
interested so you will need to buy an
adapter in order to get this working
I've seen people online you know giving
out different tutorials and how to do
this without the adapter using the you
know incorporated Bluetooth connection
inside the computer and I cannot get it
working what people say you need to do
if you guys are in
that is go down inside Start menu go
into settings go to devices and then go
to Bluetooth and then click on the
Bluetooth connection inside the
controller right here right next to the
cable which will in fact what according
to the internet when you hold it in make
a beep a bit faster like so and then it
should pop up as you guys can see it's
right now trying to connect my computer
is trying to connect to something and
nothing nothing is going on so now that
I got that out of the way let's actually
go and try and connect it using the
adapter that you can actually buy for
the controller I'm going to go to try
and plug it in and I'm going to show you
guys that it does actually work like I
said it should install the drivers
automatically so you just plug it in and
then you can actually you know just
connect using the round button there it
should say so inside the instructions
did you get with it up there I'm just
going to go in to show you guys that it
does actually work okay so now inside
the game and as you guys can see I do
not have my controller connected yet
now when you guys connect the controller
to the adapt that it should be a small
light in here that lights up and it's
actually connected as you guys can see
right now there's no connection to it if
I were to go ahead and click the Xbox
logo up in the middle of my controller
you guys will actually notice that once
you start blinking after a while we
should actually get a connection there
we go there's a small light on the
adapter now if you guys do not get the
controller connected to the adapter
you're going to need to click the small
button that's right there on the side of
the adapter at the same time as you
connect to the controller by clicking
the controller connection button up here
so if you click those in the same time
you guys should be able to connect these
two devices so now that I connected it
to my bluetooth adapter do notice
there's no connection using a wire I can
move around inside the game without
having a wired connection so this is how
we can get this working so before we end
up this video does one more thing I want
to mention in case you guys can't get
this working which is that if you did
not get the drivers installed when you
plug this in you can actually do it
manually inside your your browser so if
I do actual
go out from the game like so just close
it down now I'm going to go and leave a
link in the description where you guys
can actually find the link that we're
going to go into right here which is
where you can actually download the
drivers for the controller manually so
if you guys didn't actually get the
driver installed when you plugged it in
you guys can go and download from in
here do bear in mind that we need to
focus on the middle ones the ones that
doesn't have DFU ops out of it the top
one is going to be 64-bit download and
the bottom one is going to be 32-bit so
depending on which operating system
you're on you're gonna have to download
one or another so this is how we can get
a connection to our computer either with
the wire or wirelessly so hope you guys
enjoy it I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
