select stuff inside your database and
this is also going to be very relevant
when you do actually get to the PHP part
inside your code where you need to
select stuff from the database using PHP
code so what we're going to do here is
we're going to make sure we have our
database selected our PHP lessons and
we're going to go back up to the SQL
code part now in here we can actually
write all kinds of SQL code that
interacts with the database including
selecting specific things from our
database now if I go ahead and start
writing some code here called selects
and then we could actually select maybe
subjects from and then we need to tell
it which kind of table we want to select
something from so we're gonna say posts
if I go ahead and run this now we're
actually gonna select all subjects from
our posts table meaning that if I run
this you guys can see we get subject
this is the subject and we do actually
only have one subject or like one piece
of data inside our table called posts if
I show you guys which means that we're
only gonna get one thing when we do
actually you know select something from
this table now we can also go ahead and
write something else using SQL code if I
go back here what we can say selects all
by writing star or multiplication or
whatever you might call it space from
posts so now we're actually selecting
everything from posts so if I say go you
guys can see we get the ID we get the
subject we get the content and we get
the date so selecting different things
from the database might come in handy
when let's say you're inside the PHP
code and you're writing stuff that you
need to do on a website and we have a
user that wants to login into your
website and it goes into topsis username
and his password and then we need to go
in and check if that username and
password exists inside the same row
inside our database now when they do
that we can make a select statement that
goes in and checks if this is actually
true you know if the username is
then we also need to make sure it has
this password you know and match them
inside the database so this is the way
we're gonna select stuff from the
database now just to show you guys a
couple of more if you go into the SQL
code again and I want to say select all
from Post where and then we can actually
go ahead and say ID is equal to and then
I'm gonna say single quotes one so now
I'm gonna go ahead and select everything
from post but only wear ID is equal to
one now right now like I said we do only
have one piece of data in here so right
now ID is of course gonna be equal to
one which means that when we do actually
you know actually go up and run this
piece of code we will of course get this
line of code which we have inside our
post table but as you guys can see does
actually highlight with a small yellow
orange line that IDs in fact equal to
one where we did actually go into
selected from so we can actually go
ahead and add these sort of things now
just to show you guys one more if you go
back again about SQL code we can say
select all from posts where ID is equal
to one and and we connected right n or
we can write or in order to give
something out so now if the ID is equal
to one and subject is in fact equal to
the sector set equal to there we go this
is a subjects if that is correct let me
just go double check this is the subject
of course that makes sense this is the
subject so now I should in fact spit out
the same row if actually gotten copy
this just so I can paste it in later you
can see we get the same row again but
now it's actually taking for both of
these and checking if they're actually
true now if I go back again and write in
the code again
and I changed the text inside my subject
let's say I made a spelling error and
instead of s we get F so diff is the
subject now it's actually going to tell
me that there was zero results because
we did not have any we're subject was
equal to this and ID was equal to this
so if I go back again paces in again we
can actually write v again and instead
of ends we can write or so now checking
if ID is equal to one or the sub tech is
equal to this which is it in this case
it's not so if we go ahead and say go
you can see we still get this row so
this is a couple of ways you can access
the leg stuff from the database and
again this is going to be the exact same
way we're going to select stuff from the
database using PHP code so learning SQL
programming is quite useful if you're
learning PHP code because we will
actually be doing a bunch of these
commands now in the next episode we're
going to talk about one called update
where we do actually go in and update
the database in here and after that
we've actually pretty much learned the
ones I think it's necessary for you guys
to learn before we started doing
something with PHP code using these SQL
commands and actually doing stuff with
the database so if you guys enjoyed this
episode and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
