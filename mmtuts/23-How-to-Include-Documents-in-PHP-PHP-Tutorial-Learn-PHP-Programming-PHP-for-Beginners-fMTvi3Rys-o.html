include documents inside our PHP code
because in the last episode we talked
about functions and I did actually
mention that a really good idea with
functions is to put functions related to
a certain thing inside a separate
document for example if you have a
document with user related functions or
a document with calculation related
functions then it's a really good idea
to separate them now we did that to talk
about including documents yet which is
something that is actually pretty
important for you to know because
another thing you can do with including
documents is also putting your
navigation in a separate document so to
give you guys an example let's actually
say we have a website and as you guys
can see I do have some stuff inside my
body tag like a header which has a very
basic navigation in it I didn't style
this at all we also have a section down
here that has a div in it with a
paragraph or like another paragraph at
h1 tag in here this is hi there so if I
do actually go and show you guys the
website you guys can see we have the
header up here with the navigation and
we have the content down here with the
text now let's say I have 10 pages on my
website and I need to change the
navigation at one point let's say I
screw something up inside my navigation
I need to change it now instead of
having to go to every single document
and changing every single page that has
a navigation in it we can actually take
our first part of our website which is
the top here with the navigation and put
it into a separate document now doing it
this way is going to allow for you to go
in and change your navigation in one
document and not on every single
document you have inside your root
folder so this is quite a nice thing to
have because it can be quite annoying to
having to change every single time you
know every single document every single
time so we're just going to go ahead and
talk about how to include documents and
how to create this so inside my front
page here I do actually have some PHP
tags at the very top but what we're
going to go ahead and focus on is what
part of the website do we want to
separate from the main content now in
this example I'm going to choose to take
the header and copy all the way to the
top here copy it and delete it then I'm
going to open up a new document paste
everything in here and now what we need
to do is connect this document to the
top part of our pages which in this case
is our front
so the way we do that is by going in the
nexus saving out document in here I
didn't actually save it yet so I'm going
to save it inside my root folder as
header dot PHP now you can call whatever
you want it's a habit to call it header
the PHP so that's just what I'm going to
call it here now inside our front page
we need to link to the actual document
at the very top here and we do that
using the include tags so I'm going to
go inside my PHP code I'm going to write
include space quotes it can be double
quotes or single quotes doesn't really
matter and semicolon now inside here we
need to write the path to our document
so in this case I didn't put it inside
any folders or anything so it's just
gonna be header dot PHP so now even
though I did actually you know
completely cut out the header from our
document here or like everything from
the header and all the way up to the top
I can actually go inside my browser
refresh and you guys will see we get the
exact same thing but the only difference
here is that I could actually have
another document here I'm just gonna go
ahead and copy this paste it in here and
call this one maybe contacts dot PHP so
now I have another page inside my root
folder called contact and I don't have
to in you know include a navigation
inside this page I can just go into my
header the PHP because I do actually
have the header included into every
single page that I have which is quite
nice when you make websites so doing it
this way as well also allows for you to
like I said in the last episode include
separate PHP document that just has
functions in it if that's what you want
so if you go into our header here which
is the you know the one that has all the
the content that will be on every single
page inside our website we can actually
go to the very top of our documents on
top of our doctype HTML up here and we
can include some PHP tags
now inside these PHP tags are only going
to be documents that we just need to
make sure loads first before we load the
entire website and in this case we can
actually just go ahead and include our
new page we're going to create right now
that might have a function in it called
something so let's just go ahead and
create a function like so put inside
some actual PHP tags like so and we can
save it as maybe let's say let's let's
create a folder in here that's called
functions so we do actually have a
separate folder just for functions if we
can go ahead and call it user -
functions dot PHP as an example so if we
go into my header go to the very top
here I can say okay I need to include a
document in here so I'm going to include
space quotes semicolon then I'm going to
dig into my folder because the data X
create a folder called functions back
slash user - functions dot PHP so now I
actually included my functions inside a
separate document and I have it linked
to the very top of my page meaning that
all the functions I create inside my
user functions is always going to look
first meaning that I don't have to worry
about the function not being loaded
before I actually start using it inside
my pages so this is quite nice to be
able to do and it's something that's
really important to be able to do
because like I said we want to be able
to do this sort of thing to have some
system in order in our websites now
another thing I want to talk about is
also we have something that's called
include once which is something that you
don't necessarily need to do inside a
website but including once mr. you're
simply including a document one time and
one possible way you might want to you
know use this it's inside a loop for
example let's say you need to loop
something out and you only need to
include a function once in the first
loop then you can you know make an
include once and just you know loop it
out once and then it's going to stop
including this document inside your loop
so we won't really be using
would once at all I think but I just
want to put it out there that you know
it's actually out there so it's actually
possible to use it so that's all I
wanted to talk about in this episode
regarding including documents it is
quite a nice thing to know because you
will be using it quite often I can
promise you if you make websites even if
you're not planning on using PHP code in
a website you will probably still be
using you know at least they include
header they have inside these documents
because it's quite a pain having to
change the navigation in multiple places
when you can just you know change it in
one place so hope you guys enjoyed this
episode
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
