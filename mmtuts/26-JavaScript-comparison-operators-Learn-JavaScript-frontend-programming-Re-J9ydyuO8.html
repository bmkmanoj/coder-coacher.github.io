something called comparison operators
inside JavaScript and comparison
operators go mutts together with what we
talked about in the previous episodes
where we talked about conditional
statements meaning that we talked about
if else if and else statements and also
a switch statement so a comparison
operator is basically a way for us to
compare statements inside a conditional
statement
so for where to go inside this if
statement that I have down here that
basically checks if whatever's inside
parentheses is true it's gonna go ahead
and print out something inside the
paragraph tags have up here so right now
if I were to save this you guys can see
if you get nothing because right now the
if statement is not fulfilled so if I
were to go inside the if statement and I
want to check if X is equal to something
I can go ahead and say X is equal to 10
now what I wrote here might seem logical
in the beginning because if we take
regular math if I were to check if X is
equal to 10 then we would actually have
a true statement but because we have one
equal sign here we're basically just
saying that X is equal to 10 up here ok
so right now X is equal to 10 and then
inside the if statement
we're just saying again that X is equal
to 10 but we're not checking if X is
equal to 10 if that makes sense so we
know taxi check if X is equal to 10
we're gonna have to add another equal
sign so what we're doing here is we're
basically checking if X is equal to 10
and it doesn't matter if the data is the
same data type meaning that if I were to
say that this 10 up here was inside a
string then it's still gonna say this is
true if I were to go inside the browser
now you guys can see that we get it
works so if I were to go back here and
say okay but I also want to check if the
data type is the exact same type what I
can do here is I can actually go ahead
and set another equal sign by adding a
third one it also checks if the data
type is the same so if we were to
actually save this go inside my browser
you guys can see you get nothing because
the condition is not true if I were to
go up inside
my ex up here and delete the string
interested equal to10 you guys can see
you now get it works so this is
something we call comparison operators
where we simply compare data with
another piece of data now of course we
just set it equal to you know
we checked if it was equal to a certain
thing but we can also go ahead and check
if it's not equal so if I were to go
ahead and say well we want to check if
it is not equal you know in the typical
case is how we check if it is equal and
we don't care about the data type but if
I want to check if it's not equal to 10
then I'm gonna go ahead and change the
first equal sign to an exclamation mark
so changing this one says it is not
equal to 10 meaning that if I go inside
the browser you guys can see it
disappears because right now 10 is equal
to 10 so this statement here is going to
be false so what I can do is I can
actually go and change this to 5 just to
show you guys and now it's going to be
true which means that we now get it
works now what we can also do is we can
actually go ahead and check if it's not
equal to either the same number but we
can also check if it's not equal to the
same data type so right now when we do
have exclamation mark equal to the way
we would do it if you were to check if
it was equal to the same number or the
same data type is we would actually
write equal equal equal but if you want
to check if it's not equal to the same
number or the same data type we can go
and say exclamation mark instead of the
first equal sign so right now we're
gonna go ahead and go inside the browser
and refresh and as you guys can see it's
gonna say it works because right now 5
is not equal to 10 if I were to change
this one to a 10 we would actually get
nothing because right now because right
now the statement is not gonna be true
because you know 10 is the same data
type as 10 and it's the same number so
if I were to go ahead and change the
data type down here which means that
right now 10 is equal to 10 but it's not
the same data type as you guys can see
we now get it works now the next one
we're going to talk about is how to
check if something is greater than or
equal to or less than an equal
or you know whatever combination might
have with greater than or lesser than so
inside the conditional statement here
I'm just gonna go ahead and go back one
so we have ten which is equal to ten and
I'm gonna go ahead and delete the equal
signs so the first thing we're gonna do
is we're gonna go ahead and check if X
is greater than ten right now
X is not greater than ten which means
that when we go inside the browser is
not gonna write anything if I will go to
back inside the code and say well it's X
greater than or equal to ten then it's
gonna go and spit something out which
right now it is so if I go back inside
here we can also go and check if it's
lesser than by writing a lesser than ten
which right now it's not true of course
so it's gonna disappear and we can go
ahead and say if it's lesser than or
equal to I'm just gonna go back and as
you guys can see we now get it back
again so this is how we do comparison
operators which is something we use very
often with conditional statements so
it's very important that you guys know
about these and learn how to use them so
if you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
