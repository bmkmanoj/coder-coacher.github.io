things we're going to talk about
something called number methods and
we're going to talk about something
called math objects so basically we're
going to do today is we're going to have
a number episode we're going to talk
about what we can do with numbers when
it comes to JavaScript so the first
thing we're going to talk about is
number methods and this is very much the
same as one of the previous episodes we
did where we talked about string methods
so the basic idea here is that we have
some kind of value which is a primitive
value and we're able to perform methods
on it even though it's not an object so
like we have over here we're have
variable X that's equal to some kind of
random number like nine point six five
six we're able to perform some kind of
method on it even though it's not an
object
so because we talked about string
methods before I'm not going to go too
much into details about number methods
but if you guys are interested in you
want to see more types of methods using
this number method I'm going to go out
and provide a link in the description
where you guys can find more of them so
to give you guys at these two examples
here if I were to take this variable X
which is nine point six five six and
perform a method called to fixed like
they want to have here I can actually go
ahead and copy what we have here and
just out put it inside the browser so
you guys can see it it basically goes in
and says how many decimal points do you
want behind your number now right now I
did actually write zero which means that
I want zero decimal points behind X
which right now is nine point six five
six so which zero decimal points is
going to round it up from six five six
till ten so forward to out produce
inside the browser you guys will see it
says ten so always remember that once
you use two fixed it's gonna round it up
to the nearest highest number or the
nearest lowest number had it been point
four something it would have been nine
so what we can do here if you want to is
let's say I'll have a shopping cart
inside a website and I want to show in
dollars how much the person needs to you
know pay you want to buy a product what
I can do is I want to say well we don't
want some kind of long decimal point so
I want to have two decimal points behind
it so they can see how many dollars they
need to pay in order to buy this product
so I can actually go back refresh and
you guys can see because I wrote
instead of zero we now get nine point
six six so the next one we have is one
called value of which basically just
goes in and calculates the value of
whatever we have inside the parentheses
behind it so right now would say one
hundred plus twenty-three we're gonna
get the value of this which is going to
be equal to 123 so were to just go ahead
and really quickly just paste this down
here and save it refresh the browser so
you guys can see if you get 123 so
there's a bunch of different number
methods we can use when it comes to
JavaScript now when it comes to math
objects it's a slightly different
because math objects is when we want to
do some more complicated stuff using
math so let's go ahead and delete what
we have down here inside the output and
instead use the first example here
called math.random now what this one
does is that it goes into the optic
called math that has a bunch of built-in
functions and properties it goes ahead
and takes these numbers or at least
takes this object and spits out a random
number so if I were to paste this in
here you guys will see them get a random
number that's between 0 and 1 so right
now I'm getting 0 point something
something something which is very good
if you want to do something inside your
website that requires you to get a
random number each time you refresh the
browser now another type of method we
have inside this math object is where we
can round up numbers kind of similar to
what we did up here because if I were to
take some kind of number that's actually
going to just copy the method here paste
it down here let's say we have nine
point six and I want to round up this
number it's gonna round it up until 10
so were to refresh you guys can see we
now get 10 so we can do a bunch of stuff
using this math object now a couple more
advanced examples would be let's say I
have a number like 4.4 and I want to
round it up even though it's lower than
5 at least the decimal points lower than
5 which in typical cases would actually
mean we need to round down instead let's
say I want to force it to round it up
instead I can actually go and use math
sealing or seal which goes ahead and
takes this number and
even though the number might be 4.1 is
still gonna round it up till five so
four should refresh the browser so you
guys can see we get five if it were to
take math.floor we would actually go
ahead and round it down instead let's
say we have 4.9 I can actually go ahead
and round it down so you might be asking
what does math differ from using methods
up here that we used before well when it
comes to this math object we can do more
advanced stuff like what I just showed
you guys all we can do something like
the power of or the square root of a
certain number or we can even get out
the value of pi if you wanted to so we
were to take PI down here spit it out
you guys can see we get the PI number at
least for a certain amount of decimal
points we can also get other values and
this is actually what we call the
property because the PI down here is you
guys may notice did not have any
parentheses behind it and that's because
there's a property inside the math
object which is already a fixed number
so we have a bunch of these properties
and methods that we can use inside this
math object in order to do more
complicated stuff using math so if you
guys get to a point where you can
actually find any number methods that
will actually do what you wanted to I
haven't actually personally used these
in a lot of cases but if you need to do
something advanced like this then you
can go ahead and look into math objects
because this will actually have some
more complicated stuff you guys may need
to use at some point if you want to use
this sort of math so if you guys enjoyed
this episode and I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
