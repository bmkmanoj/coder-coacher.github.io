add more pages inside a website because
as you may have noticed so far we've
been using our front page snow to learn
HTML and CSS and when you typically look
at a website online with more than just
one page so I thought it'd be a good
idea to learn how to have more pages
this early on so the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to above my
root folder and inside my root folder
guys consider we have a file called
indexed at HTML and a file called styled
at CSS now when it comes to including
files inside your root folder you know
inside the actual project folder your
front page has to be called index dot
something which we talked about in one
of the first episodes in this course
here and the reason for that is that
when we do X need to upload the website
online we need to upload the website to
a server and the server always looks for
a file called index dot something
because it's going to look at this file
as the front page of your website
however when it comes to sub pages
inside your website we can call these
whatever you like of course there's a
piece of guidelines to what should
actually be using inside the page name
such as if it were to go inside my text
editor here and create a new page and
save it inside my root folder I probably
shouldn't be using any capitalized
letters also should not be using any
sort of weird symbols or anything that
might mess up the file name so it's a
good idea to stick with non capitalized
letters and something simple that
indicates what the file is actually used
for such as if it were to create a
contact page how to call it contact dot
HTML for example and then I can say save
and now I guys can see we have a contact
page now when we want to set up this new
page we need to actually create some
content inside of it just like with it
inside the front page so I'm going to
copy what we have inside the front page
so far and just paste it inside our
contact
document now the important thing here is
like inside the front page you need to
have certain tags that has to be inside
any kind of new document and if you're
in doubt about which tags we need to
have inside this document when we create
a new document go ahead and look at the
episode at the beginning of this course
where we talk about what you need to
have inside and pay to any creator for
the first time so I just covered in the
content from our front page
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
change just a few things because inside
my front page I had a h1 tag that said
welcome to my portfolio so I'm going to
pretend for a second that this is a
portfolio website and inside the page I
also have a paragraph that says welcome
to my personal portfolio feel free to
look around the website so inside the
contact page you can then change the
text or says contact page or something a
bit more Creator than this and then go
down to the paragraph tag and again if
the text goes outside your screen go up
to you click toggle soft wrap and you
guys can see we can see all the text
inside the active screen here now I'm
going to change the text here so it says
name :
Daniel Nielsen gonna copy to the line of
code paste it on Neath it and include
something like I don't know telephone
number or email we can say e-mail could
be use at mmm toots dot net if I wanted
to and we can keep adding details we
wanted to but again this is just to
demonstrate that that we have a page
with different content and if it were to
actually access this inside the browser
we can then see another page so if we
were to go back inside the website you
guys can see that this is the text out
of my front page if we were to refresh
just to reset everything it still looks
the same because we didn't change
anything inside the front page but if
you take a look at the URL up here in
the top you guys can see that we have
our root folder and inside a root folder
the current document that were viewing
is the one called index dot HTML if it
were to change this to contact dot HTML
you guys can see we now have a new page
with different content inside of it so
what we just did here is we went ahead
and created a new page but we haven't
created a link for it yet which is
something that we're gonna look into in
the next episode so can actually access
this page without having to you know go
up inside the URL and serve something
different than what we just had here so
I can actually go back to the index page
by writing index dot HTML and as you
guys can see we now have the front page
again so what I plan to do in this
course here
is in some episodes from now I would
like to start making a portfolio website
together with you guys with the skills
to be learning these lessons here so
we're gonna take everything that we
learned and then slowly we're gonna
build up something that actually looks
like a real website because right now as
you guys can see this is just basic text
inside you know a white background is
not really a website so we're gonna go
and build up a portfolio from scratch
using this coaster we learned these
lessons and in the next episode like I
said we're gonna start by learning how
to create links inside the website so so
I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
