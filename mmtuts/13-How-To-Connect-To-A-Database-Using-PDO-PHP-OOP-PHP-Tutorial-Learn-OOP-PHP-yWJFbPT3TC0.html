database using PDO instead of using
MySQL I which is active I've been using
up tuned on these lessons here so from
today on in the future we will be using
a PDA connection in order to do our
course here so as you can see in front
of me here I have a basic index page and
inside the index page I have nothing
special except for a link to my class
that has my database connection inside
of it and inside my DPH class I still
have a masculine connection going
because I want to show you guys the
differences between MySQL I and PDO by
just simply using the same class that
we've been using in all the previous
lessons here now the first thing I'm
going to do inside the db8 class is I'm
going to add a fifth property inside the
class and this is not something we have
to do we could actually do PDO
connections without this fifth parameter
but it allowed for us to create some
additional functionality later on if you
wish to so I'm just gonna go and include
it since it doesn't hurt anything so I'm
gonna go and include another private
property that I'm gonna call chars set
which is the character set the views
inside the database and inside the
connect method here I'm going to just
copy paste from the previous one and
just change it to char set and change
the value to utf-8 MB for which is just
a default character set so not only have
this we can actually go ahead and change
this MySQL I connection that I have down
here into a PDO connection do notice
that we have one two three four
parameters in SAP mask uli and when it
comes to PDO we only have three now the
difference here is that inside the first
parameter we're going to include a bunch
of parameters if that makes sense so let
me go answer guys what I mean I'm gonna
go and delete it here and what I'm going
to do is I'm going to create a variable
I'm gonna call DSN which stands for data
source name which is going to be the
first parameter so we're going to
include inside our PDO connection so I'm
going to set it equal to a string and
inside the string we need to add a
couple of different pieces of
information now the default ones that
everyone adds is first of all
we need to tell what kind of driver
we're using then we need to add what
host we're using and then the database
name now the last one that we're going
to add is also the character set which
we included as our fifth parameter now
the most typical database driver that
most people are using is called MySQL so
if you're using PHP myadmin inside your
localhost then you're probably using
mask ul as well now if you're not using
localhost of PHP myadmin or that sort of
thing and you're a little bit confused
about what your driver is there is a way
we can actually get the information from
our database and know what kind of drive
we'll be using so for were to go inside
my index page and just simply write a
print our function print underscore our
parentheses curly brackets and inside
the print R I'm going to say we want to
run a static method in PDO called PDO
colon colon gets available drivers
parentheses and if we were to go back
inside my website you guys can see that
we get some information regarding the
drivers inside our database now mine
does actually say MySQL so if yours does
as well then you just need to follow
exactly what I'm doing in this episode
if it says something else with you then
I recommend googling what you need to
change depending on what kind of driver
you have okay so I'm gonna go back
inside my code I'm just gonna go ahead
and delete the printer function and I'm
gonna go inside my database connection
again so the first property inside mat
the Ascend variable is going to be my
SQL colon and then we need to add what
kind of host we're using so I'm gonna
say host I'm gonna set it equal to and
then it needs to be equal to our host
which right now would be the server name
which we set up here now I'm using a
local host if you're connected to an
online server then you need to get the
server name for that server so because
I'm using local host and we just simply
go inside my code here and then after
the equal sign we just simply add in the
server names I can say you want to add
this server name
and then I want to add another string
because we need to add another parameter
to it or another property so I'm going
to say semicolon and then we're going to
add the DB name which is the database
name I'm going to set it equal to do the
same thing here and to simply refer to
what we have up here so we're going to
say we have DB name which is equal to my
case test DB because that's what I named
my database name so I'm just gonna paste
it in here and then the last parameter
we're going to add is going to be the
char set so we're going to say char is
set it's going to be equal to and then
we're just simply going to add the
charset from up here as well like so so
now we have everything we need to have
inside the DSM so what I'm going to do
now so I'm going to go down to next line
and I'm going to create a variable
called PDO
which is going to be the actual PDO
connection so I'm going to say we have a
new PDO
in capitalized letters parentheses and
then inside the parentheses we just need
to add three different parameters the
first one is going to be the dsm images
created from up here so I'm going to
paste that in comma then the second one
is going to be the username for a
database which we have up here just
gonna paste that in the third one and
the last one is going to be the password
so I'm going to just copy paste that one
in as well like so now the last thing we
need to do so we can actually connect to
the database using other classes is we
need to actually return this PDO
variable so I'm going to say want to
return variable PDO like so now there's
one more thing I want to do here because
what if we get an error message while
connecting to the database well what we
can do is we can actually go ahead and
set up a try catch exception which means
that we can try to run a piece of code
and if it gives an error message then
it's going to catch the error and throw
an exception so what I can do is I can
go ahead and say we want to create a
try-catch function and again I used to
shortcut inside my text editor by
writing try and then tap and then I got
to try catch exception if you don't have
shortcuts inside your text editor
you can just go ahead and write the
whole thing out now what I want to do
here is I would like to include our code
that we just wrote copy it delete it and
then insert it inside our tribe function
up here after we did that we then need
to set up some attributes inside the PDO
connection in order to get a proper
error message inside the caps function
so what I'm going to do is right before
I return the PDO variable I'm going to
go ahead and say we want to take the PDO
variable and run a set attribute method
and then I'm going to go and add a
couple of different parameters inside
the method here the first one is going
to be PDO colon colon which again is a
static then I'm going to set this one to
attr which stands for attribute
underscore er our mo de which stands for
error mode then I want to set the arrow
mode afterwards by saying PDO colon
colon which is a second static and I
want to set errm au de which is error
mode underscore exception like so so
what this does now is if we get some
kind of error message then inside the
cat's function it's going to take the
error and we can then show it inside the
website so what I can do is I can
actually go and make a couple of changes
to the default code I got from my
shortcut and instead I'm going to say
want to get a PDO exception which we're
going to set to variable e which stands
for exception then inside the catch
function I'm going to echo the error
message by saying connection failed
colon space then I can go to add the
exception afterwards so we're going to
include the variable E which is the
error message then we're going to point
to a method called get message which
will now get the actual error message if
there is actually an error so for words
I actually tried this and go inside my
index page and simply create an object
and try to actually run I'll connect a
method
then I can say we want to create an
object I want to set it equal to new DBH
then underneath iya we're going to
actually run the connect method so we're
going to say we have variable objects
and point two connects parentheses
semi-colon so now if I go inside my
browser refresh you can see we get some
kind of error message and that's because
right now my method is actually
protected so we need to change it
because this is not the error message we
want to see so I'm going to change it
from protected to public so we can
actually run it inside the browser and
now if we were to actually run it you
can see we get no error messages and
that's because everything is like it
should be if it were to actually change
some of the properties inside my
connection to let's say test DB - which
is not a database that I have save it
refresh the browser you can see we get a
connection failed and then the error
message so right now it says unknown
database test DB 2 which is what we want
to get so if I were to go back inside my
code and go ahead and just set it back
to test a B so everything is actually
working so this is how we can set up a
PDF connection and in the next episode
we're going to talk about how we can
actually spit out data from the database
using PDO
so if you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys
