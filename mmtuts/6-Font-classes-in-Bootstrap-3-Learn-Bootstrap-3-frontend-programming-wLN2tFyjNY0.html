bootstrap goes into your website and
changes the default styling of your text
inside your browser because the browser
does actually have a default styling
when it comes to text and when you add
pushed up to your website actually goes
inside the code and overrides the
default styling of the browser and
answer its own default styling so today
we're going to talk about some different
stylings we have inside text elements
when it comes to bootstrap and we're
also going to talk about some different
tags that we have inside bootstrap that
allow for you to change the text into
some cool effects so what we're going to
do is as you guys can see you type my
website here I deleted all the content
we have inside our container fluid and I
went ahead and added three different
header tags and a paragraph tag now what
I want you guys to notice is that inside
our website over here the header tags
actually changed his size because the
bootstrap coding inside the importer
style to get up here changes the text
inside your browser so what we can do is
we can actually go ahead and add a
couple tags that would actually make
cool effects inside the text inside the
website so if I were to take for example
this head up here inside the header one
tag I could actually go to add some more
text so I could actually go ahead and
say this is header one and I can
actually go inside my code here and I
can add a tag called
small so I'm gonna go to open up the tag
here I'm gonna write small and I'm gonna
close off the tag right after hit a 1
like so and if i refresh the browser you
guys will notice that we get a different
type of styling for the h1 tag because
we add the small element around it so
this is just to show you guys that when
we have header tags inside the bootstrap
code we can also add some kind of
subtitle to our headers even though it's
still an h1 tag by adding the small tag
around the text so when it comes to
these cool effects we can add inside a
website I'm just going to delete the
header tags here and just have the
paragraph tag now what we can actually
do here is we can add some of these tags
around text to make some really really
cool effects using bootstrap so the
first thing we're gonna talk about is
the one called mark so if we were to
take this text down here that says this
is some text and I want to highlight
this text
I can use to mark tag inside bootstrap
gonna go ahead and put it around the
text here refresh and as you guys can
see if I were to zoom in a bit is that
we get a highlighted text at the end
here so we can actually highlight the
text inside bootstrap now if I copy this
paragraph and add another paragraph
below it refresh you guys can see we
also get inside bootstrap and default
margin underneath the text so there's
access some spacing between the text
which is also something that bootstrap
does now if I want to change the marked
tag into something else let's say I want
to do something called an abbreviation
so I'm gonna say abbr which is when we
use some kind of radiation inside the
website so let's actually go ahead and
just move this up to text and the user
doesn't know what text actually means so
what I'm gonna do inside the
abbreviation tag is I'm gonna add a
title and say text means this is a
paragraph you know just to not confuse
the reader I'm gonna save this refresh
the browser and as you guys can see we
now get this little dotted line
underneath text if I were to actually
hover my mouse cursor on top of it it
now says inside a small text window this
means this is a paragraph so we can
actually you know tell the use of what
we actually mean when we abbreviate a
specific word let's say I used lull
inside the website which I would never
do myself but let's say I use long and
then we have a old person visiting our
website they don't mean what lol means
they can be told inside this hover what
exactly low means now if I were to go
back inside my website here and just go
ahead and copy the paragraph tag one
more time we can actually go ahead and
add something called a blockquote
now what this means is that let's say I
want to quote a specific person what I
can do is I can go and say hi there and
then say that this is some text is a
quote by some specific person I can
actually go ahead and change the mark
into a block quote like so and I can go
ahead and show you guys what this one
does it actually asked this little quote
styling to it so it actually looks like
a quote it
we can actually change the styling if we
want to inside the CSS 5 we have up here
if I need to so we don't have to stick
with the default sizes inside bootstrap
just FYI and again I can actually use
fYI to add an abbreviation to it because
it means for information get it but
let's say we have block quote and I want
to actually add who actually set this
inside the block quote I can go inside
the block code tags add a footer tag and
then say we have a person called Daniel
Nielsen which is me as you guys will see
it now changes to styling so we get this
little you know by Daniel Nelson what we
do actually not need to add the dash
here I just noticed like so so now we
know actually who quoted this text now
some of you guys might be looking at
this code here you know with all the
marked tags and previous integrant block
quote and say well Daniel you said we
were gonna do something really cool
inside bootstrap when it comes to text
and this right here is kind of normal
it's not really you know awesome but
it's it's kind of ok so let's actually
jump into some of the more cool features
we have inside bootstrap when it comes
to using tags so let's say I have a
website that teaches on how to do coding
for example HTML tutorials and I want to
add code to my website well right now
instead of having to default styling all
the code I could actually go ahead and
use bootstrap default code tag in order
to show that this right here the text
I'm typing is code so what I can do
inside my body tag here is I can
actually go ahead and add a paragraph
tag and say this is some code or some
text showing how to code colon next line
and then what I can do down here is I
can actually add the code tags we have
inside bootstrap and then I can actually
go ahead and just copy some of the stuff
we have up here I'm just gonna go and
copy the the first paragraph we did
inside with the highlighted text and
paste it inside my code tag so what
would you actually get inside the
browser is you know and actually tag
that shows specific code so you guys can
actually see we get this default styling
of pink inside the browser which
indicates that right now we're actually
coding of course we could
chance of styling of this if you wanted
to by just you know inspecting the
element and see what Simon's changed
inside of here you know to change the
colors but this is how we change the
text to show that this is actually code
now the next cool one we're gonna learn
is how to access show keyboard shortcuts
inside a website so what I'm gonna go
ahead and do is I'm gonna go ahead and
add another paragraph tag and I'm gonna
go and write something like let's say
there's actually a tech website weren't
gonna show how to I don't know do
shortcuts inside Photoshop I can go
ahead and say well to create a new layer
comma click ctrl + Shift + n to create
the layer like so so we'll connect to
doing here so we can actually wrap this
specific coat down here that actually
shows what you need to click on inside
something called a keyboard description
so let's actually go add that tag we're
gonna say KBD
and then wrap it around the text like so
and go inside the browser and as you
guys can see we do actually get this
keyboard shortcut looking code if were
to zoom out that tells the use of what
they need to click on on the keyboard in
order to get a specific shortcut which
is kind of nice now I'm gonna go to Sir
guys two more things we can do with text
in here there's actually a bunch more
you guys can do and I'm gonna go and
leave a link for you guys if you want to
see how to do more stuff inside text
elements using bootstrap but for now
let's actually go and do two more so
inside my code here I'm just gonna go in
and copy the top paragraph tag with the
marked tag paste it down and just delete
the marked tag like so and inside this
text C I'm gonna go ahead and wrap it
inside a paragraph that has a specific
class so inside the paragraph I'm gonna
say we have a class and this one is
going to be called text - something and
we do actually have quite a few of these
so I can actually go ahead and say well
let's say we have a success text like so
what do you guys will notice is that
inside the browser we get a green text
so this one is some kind of success like
you did something you just signed up a
new user inside your website and now it
shows the green text it says the user
has been signed up what we can also do
let's say that the user actually typed
something wrong when he tried to sign
himself up is we can go ahead and say we
have a warning inside the text instead
of having a success text as you guys can
see now change to some kind of ominous
gray is red color that actually has some
kind of warning you know you need to
need to do something before we can
actually continue signing yourself up we
can also do someone called danger which
of course is going to be red which means
that whoa okay definitely did something
wrong here and you try to sign yourself
up so we have a bunch of these different
style links in here we can use for text
in order to change the color into some
kind of you know something that
indicates something specific like danger
or success or if you want to mute
something you know make the the text
less noticeable we have a bunch of these
and again the link in the description
will tell you guys some more you know
colors that you can actually add to the
text now the last thing we're going to
learn here is something that actually
changes the background color of your
text so I'm gonna go ahead and create
another paragraph and instead of saying
text danger I'm gonna go and delete it
and I'm gonna go out and say we have
something called a BG dash which means
that we have some kind of background
change you know in some kind of color so
what I can also do here is something
similar to the previous one I can go and
say we have a success meaning that right
now if I were to refresh the browser you
guys can see we have some kind of
success message with a green background
now this might be even better if you
want to have some kind of you know oh
you just signed up a new user and and
have a message writing inside the
browser because this one is quite more
noticeable we can also do something very
similar to the previous one like saying
we have a warning again if someone types
something in they forgot to write
something then we get this brown is you
know bright color we can also do the
team to color like the text above it
which means we now get this red color so
this is how we can actually change some
of the stylings or some of the effects
we have on text inside bootstrap hope
you guys find this useful and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
