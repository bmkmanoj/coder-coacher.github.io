talk about how to insert a image into a
website and for this example we're going
to be using a logo which we're going to
insert into the header that we created
in the last episode now in case you guys
want to you can actually go ahead and
download the images I'm using for this
episode in the description of this video
and then you can just kind of really
quickly follow along on this episode now
if you guys want to of course you can
also just go ahead and download
something from the internet or create
your own logo that you can use in this
episode now what we're going to talk
about is a couple of different ways we
can insert an image I'm also going to
talk a little bit about the format's of
images you can use when it comes to
uploading to a website now before we do
any of that we do actually need to
include the images inside our root
folder so as you guys can see I do
actually have my root folder okay over
on the left side here and I do have a
random image folder open from my
computer somewhere over here that
includes the two images we're gonna be
using for this episode
now one thing you should notice is that
one format the one I have on the left
here is a PNG image which means that I
have well I did actually make a logo
that had some background that needed to
be transparent so I just went ahead and
created a PNG image since that of course
can make some of the background
transparent now we can also use JPEGs if
you want you can also use diffs you can
use all kinds of image formats you can
even use a format called SVG now you
might be asking what is SVG well when it
comes to inserting images to a website
you can actually insert both pixelated
images and you can insert vector images
meaning that when you zoom in on your
screen or inside the browser your image
is never going to get pixelated now some
benefits are having an SVG image like I
said is that it's going to be much more
high resolution some non benefits is
going to be that some browsers like
Internet Explorer or Microsoft edge it's
not completely optimized for these kind
of images you might have some issues if
you have created for example layer masks
inside the image it's going to show up
in a little funky way inside these
browsers now you can still see the
images but they're just going to look
weird so what we're going to go ahead
and do is we're just going to go ahead
and work
with the PNG image first and then just
to chemistry as an example at the very
end I'm going to show you guys the SVG
image now if you have a question about
how you can actually create SVG images
some programs such as illustrator and
Photoshop well not photoshop I'm not
quite sure about that one but I know
illustrator can actually save SVG images
so what we're going to do now is we're
going to go ahead and go into our code
inside our HTML file our index dot HTML
and inside the header right before the
nav we're going to go ahead and include
a image tag now the way you do this is
by opening up the code writing IMG space
and then you're going to say SRC for
source equal to and then put quotation
marks and then inside here need to write
the path to the image now we didn't
actually include the image into our root
folder here so we should probably do
that straight away inside the root
folder I'm just going to go ahead and
create a folder called IMG for image you
don't have to call it IMG you can call
whatever you want I'm just calling it
IMG because that's what I'm used to I'm
going to go ed and copy the two images
we have over here inside a little
example and then I'm just going to go
ahead and paste it in here inside my
image folder now that we have it inside
our root folder and again just to remind
you guys do not use images from your
computer on your website because when
you need to upload the website it's
going to be a pain in the butt to try
and go inside the computer and find all
the images put it inside your root
folder and then change all the linking
to these images because it needs to work
like that when you do actually upload
the website so just make it a habit to
only use materials inside the root
folder on your website so inside our
image source tag we're just going to go
and close off the tag at the very end
here now some people who argue that you
need to include a backslash at the
reigneth of the tag you don't have to an
html5 anymore they actually eliminated
that and you don't need to close off the
image by writing backslash mg or
anything so you just need to include the
image and then the source equal to and
then you can write the path so we wrote
it inside out like we pasted it inside a
folder called IMG
backslash and then name the file and the
one we have is one called logo dot PNG
now another thing you can add inside the
image tag as a parameter could for
example be alt now you might be asking
what is alt well when it comes to google
searching and you want people to be able
to find your images right now Google
does not know what is on this image we
know that it's the logo and we know it's
a logo for mmm toots at least for my
example it is but Google does not know
that so what we can do inside the alt
tag is include a couple of keywords that
will define what is on this image so I
can actually write mmm toots space and
then I can add another word such as logo
so now we have some names for this image
so at least you know Google knows what's
on this image so what we're going to do
now is we're going to save it then I'm
going to go ahead and open up our
website inside the browser inside chrome
preferably and then we can actually see
that we have a image up here in the very
top corner I'm just going to zoom in for
you guys so you can see now as i zoom in
you guys will notice it's very pixelated
and that is because like I said we're
using a pixelated image if I were to
include a SVG image instead if I go back
into the code and I just linked to my
SVG image instead instead of writing dot
PNG I'm going to write dot SVG save it
and then I'm going to refresh my image
and as you guys can see wow it suddenly
got very big and it's very crisp as you
guys may notice so using SVG images is
going to make it into a vector like I
said and it's going to always remain
crisp now like I said we're not
confusing SVG images in this example
because not all browsers are quite happy
with it yet and we want to make sure
that even people using Internet Explorer
is going to be able to see the images so
we're going to go ahead and use PNG save
it and refresh now when it comes to
displaying the logo you guys may notice
that the header is not quite tall enough
to contain the logo so we're going to go
ahead and increase the size of the image
now it's very important that we know
exactly how big the image is I know for
a fact that my image is 92 times 102 in
width and length width and height if not
just the other way around we can always
right-click if you're in doubt you can
go in and you can right-click your image
go to properties and then go to details
and then you can see that it is in fact
92 width 100 - height which is what I
said so what we can do now is we can go
ahead and go into our style sheet and
then when we start the header which is a
bit further down from our research sheet
down here we can go ahead and give it a
height as a little bit larger than our
logo was in height which was 1 and 2 so
we're going to make this one 140 pixels
high going to refresh my browser and as
you guys can see we now have some extra
space now what I want to do here is I
want to go ahead and take my logo and I
want to move it from the top a little
bit down because I want it to be just so
there's a little bit of space at the
bottom so I'm going to go back into my
style sheet and then I'm going to go
down below our head of styling I'm going
to go ahead and say well we have the
header and inside the header by clicking
space we have a image so every time you
add a space after a little piece of tag
inside a style sheet you say ok inside
this tag we have another tag or another
class or another tip which we'll get to
at some point but just know that you can
write space to say we have something
inside something else so inside a header
we have an image that I would like to
style this way and then we can actually
start styling it so we're going to say
well we wanted to have a margin - top
colon and we would like it to move from
the top with about a let's say 40 pixels
which is probably too much but let's
just go out and check there we go so
it's a little bit too much so we're just
going to go ahead and add a slightly
less maybe 30 check it again and that
seems to be a lot better so I'm going to
go and keep that for now
now another problem we have is we do
actually need to take this image and put
it a little bit further to the center of
the screen because right now if I were
to view this at 100% which is this right
here
you guys can see the images all the way
to the left now that could be fine if
you wanted a website that starts all the
way from the left side of the screen but
if you wanted one of those websites that
has been centered we're going to have to
talk about something called a wrapper
which I could get to in the next episode
now for now we're just going to go ahead
and stick with the images so this is how
we insert one kind of image and like I
said this is you know this is actually
the typical way to do it but sometimes
you would like to include some kind of
hover effects we didn't really talk
about hover effects but just to kind of
demonstrate why the other way of
inserting images could potentially be
better I'm going to go ahead and include
a little example for you guys so inside
our style sheet or inside our HTML sheet
in facts we're going to go ahead and
include another image below but as you
guys may notice I'm not actually going
to create an image I'm actually going to
create a div which we talked about a
couple of times before I did actually
mention it but essentially a div is a
empty objects so right now I didn't
define the width or the height or a
background color or it's just simply you
know like an object like a box so I'm
going to go ahead and create a div and
then I need to get this div and name
well we don't actually have to but it's
just much easier to do it and then I can
sort of explain on the way why we're
giving it a name sometimes however you
do have an object on your website dad
there will be multiple of let's say a
div for example you're possibly going to
have a lot of dibs on your website
now each div if you want to style them
individually you're going to have to
give them a unique name so we can go
into our stylesheet and then say we want
to style this div which has this name so
we only style a specific tip so we
target this tip specifically now by
doing that we can write either a class 1
ID and the difference between these two
is that an ID name can there can only be
one of them a class name we can have
multiple off meaning that I can actually
go ahead and write a class here equal to
quotation marks
I'm going to go ahead and call this one
test not trust test so now we gave this
did a name called test and I can
actually go ahead and copy this one and
then say oh well I need to have two
images next to each other so I'm just
going to go ahead and paste it right
below here and this will actually be
okay now if I were to change this and
make an ID as test I would not be able
to well we would be able to but it's not
ideal so I have two dibs because a ID is
very unique and there should only be one
so for this example we're just going to
go ahead and use an ID because we're
just gonna be using one for this example
so what we're going to do now is we're
going to go into our style teeth and
then we need to start styling this Dib
so inside I've started below our header
image I'm going to go and say well we do
have a ID by writing the hashtag symbol
we have an ID called test and I'm going
to go ahead and style it with this code
I'm going to go and give it a width as
92 pixels because that's what I know my
image is and width and I'm going to give
it a height as 102 pixels now I'm going
to give this tip a background color I'm
not a background color a background
image because like I said we do actually
need to include some kind of image in
here because otherwise it's just gonna
be a regular div so in order to create
an image we're going to have to give
this dip a background image so I'm going
to say background - IMG : now okay so
it's not IMG it's actually a match there
we go so inside here we need to write
the path to the image so we're going to
write URL and then we're going to write
the what do you call it the parentheses
and inside the parentheses we're going
to write the path so it's inside a
folder called
IMT backslash logo dot PNG save it so
now if I go ahead and go refresh my
website you'll notice what we do
actually have anything yet and there's
thing we did wrong in here okay so I did
actually find out why we couldn't see
the image inside the browser which is
because our stance you just actually
inside a folder called CSS and we need
to tell it in the path to the image that
we do actually need to go back a fold
into the main part of the root folder
and then inside a folder called image
and then find a logo so inside the path
to our image inside the stylesheet
we're going to go ahead and write dot
dot backslash and then image back slash
logo dot PNG because the dot dot
backslash means that we're going back up
folder and then we're going inside the
image folder which we have one folder
back so saving it this way and then
refreshing the browser you'll notice
that we do actually have two images now
we have the first one which we can
actually hold and drag the image around
because we can see it's an image then we
have the second one which is a div box
of the background with the image and we
can't actually drag and hold and move it
around which is because it is not a real
image now you might be asking what are
some of the pros and cons of doing it
these two ways well first of all like I
did actually mention with the alt tags
if you want to be able to search on
Google and find the image and use maybe
some search words for Co optimisation
which you guys might not know what is
but essentially Co optimisation helps
your website become more visible and
doing it the regular way the regular way
as an image like this it's going to make
it easier for Google to find your image
now doing it as a div with the
background as the image is not as Co
friendly as a regular image but you can
in fact do some really cool hover
effects let's say for example I want to
change the background of the image from
orange to maybe blue when I hover on it
we cannot really do that with a image so
instead we do actually need to do it as
a div where we go in and say okay well
when we hover on it I want to change it
inside the stylesheet to have you know
to switch it out with a different kind
of image so that's the two different
ways of doing it and that's essentially
how we can insert images into our
website now for this example we're not
going to be using a hover effect so
we're just going to keep the regular
image we have up here and I'm just gonna
go ahead and delete the div inside our
first of all inside our stylesheet by
the way we did actually talk about
create
a starling for a ID which is by using
hashtag if you had a class instead of an
ID the way to do it was to write a
punctuation mark because then you refer
to a class instead of a div called test
so just in case you guys need to know
that so I'm just going to delete this
again save it I'm going to go into my
index file I'm just going to go ahead
and leave my dip box again so we only
have the image file and then save it so
now our website should look something
like this so having it like this we're
going to go ahead and off this episode
and then in the next episode like I said
we're going to talk about how to Center
the image so not censor it but move it
so that it's aligned more closer to the
center so it's not all the way to the
left side Tobie guys enjoyed and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
