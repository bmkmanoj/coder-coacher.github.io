something called multi-dimensional
arrays inside PHP we're going to talk
about what they are how to create them
and how to output something inside the
browser using multi-dimensional arrays
so the basic idea behind a
multi-dimensional array is that we can
have an array like they want to have
here that has three pieces of data
inside of it
daniel john and jane and instead of
having data inside this array we can
have another array inside of it so if we
were to go ahead and delete daniel for
example now we have two pieces of data
and instead of the first data i'm just
going to go and create another array so
right now as you guys can see we're
starting to get something that might get
a bit confusing because we might be
thinking why do we need to have an array
inside an array one example could be if
you pull out data from a database that
you have online and you want to insert
it inside an array now because data from
a database when you pull it out already
gets pulled out as an array when you
insert it into an empty array like the
one we have here you get a raise inside
arrays so we need to learn how to
actually you know use them and what they
are so right now inside this first array
that I have inside my array I'm gonna go
ahead and put a couple of numbers so I'm
gonna say we have one two and we have
three just so we have some numbers now
just to make this more nice to look at
I'm just gonna go and move this down so
we have everything on separate line so
I'm just gonna go and move it down like
this and like this and this is close it
off there so now it looks a bit more
clean to look at so what we can actually
go out and do now is we could actually
go ahead and test this step for where to
go down on the next line here and do
something called print R which is a
function map inside PHP in order to spit
out arrays inside the browser and see
how they look like it's gonna go and say
print underscore R parentheses I'm gonna
put in my variable data inside the
parentheses if I go back to the website
refresh you guys can see we get some
numbers now what we have here is the
first array inside our document which is
variable data inside this array inside
space number one which is zero because
we start from zero we have another array
which is
right here and it says we have one two
and three inside this array then
afterwards from the first array we have
our second number or our second data
which is John and then we have the third
data which is Jane so as you guys can
see we now have an array inside spot
number one inside the original array now
I might be asking how do we then spit it
out because let's say I have this
multi-dimensional array and I want to
spit out some data if I go ahead and
comment out our print our go down to the
next line and say I want to echo verbal
data and I want to echo out the first
piece of data which is the array we have
in here and I want to spit out for
example one from this array now have
word too if I were to spit out data
number two I could to go ahead and say I
have you know spot number 1 which is 0 1
which is John if I were to echo that you
would get John but what if I want to get
the data from an array inside an array
what we can do here is we can say okay
we have spot number 1 or C row inside
the original array up here which is a
separate array and if I want to go into
that array we need to add a second
brackets afterwards and from here we can
put in the number of the data we want to
pull out from it so if we want to pull
out number 1 we say this your spot went
first to raise this array and then the
series part from that array is 1 so the
refresh the browser you guys can see we
get 1 again we change this to 1 then we
get two very basic and so that's
basically what a multi-dimensional array
is and in the future you will be using
it when we get into stuff like of to
grow into PHP programming which is a
different type of programming which is a
different type of programming using PHP
code where you structure everything a
bit different then you will need to know
how to do multi-dimensional arrays which
is why it's important that you
understand you can actually put a raise
inside a raise like we did here now if
you guys are interested in how to exit
loop out data from a multi-dimensional
array like we did here in the previous
episode where we talked about how to get
data from a database and insert it into
an array I talked about how to insert or
how to loop out the data from Walter
arrey using the for each loop we have
inside PHP so if you guys want to see
how to do that you can go ahead and
watch the last episode or we did that at
the end so we guys enjoy it now see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
