take a look at how to do a green screen
effect just like this one
so in this episode we're gonna take a
look at three different types of keying
effects we're going to take a look at
premier first of all which has a keying
effect called ultra key effect we're
gonna take a look at After Effects which
has something called key light effects
then last but not least we're gonna take
a look at something called primate keyer
which is also a add-on for After Effects
now before we get started the actual
post-production stuff I really quickly
want to talk to you guys about how to
actually set up a green-screen area it
is very important if you guys set up a
green-screen correctly because if you do
not have the proper lighting if you do
not have the proper areas to do it in it
can be a pain in the ass to try to do
you know a green screen effect in
post-production afterwards so first of
all let's go ahead and talk about
different kinds of green screens out
there the one I have behind me here is a
collapsible green screen we can actually
take it and unhooking the actors show
you guys as you guys can see I can
actually squeeze it and it will actually
be foldable and everything so I can
actually bring it to my clients which is
a really nice detail now what I have
behind me here is really good on the go
if you want to bring it to someone that
you need to interview now if you want
something bigger than that then you
could always invest in a seat a big
green screen sheet that you can actually
hang up now the problem with the seat
though is that you need to make sure
there's no folds in it
the reason this kind of green screen
behind me is really good is because it
stretches out by itself and eliminates
all the folds if you have a fall in a
green screen it's gonna be a terrible
thing to get rid of in post-production a
last solutions are actually getting a
green screen could be if you have a
little studio somewhere it could
actually paint the walls the same chroma
key green color that I have behind me
here and use that as a green screen
that's more of a temporary solution we
actually have a location for it so now
we talked about different green screens
you can use let's go ahead and talk
about the lighting because the lighting
is very important now don't
underestimate the lighting because it is
super crucial that you have really good
lighting when you do a green screen
because although wise it's gonna screw
it all up so as you guys can see I do
have a lot of different lights in here
and the way I positioned them I set it
all up is not really the correct way to
do it but I'm gonna talk to you guys
about how to do it so I have a lot of
different lights in here and the ones
that I use actually LED lights now you
can use all kinds of lighting for green
screens you see a lot of professional
green screen errs that have these huge
lights set up
that you can use now for more of a
cheaper way to do it now I bought these
at something like Office Depot for very
little amount of money maybe I like $20
and I got a couple of these and these
are just regular LED lights that I found
very useful in order to do LED lighting
on a green screen I have a have a couple
of different kinds this one is more
powerful which I do use a lot for my
green screen I also have a portable one
which I can actually adjust the levels
on if I needed to this one is more for
my face if I use it for my face but
basically lighting is very important I
almost have spot lights up here you you
really need to make sure that you light
up the green screen so it's completely
green you do not want to have dark spots
on it because dark spots are so hard to
remove in post-production and if you do
have dark spots you can sometimes get
dark areas around yourself which compete
with the test remove also especially the
around clothing
now one thing you can do to get rid of
the halo effect that you sometimes get
mean to do clean screens is actually to
have a light points it's standing behind
your back pointing forward to sort of
get this glow around too that will
eliminate some of the green color that
you experience when you do green
screening when it comes to the talent
which is the person standing in front of
the camera talking you also need to make
sure you light them up correctly because
when you have the green screen lit up if
you do not light up the talent correctly
you can sometimes get spill on the
talent which is not good when you do a
green screen I'm standing fairly close
to my green screen here was not which is
not good if I stood further away from it
it would actually give me a better
effect but if I do get closer to it it's
gonna start spilling off on my clothes
especially if I have bright clothes on
and then you can see the green stuff on
your clothing when you have to remove it
in post-production which is not good so
the further away you stand the better it
is so now we talked about how to do the
green screen setup let's go ahead and
talk about how to do the post-production
stuff okay so now we can get started the
post-production process I figured we
would start out with premiere and inside
premiere I did actually import my video
clip which is the same clip you guys
just saw a few seconds ago now before we
start adding any keying effect in you
which by the way we're going to be using
the ultra key effects we need to make
sure that the clip looks like it needs
before we add the key effects the cool
thing about premiere and After Effects
is that when you add on effects let's
say I add the keying effect first and
then I add let's say color correction if
I color corrected after I add the key
effect I will only call it correct
whatever is left after key out the
background now if I add the color effect
first and then add on the key effects
I'm gonna color correct the green
background also and then the keying
effect can actually be influenced by the
effect I added before it which we
actually do need to do so we're going to
go into effects here and the first
effect I'm gonna call out is levels now
the reason we want to do this is because
as you guys can see there's a couple of
dark spots on my background here that I
do need to remove so I'm gonna add a
level onto my clip and I'm gonna take
the red green blue white input the level
I'm gonna sort of make it a bit brighter
just slightly like so and as you guys
can see it sort of fades out the the
dark spots just as you know slightly
which we need to do after we've done
this I'm gonna go ahead and add
brightness and contrast to my clip
another effect we have down here and
after I've done that I want to set the
contrast a little bit up just slightly
to about let's say 10 and as you guys
can see that the green becomes more
obvious now we're gonna add on the key
effects and we're gonna search down in
the search bar for ultra key which is
down here in the video effects put it
onto the clip take the drop tool and
click on the darkest place you can find
inside the the green color like this one
and as you guys can see we can actually
tell the distant gray areas behind here
now if I take a clip or a photo and put
it behind here let's just go ahead and
take the same background I used before
and put underneath the clip like so you
know you can actually see that you know
it's not really apparent but if the clip
that I had in the background was moving
and all that
you would actually be able to see these
gray areas here so we need to get rid of
all that now we also need to get rid of
all this outside stuff I'm actually
gonna go to my effects panel and say
crop I just sort of crop it down a
little bit I'm gonna say left's I'm
gonna crop it till here I'm gonna say
right and crop it till roughly here okay
so now we're gonna do is we're going to
go up to the alter key effect that we
added on there inside our effects
controls panel here and we're going to
go down into where this matter
correction a generation sorry we're
gonna go down to the highlight we're
gonna tone it down now depending on how
good you want the key you probably don't
want to tone it down too much the more
you tone it down the more the the
background that the great stuff
disappears but you also want to be
careful you don't over adjust some of
these settings now what you're gonna do
is well it actually looks quite good now
and I think I did a pretty good green
screen when I did record it if you play
this I'll actually show you guys it's
got to play from here now I'm just gonna
set it to half over here otherwise this
might lag a lot when you preview this so
if we play this you can actually see you
have some Keene going on here now it's
not perfect and Premiere is not the
optimal program for for doing this sort
of you know Keene as you guys can see
there's a little bit of flickering it's
okay for what it needs to do if you're
just gonna do something rough we can
actually play around a little bit more
if you go down to let's see Matt cleanup
you can actually have just a contrast
also which will also as you guys can see
there's actually some you can actually
got here to the output here and say
Alpha Channel and we can see some of the
spots that might show up if i zoom in
here you can actually see we have some
gray areas on top of my t-shirt if I go
to contrast and boof it up buff it up a
little bit you can actually see it
disappears but my hair will also take a
little bit of damage by doing that so if
I just take it up just like not all the
way but enough for it to look pretty
good I'm gonna go back to composite
output and then we can sort of preview
again so as you guys can see there's a
bit of spill here the hair looks okay I
would say and the outline look okay
under their arms you can see we sort of
have this weird water effect going on
under the armpits and the forearm which
is not good but you can always play on
these settings a little bit and see what
they do and actually adjust these this
is going to pause the video here just go
back a little bit there we go and then
tell your mom to Settings let's soften
the edges a little bit it will take care
of some of that rough roughness so if
you play it again here you can see it
actually looks okay so Premier's not the
best program for this I would say it's
my personal opinion but I do use this in
some my videos on most of my videos on
my channel because it is very quick to
do so let's go ahead and take a look at
after fix now okay so now why is that
after face now I figured we would try to
play with the key light effect that you
have inside After Effects so the way to
get key light onto the clip well first
of all like I said you to adjust the
levels themselves so we're going to go
ahead and go over here to the effects
panel and we're going to search for
levels but go ahead and drag my levels
onto the footage and then we can sort of
adjust it here so I'm just gonna adjust
it a little bit now the levels inside
premiere there's a little difference you
have that white output down here go
ahead and move that white out for don't
move the the bar up here like I did in
the first time we're gonna brighten it
up a little bit we're gonna go over here
we're gonna say brightness and contrast
onto the clip I'm gonna give it around
10 just like before
like so and now we're gonna go ahead and
key up the background so I'm gonna go
ahead and search for key light just down
here key light 1.2 and over here you can
actually see we have the key light
effect here so what I'm gonna do here
first is I'm going to go ahead and
select a screen color so I'm gonna go
ahead and choose to the drop tool choose
the darkest area and then fade it out so
as you guys can see you spit out now the
nice thing about After Effects is that
you can actually go up and very
specifically cut out you don't have to
crop it can actually cut out the
background
the mask so while we have this clip down
here selected I'm gonna go ahead and go
out and select the pen tool click get it
then I'm sort of gonna draw around the
edge of my green screen like so just
throw around here and we'll be connected
at the end here you'll see that it fades
out everything else which is really nice
so as you guys can see there's a little
bit of grainy stuff around the edges in
Orland that's because we did not adjust
a layer yet so what I'm gonna go ahead
and do here is I'm gonna go ahead and
shift over to source alpha oddly no I'm
not source alpha it is called combined
mattes and then you can actually see all
the gray areas and such and those things
so we're gonna go down to the screen
balance and we're gonna just adjust a
little video as you guys can see we're
sort of correcting it I guess I need to
put it all the way down as I can see it
also played the screen game just gonna
black out the degree areas like so all
right and we don't want it too much
because we actually erasing some of the
white stuff on the top of us which is
not good go down to screen mats and go
ahead and take a look at the stuff we
can actually start shipping with the
white it's just too white a little bit
so we'll say okay we got it up there and
I think it looks good now if you have
more black spots you can actually chip
with the clip with the white the black
and I just that there's a lot of
different settings in here you can
actually soften the screen and all that
so this garden and check off the view to
source instead sorry not the source see
if I can find it again here correct no
final result of course that is the one
we need to use I'm sorry sort of
confused as I apologize for them so we
can I have preview this really quickly
there's a little bit of stuff going on
on top of e which we will need to
correct and this little spill going on
which is also something that it's gonna
be kind of hard to learn with this
feature I'm not quite sure how we can do
that because I have not worked with off
to fix key light too much let's see what
does that have as softeners we can
actually soften the edges here just like
we did before
I don't think we should do that screen
softness screen the passive white I'm
not quite sure with all these settings
to so I'm just gonna go ahead and leave
this one for now and then we're gonna go
into the next one okay so now I'm going
to try the one called private keyer and
just for the record I kept my levels
effect onto the clip and I kept my
brightness and contrast onto the clip
and I kept my masking the only thing I
did was I deleted the key light effect
so what we're gonna do here is I'm gonna
go ahead and go over to my effects panel
I can actually already see my prime
attea down here by the way primate Kia
costs $500 if you do have it that's
awesome it probably wouldn't be watching
this part of the tutorial if you did not
have it already or if you're just
interested in seeing if it is if it's
worth buying I can tell you it is so
I'll drag it onto the clip here and then
we get this fine looking little panel
down here it's a little bit bigger the
key light and it's a lot more
customizable so what I'm gonna do here
is I'm gonna go ahead and say select
background down here it says selection
and I'm going to start dragging and just
holding down my mouse button start
dragging my cursor around on the the
green screen both in the light and the
dark areas like so and let go and it you
know sort of face it out here
so what we're gonna do now is when we go
into the view and we're gonna say mat
view you can see there's still some
still some spill going on around here so
we're gonna go ahead and delete all that
next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna
go down to selection I'm gonna say clean
background so we're gonna drag around
what we still see the spill and just
hold out my mouse cursor and as you can
see you actually slowly getting rid of
all the spill there we go make sure we
have everything gone from here the nice
thing about this is that it is very easy
to use and is very customizable so now
we have this done we can actually zoom
in a bit and you can see we still have
some great areas in the white shirt so
I'm gonna go ahead and choose clean
foreground start dragging on here just
like with the background there you go
now there's a lot of fine tweaking and
fine-tuning this thing here so I'll just
go ahead and show you guys how to use it
and then I'll sort of fast forward till
I get a result that I'm satisfied with
so the next thing we can do here is if
we go back to the composition view as
you can see oh
Devin's we have a lot of green stuff
going around there to see how do we
remove all that well if you go down to
the fine-tune and zoom in on your talent
you can see we have the the green edges
around the talent if I take the
fine-tuned tool and just select a few
pixels and it will actually come up with
this little warning here that says use
wireframe interaction see preferences to
about updating display welcome sampling
but just can say okay I'm selected again
just to make sure we have it selected
and then we're gonna go down to the
spill selection down here we're just
going to tweak it a little bit as you
can see oh it's going away
and we still got some green colors so
we'll just tweak it a little more
actually we do not tweak that one there
we go we're gonna go up to the face and
sort of tweak that one too
because we have some green color here we
do not want it's just it there you go
alright and we do not have any more
green spill now what we're gonna do now
is we're gonna go down into our effects
our primate key effects we're gonna go
down and select the one called spill
killer
now what this one does is that it
actually at some in some cases you still
have a little bit of green spilling onto
the talent and he's standing from the
green screen which you can't always 100%
avoid but what he can do down here is
going to color mode and say okay ran out
said as blue which means that it thinks
that we have a blue background so what
I'm gonna go ahead and do here say okay
but I'm actually using a green screen
not a blue screen and then it can
actually adjust some of the disc
coloring on your talent now I can
actually see up here by going out of the
math view that we do still have some
background we need to remove there I'm
just gonna go back up and select a clean
background just sort of track it on
there
goes away like so and I think we have
some more here just kind of so want to
take it away there here we go it's all
about fine-tuning and adjusting gear so
let's go ahead and play this and see how
it looks like I'm just gonna take it
down slightly there you go
let's see how all this looks like so I'm
gonna play it here so as you guys can
see we do have a pretty nice effect
going on so far now a little thing here
I want to mention is that if you go down
here sometimes you get these bright
edges or black edges that is not good to
look at we're gonna remove that so let's
go ahead and go down into it's called
correction and go down to where it says
D focus mattes so we're gonna go ahead
and zoom out a little bit so we can see
what we're gonna do we're gonna take a
look at the arm down here I'm gonna take
a look at the office trouble to help
here and as I start diffusing it can
exit face away to edge here you can sort
of take it away slightly we don't want
to do too much so I would say no more
than around four just to get slight
discoloring up now I did actually have a
light pointing at me which is why I do
have a little bit of white on my arm
down there so what is the not much we
can do about that but if you play this
you can see we did a pretty good damn
job even the hair and everything looks
really good yeah so as you guys concede
this is how you do the prymatt key
effects it is very nice to work with I
must say it's amazing if you do need to
do something that looks professional not
something quick it does take a little
longer to do this but it is worth it so
I hope you guys enjoy so tutorial here
and disappear view of different ways to
do green screening and I hope to see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
