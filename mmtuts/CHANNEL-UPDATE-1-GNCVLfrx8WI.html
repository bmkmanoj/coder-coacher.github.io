video just to kind of share with you
guys what exactly has been going on my
channel lately because as you guys may
notice there's been a lot of changes to
my channel like my logo has changed by
Ben has teens my content has changed
everything is changed to my youtube
channel and I thought it does have some
kinda explanation to why why exactly the
reason was behind all this so some you
guys may know i'm actually studying
right now I'm finished finishing off my
bachelor in a couple of months now and
because of that right now I'm i have my
exam project i have my internship I have
two jobs on the side which doesn't leave
me a lot of time to do you know one
video a day so the way I see it when you
have a youtube gaming channel it's
something that you know you need to
upload at a regular basis and since I
don't have the time to do it I don't
have the energy i don't have the
overview / when nice to do this and I
just decided that I gave it a shot and
it's not really worth it so what's going
to be happening my channel now as you
guys may see is that I changed my
youtube channel name to something more
tutorial like there's a lot of tutorials
uploaded lately which is because it's
part of my bachelor project so
essentially what i'm doing here is i'm
working on a website which i did
actually work on before you guys may
remember way back i was actually talking
about it and i did like to have a
prototype up and running and I just
completely trashed that website and now
I'm building a new website which is
gonna have a lot more cool stuff on it
hopefully and it's going to be a you
know tutorial website where people can
come in the psychic community going on
there's a lot of cool stuff so these
videos i'm uploading to the channel is
going to be part of this website so
that's the basic reason behind you know
me changing all the content for my
youtube channel so hope i didn't really
disappoint anyone by the sudden change i
know a lot of the people who came in the
beginning did actually come because of
the tutorial so i hope you guys can give
something out of this and i did actually
decide to redo all my videos meaning
that right now I used to have videos on
HTML CSS WordPress that kind of thing
but I decided to completely redo it with
a new a microphone and just with an
updated state of mind in my head
so everything has been redone which is
why it's taking a bit of time to upload
the stuff and currently i have finished
HTML CSS and i'm working on wordpress
and after that we're going to work on
PHP and so on and so on and so on so in
case you guys instead I did actually
hire well I didn't hire I did actually
recruit a couple of people to help me
with the website and they will get paid
you know you're in a bit of money on
YouTube and I did actually say that if
they uploaded content to this website on
building they would get the money that
they earned on the videos they made so
I've been recruiting a bit of people to
get some more interesting content you
know both in video production and web
development and that kind of thing so
hopefully just be a lot of cool stuff
also Photoshop and graphic broke up from
that kind of thing so it seems like a
cool idea and it's something I'm working
on like I said from a bachelor project
so it should hopefully be something a
lot better than the past website i tried
to to get up and running which didn't
really have a lot of 60 because i didn't
really get much further after i uploaded
it i didn't really work on it anymore
and this thing should hopefully be
something that is gonna be a real thing
and it's gonna well hopefully i know
it's gonna be a real thing cuz i've been
working really hard on this website for
many months now and it should be
something good so that's the basic
reason for everything is you know having
been changed to my channel i just wanted
to kind of let you guys know why exactly
this has happened i will be doing a
little bit of game playing if some of
you guys are still interested in that on
my twitch channel because I don't see
why I should upload gameplay videos to
this channel anymore since I changed it
so if you guys are interested in follow
me on twitter instead I will have a link
for it in the description I won't be
doing twits as often as other people do
because like I said I'm very low on time
but when I do actually get the time I
might do something at some point so one
more thing and this is kind of a side
thing my channel has actually been under
attack from a YouTube dislike bot which
goes in and just dislikes my not all my
videos but only the latest one since I
think
half a week ago a week ago maybe so this
dislike but goes in and immediately
gives me three dislikes as soon as I
make a new video and I uploaded so and
it's even before you know like like it's
seconds after uploading videos i get
dislikes without that many people
actually having been watching it so i
decided to to what you call like
discontinued liking on my videos at
least the latest ones since i see the
liking system as a thing to help people
you know look at this video to see if
it's good or not it's not because I'm
emotionally hurt by dislikes but I just
think that it kind of defeats its
purpose if there's a robot out there
like a bot going in and just dislike in
my videos because it gives a fake sense
of it this video is good or not it does
you know a robot liking my videos it's
the same thing like in my head you know
it's not real so people get a false
sense of if this is a good video not so
I don't see a reason to have liking and
disliking on videos you guys can still
give them both likes and dislikes but I
don't want to show it for people if they
don't get the real sense of the you know
the quality of the content so I decided
to dislike like discontinued my my
liking system on the latest videos and I
hope that's okay I hope it's not
something that's bothering anyone I
don't think it will be but you can still
dislike and like my videos you just
can't see what other people have done on
my videos so I hope that's okay and
that's essentially all I have to say in
this episode I don't think I had
anything else to include other than why
it ain't everything so okay guys have a
nice day and continue to follow along my
tutorials if you guys are interested in
that kind of thing and I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
