gonna learn how to show how to password
inside an input field using jQuery and
this is something we already did inside
the JavaScript cause only a few days ago
but because at people request how to do
it in jQuery we're gonna go and do that
in this episode here now one thing I
want to mention is that in most typical
cases when it comes to creating
something using javascript and something
using jQuery if you have a huge script
then you will be able to tell a
noticeable difference between using
JavaScript versus jQuery now because
this episode here is going to be a very
short tutorial with very little code
you're not really gonna see that big of
a difference between JavaScript and
jQuery but again we're just gonna do it
so you guys can see the differences here
so as you can see in front of me here I
do have a index page and I have a minute
J's page and what I want to do here is I
would like to take this form that I have
inside my index page and I would like to
do something when I click a button
inside the form which is going to be to
show or hide a password input type so as
you can see inside the form we have an
input which is going to be the user name
then we have a password input which is
set to password as a type and this is
the one we want to change when we do
actually click a button inside this
login form now I did also went ahead and
gave it an ID said to you password login
because when we do actually need to
create the JavaScript or jQuery code we
need to be able to grab this input and
do something to it so the idea is going
to be sort of we can actually grab it
and do something okay now as you can
also see I did also include a button
down here which is not the login submit'
button this is just a regular button
that has a onclick event inside of it as
an attribute meaning that I want me to
actually click this button we tell it to
go ahead and run this function here
inside JavaScript or jQuery another
thing I want to point out here is that I
also set a type to button because if you
don't do this then it's gonna see this
button as they submit button when we
click it so in order to avoid that we're
just gonna go ahead and set the time to
button now as you can see I also
included some text called
view and hide inside the button so we
can actually see that we can actually
view and hide the password when we click
this button ok now I did also
neglect to you know include an action
and a method and a submit type inside
the button down here but that's because
we don't really need to actually do
something of this form again if you had
a real example on a real website with a
locking system then of course you need
to include these things but because we
just want to focus on showing and hiding
a password inside a form we're just
gonna go and focus on these two inputs
here okay now inside my main two TS file
actually let's actually go ahead and
take our JavaScript file and put at the
bottom to make sure we load it after we
loaded the entire website and we're also
gonna go ahead and go in and get the
jQuery code because I'm done that yet so
I'm just going to really quickly go into
jquery.com and I'm gonna go ahead and
get the CDN version of it because it is
fast and easier copy it and paste it in
right on top of my JavaScript code
because you need to load it before the
JavaScript code okay so now we're ready
to go inside I'll main the TS file and
as you can see I do already have some
code in here this is acts what we did
inside the JavaScript tutorial and I
would like to spend just a few seconds
explain what exact is going on here so
the first thing I'm going to notice is
that we do actually have a variable at
the top here called let's now let and
Const in case you didn't know are two
new types of variables to have inside -
Yahveh scripts and if you're a little
bit confused about what exactly the
differences are then I do have a
tutorial in cyber JavaScript course and
I'm gonna go to link to in the
description if you want to know the
specific differences so you can go and
check that video out if you want to for
now just know that this is a variable
that has a name as you login password
and I set it as a boolean type to false
meaning that right now we're actually
checking if we already click the button
or not because we need to actually know
if we already have the password showing
inside the input or if it's set to
password type meaning that we see these
dots instead of the actual password so
were to go inside this little test
version here you can actually see when I
type something we get these dots instead
of the actual text okay inside our
JavaScript code you can also see if you
have a function which is to wonder we
activate once we do actually click this
button inside the index page and inside
this function what we have
is a another variable called Let's Get
Password view which simply goes in and
grabs the input using the idea that I
applied to it inside the index space and
again this is JavaScript code so in
jQuery would actually change this so
instead of staying document dot get
element by ID or Cori selector which is
the new version of selecting elements
inside JavaScript we can go out and say
we want to say dollar sign and then
change the name inside the string to ID
you password lock in which again is
shorter but not really that different
from the JavaScript version now who were
to go down inside the next part here
where we have an if else if statement
the basic just goes in and checks if we
did already click the button or not
using this variable created at the top
here so if we load this function and we
haven't clicked the button yet
meaning that view login password is
going to be equal to false then it's
gonna go ahead and grab the input which
we set up here and set a new attribute
for it
cause something else now in j.crew we do
actually have something else we can use
instead of set attribute so what I could
say is a TTR which stands for attribute
and then do the exact same thing inside
the parameters of the parentheses here
so basically what we're doing here is we
say we have a attribute called type and
I want to change it into a text type
okay so we're taking an attribute and
changing the value of the attribute then
afterwards we want to set the view login
password to true meaning that the next
time I run this function is not gonna
run this if statement because your login
password is going to be equal to true
instead it's gonna jump down to the next
one and load this one instead and this
one says if you lock in password is
equal to true then do this down here
instead and then we just go ahead and
change it back to a password type using
again the attribute function we have
inside T occurs we're gonna say attr
type and set it to password and again we
want two teams to view look and password
boolean to false so the next time it's
gonna run the if statement instead so if
we were to go ahead and save this and
then go ahead and run what we did here
inside the browser so you guys can
actually see when I start typing
something right now it's hidden if I
click the view hide password you can see
we can now see it a password and again
if I click in it's going to change it
back to hidden so this is how it can cry
a show/hide password input using jQuery
hope you guys enjoyed
I'll see you guys next time I'd like to
say thank you to all the people
supporting me on patreon against the
necks of benefits such as lesson
materials then go ahead miss it the link
to to see on screen here and I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
