inside JavaScript and a race is
something I've used quite often inside
JavaScript and it's a way for us to save
a lot of data inside one variable inside
of JavaScript code so an example here
would be let's say we have a hundred
names and we need to print them out
inside the website now instead I'm
creating a hundred variables you know
assigning a name to each one of them you
can create something called an array now
the good thing about an array is that it
takes up a lot less code and there's a
lot less complicated to create you know
just assigning a bunch of values to one
variable so what we're going to do today
is I'm going to show you guys how to
create these arrays how to print them
out inside the browser and create
something called an array object so what
we're going to go ahead and do here is
as you guys can see I have a paragraph
tag called test and I'm going to go and
create an array and insert data inside
this paragraph here so when we go down
inside our script tags I'm going to go
ahead and create just to show you guys a
bunch of variables so I'm going to say
variable name one is equal to for
example Daniel then I'm just going to go
to copy this two more times like so I'm
going to change the variable names
because we don't want to keep the same
names I'm going to change the name to
John and Jane so right now we have three
pieces of data and if I were to insert
this inside the browser I could do that
but let's say I want to make this a lot
simpler by just creating three names and
inserting them into one variable what I
can do here is I can create something
called an array so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to go ahead and say we have
a variable I'm going to call this one
names and then I'm going to go ahead and
rewrite what we have up here but inside
one variable so I'm going to say names
is equal to brackets and then inside the
brackets we can go ahead and insert the
same data so I'm going to say double
quotes Daniel then after the double
quotes I'm going to go ahead and say
comma then a new piece of data called
John comment and then Jane now these two
pieces of code here does the exact same
thing except for the top one here being
a lot bigger and a lot more complicated
where the array down here is much more
simple now there's another way to create
an array instead of having to just you
know use
records which is using the function
array inside JavaScript so I'm just
going to go and say if you have a
variable called names I'm just going to
go and rewrite what we have up here I'm
going to set it equal to array with a
big a print to C's semicolon then inside
parentheses we do the exact same thing
as we did up here just going to copy
what we have out there and insert it so
these two pieces of code does the exact
same thing as what we have up here now
of course like I said this one down here
is not really the one that people prefer
to use because it takes up more code and
it's just much simpler to use the one up
here so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to go and delete what we have here
and then I'm going to go ahead and show
you guys how we can print this out
inside the browser
so if I were to go down and say we have
a document dot get element by ID
parentheses punctuation in there hTML is
equal to names and then we want to say
brackets and then say zero now of course
we want to get the test ID up here so
I'm just going to test inside get
element by ID now what I just did here
is right now inside this array we have
here I'm just going to go and delete
these three up here because we don't
need them we have three pieces of data
right now via daniel john and jane now
each time you count inside code whether
it being PHP code or JavaScript code we
always start at zero so Daniel is going
to be data number zero John is going to
be number one and Jane is going to be
number two so right now when I go in and
say we have a variable called names
brackets zero and referring to the first
data inside this variable here so if I
go ahead and save this and go inside my
browser refresh you guys can see if we
get Daniel if it were to change the
number into a one
we should get John so this is how we can
write variables and how to get the names
or these the data inside the array so we
can spit them out inside the browser now
one thing I want to mention before we
start creating array objects is that
when we do it this way we have a raise
or at least data inside an array and we
want to spit out the data we can spit
out the data much faster if we were to
use arrays then
creating a bunch of variables because we
have something called loops inside
JavaScript that makes it a lot easier to
spit out the data now we're going to
talk about loops a little bit later for
now we're just going to go and stick
with this so the next thing we're going
to learn is how to create an array
object inside JavaScript and what we
have here
you know the array we just created is
technically if you were to test it
inside the browser using a JavaScript
function that actually tells you what
kind of data this is it will tell you
that what we have here is an object now
what we want to do is we want to refer
to this as an array since technically
it's not an object at least you know not
the way we we like to think about it so
we're going to learn how to create an
array object which is a lot more
powerful if you want to do more
complicated JavaScript projects and it's
not really a difficult thing to to
create so don't think that we're about
to learn something really complicated
here so what I'm going to go ahead and
do here is I'm going to go ahead and go
below what we have here X I'm just gonna
go ahead and comment out what we have up
here like so like so and I'm going to go
ahead and create an array object now the
way we do that is by creating a variable
I'm just going to call this one names
just like the previous one I'm going to
set it equal to curly brackets not
brackets but this time curly brackets
colon and inside the curly brackets the
first data we can go ahead and give it a
name so right now if I were to say well
actually let's not call this one names
let's actually call a person because
that makes more sense here and basically
what we can do with an array object is
we can go and say well we have a person
and this person has specific properties
and methods such as names or an age or
maybe some kind of function that
calculates something about this person
inside these curly brackets here so what
we can do is we can go and say let's say
we have a first name like so let's
actually make that big like so colon
double quotes Daniel comma and then the
next property which could be last name
colon double quotes Nielsen let's say I
have an H as well because this is
technically my name and my last name so
let's say I have an H colon which
25 and this is how we create an object
now what's important to understand here
is that right now this is an object
because we assign names to the data
inside the curly brackets and this is
actually what we're technically inside
other programming language is called an
associative array
meaning that right now we have just a
very basic array that has names for the
data now inside JavaScript we don't have
anything called associative arrays this
is called an object okay so if you want
to print out the data from from this
object here we can actually go ahead go
down to the next line and say that we
have another document get element by ID
paste it down here and then instead of
names we're going to go ahead and say we
have person and then instead of the
brackets we create a punctuation and say
we have first name because that's what
we have inside as a name for what to
save this comes at the browser you guys
can see we get Daniel as well we could
change this to H one and two and we will
get 25 so this is how we create array
objects inside JavaScript now a couple
more things about arrays is that
typically when you see an array inside
you know tutorial website or something
like that you typically don't see it
like this you know in one line now
typically when you see an array you see
the people I move down the data like so
like so like so and like so because it
makes a lot more sense to read it this
way now it's really important for you
guys to know that you don't insert
commas at the last data you know because
it needs to look like in one line so
typically when you see people write a
race on line it looks like this same
thing goes for objects down here where
would actually look like this like this
like this and like this now the last
thing guys need to know about JavaScript
objects like the one we have here is
that we can insert other types of data
than just properties like the one we
have here we can actually insert
functions inside these objects here
which then get renamed as methods
because they're inside an object we can
also insert a raise inside an array
meaning that if I were to say well we
have an eight here but let's say I want
to create an array out of this we can
actually go ahead and instead of 25 you
could create a list of numbers inside
the 8 here now in the next episode we'll
talk about how to insert a raise and
instead functions inside these objects
here so we guys enjoyed I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
