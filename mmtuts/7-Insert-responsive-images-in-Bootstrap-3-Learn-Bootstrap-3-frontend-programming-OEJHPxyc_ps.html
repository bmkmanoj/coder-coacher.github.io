images inside bootstrap because when it
comes to bootstrap you have a lot of
nice features we can add into images to
make some responsive or maybe give them
some kind of cool effect so inside my
website here as you guys can see I have
a very basic push drive website I have
the necessary links I have a stylesheet
that I included myself so I could
actually go inside the styling and
change it and I went ahead and created
three different columns down here inside
my body tag now with you guys from
notices did I actually went ahead and
start these columns so we can actually
see them inside the browser and yes I
know right now it's actually kind of
small to look at but this is the actual
size that I decided for the text and the
colors so what we're going to do today
is I'm going to go ahead and take these
columns here and I'm going to go ahead
and add another row underneath it and
I'm going to go to insert and image
inside the middle column we have in here
so I'm going to go and change the text
inside the second row we have here as
you guys can see want to do actually
refresh you guys can see we get two more
columns or two more rows inside the
website the middle row doesn't have any
kind of content inside of it meaning the
right now we don't actually get any kind
of height inside the metal column so
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to go and say we have an image like so
and right now the image is inside a root
folder as you guys can see right here
inside an image folder called test the
JPEG so I'm going to go and refer to
this one if you guys want to download
the image you can go and find the image
in the description of this video so I'm
going to go and say if you have an image
folder forward slash test dot JPEG like
so if I insert it inside the browser
refresh you guys can see we get a very
very big image so we need to actually
resize this image in order to make it
look somewhat like it should so what I'm
going to go and do here in order to
resize them is I'm not going to go
inside my stylesheet I'm actually going
to go ahead and use the bootstrap
function that actually resizes the image
according to the containers inside of so
what I can do here is I can go inside my
image tag and add a class called image
responsive so what's the image Daz
responsive like so and forward to
refresh the browser you guys can see
that now it actually fits
- width or the height of the actual
constant we have it inside of now if you
guys ask about why there's a bit of
spacing in between or in between the
damage and the browser if you guys can
see the text up here also have a spacing
and that's because we have default
margin or default padding when it comes
to these elements inside bootstrap so if
you want to change this you're going to
have to go inside the styling yourself
and actually remove the actual padding
so let's actually see what it is if I go
inside the image here we get a padding
around the actual column so we need to
actually go inside our styling and say
we want to remove this padding if you
want to now just inserted out so we can
actually remove the padding from this
image here you can actually go into the
stylesheet
and go inside the class the images
inside of and change the padding of this
class and one thing you guys will notice
is that when we do I set the padding to
zero it doesn't actually change the
actual styling inside the website
because if i refresh the browser you
guys can see nothing happens now there's
two ways we can fix this because first
of all Busha right now is actually going
inside our code and overriding our
default styling CSS and the way we can
change that is by going inside our
styling say exclamation mark important
right after the actual styling refers
the browser and as you guys can see now
the padding goes away and the image is
actually all the way from left to right
now this is not really the optimal way
to do this though so if I go back inside
my styling change the code refresh the
processor goes back to normal again I
can go inside my index file and go to
the top where included the stylesheet
because right now because the statute is
the first thing inside my index file
it's going to read the styles that we
wrote and then afterwards is going to
overwrite the code with the bootstrap
code down here so if we want to do this
the proper way I can delete the style or
the link to the stylesheet going to need
the bootstrap code and paste in the
stylesheet so if we go back and refresh
you guys notice that now changes again
of course right now you guys can see
that this is the sensor up here also
changed and that's because it also has
the tiling as sensor inside the style
sheet of course better than mine when
you make your own website so let's
actually go ahead and remove the styling
again because I don't want the image to
go all the way from left to right like
so
I just want to show you guys for me to
actually change the size of the browser
it does actually you know resize the
image according to the container going
back into a code we can go ahead and add
some cool effects to this image here so
if you guys want something to look like
a thumbnail if you want it to look like
you know a circle then you can go and do
that using bootstrap rather than going
into your stylesheet and do it manually
so what I can do is I can actually go
inside my image I'm just going to go and
resize this we can exit each anti-image
inside the code and I'm going to go to
add a class to this image here now the
first class we're going to add is going
to be called image - rounded which right
now forward to actually change the image
or just refresh the browser you guys can
see that we get this round the corner up
in the top and the bottom corners so
this is just some kind of way to add
rounded corners which is the border
radius that we can add inside the
styling in CSS - images without having
to actually do it inside to CSS now this
is doing it the bootstrap way if you
want to do it to CSS way you can do that
as well again we're going into the
concept of bootstrap being a way to add
classes to your HTML content in order to
change up the content inside the browser
instead of having to style everything
yourself so going back inside our
bootstrap
image down here let's actually go and
change it from image rounded to image
circle and now what you guys will notice
is that the image becomes a circle it
just cuts away the borders and again the
only thing it does here is that the
change with the border radius to
something much bigger than actual image
size meaning that it's always going to
be rounded inside damage so it's just
messing around the border radius again
now the last thing we can do here is
something a bit more special than just
changing the border radius is we can
actually go ahead and say we want to
have a thumbnail since that I have an
image circle we can actually go and say
we have image thumbnail like so and now
the guys to notice is you get this
thumbnail effect inside the image so we
get this border up here that's white
that you know looks like a thumbnail
that you can actually click on and then
open up the image in some kind of
smaller window now the last thing I want
to show you guys regarding images inside
trap you can also use bootstrap to
create galleries so if I were to
actually delete the first row we have
inside our code which is just the
textile Peter says left side Center
right side like so we can actually go
ahead and insert the middle image and
just copy it inside the other two divs
we have inside the code so right now I
have three different images well three
of the same images inside my code and as
you guys can see now we get this
repeated image inside our browser if I
were to change the layout so we go out
into regular website mode or desktop
mode we do get this gallery looking
thing of course right now the center
also has a styling in it that says the
background color should be this color
let's go and remove that and now you
guys can see we get a gallery going on
inside the website of course we could
also add text to these images so for
were to say the image I'm just going to
move it down so it looks and what nice
like so so we have the image here I can
go ahead and add a paragraph underneath
the image and say it is is an title or a
title like so and I guess we'll see you
get some kind of title to the image so
creating a gallery inside bootstrap is
also very simple to do so this is all I
want to show guys in this episode in the
next episode we're going to talk about
how to do kinda the same thing but using
videos instead so if you guys enjoyed
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
