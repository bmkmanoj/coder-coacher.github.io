what exactly you need to look into if
you want to learn how to make websites
so in case you guys are sitting there
thinking well I want to make a website
for company or for myself but I don't
know where to start then I'm going to
try to point out or help you guys in
this video here knowing exactly where I
need to start so basically what we're
going to cover in this episode is what
exactly goes into making a website and
what you need to learn first now just to
give you guys a bit of background on
myself in case you don't know who I am
my name is Daniel I live in Denmark
right now I have an educational
background in web development and web
communication and currently I'm working
inside a company as a multimedia
designer in my spare time and make
videos on YouTube that explains how to
actually create websites and teaches how
to code different coding languages so in
case you guys are interested in one of
my courses after this video you guys can
go ahead and check those out so the
first thing I want to make clear when it
comes to making websites is that making
a website does not cost anything at
least to start out with if you want to
make a website you just need to have a
computer you don't even need to install
any kind of programs on your computer
you just need to have the computer and
you need to have a domain now what a
domain is is basically if I were to go
inside my browser and type something
like mmm - snaps or facebook.com/ mmm
tools and Facebook is the domain name
for the website so later on when you
have actually made your website you can
go ahead and buy a domain name from some
sort of hosting company on the web and
to actually have a link in my
description where you guys are going to
take one out if you guys use the link in
the description you will get a discount
based off my link in the description but
just to make it clear you don't need to
have a domain until you do actually have
a finished website so actually creating
the website does not require anything
else than just a computer you can build
an entire website without needing
internet okay you just need the computer
so just to show you guys an example of
what a website actually looks like let's
actually go ahead and take a look at my
website here this website is my site
called mmm toots where I teach tutorials
on different coding languages and when I
built this website the way I started out
was by creating a folder
my computer I called it something like
mmm toots and inside the folder is where
all the content for the website is
stored just to show you guys how the
folder looks like I'm going to go and
open up here so you guys can see this is
the folder inside the folder I have many
different files and folders that
contains images coding files and fonts
for the website now of course this is
actually a more complicated website
which is why have so many files and
folders in here so don't get freaked out
you can see that there's quite a few
files in here building a basic website
does not required as many files now
looking at all these files you might be
asking me well how do you actually build
these files and all the coding documents
to use inside
websites now to do this we just need a
basic text editor right now you should
actually have one on your computer
called notepad you can actually use this
one in order to create websites of
course it's not optimal because it
doesn't really have any kind of syntax
or color system inside the code to
illustrate which code is what so in my
case I'm using one called sublime text
for most of my website developments just
to show you guys this is how it looks
like so inside this text editor just to
show you guys an example of code I went
ahead and created a very basic index
page which is what we call a front page
inside a website we don't call it front
page we called index page inside this
file I just wrote some very basic code
there's not a lot of code in here
typically your index one will be much
bigger than this but just to show you
guys how code looks like this is how it
looks like another programming language
can be seen inside this file where
included just a little bit of code just
to show you guys how it looks like these
are actually two different coding
languages that are used inside my files
so now that I saw thee answer website
folder and soda got a couple examples of
how code actually looks like let's
actually go and take a look at the
different coding languages that I
recommend you guys start learning if you
want to make a website and again we're
talking about building a website from
scratch using code which is actually
quite a lot of fun if you're interested
in coding so as you guys can see in
front of me here I have a document
called web development what should I
learn first and inside this document
made a couple illustrations showing
which exact coding languages you should
look into if you want to learn how to
build a website and yes I did say coding
images because if you want to build a
website from scratch you're going to
need to learn how to code now there's a
lot of coding languages out there and in
case someone has never showed you before
where you need to start it can be quite
confusing knowing exactly which one you
should learn first so let's go ahead and
take a look at this diagram that I made
from the beginning as you guys can see
when it comes to web development we have
two different areas one is called
front-end development and one is called
back-end development now when you want
to build a website just a very basic
website one that has images text links
in it you need to learn something called
HTML and CSS these are two different
coding languages that work together when
you want to build a website basically
HTML is the actual structure of the
website and CSS is what makes the
structure pretty so in case you have
some text inside your website you
created an HTML and when you want to
style the text make it bigger make it
change color you do it using CSS now
HTML and CSS is very easy to learn of
course in the beginning is never done
any kind of coding before it can be a
bit tough because you've never actually
coded before but of all the coding
languages you need to learn in order to
create a website HTML and CSS are some
of the easier ones and some of the ones
you need to learn in order to build a
website and when you know HTML and CSS
you can basically build the complete
website you don't need to learn any of
these coding languages down here because
HTML CSS can do the entire thing for you
having said this when it comes to making
websites if you want to make something
that's more than just a basic website
you know one that's aesthetic that you
can really do anything in other than
clicking on links then you need to look
into other languages and this is where
we start moving into front-end
development and back-end development
because when you start out with either
the front-end development or back-end
development you need to learn HTML and
CSS then if you want to continue doing
more visual stuff inside a website
something that might cost the website to
change or behave in really cool ways
when you start interacting with it then
you can look into front-end development
a couple languages we have here is
called JavaScript and jQuery jQuery is
actually a coding language based off
JavaScript which a lot of people says is
a lot easier to write than JavaScript
and you can actually do
quite a lot of things inside jQuery you
can even mix JavaScript and jQuery
together if you want to but the basic
idea I'm trying to get across here is
that after you learn the basics of HTML
and CSS and you want to continue
building websites if you want to work on
the front end part which is the part
that you actually see inside the website
then you need to learn JavaScript first
and then take hurry now in case you guys
wonder what exactly back-end development
is it's basically all the stuff that
goes on in the background now you might
be thinking that well back in
development that doesn't really sound
that interesting because you can't
really see the visuals of it inside a
website
well back-end development is what makes
a website do stuff so in case you guys
want to have a login system or if you
want to have a search field we want to
create any other kind of application
inside your website that allow for the
user to do stuff inside the website that
produces some kind of result then you
need to learn back in development when
it comes to back-end development we have
something called PHP which is one of the
languages you can use in order to
interact with the user through a website
there's a lot of languages out there the
one that I'm focused on in my lessons
here is PHP now when it comes to PHP it
is a way to handle data from the user
when he starts doing stuff inside the
browser but when the user does something
and you want to save whatever he does
let's say we create a login system the
user goes to your website to sign up
inside your website when he signs up we
need to save this information somewhere
which is going to be inside a database
now databases is quite a step ahead if
you haven't even gotten started with
HTML CSS yet but again I don't want to
confuse you guys these things down here
everything here are only things you're
going to look into after learning HTML
CSS ok these are bonus languages you
guys can choose to learn if you want to
continue learning how to build websites
now when we want to interact with the
database using PHP code in order to
actually pull out information on the
user or insert information of the user
we need to use SQL SQL is a database
language and it's the one that actually
handles pulling out or inserting data
inside the database now inside the next
step down here which would actually
the step three I mentioned something
called oo P PHP which stands for
object-oriented programming PHP now
after you learn PHP coding which is
again how to actually make a website
interactive if you want to get hired by
a company in the future let's say an
advertisement agency then you're going
to need to look into optic go into
programming object-oriented programming
is basically just another way of
programming things but in a much more
structured way in order for other
programmers that you might work with to
look at your code and make sense of it
there's also quite a few benefits from
learning object oriented programming
rather than the regular procedural
programming which is what we call it
when we just learn PHP code now inside
my diagram here I went ahead and
included a lot more information when it
comes to web development as you guys can
see we do actually have something under
Co optimization frameworks and content
management systems and again I don't
want to fill the gap so a lot of
information if you just want to know
where to start everything else that I'm
explaining this video for the rest of
the video is going to be in order to
give you guys a full view of what
exactly need to learn further down the
road okay so after we look into for
example HTML CSS and we have looked into
JavaScript jQuery which is front-end
development and also learned a bit about
PHP and SQL in case you guys want to go
both ways we can start looking into
something called JSON and Ajax which is
basically when JavaScript and PHP comes
together in order to do stuff together
in order to do much more cool things
inside a website an example of this
would be in case I want to create a
message system inside my web site you
know we go into a web site like the one
they have in Facebook where you can
write to other people in order to do
this when you do stuff in PHP every time
you need to make changes to a website it
requires that you refresh the browser
and again you can repress the browser
each time you want to see a new message
from another user you know when somebody
writes to you so we use Ajax as an
example in order to get the data from a
database without needing to refresh the
browser so if you want to create
something like a message system inside a
website we would need to learn something
like 8x okay
so these languages down here are
languages that we can use in combination
with JavaScript and PHP so not only
talked about some of the basic
programming languages we have out there
in order to get you guys started with
web development let's actually go and
talk about some of the other elements
when it comes to web development so when
it comes to web development and you want
to take much further than just creating
websites that you actually want to do
this as a job in the future
you're going to need to learn a couple
other skills now the first one I'm going
to talk about is search engine
optimization which is called Co in short
now when you go to Google and you want
to search for something let's say I want
to search on HTML tutorials now once you
click search there's going to be a lot
of different links and websites popping
up inside Google search page now the
thing that actually determines which
pages would be at the very top when you
search inside Google it's based off
something called seal now when it comes
to 0 we have two different fields we
have something called unpaid seal and we
have off page view both of these go very
deep and are very complicated to learn
and there are actually people out in the
world who makes a lot of money just
doing Cu for companies so when we have C
we have two different types we have
unpaid and off-page to you on pages
basically when we say optimize the code
to make sure that Google actually likes
our website and off page Cu is when we
build up some kind of value by having
people visit it again this is a very
simple explanation of Cu it's actually
very deep when you go into Co
optimization there might be some
tutorials on this channel in the future
regarding see you right now there is
many kind of videos so in the future
might get into it another Theo you guys
can look into when it comes to web
development is something called
frameworks right now if I were to review
some kind of website inside my browser
in order to make it easier for myself to
create these websites and to make sure
that other developers know exactly how
the website has been created we can use
something called frameworks there's a
lot of different frameworks for a lot of
different languages in case you guys
want to learn a framework for HTML CSS
we have something called bootstrap and
w3 CSS which is a way for you to program
a website that both make it responsive
meaning that you can see it inside cell
phones and actually adjust to the cell
phone screen and makes everything look a
lot nicer so basically once you guys
have learned the programming
a recommending a slogan two frameworks
for each programming language you can
find primers for HTML CSS JavaScript and
some of the other languages we have out
there now the last thing I want to talk
about is something called a CMS system
which stands for content management
system now you might have heard about
some of these like WordPress which is
actually most popular CMS system out
there which is basically a way for us to
well some people do exercise you can
create websites using WordPress which is
basically true if you learn how to do
WordPress which is basically just going
into your browser and then you can
drag-and-drop and do stuff inside a
website just to make a website this is a
very easy way to make websites without
needing to code anything but I need to
say if you decide to make websites using
a CMS system you're going to make
website to look very much like each
other so if you have a client I want you
to make something unique you shouldn't
be using WordPress Joomla Drupal mbaku
in order to make these websites at least
when it comes to the themes that are
built in to these CMS systems now I
might have confused you guys a bit about
what exactly a CMS system is so just to
explain to you guys when you make a
website for clients let's say I have
John and I need to make a website for
hem and then programmer website give it
to him but because John does not a
program and at some point in the future
need to change the content inside the
website we need to include the CMS
system inside the website meaning that
instead of having to go inside the code
and change stuff
John can just simply go inside dashboard
inside the browser using a login system
and change the content inside the
website whether it being text images or
creating new pages so this is basically
what a CMS system does and again this is
something you might want to look into if
you plan to have clients in the future
so I hope this gave you guys some kind
of overview over what exactly needs to
look into when it comes to learning web
development I'm going to go and save
this image put it inside my description
for you guys to download so just to
recap really quickly if you've never
created a website before I recommend you
guys start out by learning HTML CSS then
afterwards I think you guys to start
learning JavaScript and jQuery since
these kind of goes together
HTML and CSS then after learning
JavaScript you guys can look into
learning PHP and SQL since
laughter you got to do more things
inside the website such as creating a
login system and then once you've done
this I recommend you guys looking into a
CMS system like for example WordPress
again if you guys are not interested in
doing a CMS system I recommend you guys
look into something like bootstrap
learning some kind of framework that you
can use inside your websites in order to
make it mobile responsive or tablet
responsive as soon as you get started
programming so don't actually have to do
it manually
after you're done creating your website
using HTML and CSS so now that we talked
about all this I'm going to go ahead and
recommend you guys go back to my HTML
series inside my YouTube channel one
side my website and start looking into
how to do HTML and CSS inside my HTML
CSS series I'll talk about which
programs you can use or text editors you
can use in order to get started with
programming and I also teach you guys
how to upload websites to the web later
on when you do actually have a finished
website so we guys enjoyed this episode
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
