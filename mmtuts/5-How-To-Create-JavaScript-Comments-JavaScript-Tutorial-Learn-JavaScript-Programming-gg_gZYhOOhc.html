comment inside JavaScript and I think
this is something that's quite important
for you to know since at one point when
you have a really big website it can be
quite difficult to distinguish some code
from another which means that commenting
can actually be used to write an
explanation to what code does what
inside our code so the first one we're
going to learn how to do is commenting
out a single line now as you guys can
see I've two lines of code down here and
this is exit example from the previous
episode and I'm just going to go ahead
and comment out the console.log line
that we have here for writing backslash
backslash now everything in front of the
badge class is not going to be a comment
but everything to the right side of it
is going to be comped it out and it's
only going to be this line of code here
so I could actually use this comment to
either write on the right side of it
like here I could write something or I
could write the comment on top of it to
just explain what exactly this code does
now let's say I want to comment out more
than one line of code I can actually go
and do it the same way as CSS we write
backslash star as you guys can see I
automatically commented out everything
inside the script tags because you know
everything after these symbols gets
commented out if I want to close two
comments I need to write star backslash
you know just reversed and now
everything between these tags is going
to be a comment as you guys can see if I
move it up to the next line
you know the second line does not get
comments out because like I said
everything in between the tags gets
commented and that's basically it I
don't think that this episode should be
longer than this because it's just
simply commenting I hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
