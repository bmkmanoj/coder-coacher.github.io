something called functions within
JavaScript and when it comes to
functions at least within JavaScript we
basically have two different types you
have predetermined functions and we have
used to define functions now we did
actually do predetermined functions in
the past in some of the previous
episodes but I didn't actually refer to
it as predetermined functions so just to
give you guys an example of what those
are I'm just gonna go and write out
document dot write parenthesis semicolon
now the document part is the object that
we want to do something to and the right
parenthesis is a function and it's what
we call the predetermined function
because it already exists within the
JavaScript language you don't except to
create this thing because it already
exists now the way you can recognize a
function is that they have some kind of
name and then you have parenthesis
coming after it all functions are going
to be looking something like this
because that's just a way to build up
now when it comes to user-defined
functions it's a function that we create
ourselves so we decide we want to use a
for and what it should do and just to
give you guys an example of why it could
be useful to have functions let's say we
have a website and I want to do
something inside the website with
JavaScript but not until the user has
done something inside the website for
example clicked on something or waited a
certain amount of time or maybe the
mouse needs to hover on top of something
then we can use functions because when
you put stuff into functions it won't
actually run the function until we've
actually called on it so to give you
guys an example here let's actually go
ahead and just continue writing
something inside our document right here
I'm gonna say clicked like so refresh
the website and as you guys can see it
says clicked now if I put this inside a
function that we create ourselves a
user-defined function by writing
function space then we need to give this
function some kind of name it could be
just as an example my script you guys
can call whatever you want parentheses
because we do need to have the
parentheses afterwards that defines a
function space
curly brackets just like in CSS and then
inside the curly practice is where we
put our code so if I were to copy our
document right here put it inside the
function instead you guys consider once
a refresh the website it disappears and
that's because we haven't actually
called in the function yet now if I
didn't want to have this text appear you
know to actually have the code running
from the function I could go underneath
here and just simply write out my script
parentheses semi-colon because now we've
activated the function and it's gonna
appear where we put this piece of code
inside the website so for to refresh now
you guys can see it says clicked again
now if I want to call in this function
on certain events and we haven't
actually talked about events yet because
I think it's important we get the hang
of functions first and talk about some
of the the different things that
JavaScript has to offer some of the
basics before we get into too much into
events but just to give you guys an
example let's say I want to have a piece
of text inside my website and when I
click on this text I want something to
happen I want to run this function down
here so if I say click me and do bear in
mind this is just a simple paragraph in
HTML it's not JavaScript code now if I
want something to happen once I click on
this thing up here I could say that I
want to put an event inside the HTML tag
I could also do it directly inside the
code but just for this exercise let's go
ahead and put it inside the HTML tag so
if you go inside my paragraph tag the
opening tag I can actually create an
events which JavaScript knows as a
default it knows a lot of these what do
you call the names of these events so if
I were to go inside an HTML tag and say
for example unclick which is a valid
event we have in JavaScript equal to
double quotes then I couldn't actually
put the name of my script inside this
event which basically means on click on
this event we want to run this function
okay so if I go back to the website
refresh you guys can see it says click
me if I click it
clicked so the JavaScript code is not
running until I've actually clicked it
now this is just one you know purpose
behind using functions functions can be
used for many different things in
JavaScript we will be using it quite
often basically all the time so it's
very important you guys get familiar
with functions within JavaScript so you
don't think it's something you know
scary to get into it it's it should be a
second nature at one point so this is
basically what I wanted to show you guys
with functions we will be talking more
about from since in the future so I'm
just going to ahead and leave this
episode here I hope you guys enjoyed and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
