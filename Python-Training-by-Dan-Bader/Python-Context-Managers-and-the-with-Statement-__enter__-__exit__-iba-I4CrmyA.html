going to talk about the width statement
in Python so the width statement relates
to something that is called context
managers and it is sometimes regarded as
a bit of an obscure feature by some
people but actually when you peek behind
the scenes there's relatively little
magic involved and it's actually a
highly useful feature that can help you
write cleaner and easier to understand
easier to maintain code so the first
question that I want to talk about is
okay so what is the width statement
actually good for
the width statement is great for
simplifying some of the common resource
management patterns that you'll see in
your code so by resources in this case I
mean system resources like files locks
or some kind of network connection stuff
like that and so with the width
statement you can abstract the way some
of the functionality there that is you
know commonly required like dealing with
the acquisition and releasing these
resources again so a good example here
would be dealing with files a file and
Open File is a system resource and you
need to acquire it in some way and then
also release it to give that resource
back to the system so it doesn't have to
keep track of the file you're working
with and so I want to take a look at
this simple example here where we're
using the with statement to open a file
and in write to it and to have the file
automatically closed so the big
advantage here is you know what I just
said where if we use the with statement
to open the file
Python is going to make sure that this
file is going to be closed once we're
done with it so basically when you do
this you open or you create this context
where we're working with the file object
right we're giving it the name F just
maybe not an ideal name right maybe you
should call this out file or something
like that and then in the block that
follows in this indented block here we
can work with F and as soon as the
execution of your program leaves the
context Python will automatically close
the file
so it's going to call F dot close and
that will return the resource the file
descriptor back to the operating system
and it doesn't have to keep track of
that resource anymore and so to
demystify how the width statement works
let's take a look at what actually
happens behind the scenes right so if
you were to write this manually and
probably do something like that right so
you would open the file just assign it
to F here on this line and then I'm
using a try finally statement here to
actually write to the file and then to
make sure I actually close the file so
even if something goes wrong here you
know we have some kind of exception
some error where we can't write to the
file this would make sure that we're
actually calling clothes on the file
which in a longer running program that's
super important because you always want
to give up these resources so the try
finally here is really significant right
it wouldn't be enough to just say okay
I'm going to do an open and then write
and then a closed because you could
potentially leak that resource by not
releasing it again if some kind of
exception would happen using the with
statement really simplifies the code we
have to write here because what you see
in the second code example that is super
common you're going to use a pattern
like this very very frequently if you're
dealing with any kind of resource like
open files open network connections
stuff like that you always want to make
sure you're using this try finally
pattern and so the with statement is a
way to abstract that away to factor out
that functionality so that you don't
have to write that every single time you
open a file or you create a file now how
does this actually work behind the
scenes right because this seems like a
really nice feature and in my opinion
it's a highly useful feature in Python
but how do we go from this to that
behind the scenes and this is what I'm
going to explain to you now so how can
you support the width statement in your
own objects because there's really
nothing magical or special about the way
open works there's not some magic sauce
that's only available to Python built-in
objects you can support the same
functionality in your own programs or in
your own objects by implementing
so-called context managers so what's a
context manager really what it boils
down to is that it's a simple protocol
or some interface or contract that your
objects follow so that they can be used
with the width statement and I'm going
to show you a simple example here
so this managed file class basically
emulates what open did there and how we
were able to use it with the with
statement so there's two methods that an
object needs to support in order to be
used with the with statement and that is
the enter in the exit method so it's a
very very simple contract a very very
simple interface and with this managed
file class here we can go ahead and say
ok with managed file as F and that looks
exactly the same as the open function
call looked earlier and now we can
actually go ahead you know and write
something to that file and we're going
to get the same result the file is
automatically going to be closed
all right so I want to talk a little bit
more about the steps that Python takes
behind the scenes for for this example
to actually work so you can see here we
defined this managed file class and
we've got this constructor here that
just assigns the name it remembers the
name for the file that we want to create
and it doesn't actually open the file
until the enter method is called and
that's kind of how you want to structure
your context managers right so that
really the resource gets acquired when
the enter method is called and it gets
released when the exit method is called
and then the exit method also takes
additional parameters that will tell you
about some exception that might have
happened in case you want to you know
inspect that log that or do something
with that I'm not doing that here just
checking like hey did we actually open
anything
if so then we're going to close the file
and now obviously you know with this
example you need to remember that this
is sort of a useless wrapper around the
open function here because the open
function already pretty much does that
as when it functions as a contacts
manager right so this is merely an
example to illustrate that but you could
imagine this would be some other kind of
resource like a database connection so
now what's going on here in this example
because when we create an instance of
managed file we're not actually
immediately calling the enter method so
I could also do something like this you
know I'm going to call this MF which is
not an ideal name but for this example
it'll work so I'm creating
this managed file object and up until
now we didn't actually call
the enter method right you can see that
here with this exception because the
object doesn't have a file attribute yet
we didn't assign that yet because we
didn't call enter yet or python did call
enter yet now when I go ahead and do
with MF and then I can say something
like with MF as the file
then I'm going to enter this context
where the resource is acquired and now I
would have to go the file dot right
hello dot txt
talk about what's going on here right so
we can see here with this statement with
MF as the file
behind the scenes this is going to call
enter and then it's going to assign the
return value so this is going to return
the actual file it's going to assign
that to this name here the file and then
within the context off this manage file
I can use the underscore file to
actually write to the file right because
this was the actual file object that I
needed to write to the file and then
when we leave the context it'll like
right after I'm making this call here
and we're going back one indentation
level leaving this context then
immediately Python is going to call the
exit method or the dunder exit method
all right so I hope that gives you a
better idea of how these context
managers actually work behind the scenes
now I just explained to you how
class-based context managers work but
this isn't the only way to support the
with statement in Python and this isn't
this is not the only way to implement a
context manager so there is the context
Lib module in the standard library and
it provides a couple of abstractions on
top of the basic context manager
protocol and this can make your life a
little easier if you're trying to
implement a use case that matches well
with what the context Lib module offers
so here's a quick example of what you
can do with this so I'm going to
re-implement the same managed file
functionality using the context Lib
library so there's a decorator in there
called context manager and this thing is
is highly useful so what that allows you
to do is you can define objects that
follow the context manager protocol that
you can use with the with statement
simply by writing a generator so you
know when looking at this code again you
can see our familiar try and finally
pattern here so where I'm acquiring the
resource and then I'm yielding it and
then later I'm closing the resource and
what happens is that this app context
manager decorator will turn this
generator function or this generator
that I just defined here it will turn
that into a full-blown context manager
that I can use with the with state
so again I can do something like this I
can say with managed file
hello dot txt
I'm just going to call it f and
and I can say I could write something to
the file and of course we can also you
know write write more stuff to the same
file and now when I run this we're
actually writing to the file if you're
wondering what this is so this is just
the number of characters written because
write returns how many characters were
written to the file right and it's just
kind of leaking back into my interpreter
session here so with this technique
using contact slip and using the context
manager decorator you can write some of
these context managers a lot quicker
I guess the downside is a dad for
someone to understand this piece of code
they would have to have some basic
knowledge about decorators and they
would also have some basic knowledge
they would have to have some basic
knowledge about how generators work in
Python right so when you compare that
with the class-based implementation you
could actually say hey on the class
based implementation communicates what's
going on much more clearly for someone
who's not an expert at Python so
depending you know how how your team
feels about this and what everyone's
expertise level is it's kind of a fine
balance with them what what concepts you
want to pull into this you know
personally I think this is pretty
beautiful right this is awesome this is
very pythonic but on the other hand it
requires someone to understand many many
more concepts in order to actually you
know understand what's going on looking
at this I mean they're going to still
use it the same way so they might not
care but I just wanted to mention that
because in my mind code always needs to
communicate what's going on or like code
is communication and this is a great
example where you can see where the
trade offs are right and I can't make
those decisions for you but it will be
something that you need to decide within
the context of your team the project
you're working on and so on right duh
just wanted to mention that all right so
I hope that gave you a good overview of
how these context managers work how the
with statement works behind the scenes
and what you can do with them there's a
couple more really cool things you can
do with context managers like you can
write some really really nice ap eyes
with that and I'm going deeper into the
