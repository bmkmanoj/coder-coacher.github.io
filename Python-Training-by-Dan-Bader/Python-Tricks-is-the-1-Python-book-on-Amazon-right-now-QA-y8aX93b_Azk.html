tricks this book here just came out on
as a paperback on Amazon is actually the
number one best-selling book in Python
programming on Amazon right now and that
feels kind of crazy I honestly I was
super shocked to see this but it is very
cool so if you bought a copy than huge
thanks if you bought the early access
digital version a while ago you know
huge thanks again for your support huge
things if you ever sent me some feedback
or you know told me about a mistake I
made in the book that that's just
awesome you know it really helped me get
this project out the door and helped me
get this published on Amazon and it's
it's kind of nuts to see this so yeah
it's actually the number one bestseller
in Python programming and it is also the
number one bestseller in programming
languages which is nuts it is freaking
nuts you know I feel a little bit bad
about you know just bragging about this
in the video but also I can't really
help myself right now so so bear with me
right and I am so the actually this is a
book that I really love clean code by
Uncle Bob Martin and I learned a ton
from this book and it was just kind of
mind-blowing to see Python tricks beat
Uncle Bob well at least for for the day
or for the week we're gonna have to see
how long how long it stays up there but
honestly like if you bought a paperback
version off this book thank you so much
you are you're really awesome and this
is really helping me out a ton so yeah
just a couple of a couple of things I
want to talk about in this video because
I I got a shaitaan of emails actually
I'm sitting at close to 100 emails in my
inbox right now that I'm slowly working
my way through so if you email me bear
with me might take a while before I can
get back to you but I tried covering the
top questions about the book because I
got a bunch of questions you know around
availability availability for the book
and for how long you can still get the
the launch discount on the paperback on
Amazon and I put together this FAQ and I
just wanted to talk about some of the
yeah some of the the questions here just
do a quick Q&amp;amp;A so blah blah blah as you
can see you know it's the number one
programming languages book right now are
there sample chapters okay so of course
I want to make sure if you're
considering buying the book that you
have a chance to look at what you know
what you're gonna get so the best way to
do that is to actually click through to
the Amazon page and then Amazon has this
thing called look inside and you you
basically click on the cover for the
book and it's gonna open up this viewer
here and that way you can take a look at
the full table of contents and you can
browse around in the book and read a few
sample chapters and it's I think they
limited you know it's only available
like once every 24 hours so something
like that I don't actually know but
basically you can take a look at the
full table of contents and some pages
and you know just open up a random page
and get some sample chapters that way
the other way you can do it I've got a
PDF sample linked on my site here that
you can you can also access and then you
can browse through that and get a feel
for what's inside the book you know
really I want to make sure you get a
sense for what the book is about and
what are not it will be helpful to you
and well another way for you to figure
out if this book is right for you is to
take a look at the reviews here so
they're a bunch of really awesome
reviews that I'm really really grateful
for so if you left a review thank you so
much that's really really cool and some
of them are really really in-depth so
yeah you know we recommend that you just
browse them most of them are actually
from people who bought the PDF version
for the early access digital digital
release so the content is exactly the
same you know the paperback is based on
that version it's it's
exactly identical actually it brings me
to the next question so the the digital
includes a bunch of bonus videos right
like some bonus content and some people
ask me hey is this included in the
paperback version yes it is absolutely
because I want to make sure you know
you're not getting you're not getting a
bad deal if you're getting the paperback
so the paperback includes exactly the
same content includes all of the bonus
content and be able to to download that
via a special link that is in the
paperback version and you can just go
there and then grab all of the content
and then you can watch it you know there
are a bunch of videos actually more than
two hours of videos included with the
with this book most of it is actually
based on previous YouTube tutorials that
I re-edited and kind of cut out all of
the promotional stuff so it can really
focus on on the content itself and in
some other bonuses and that's all
included with the paperback as well so
oh yeah what about a kindle version so
there is a kindle version available on
my website right now it's the mobi
pocket version that you can buy on my
store it's not available in Amazon yet
because I hit a snag there with
publishing it on Amazon it will be
available on Amazon if hopefully in a
few weeks I don't know how long it's
gonna take but it will be available in
Amazon and if you get the paperback
right now I will set up what is called a
Kindle Match deal so you can upgrade to
the the digital version the Kindle
version from the paperback and I'm not
sure how I'm you know what the pricing
options there will be but it'll probably
be like a dollar or $1.99 or something
like that you know where you can add the
the digital version to your paperback
purchase or let's say the digital Kindle
version of course if you want the PDF if
you want the ePub then you can get that
from my website on debate org alright is
this book worth looking at for beginners
um well the way this book is positioned
is or you know the who I wrote this book
for is that the idea there is that
your your past the absolute basics so
you have a good understanding of the
basics of Python you know the basics of
the syntax how do you run a Python
script how do you install the
interpreter and stuff like that so it's
not a from scratch Python tutorial but
instead it'll help you you know figure
out all the things that an intro
tutorial doesn't tell you you know have
some some hands-on tips on working with
package management and on working with
some ecosystem stuff that is related to
Python itself you know working with the
Python interpreter and some of the
advanced stuff you can do there and then
also some coding or actually like 90% of
the book is coding patterns you know how
can you use advanced features in Python
that are maybe not that easy to wrap
your head around in the beginning you
know things like generators decorators
iterators what's the difference between
a generator and an iterator how how can
you use these iterators and generators
in practice you know how how can you
actually use them so they're a helpful
tool for your day-to-day work and are
not just obfuscating your code how do
list comprehensions work set
comprehension dictionary comprehensions
and it's just covering a a wide variety
of these intermediate and advanced level
topics in Python that are usually not
not talked about you know in in a
beginning tutorial I'm also covering
some things start looking at the table
of contents here to make sure I don't
miss anything I'm covering some of the
common data structures in Python and how
the abstract data structures map to the
corresponding objects in the Python
standard library and in Python itself so
if you're preparing for a coding
interview this information is is golden
you know if you if you know how you know
many of the abstract data types like
stacks queues and all that stuff how
they map to Python how you can use them
inside Python that is going to be very
very important if you're trying to pass
a white board coding interview for
example and well there is also a chapter
on classes and olp object-oriented
programming
again shanks on my thoughts there is a
big chapter on using functions more
effectively you know how do decorators
work what they're what are they actually
good for what are lambda functions and
I'm also touching on some of the the
functional programming topics there so
for example what does it mean that
pythons function functions are first
class you know that that everything is
an object in Python including functions
what can you do with that and how is
that useful and how does it actually
apply to your day to day coding so
really the goal with this book is to
give you some actionable I call them
tricks which is maybe not really the
right word because it sounds like
something weird that you would do with
Python this is actually a quote from
from one of the Amazon reviewers but but
really what it's about it's you know the
practical hands-on things that you need
to know if you want to write developer
style Python if you want to take your
Python to the next level and all of this
is based on practical experience and you
know years of writing Python and arguing
about the stuff with people online and
arguing about with my co-workers and you
know giving presentations and talking
about the stuff teaching other people
how to program in Python and it's not
just stuff that I'm making up so yeah
check out the book if this sounds
appealing and if you're a complete
beginner well absolutely you know check
out the the sample chapters just browse
around and see if you can make sense of
it you know that this book is written
from like in a very conversational style
and actually I was on the podcast a
while ago where I talked more about kind
of the philosophy behind the book and in
the making off this book then I'm gonna
put that in the description so if you
want if you want the full background
story and check out check out the
podcast anyway and you know I think
because of that it is not like a dry
technical technical manual so if you if
you're willing to learn you're let's say
you're complete or like you know more
towards the beginning stage of learning
Python but you're you're really eager to
learn I think you can you can work with
this book you know at the very least
you're going to
you're gonna figure out what you don't
know yet and then you're gonna be able
to go and kind of read up on the missing
parts and then make progress that way
you know so in a way I think it's also a
good road map on how to go from beginner
and Python to intermediate level and
beyond that
Sall so yeah that sounds appealing check
out the book get the print copy on
Amazon did you do okay what do we got
here talked about Kindle talked about
the bonus content oh yeah so a bunch of
people reached out to me and said that
the Amazon link that I shared it
actually for a force and the problem
there is that the book isn't available
yet on all of the Amazon
country-specific stores so it is
available right now on amazon.com amazon
canada amazon co UK Amazon Germany
France Italy in Spain and it the way I
understand it it should actually also
come out in Amazon India Amazon China
Amazon Brazil Amazon Mexico Amazon
Netherlands and Amazon Australia like
basically all of the country specific
stores not a problem with Amazon is that
it's kind of opaque you know I was under
the assumption that well is which just
magically happen because I'm actually
printing the book through Amazon as well
and I was under the impression that it
would just magically appear in all of
the stores the problem is there's kind
of a two-tier system to these stores you
know you have or actually three-tier
system so you have the amazon.com store
that includes the Amazon Canada store
and they're kind of you know they get
the book shows up they're the quickest
then you have the European stores
somehow excluding the Netherlands store
which I don't really understand why but
that's lagging behind a little bit that
get the book next and then you have the
extended distribution channels which
includes amazon china amazon india and
and all of these stores and it takes a
little longer for the book to reach
these other publishing channels so the
well what I heard from Amazon is that it
can take up to eight weeks for the
paperback to be available in these
extended distribution stores which which
is not great
fortunately there isn't really anything
I can do about that you know I really
had to move forward with the launch
because you gotta act quick you know
when the book is available you kind of
want to give it the most momentum and so
that that's what I'm doing right now you
know that's that's why I'm promoting the
book right now and the way I understand
it it is gonna go it's gonna be
available on the Indian and the
Brazilian stores and you know all of the
other ones and it's just gonna take a
little bit longer I'll see if I can you
know figure out some kind of a deal
there as well the pricing is kind of
Paykan Amazon as well you don't really
know actually what your book will be
priced at so for example right now
they're actually discounting it below
the target price that I set well it's
Amazon anyway I'm still grateful for
them you know it's it's awesome to get
the visibility through their store if
you if you if your book ranks so not
complaining here oh yeah
so the next best thing I can offer you
at the moment if you if you can't get
the paperback you can get the digital
version on my website I've got a link
here and you can kind of click through
here and you know read more about the
book learn more about the book and then
get a digital copy that includes a PDF
and epub version that you can read on
your tablet and you know computer
anywhere else all right
so oh yeah how can I get the launch
price because the discount doesn't seem
to do anything so again the way I set
this up I just priced the book lower
this week on Amazon and then actually
tonight I'll just raise the price so I
don't know how long it's gonna take to
to go into effect everything seems to
take around like 24 or 24 to 48 hours so
I'm just gonna trigger that today and
then the book price gonna go up to 29 29
US Dollars and so yeah so if you want to
take advantage off the 33 percent launch
discount then get the book right now
just get the paperback right now on
Amazon and you can take advantage off
the discount so it's not a discount it's
specifically called out because that
doesn't work that way with Amazon but
it's just a lower price and you know in
a few hours it will be more than a third
higher right we'll be you know more than
30% higher so so that's how it works all
right well I think I covered everything
if you have a question that I haven't
covered and then just tweet at me email
or leave a youtube comment and I'll I'll
do my best to help you out like I said
kind of backed up with emails and stuff
at the moment but I'm working hard to
get that resolved all right so if you
bought a copy thank you so much if you
haven't gotten your coffee yet get it
now before the price goes up and a happy
