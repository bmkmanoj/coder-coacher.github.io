from a reader the other day that I felt
like it would be the easiest to actually
answer it in a quick video so Michael
writes that another question is there a
Python plugin for sublime 2 or 3 that
shows your syntax completion or errors
and to this I would say they're actually
potentially multiple plugins that you
want to install they're going to help
you with checking your syntax and that
are going to help you give a dog a
complete - sublime text if you're
writing Python right so let's talk about
the the error checking or the syntax
checking first so what I would recommend
here is that you would actually install
something that's called a linter or code
linter which is a little program that's
going to check your Python code for
errors common mistakes syntax errors
misspellings also stuff like correct
formatting you know are you using the
right intonation are you using
consistent indentation are your
variables named in a certain way that is
sort of commonly accepted in the Python
community and there's one option or
there's actually two options for the
linter itself and then you want to pick
a plugin for sublime text that's
actually going to go out and run the
linter on your code and then parse out
the error messages from that linter and
display them in line with your code so
let's talk about the actual linters
first there's actually two um products
are free that i would recommend the
first one is called flake eight which is
yeah it's it's a code linter for python
and it's actually combination of two
tools that are called flake or pie pie
flakes I believe and pep eight which is
sort of a formatting checker so just use
flake eight it's probably going to do
95% of what you want and you don't have
to spend a lot of time tweaking it and
setting it up so I highly recommend
flake eight the other option for a
linter you
is it's called pile inter or a pile
Ansari pilant it's a really great tool
it's a pretty comprehensive solution so
you might wanna spend some time to
actually tweak it to to make sure it
suits your needs
so it's certainly easier to start using
flake eight rather than starting out
using pile inter right away and I've you
know these days I'm using flake eight
primarily because I feel like it does
pretty much all I need and I just don't
want to bother with setting up pilant
anymore so once you decide it on the
actual inter program that you want to
use the actual code linter you're gonna
want to get your error messages into
your sublime text editor so that as
you're typing out the code or opening a
file it's just going to call you out on
the little mistakes that you know that
cropped in that crept in or just things
are going wrong with your code so there
is actually a great plugin that would
recommend it's called sublime linter
which is sort of a umbrella thing that
supports various linters through other
plugins so you're only going to have to
deal with sublime linter and then you
can install plug-ins for sublime linter
that then actually going to go and like
lint your java code lend your Python
code lint your ZC code and so on and so
on so it's pretty flexible and the best
tool that I've found so far so you want
to get sublime linter and the the flake
eight plugin for sublime linter and then
also flake eight so this is a bit or it
can be a bit challenging bit finicky to
setup so I plan to write more on this or
maybe actually do sort of a quick video
tutorial on how you're going to set this
up but it's so worth it like once you
have this set up it's actually awesome
once it works it is just really really
great and it's really made my life as a
Python programmer a lot easier so let's
move on to the other part of the
question which was um yeah is there
anything that
gives you autocomplete or syntax
completion so there there are options
for that to do that within sublime text
however I'm not a big fan of them I'm
probably one that I could recommend the
most it's called I believe it's called
sublime code Intel and that seemed to be
a good choice back in the day when I
tried it but I actually stopped using it
all together and these days I just hum
flat-out don't use autocomplete anymore
um which you know I have discussions
about this with coworkers who are
generally big fans of PyCharm and
PyCharm is really good at this
autocomplete stuff it's not perfect I
think with Python in general you're
never going to get to a place where you
know you're gonna get Java level
autocomplete in your tooling it's just
not going to happen because of the way
how the language is structured and how
it's so you know not because of how
typing works in Python it is really
difficult for tools to actually come up
with Auto compilations that make sense
so one of the things that really
irritated me was that you know I would
get these inaccurate auto completions
where I felt like I could just do a
better job if I wouldn't get distracted
by these incorrect autocompletes and and
actually just not have them and work
without them and many experienced
developers that I know they don't use
autocomplete at all right sort of many
of them I felt like or many people in
the Python community seem to move more
towards simpler tooling um and
personally I definitely noticed that as
well you know in my setup we're sort of
I've reduced the number of plugins that
are run in my sublime text because I
feel like for the tools that I use I
want them to be really good and I want
to get a lot of value out of them and
I'm not going to use something that is
you know working only 50% of the time so
your mileage might totally vary with
this stuff
I would still you know recommend you
give it a shot but you know also know
that it's solely okay to turn it off and
just not bother with it if it becomes a
distraction I've heard good things about
Visual Studio code as well and it's
autocomplete might want to give that a
shot as well however you want to stay
within sublime text probably check out
sublime code Intel and see how that
works for you
yeah that I think that's all I have to
say about this topic but you know I love
talking about this stuff so feel free to
drop me an email you're going to be able
to find it in the subscription the
description of that video and you can
just link through to there click through
to my blog and then just shoot me an
email or hit me on Twitter and I'm going
to do another video about your question
cool talk to you soon bye now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
