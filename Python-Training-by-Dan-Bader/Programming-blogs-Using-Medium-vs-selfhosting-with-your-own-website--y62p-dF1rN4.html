question for you today and it came from
Murat on Twitter so Murat asks would
writing articles on medium cover such a
portfolio would you recommend having
your own website and what he's referring
to there - there is if you're trying to
build up a developer portfolio by
writing blog articles writing tutorials
that you publish on the internet kind of
build up your expertise and demonstrate
your knowledge should you do that on a
platform like medium that's just a
blogging platform where anyone can sign
up or should you do that on your own
website
and I've written a blog article about
this topic in the past but I don't think
I've ever done a video on this so my
thoughts here are I personally would
absolutely go self-hosted you know put
up your own website there and post your
articles to that in the first place like
this should be sort of where your
articles go and I would maybe republish
them at a later point in time - sites
like medium or LinkedIn but it would
absolutely make your personal portfolio
that you're hosting on your own website
I would make that the number one channel
the number one outlet where you're
sharing your stuff and the main reason
is that I just don't trust sites like
medium tumblr or well I guess LinkedIn
if you're running your blog there I
don't trust them to be around as
blogging platforms for the next 5 or 10
years right and if you're serious about
building this kind of portfolio and
building up this kind of expertise I
would not rely on another third party I
mean technically you're always relying
on some kind of third party for your
hosting and whatnot but if you have
control over your own content that is
invaluable and I had an experience like
that where I was always doing my my
blogging and my tutorial writing on my
own website kind of completely self
hosting that since 2012 and my
experience has been that if you do that
it opens up so many more opportunities
and so many more possibilities for
now I'm selling Python training courses
through my website if I had blogged or
written tutorials and put them on medium
I couldn't really do that sure you can
put a link in there but you can't really
you don't really have the kind of
flexibility that you have with your own
website right where you can you know you
can offer additional things and ask for
people's email addresses and give away
free stuff and kind of make it a make a
like little sidebar ads for your own
stuff essentially and you can't really
do that with medium because you're 100
percent under the control off the medium
platform in any kind of search engine
rank that you build up well guess what
that points to medium com it doesn't
point to your own website and I think
that is the biggest downside of hosting
your stuff on any of these other
platforms so if you're trying to build a
developer portfolio and you're trying to
to kind of get your name out there and
show and demonstrate your expertise I
would absolutely go the self-hosted
route you know get a domain something
like your own name you know first name
last name com or something like that
that is very generic that's always gonna
be a viable option for you to use moving
forward and then just start putting your
stuff there it's very easy to do that
these days you know you can just start
out with something like Squarespace
which is a hosted blogging platform and
you can you can use you could also just
use WordPress they also have hosted
options or you could host it yourself if
you can do that or you can do what I did
and just write your blogging platform
from scratch and it could be a cool
exercise something that you can do in
Python and something that can teach you
a lot of other skills like web
development skills and it would also
give you something to blog about on your
site right just an idea so yeah don't
put your stuff a medium honestly I don't
trust them I don't think they will be
around in ten years and you will lose
all of your content and this is really a
long-term game and I think you should
always self publish and self host your
stuff if you're doing any kind of
developer portfolio now if you're
talking about code I would put it on
github it's kind of the same liability
there you know honestly they might
disappear as well but I feel like with
code it's it's a little
easier to migrated and you're not that
reliant on the search engine rank and
kind of you know having to show up in in
search engines so just a couple of
thoughts on that yeah I hope this was
helpful let me know if you have another
question that anything about your career
as a software development developing or
how to learn Python how to get better at
Python I really enjoy talking about this
stuff and I'd love to answer your
question in a future video so just leave
a comment below and I'll try and tackle
a question in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
