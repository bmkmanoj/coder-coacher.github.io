want to talk about implicit return
statements in Python Python
automatically adds implicit return
statements to the end of any function
that you write
so therefore if a function does not
specify return value it will return none
by default and I know this can be a
little bit confusing so with this video
tutorial you're gonna learn exactly how
these implicit return statements work
and how you can use them to your
advantage and then of course also how
are you gonna be able to see how they
work in other people's code which is
really important for understanding the
Python code that's out there okay so
let's start with a simple example I've
got this dummy function here and it just
contains a simple if statement here and
we can see here in the last line it
actually returns none and now with the
implicit returns feature in Python you
can simplify this function so let me
show you a new version off this function
that will be exactly equivalent so it
would lead to the same output but it
doesn't actually return none here it's
just a bear return statement and a bear
return statement in Python implies that
none will be returned you might use that
in some cases to simplify your code a
little bit could also be confusing is if
someone doesn't know about this feature
so it's always something to keep in mind
now because the return statement is
implicit that means you can actually
leave it out completely so that's what
I'm doing here in this foo 3 function in
this case I'm leaving out the return
statement in the else part of that if
statement and this will lead to exactly
the same result so all these functions
are exactly equivalent they have the
exact same return values but you can see
here that this last option is quite a
bit shorter and easier to read than the
first one but just to confirm that they
actually all have the same output let's
actually run them so what I'm gonna do
here is I'm gonna go through each of
those functions and I'm call I'm gonna
call them with an argument of false
which is going to trigger the else
branch in the the central if statement
here and we should we should expect to
always get a none return value here so
stride with the fool one function just
kind of the unchanged version of that
function the original version of that
function so alright so this returned
none now let's try it with the bear
return statement that would also imply
return none and again this returns none
as well and now let's try it with the
third function or foo 3 function here
that doesn't include the else branch
altogether it only has the kind of the
truthy branch here and there's no return
statement whatsoever so once I run this
you can see here it also returns none
and if I pass a truthy argument you can
see here that it correctly returns the
actual value so you know if I pass
something else it'll just bounce that
back to me and yeah I guess this is
proof that this really works and I'm not
just making this stuff up now of course
the question that remains is when should
you actually use this when is it a good
idea to use this feature in your own
Python code so my rule of thumb is if a
function does not have a return value so
in other languages that would be called
a procedure then I always leave out the
return statement so I don't add empty
return statements if I don't have any
sensible value to return right so for
example if I wrote something like the
built-in print function that would only
ever be called for its side-effects
would never return anything then I
wouldn't put a return statement there it
just wouldn't make any sense in my mind
if you're following that principle the
only time you need to decide whether or
not to use a implicit return nun
statement is when a function actually
has a return value that makes sense from
a logical perspective right so the print
function we're only calling it for its
side-effects but the sum function for
example we want to call that because we
expect some kind of return value with a
function like that where it would
logically make sense for it to return
none I think that's where we need to
discuss whether or not you should use an
implicit or an explicit return on
statement I think on the one hand you
could say that well if you leave out the
return on statement it makes the code
more concise and therefore easier to
read and understand and maybe you could
say makes it prettier on the other hand
this feature
might really surprise some programmers
and it they might not know that Python
behaves that way when it comes to
writing clean and maintainable code then
using the surprising behavior is usually
not the best way to go about it so for
example the book that I'm working on I
had a couple of code examples there or I
think I had one code example there that
was using an implicit return none
statement and so I started getting these
regular emails where people mentioned
that hey then you're missing a return
statement here and I have this almost
like this you know template saved the
way that would that I would send people
as a reply was like hey you know what
Python actually does these implicit
return statements and that's totally ok
but I can see why it's confusing and so
my thinking there has shifted a bit
where I'm thinking you know in this case
and the book I actually changed it
because the point of that code example
wasn't about the missing return
statement or being concise but it was
more about something else entirely and
being very clear and making the the
example very easy to understand so in
this case I think it made sense to bring
back the explicit return statement I
mean don't get me wrong right I love
writing clean and beautiful code as much
as anyone else and I used to feel really
strongly that programmers should really
know the ins and outs of the language
they're working with but also you got to
be you got to be realistic about this
stuff right so when you consider the
maintenance impact of even a simple
misunderstanding where it's you know
you're working in a in a bigger team and
there's this back and forth on oh hey
are missing a return statement here
no I guess there's this like rule in
Python that you can leave it out and
then you know someone is asking about
that in chat or maybe someone is tapping
on the shoulder so that caused an
interruption and it just you know it's
it's like the butterfly effect where you
have this little thing and it just kind
of spirals out of control it has a much
larger impact than you would have
thought it would have initially and so I
think when you consider the maintenance
impact of stuff like that
then I would be leaning more towards
making the code explicit and very clear
so I'm not gonna make a definite
recommendation here right or like a
definitive recommendation we're gonna
say hey you always have to use this
feature you you should never use this
feature but it
always depends so honestly it really
depends on the circumstances but
personally I try to keep in mind that
code is communication and it is meant
for primarily for humans not for
computers otherwise we would all be
writing sort of some kind of binary you
know bytecode assembler language there's
something like that or I wouldn't be
writing Python so I always try to err on
the side of being more explicit so that
people have an easier time understanding
and maintaining my code so you know that
might not be your philosophy but I think
it it really helps in making it easier
to work with other people and also
making your programs more maintainable
in the long run all right I know I'm
kind of leaving you alone here making
this decision but but try it out be
aware that this exists and implicit
returned values are a thing in Python
they're gonna come in handy and they're
you're going to encounter them but also
balance it with the need for being clear
and writing maintainable code and
actually if your philosophy when it
comes to writing clean code aligns with
mine and what I just described then
check out my book because there are many
more examples just like the one I just
discussed and I'm always trying to
approach it from the angle that I just
explained you know where I believe that
code is communication it's written for
humans primarily we've got to make sure
that we're writing explicit and clear
code so if this is something that you're
interested in learning or interested in
you know improving your skills in that
and kind of picking up that mindset then
check out my book Python tricks I think
you're gonna enjoy it
alright thanks so much for listening and
happy Python II</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
