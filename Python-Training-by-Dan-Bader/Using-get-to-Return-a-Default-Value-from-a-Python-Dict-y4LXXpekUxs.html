Python tip so many of you are probably
familiar with pythons dictionaries and I
want to show you a quick tip today where
we talk about the get method that's
available on any Python dictionary and
its default argument because in a lot of
situations especially if you're dealing
with text processing can be really
helpful so I tried coming up with a
simple example to show how how you can
use the get method and I came up with
this example where we have a dictionary
that's called name for user ID where it
basically maps from a integer user ID to
the user's name right and you can
imagine this comes from a database or
whatever like it's it's it could be a
real data structure that you have
somewhere in your script or your Python
application and so now what we want to
do is we want to write a function that
we're gonna call greeting that just
takes a user ID and what we want that
function to do is to return a greeting
for that user and probably the simplest
way we could think of implementing that
which is be you know some kind of format
string where we say hi and then
substitute the user's name
and we just go name for user ID and look
up the name based on the user ID right
so if we do this and let's just actually
define that and then play with it for a
bit
and we pass in a valid user ID to work
fine
however if we're passing in an invalid
ID this is going to blow up so now it
would be really interesting or really
good for us for that function to
actually return something useful if the
user ID is not available and so you
might think you know the first thing we
could do here is pull we're just going
to check if the user ID is actually in
the dictionary so it should say okay if
user ID in name for user ID then we're
going to return
we have
and if not
we're just going to return
kind of sensible default right okay so
now we still get the same behavior if I
put in a valid user ID I get my high
Ellis I put in an invalid user ID I get
my hi there which it's kind of what I
want okay so so this would work so now
the challenge with this implementation
that we have is that it could be a
little bit more pretty so the first
thing is that it's it's kind of not good
style to do a membership chick here so a
little bit more pythonic option would be
to actually just try and grab the the
name for the user ID and if it fails we
would erase an exception or kind of
catch it would race and exception itself
we would catch the exception and it just
returned to default so a better
implementation could look like this
where we would have this triblock and we
just say okay just try to do this
and if we get a key error
we'll just return hi there
and now
this works the way we expect it to work
but this could still be a little bit
shorter
okay so there's actually a better way we
can do this because most of this is
actually built into Python because it's
such a common thing so I hinted at this
in the beginning every dictionary in
Python has a get method on it and you
can see the the doc string forget here
and the way it works is that you can
pass a key to it you know it's it's so
instead of doing instead of doing this
where the key would be the key would be
the user ID we can use the get method
and pass the same key and we get the
same result okay so that seems pretty
useless right like why not use the
shorthand square bracket syntax for that
so now the cool thing is that you can
pass a default that will get returned if
if the key could not be found right so
what we can do now is we can specify a
default let's say there
and then if the idea is found we get the
value for that key but if we pass in an
invalid ID or you know when I would
trigger a key error we get the default
so with that get method it becomes a lot
easier to define our greeting greeting
method we could just say okay return
hi and then we do the string
substitution whoops
we'll do the string substitution and
then we're just going to say name for
user ID get
passing the ID and we're going to make
the default there
right now when we run greeting we pass a
valid ID it works as expected
when we pass an invalid ID we get our
expected result and so now this is
really short makes it uses just a
standard Python feature we don't have to
deal with either doing a membership
check or actually writing out that
exception block so it's really nice and
clean
everyone's gonna understand it because
it's a standard Python standard library
feature and for that reason I think this
is probably the best implementation for
this little example cool I hope you
enjoyed that and if you want more and
