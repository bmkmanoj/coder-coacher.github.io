to give you a quick demonstration of how
you can use sublime text as your get
editor what that means is whenever you
make a commit and get from the command
line using the git command what will
happen is that sublime text is going to
pop up and you can actually edit your
commit message within sublime text which
I found a lot more convenient because
sublime text is really the editor that I
use the most that I'm the most
comfortable with so naturally I wanted
to use it for my git workflow as well
and I'm going to show you real quick how
that all works so what I'm going to do
now is just jump into my shell here and
create a new git repository just an
empty kid repository and then we also
want to create some file txt and maybe
add some content into that file alright
so now we've got some file txt and I'm
going to add that file to get now I've
got a new file some file txt and now the
interesting bit here is that I'm going
to configure get to use sublime text as
my editor and the way you do that is by
exporting a new shell variable that is
get underscore editor and we set it to
the subl command that will start or
launch sublime text and make it the
focused window and we'll tell it to wait
before it returns because that's
necessary in the way the the git command
wants to use the editor and it will also
tell it to create a new window because I
found that's a little bit more
convenient than just it opening a new
tab so I'm going to run this which will
create that new variable and get is
going to reference that variable and
then
use sublime text as its editor so when I
go and create a new commit now it is
going to launch sublime text so as I hit
return sublime text pops up and we're in
this temporary file here that skit
sublime slash dot git commit edit
message that's just a temporary file
where our commit message is going to go
into and then we can just say um hi
there this is the initial commit right
and it's going to ignore all of the
commented out stuff here it's basically
just going to take the first line and
because of the way I've got my gutter
set up here it also tells me how much
space I have left for a well formatted
and well styled kid message so anyway
I'm going to hit save here and then just
close that window by hitting command W
or we could also click the X button here
so what's happened now is that get get
notice that the subl command exited now
and it created the commit just like we
wanted so when I pull up git log I can
actually see that commit here and we can
see that my text is in here as well just
like I wanted just maybe a quick
reminder you probably want to put this
export command into your shell profile
so that you don't have to enter it every
single time and you want to make sure
that your subl command is actually
configured correctly right so you got to
make sure that sub will command exists
and that's something that comes with
sublime text but it's also something you
need to configure or basically link up
in your path and then you want to export
that get editor variable
alright that's all there is to it I hope
that helped you out and talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
