developer this is a great question it's
a very very important question and in
this video I want to give you some of my
thoughts on the topic first of all I
totally believe in that staying up to
date as a Python developer or as any
kind of other developer for that matter
as a software developer in general
staying up to date is one of the most
important things you can do for your
career and one of the things that you
absolutely have to do for your career
because the field is moving so fast and
it is very very important that you're
aware of what's happening in the field
what's happening within your
specialization and this is gonna be very
very helpful in maintaining your higher
ability and your chance to get a job if
you're looking for a new position or
your chance to get new contracting work
if you're working as a contractor or as
a freelancer so very very important
thing to do now what is the best way to
stay up to date as a Python developer
specifically I think there are a couple
of strategies you can use one is just to
read about Python write like you should
make it a habit to stay in touch with
Python news and whether you do that
through for example my youtube channel
or other people's YouTube channel or if
you're following a couple of Python
newsletters or if you're going out and
reading a couple of blogs this is a
great way just to stay in touch with
what's happening in the world of Python
another strategy that you can use is to
go and attend Python conferences around
the world so if you go to PyCon org you
can see a list of PyCon conference's
hosted around the world and you just
want to pick one that is reasonably
close to you and make a point of
attending that conference every year or
every other year and this is going to do
two great things for you number one
you're gonna be able to attend the talks
there and just learn about what's going
on you know just sit there and take part
in the keynote listen to the keynote
listen to some of the talks that really
interest you and you're gonna get a good
feel of what the big movements are in
the Python community especially if
you're doing that for a couple of years
you're just gonna be
to ative li aware of what's happening
there and you can learn about this stuff
and this is going to put you ahead of
most other people in the space because
they don't want to do that and they
don't want to stay up-to-date with the
latest developments and I feel like
going to a pikin conference is a great
way to be in touch with the bigger
movements in the community now the other
thing this is going to do is that it's
gonna help you build your connection
with the community you know you're
essentially gonna make friends in the
community and that's going to be a great
way just to be in touch with what's
happening what other people are working
on and just to make sure you're not
missing out on anything if you can't
attend a local conference another
possibility would be to join an online
community of Python developers for
example I run something called
pythonista cafe it's a forum where
Python developers and those who want to
become Python developers meet and we
exchange ideas share our code review
each other's code and this could be
another way for you to get in touch with
your Python over the global Python
community rather than you know attending
these conferences in person which can be
unfortunately can be a little bit
expensive but it's totally worth it
alright another strategy right so these
are some strategies that you can use if
you spread it out over time this is not
gonna take up very much of your time
it's gonna be a lot of fun it's gonna be
very engaging and you're gonna get a lot
out of this both personally and
career-wise I totally believe that and
it's worked really well for me so maybe
I'll see you as one of the next PyCon
conferences or some other conference in
the future all right take care and happy
