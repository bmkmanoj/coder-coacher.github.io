code review unplugged episode and today
I'm going to look at some code that Carl
has sent me so this is actually a really
cool project because it's um yeah it is
a security a tutorial for fixing and I
well identifying and fixing security
vulnerabilities in a tiny flask web app
and I like this it's not a lot of code
so you know should be relatively easy
for for people to go through this but I
kind of like you know the short and
sweet description here and I like the
fact that that it's trying to teach
people something with code and actually
making them do something so I think this
would be great for a little workshop or
I don't really know where it is where
this comes from if this if Carl you know
if you were doing this at at a company
or some kind of public workshop but I
really like the idea and it should
definitely keep going like I think it's
a really really cool way to teach people
so yeah so all I did so far was pull
this up in github and then also just
clone the repo locally let's also open
that up in sublime text
maybe crank down the font size a bit and
yeah cool so so what I really like here
is that the readme is pretty extensive
and you know just kind of contains all
you need I am not a hundred percent
clear what version of Python we're
dealing with like just looking at the
requirements txt file it's great that we
have a requirements txt file by the way
this is using the flask module and a
bunch of other stuff and it looks like
we're supposed to just install this
globally so with this like I typically I
wouldn't recommend installing these
things globally unless it's like a tool
like a lint or something you need all
the time so usually I would not install
new Python libraries modules
with pseudo pip install like what I
would do
I'm just going to assume this is Python
3 and we'll see what happens like I
would create a new virtual environment
with the PI vnf command and then I'm
going to activate that this other
command and I actually have a shortcut
here in my shell setup so I can just do
de to deactivate a vnf in AE to activate
one maybe should crank up the font size
a bit too so I was just saying like I
can do de then AE to activate and
deactivate these VMs and like a virtual
end is essentially a local copy of your
Python environment so that when you
install new modules they don't gum up
your global Python install but they're
localized to just this folder so like we
can look into this with LS and you know
you can see that here we actually have a
tiny well almost like a tiny Python
install here right like with a bin
folder and a library folder and all of
that so look into Python virtual ends
and then if because this is a tutorial
for for newbies like I would potentially
consider you know teaching them about
virtual ends because in the long run
they're probably not going to be happy
installing these requirements into their
global Python install so I'm going to do
here um just install the requirements
great that you have in a requirements
file here always always great because it
just makes setting up this stuff a lot
easier and you've pinned your
requirements to to fix versions that's
great too
ok so now I guess I'm yeah probably not
going to play through the whole tutorial
but I want to make sure I can run the
tests and kind of also maybe spin up the
app so it can make sure it's running
okay so let's go Python app not pi
okay cool looks like it's running nice I
like the green
sweet soups work
Strahm OG works - excellent no unicode
errors no I'm cool so it looks like this
is running let's try let's try and make
sure we get the test running as well so
that's usually what I try to do with in
with a new project just to make sure I
can run the tests as well so okay so it
looks like there's no instructions on
how to run the tests so maybe with the
way we can figure that out is we'll just
look at the tests and then yeah we can
see it's a script file or it it does
dislike imports unit tests and just
cause unit tests main so it looks like
we can just run this like a regular
Python script and in tests pass cool so
it looks like we've got this running so
why don't we take a look at the code now
and I'm going to do this in sublime
texts I think it's going to be a better
environment to do that in okay like I
said the requirements look good let's
look at app dot pi okay so this is like
a tiny flask app
yeah we have got this global posts here
I mean I think for an example like that
that's totally fine that we're not doing
any kind of persistence so I'm not going
to focus on that okay so maybe the first
thing that actually catches my eye is
that these comments here
they could be docstrings so just to show
you what a doc string is it's like when
you do these three like typically the
convention would be it could be any old
string as long as like the first thing
that happens in your in your function
but like typically you would format them
like this and then this would be the doc
string and the cool thing about dark
strings is that they're treated a little
bit special by the Python Python parser
or the Python runtime because these doc
strings are actually accessible you know
through from from within the program and
that means there are a lot of tools
around that allow you to generate
documentation based on these stock
strings and so it's just like good
practice to you know not have these kind
of inline comments for dark strings just
kind of use proper doc strings just
because I'm seeing that here everywhere
like you're really just describing the
function I think that's that's great and
that's the right way to go about it but
you probably want to put that
information into a dark string and not
just into a an inline comment so that's
probably what I would change I'm here
with the output I mean I think I think
that's fine too because you just you
know you want to do this like minimum
minimal example here obviously like for
a larger app or whatever like this would
be loaded from from some kind of
template file and probably be handled
through a proper templating system also
to avoid stuff like this where we're
just concatenate and I know you know
this is part of the the challenge here's
I don't want to spoil app for people but
like you know you could really easily
like inject all kinds of stuff like
inject
script tack or do something else like
that and there's no like validation for
that but that's part of the the game
like it's part of the whole tutorial
right so that's I really like that well
done yeah in terms of you know how
you're formatting this small app like I
think it looks good like it's it's nice
to read it's like formative consistently
honestly the only thing I really saw was
the the dark strings here um so yeah I
can't really complain about that and
then for the unit tests I think this
works well too you know again like in
terms of the the formatting like maybe
one tiny thing like I'm seeing that
you've switched your quote types you
know you're using double quotes down
here and in single quotes there but
that's something that that personally
like I I would I would change that for
consistency but I mean in the grand
scheme of things it's not a big deal and
what like one way you can you can deal
with that is just by having syntax
highlighting that actually highlights
them differently I mean if you wanna if
you want to go for consistency right
then then you would need that if you
don't want to then it doesn't really
matter but anyway okay so probably
change that in terms of how the tests or
what the tests look like I think that
makes sense to based on what you're
doing I don't think it makes sense to
pull in like you know something like web
test which is like a bigger framework
for testing these kinds of web apps
which you know it really helps when
you're working on a larger project but
like for what you're doing with this
tutorial I think it is great that you're
keeping the dependencies simple and just
kind of focused on well basically flask
right so actually with this stuff what I
would probably do here in terms of the
dependencies I would probably just put
in flask as a dependency and then it's
not really necessary to like spec out
all these other ones
because then it becomes really clear
what the real dependencies are because
all of this other stuff is presumably
getting pulled in by flask like Jinja
that's the templating thing and all that
stuff and works like it's like the
underlying libraries that flask is built
on top off but on the other hand if you
do you you know if you do like a pip
freeze then
then that's like the classical way to
freeze your dependency so you know
because this is a tutorial I I might
think about like just having flasks
there so that people who are looking at
it they can realize like oh you know all
we're really using here is flask which I
might be like a valuable well I want to
say lesson but like a valuable piece of
information for people but like honestly
like you know this is super nitpicky
what I'm what I'm saying there yeah I
got some CSS there
yeah it's pretty self-contained I mean
arguably we could also serve the CSS in
line here but yeah that doesn't that
doesn't really matter matter we've got a
good ignore which i think is great
it's gonna you know it's going to make
sure that people who submit pull
requests and stuff for for your your app
here are not gonna hopefully not going
to commit like all kinds of crazy files
that you didn't have to sort out yeah I
think this is pretty cool like honestly
like there's not a lot of stuff I could
I could find here and I really liked the
tutorial so anyone who's watching this
like try and play through the door
tutorial I think it'll probably teach
you some some valuable things about
avoiding some of these vulnerabilities
like I'm hoping there's some kind of
solution sheep for that I think would be
great if that was there because I really
liked the idea behind this tutorial and
yeah like I think we're we're ready to
wrap this up please write a longer blog
post about the tutorial I think it's a
really good idea cool thanks Carl and
good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
