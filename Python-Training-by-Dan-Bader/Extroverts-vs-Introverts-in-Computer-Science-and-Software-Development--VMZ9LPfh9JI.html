right now and I got this question from
Chuck Jagjit jagat oh man I'm so sorry
about mispronouncing your name but
essentially this is about introversion
versus extraversion as a software
developer or software engineer and how
how this is gonna affect you in your
computer science education so just want
to read out the question so you know
what the context is and then share some
of my thoughts okay so Jake Jake jeet
Jay says hmm
I kind of have an unusual question that
is pretty unrelated to this oh this is
for a MacBook Pro review video that I
did a while ago but it is related to
software development I am currently a
freshman computer science student about
to start in August and I was wondering
whether a primarily extroverted person
although I can be introverted sometimes
like myself would fit in well in an in a
software engineering role also do you
sometimes feel that the work is mundane
even even if one were to work at top
companies like Google Amazon etc I
personally love the challenge of coding
but these are just two of the fears that
I have I would appreciate a response of
any sort so okay so actually it looks
like this there's two questions in here
but I just wanted to address some of
some of this stuff so the question about
introversion versus extraversion and
whether or not you know you're gonna
feel comfortable in a computer science
education context going to scale to
college for for forgetting a computer
science degree so well okay so a couple
of thoughts here I am actually wondering
if introversion and extraversion you
know really like they're okay so I was
about to say whether or not they really
exist but that that's really not what I
meant is more about like what you know
what is the exact definition of that I
would say that in my past I have been
you know when I grew up I was an
extremely introverted person I was
you know actually I would just say at
some point I just got scared off off
social interaction in some way and she
just became very very shy and you know
at when I was maybe like 17 or 18 I was
a really big problem for me so I worked
on overcoming that and and actually for
a while I felt I was kind of going the
other the opposite direction and all of
a sudden felt very very extroverted in
that sense you know almost like
completely flipped flipped out around
and I feel like now I'm just more
comfortable with with who I am or sort
of how I'm wired that way and I'm
probably somewhere in the middle or like
going back between between the two you
know I al I have no problem like going
to a conference and just chatting up
strangers there and and you know making
new friends there but at the same time
you know I'm I'm actually super happy
just sitting down on the couch and
reading a book for a couple hours and
that can be absolute like bliss right so
um so it's kind of hard to really to
really like narrow down this concept and
I'm sure there maybe there's some
scientific definition of this actually a
really good book that I would recommend
that you read if you're thinking about
these things is it's called quiet by
Susan Cain that was recommended to me by
a co-worker and I had a good time
reading this book like I think she's
really she's she's she just talked about
some things that that I saw myself I saw
in others and just got like a better
understanding of you know what
introversion versus extraversion is
about and how how these concepts are are
commonly understood now you know to your
question because I feel like I you know
it was talking about sort of my
experience because just I wanted to
share some background so that you know
that I can I can actually speak to this
so well I would say that for for
computer science education a lot of
times you know people will self-select
it's self-select and maybe they're more
under the introversion end of the
spectrum right where they can be happy
sitting down in front of a couple of
books or spending like five hours in
front of a computer screen and typing
typing in code and building something
cool and they can get a kick out of that
and maybe they they don't need a lot a
lot of social interaction to do that and
some people are just on the other hand
and they absolutely can't do that and
maybe they're gonna self-select and go
for another job or another environment
where you know there's less quiet time
and there's less focused time and
there's there's just more just more
constant social interaction on the other
hand I would say that the myth of the
you know the the kind of like sit in
your cave you know it's it in your dim
cave sit in your dim cave kind of hacker
that's just you know coding stuff on his
own all the time and like this genius
that's sort of recluse and and in doing
amazing stuff that's not how house
offered about development actually is
done you know you gotta be able to work
with the team a lot of it is about about
communication explaining your ideas with
others getting feedback from other
people standing in front of a whiteboard
just kicking around ideas going you know
doing the going through meetings hiring
other people helping your your peers and
your colleagues to succeed and you know
there's just so much so much
Offutt that will make you successful is
is about social interaction and is is
about maybe being you know moving more
towards the the extroverted end of the
spectrum but what I personally found is
that it was it was never sort of a crazy
environment where I didn't feel
comfortable but actually like felled
felled really good and I actually felt
like I fit right in and I was able to
you know understand the people who were
super super introverted because I had
been there
and I was able to to you know make
strike up a connection with them because
I felt like I actually understood you
know that they weren't mean and they
weren't trying to to
to ignore people but maybe they were
just a little bit shy right and so so it
and at the same time I felt like you
know those people were more in a shy and
they they appreciated that I was able to
to bring them into a conversation for
example or just you know sit down next
to them and strike up a conversation and
so that can be you know that that's like
a really valuable asset you know I don't
know how extroverted you feel and I'm
sure it could you know like if you have
someone who's very introverted someone
who's very extroverted and it could just
be that they're not getting along like
super well but in my experience like
also going through computer science
education it's never been an environment
where I felt completely at odds with the
world and I don't think you will either
you know definitely like I have some
friends who would I would say are very
very extroverted in the sense that they
are just thriving on having you know
just a lot of like loud stuff going on
and like just the the party animals
really and and I not so much anymore but
they also I think they also enjoyed that
part of their education and now they're
also all doing you know really well in
in their jobs usually because they're
they have that ability to reach out to
people and to make these new connections
and to engage people right and so I
think this is a really valuable asset
now of course I'm you know this question
your question seems to be more about
like you know how will I fit in and I
don't think you'll have a problem with
that you know maybe you'll actually like
really enjoy it because it could this
could be your superpower you know in an
environment where most people are more
like the more introverted end of the
spectrum if you're the odd duck and you
can just go up to people and strike up a
conversation and you can you know make
these connections and connect different
circles or friends that's actually great
and people will appreciate that you just
don't you got to just make sure that
you're not an asshole about it and and
you know because it's very easy to be
like oh yeah everyone else is a nerd and
I'm like you know the brogue brogrammer
kind of kind of cliche person and I feel
like that's terrible because it just you
know there's it creates this rift and
and one isn't better than the other it's
just you know it's a spectrum and people
people just have preferences and for
anyone who is actually feeling they're
super introverted I would I would
consider you know I'm actually trying to
see if you can if you can change that a
little bit and also see if we can get an
understanding for the other side of the
spectrum and in that sense right and I
think it's possible I'd like at least
for me a lot of it was was more about
China sand and kind of yeah just just
feeling like I I was really sure like
how how to approach strangers and strike
up conversations and stuff and and I
found that you know especially in an
environment where where I'm around
people who care in general about the
same things that I do and who are
passionate let's say about Python or
programming you know it's it's like I'm
in heaven you know I'm just running
around at PyCon chatting with people all
day long I'll be completely like floored
and burned out at the end of the day but
I'll have a blast and I feel like it's
the same for many other people and
they're surrounded by peers who care
about the same subject matter it's just
so much easier to to get along with
everyone right it's so yeah just some
thoughts on that well you also had a
question around the work or you
mentioned something about you're worried
that the work might be mundane again I
think you have a lot of power in finding
work that that you enjoy you know if you
don't if you don't enjoy the kind of
let's say you know the super focus like
research work where you're spending a
lot of time you know sitting in front
like sitting in front of a computer
screen likes being super focused maybe
doing working on your own a lot or more
than in other jobs then don't look for a
job like that I mean in computer science
you know there's there's so much value
if you can be the kind of the connecting
person that can explain things and that
is a great communicator that is just so
so so very helpful and you know there's
a lot of demand for the
kinds of rolls you know and there's
there's just a ton of opportunity there
if you have programming skills and you
don't want to sit in front of a computer
all day maybe you can become some kind
of evangelist for for for a programming
language you know there's this big
companies especially like Amazon Google
you know they hire people for exactly
that purpose where you go out and you
basically give presentations all day and
talk about coding teach people how to
code and that can be very rewarding as
well I mean in a certain degree that's
that's what I'm doing right now with my
business and I went from you know we
have a three people startup or just in
the cave like coding like crazy and and
we were really sort of doing these
things on our own because because that
is like the maximum you know that way
you can you can push things forward
really quickly if everyone kind of house
especially and you just crank out code -
I went to like just stepping into a more
communication related role or managerial
road you know leading a team and making
sure like we're connecting with all the
stakeholders and making sure like things
are moving along and and then also
trying to spend like two-thirds of my
day actually also still coding and and
now I'm doing this where I'm standing in
front of this camera talking okay I'm
not talking about coding and giving
presentations about Python and you know
there's just you can change and and and
look for look for a job you will find a
job where you will be happy with your
unique skillset and where you will be
you will find satisfaction with the the
skills that you can bring to the table
and I'm sure there's you know some thing
where some job where you will find well
you will find yourself extremely happy
because it's just placed to your unique
strengths so as far as the work being
more or you know less mundane out of
bigger versus a smaller company again I
think that's something you have to see
for yourself you know it just you got to
be aware and the really really big
companies they can afford someone they
can afford to pay someone or a whole
team actually just to have a very very
narrow and specific focus whereas at a
smaller team or smaller company you will
often have a wide range of response
and you know whether that meshes better
with your personality and what you're
looking for or not or you know which one
meshes better with with your unique
personality that's just something you
need to find out like personally I
really enjoy working with smaller
companies and just because there's so
much opportunity for you know keeping
the momentum high and and also like
dabbling in two different roles so but
again you know this personal preference
and I think okay so you know to
summarize this I think you're gonna be
able to find happiness in this even if
you feel like you're you're not an
introvert I would say this is more myth
that all programmers are introverts or
you know extremely introverted we're you
know to the point where it's where it's
very noticeable that every that people
are introverted and I would also say
that in this field there is mundane work
but there is also awesome work and you
can just do you know I really think
programming is a superpower and you can
find something where you can really do
something that is very enjoyable you can
start your own company you can start
your own business or you can work for
somewhere else and there's a lot of
opportunity right now so I'm really
confident that you will find something
that that you will enjoy alright so if
