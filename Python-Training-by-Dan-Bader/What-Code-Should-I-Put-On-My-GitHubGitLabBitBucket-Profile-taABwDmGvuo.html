this question from a YouTube commenter
and one of my videos about what to put
on your github so if you're a developer
and you're building up a development
portfolio or you're kind of using github
as a place to show off your work and
wall to show the world you know what a
great programmer you are and using git
up for that purpose or any other side
you know like I was gonna say
SourceForge but I probably wouldn't
recommend them these days you know like
Atlassian's bitbucket or anything like
that get lap github they're all pretty
much worked the same way personally I
really like github because it's just the
biggest site and it's the the best known
brand I think so you know maybe some of
that will color off on your portfolio as
well so I got this question from a
YouTube commenter and he or she asks is
exercises from courses you're taking
worth putting on github how about old
gooeys and scripts you've used in your
own work but that are not that
interesting for other people so I guess
to summarize the question you know is it
worth putting code that you have sort of
flying around is it worth putting that
on github or how how should you start
out at at least that I'm interpreting
this question and I think it's actually
a really good question because you know
you're starting out you're starting to
populate your github profile and maybe
you're wondering okay what kind of
quality of code do I actually need to
put there so that it's beneficial right
because I would imagine that you're
starting out with your github profile
with a goal in mind right like maybe you
wanted to kind of serve as a developer
portfolio and it's gonna be a helpful
thing for you to apply at a job and you
know you want people to look at it and
go like oh this person is a good
programmer and I think for that purpose
you it makes sense to think about what
you want to put on your github profile
right and my take on it is that I think
having something up there is better than
having a completely empty profile so I
would probably start you know if this is
the only thing you can upload at the
moment and put there an open sore
at the moment I would just start with
whatever you have in mind right you can
always go back and then later remove
things or you know improve them but if
you're just starting out like just take
something as long as it's not just copy
and pasting other people's code which
which gives off a horrible signal right
like I've seen that you know
interviewing people and you browse their
like you read their resume your browser
kid hub account and you think like oh
there's a lot of stuff on there but then
when you actually look at it you can see
that they've just been copy and pasting
other people's code and kind of
pretended it was theirs and and that's
not a great signal right you don't want
to that's not what you want to
communicate so definitely avoid that
however with the question here it sounds
like they have this developer has like
original content right and and even if
it's just gooey like gooey apps and in
scripts I think it's totally worth
putting that on your github if it's
original code and if it's you know
represents your skills I don't think you
want to upload a bunch of stuff that
isn't you know up to the level of
quality that you're working with out at
the moment at this point in time right
when you're creating this portfolio so I
probably wouldn't upload you know code
that I wrote I don't know like you know
seven years ago because it wouldn't it
wouldn't be in my favor I mean I might
actually would be kind of interesting to
preserve that I would love to look at
that myself but I might not make it
necessarily not necessarily make it
public right so I would definitely keep
that in mind also and I want to also
speak a bit to this this one point in
the question about things maybe not
being as interesting for other people
are interesting enough for other people
so in my experience you know the
Internet is pretty big and it's kind of
crazy and kind of cool to see what even
like a super niche thing how many people
is can attract because you know whatever
these scripts do I almost guarantee you
there's gonna be someone or a couple of
people you know every week or every
month who are looking for pretty much
exactly this thing so you might even be
able to help someone out with just
sharing these you know scripts and stuff
that you don't really feel like they're
super valuable but they could they could
really be interesting for someone who's
looking for this at exactly that point
in time so I wouldn't discount that as
an option right like if you have the
stuff bundle it up put it on github put
a open-source license on it that you're
comfortable with and just see what
happens
so I guess to summarize that if you have
nothing on your github then get started
put something out there it's usually not
gonna hurt you unless you're just copy
and pasting stuff right it will be a
good thing for you you can always build
on that just to get started build to
habit do that um if you have choice you
know if you have the choice and you have
a couple of things that you're thinking
about uploading then I think you can
definitely get picky so I think when I
put together my kind of public you know
open source portfolio whatever you want
to call it I had started out with a
couple of small libraries that I that I
had written and I polished them to to a
state where they they look nice right I
didn't know how useful they were gonna
be for people but I wanted to have a
certain quality level and kind of seed
that account with you know I think three
projects that I launched this with
initially and that worked out pretty
well on the other hand like looking back
I think you know if you upload a bunch
of stuff that no one cares about that's
not gonna hurt you either and it's good
for you because you're building the
habit right so you if you're struggling
with you know trying to be do things as
perfect as possible then I would just
try and get started because you know it
actually took me a lot of time like
preparing these projects and polishing
them and going through all of that work
and I'm not actually sure if that ever
really paid off right I might have
gotten the same results just by getting
started and in doing success of
refinements so that's kind of the you
know the strategy that I'm leaning
towards today but but yeah definitely
put it on get out like I think that's a
tldr put those scripts on github and I
don't think it'll hurt you it'll be good
for you it'll show that you want to give
back to the community and it'll
demonstrate you know that you're willing
to share code and and it's already if
it's original code definitely put it up
there all right so I hope this helped
you out I'm gonna be working on
a couple more videos like that one you
know just answering questions that you
share with me and a lot of them are
gonna be about this you know whole
aspect of developer marketing how to
build up your developer portfolio how to
how to put up a good developer profile
that's really gonna speak for you and
will demonstrate your skills because I
think that's super important and as
developers we're usually not great at
that right like that's selling ourselves
or marketing ourselves so I feel like
there's definitely something that could
be improved and I you know benefited
hugely just from building up these
skills so I want to give that back and
and share that with people so be sure to
subscribe if you want to see the next
video to make sure you don't miss it and
I'll talk to you soon thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
