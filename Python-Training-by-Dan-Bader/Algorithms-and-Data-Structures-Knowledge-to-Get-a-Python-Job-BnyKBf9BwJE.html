talk about a question that I got from a
reader a while ago so the question was
about what is the minimum data
structures and algorithms knowledge I
can get away with and they say I work in
my work as a QA person I rarely use any
linked lists or graphs or algorithmic
approaches though I love writing Python
code and learning the language but I'm
very bad at math data structures
algorithms and competitive programming
so I would like to learn just enough
data structures and algorithms in Python
so I guess like the question is about
how much data structures knowledge do
you need to to get a developer job or
you know I guess to be successful in
your career I feel like that's that's
sort of the spirit of this question and
I think it's a really really great
question because there's a lot of I feel
like on the one hand there's a lot of
scare mongering about oh you got to have
you know you've got to be able to you
know balance a binary tree and like
write a red-black tree from from scratch
on the whiteboard otherwise you're never
going to get a job and you're going to
die poor and you know people are going
to hate you and on the other hand
there's kind of a lot of backlash from
from the other side where people are
saying like oh you know what like any
data structures knowledge is completely
useless like people only use that for
interviews like why would you even you
don't have to learn that it has no
practical it has no practical use in the
day-to-day work off of a developer so we
kind of have these two extremes right I
where it's like people are saying okay
if I need if I need to if I need to
demonstrate this knowledge to get a job
I'm totally expecting that this would
help me on the job and this is probably
why people are asking and testing for it
and the other side is saying like oh
that's certainly not true you know this
is just all this is just all like people
interviewing developers in the wrong way
and actually knowing about data
structures and algorithms is is not that
useful in practice I'm for me I am I am
not on either end of that of that
spectrum so I you know I want to give
you my personal perspective on this
stuff and I have experienced you know
I've gone
through several of these like interviews
and like the classic whiteboard enters
interview and screening and I've also
put other people through them and
interviewed other people and stuff so I
feel like I've got a kind of balanced
perspective on this um so in terms of
the data structures knowledge you need
you know to get away with first of all I
think it's dangerous to say that data
structures and algorithms and of the
fundamental computer science stuff is
useless and we can just be you can be a
great coder without that that's like
saying you know I'm going to be the
world's most amazing pilot pilot without
knowing anything about aerodynamics and
it's just not it's just not going to
work you know sure maybe you can get
your plane off the ground but you better
be careful so that you don't kill a
bunch of people right so if you do that
in a professional capacity and so I
fundamentally believe that having decent
you know solid data structures and basic
algorithms knowledge is a skill that's
worth having and it's it's important for
any software developer that wants to
grow their career and that is really
serious about software development and
it can also be very rewarding and it's
something that I still practice every
once in a while because it's easy to
forget this stuff and it's um it's it's
hard right and but it's also fun once
you make some progress so for example I
just you know I'm working on this book
called Python tricks the book and I
created a series of data structure data
structure chapters there that cover some
of the you know the code or that cover
it the classic computer science II data
structures and how you can use them in
Python where you can find them in Python
you know what is a Q what is a stack
what's the best way to implement a cure
or stack in Python what did the dynamic
array versus a linked list and stuff
like that you know very basic data
structures knowledge and I feel like
that this stuff is immensely valuable
for any developer to know so you know
when I was writing these chapters and I
did a bunch of research and I had to you
know come up with some examples and then
you know make up my mind what it was
going to say there I actually benefited
from that even though I knew most of the
stuff beforehand and have been working
as a software developer you know for
several years I benefited a lot from
freshing of that knowledge and
refreshing my memory on that stuff and
so I think having this knowledge is very
very beneficial to your day-to-day work
you know it's just going to make you a
more effective coder you're going to be
able to avoid certain classes of
problems that someone else might just
run into headfirst and and then they're
going to have to backtrack and figure
out what where they went wrong you know
if you if you know some basic complexity
analysis you're just going to know like
you know if I write like three nested
loops and in the inner loop I'm going to
hit the database a bunch and give run
some queries that's going to have
horrible performance if I do that you
know at any capacity like if I do that a
hundred times a second it's just not
going to be that great if I do that a
thousand times per second it's going to
get worse and worse and worse so having
a basic amount of data structures and
algorithms knowledge is immensely
helpful now of course you can take that
to the other extreme and you know you
can have the person who can like write a
red-black tree implementation for you on
the whiteboard and and you know they're
they're they're good at these sort of
competitive programming questions and
competitive algorithms questions like to
be honest like I am NOT one of them
like I tend to freeze up a lot when I
get these questions you know get I've
gotten a lot better at it and some of it
was just out of necessity right an
assess is necessary evil for me to be
able to get the job and to get the jobs
that I wanted I just have to become more
comfortable with this with this type of
interview but do I think that
person who you know you can do all this
stuff on the whiteboard are they
fundamentally like a more effective in a
better programmer well I don't know like
maybe part of it is my own bias where
I'm thinking well guess what I can't do
that so the people who can do it they
don't have an advantage and you know so
it's no point in learning that skill on
the other hand there's probably some
advantage but I also think it's all
diminishing returns right like there
comes some point where you know if you
have a little bit of data structures
knowledge that's going to be super
valuable for you and then if you have a
little bit more and it's going to be
also still valuable but a little bit
less so and like the more knowledge you
have you kind of reach these diminishing
returns like the curve Peters out right
and I feel like it is like that with
data structures knowledge as well so
like the person you know who knows what
a binary search is and has like some
solid like complexity analysis skills
right they know how Big O notation works
and they actually understand it when you
look at code and can kind of make these
come up with these like I guess like
subconscious feelings about like Oh a
Cisco going to be fast or not and you
know they kind of have a sense for what
makes a slow algorithm what makes a fast
algorithm if you take that person and
you compare compare them to the person
who can write a red-black 3 a red black
tree from scratch in in 10 minutes on a
white board
I'm not sure if that is so much of an
added benefit in in real life right
because at some point like once you've
gotten the job like a lot of it comes
down to like hey are you actually a nice
person to work with you know can you
help the people around you to work
better and faster and it may be a little
bit more happier and you know there's
just so much more leverage in that in my
opinion where's this actually going like
you know being like like like Rambo like
the lone the lone hero and you're just
coming in like yeah guys you know I got
it like I'll just you know drink more
coffee and bang out a bunch of extra
code and I write this like red black
tree from scratch like in fact
most people would probably not write a
very complex data structure like that
from scratch because even for someone
highly skilled that is more more of a
long-term effort right it's not like
it's a lot of times it's very easy to
come up with these some algorithms on a
whiteboard that that works for those
specific cases and they're good enough
for an interview but then when you
actually use them in practice you have
to you have to worry about all kinds of
other things right you have to worry
about maintainability is this code
readable do other people understand it
is it well tested does it validate its
inputs and and there's a lot of this
this just the practical knowledge there
you know how you would be a practical
software engineer you would probably not
write your own red black tree but you
would based on your knowledge you'd be
able to find a really good off-the-shelf
implementation and then use that in your
own programs and that's what makes you
more effective right so so I think
there's there's I like to think there's
a difference between you know someone
being able to do that on a whiteboard
and then them actually being a very very
effective productive developer that
actually delivers delivers great work
right those are not necessarily the same
thing and so two real all of that back
in you know sorry for the ramp we answer
there but two real all of that back in
how much algorithms and data structures
knowledge do you need to you know what's
the minimum minimum you can get away
with and
I hope what I just said it gives you a
better view of that whole spectrum so
the minimum is probably not add a like
Google interview level you know white
boat white board coding kind kind of
knowledge right like it's the minimum
you can get away with is like I'm in my
opinion would be like you know knowing
about basic data structures like what is
the queue what is the dynamic array
what's a linked list how does a
dictionary or
a hash map work and you know how do
these basic data structures work and
what are their relative performance
characteristics I when would you use
them I feel like that knowledge is going
to take already going to take you very
far and that's probably what I would
have as the minimum I mean of course the
questions like for with the minimum for
what's right look if you just want to
get a job as a programmer um maybe you
can you can reduce that minimum further
and you could just say okay you know I
know the basic data types in the
language that I'm working with you know
I know what a list is in Python and what
a dictionary is and it would have said
is and I know how to work with them I
sort of know under which circumstances
one is better than the other or faster
or slower than the other how much memory
they take up and then maybe you don't
need much more maybe like you need even
less but I feel like you know somewhere
in that range this is where personally
where I would put the minimum for
someone to be a highly effective and you
know highly employable software
developer but it's in my opinion
probably not over there where it's like
you're the person that writes a
red-black tree from scratch in a
interview situation right so it's it's
it's more on the on the other end of the
spectrum to be honest and kill so let's
go over that question again
yeah so there was one other a bit here
about being bad at math and you know
being bad at data structures and
algorithms in competitive programming so
I wasn't actually great at math when I
started you know started my computer
science education in in Germany so it
was a bit of a hard landing for me and
actually you know I got myself like so
um psyched out and worried before I even
applied for university that I almost
didn't do it and by that time I had
actually been paid to do programming
work right but I felt so incompetent and
I felt like I wasn't ready for it
because of my not that great math skills
that I almost didn't do it
so now thinking back it would have been
a horrible decision you know if I hadn't
gone because for me it's like it's a
complete passion I love programming and
I got so much joy out of my my education
there and I'm glad I went and I'm glad I
applied and you know it was it was hard
work sometimes but it was absolutely
worth it because I got to you know work
on stuff and learn stuff that I
absolutely loved and I got to hang out
with people who were in the same
situation so that was a great value to
me right but what I want to say is that
don't feel don't feel like you can't do
this because you're not super you're not
a math wizard um like I said a lot of a
lot of a lot of things in programming
they actually come down to to more like
thinking more thinking like an engineer
you know I totally you know to maybe to
explain that what I mean by that is like
of course you want to have like you want
to be thinking analytically and like
rationally and logically but
it's a math again it's a wide field
right like I found that there were some
some parts in in mathematics dad that I
felt like really comfortable you know
like boolean logic and stuff like that I
felt really comfortable and then other
things you know not not so much so it's
a wide field and for you to be a
successful programmer there you're not
going to be you're not going to have to
be an absolute master at every single
like on all of it right like if well if
you don't know like I was really
struggling with differential equations
so if you don't know how to solve them
you hate them it doesn't really matter
you just find a job where you never have
to deal with any one of those ever again
or maybe you know you can just tap your
coworker on the shoulder or maybe you
can just hire consultant to figure that
out for you you know that particular
thing and then you're golden and you can
move on you know like what I really
enjoy is about is about designing
systems and building systems and also
building them in a way where there were
they're maintainable and like nicely
structure and I get a lot of joy out of
that into a certain degree you could say
you know that is also like you know a
more more like a well maybe some sort of
mathematical ability I think it's
related to that you know how do you
think logically about like how can you
build a system where do you start what
in what order do you build things where
do you add things and these are all I
feel like they're all skill sets in the
same level part of the same spectrum and
you don't have to be a master of all of
them to have a great time as a
programmer and also to have a successful
career as a programmer alright so I hope
this helped you out don't go too crazy
and and don't don't psych yourself out
too much about these algorithms and math
questions this is a skill you can learn
if you already have some programming
knowledge sounds like you're already
sounds like you're working in QA and
you're doing programming work there
that's awesome and that's that's a
fantastic foundation you can build on
and then you know add these these these
other skills that you need maybe to make
it through a classical
developer interview whiteboard kind of
situation all right best of luck with
that and thanks for the question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
