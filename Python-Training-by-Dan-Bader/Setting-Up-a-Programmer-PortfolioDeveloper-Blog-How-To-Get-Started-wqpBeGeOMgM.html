want to talk about one of the best
things you could do for your career as a
software developer because I actually
just came back from PyCon Germany and I
had a conversation with a Django
developer named Astrid and Astrid was
really struggling with finding new
contract work or basically finding new
gigs and finding better kinds so Astrid
was a freelance Django developer and she
was really struggling with that problem
and so you know we kind of talked about
the stuff over lunch and I went into
full-on unsolicited advice diagnosing
mode and we chatted about this problem I
was true really trying to understand um
what was making it so hard for her to
find work in this space and eventually I
found out that she didn't have a website
um and now I think that is a huge
mistake right it luckily it's one that
is relatively easy to fix but I think
for any developer who's looking to
improve their career and just kind of
improve their chances at finding better
work or finding better clients or
finding a better job or you know even
just kind of having more influence and a
bigger say in the community starting a
website is the most important thing you
could do I think and now I've got my
website here's an example and the reason
I have that open is because I want to
show you how I got started
so this is what the website looks right
now in late 2016 and actually started
debater org in 2012 and I just went back
to UM one of the first commits where I
had launched the site and I just spun
that app up again so I can show you what
my site looked like back then and the
reason I'm showing you this is so that
you can see that
it doesn't take much to get started with
your own website as a programming
portfolio or you know even just to get
your voice out there and it it's all
about these humble beginnings right and
I was talking about this when when I
shared astrid story on my newsletter and
some people got back to me and we had a
conversation about this and they said
you know what i I know this makes sense
I should really start a website but it's
so freakin hard to get started and it
looks like you would need you know so
much content and by the way I don't
think I have a lot of content on my site
compared to some other people but I
that's why I figured it makes sense to
go back all the way when I just launched
my site just to show you how I got
started and how this stuff can grow
right you never want to go and like
compare what you're about to do with
someone who has been doing this for a
while like this is always going to be
frustrating right so if anything this is
what you should be aiming for you know
aim for something better but this is how
I got started and so I launched this
site with with a very very simple
structure you know I basically only had
my blog list of articles and this was
also the landing page a very simple
about page it was just a quick blurb and
link to my Twitter and that was
essentially it you know some contact
information that was essentially it so
when you went to debate org you would
you would land here on this blog list
and the reason why I have these you know
relatively massive giant font size is
because I only had two articles when I
launched this and I wanted it to at
least you know fill the screen and it
looks somewhat impressive like I didn't
just want to have like two little bullet
points that said you know spell-checking
latex documents with a spell and so this
is how I started out and then when you
click those you know I had images and it
it wasn't a lot of content there um it
you know you could argue about the
formatting not being perfect and
everything but but this is how I got
started like this is how I launched with
these two
pickles that I wrote when I was hanging
out with my parents over the holidays
one year and this is how I got started
so it doesn't take much to get started
and it can grow you know because once
you have you have the basics there you
can start growing this and you can start
adding more content and maybe you want
to start your own mailing list maybe you
want to start you know doing things like
I'm doing now like offering screencasts
or at a proper landing page that kind of
introduces you and and what your angle
is on this stuff you know and maybe you
want to start offering some products but
it all starts with going out there and
publishing one tiny article right that's
not a super long article like check out
this other one I mean you know nobody
really cares about latex and a spell but
it still gets some traffic and it got
some traffic back then it was just
absolutely amazing seeing people
actually use the site so I think
starting a blog is one of the best
things I ever did for my programming
career and I would really Rhian courage
you to do the same thing like get into
writing start putting yourself out there
and it can really grow into something
that you know I personally I get so much
joy for my site and I got so many
opportunities from working together with
other people and also having it as a
portfolio of sorts where I got better
jobs through that I get contacted from
people who are not just the standard
recruiters you would get for linked from
LinkedIn but actual people who read your
stuff we're a little bit familiar with
your with your content and kind of your
angle towards programming and if you can
get started with this do it absolutely
do it would really really encourage you
to do this I want to talk more about
this in the future and how you can start
your own website or blog or programming
portfolio because I think it's such a
super super important topic so be sure
to subscribe or sign up for my
newsletter where I'm also going to be
talking about this stuff and yeah let me
know if you have any more questions cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
