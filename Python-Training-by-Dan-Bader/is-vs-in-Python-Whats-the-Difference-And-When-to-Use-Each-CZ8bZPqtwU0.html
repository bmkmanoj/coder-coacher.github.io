it's time for another Python video so
I'm doing this new series of videos with
little Python tidbits you know really
cool features in Python that you can
apply in your own code in your day to
day work and that are just going to give
you a deeper understanding of Python and
I'm calling them Python tricks so
there's a new video series I'm starting
and shameless plug I'm also working on a
book under the same name which is going
to be almost like a buffet of really
awesome and cool features in Python that
you might not have heard about or you
know that you've always been curious
about about how they might work so I'm
actually working on this book in in like
an early access or like beta mode so you
can get updates as they come out and you
can get in for a cheaper price and if
you're interested I'll put the link into
the video description below alright so
in this episode of Python tricks I want
to talk about the difference between the
is operator and the equals equals
operator because I know that there this
is off the point of confusion for Python
developers and I've been trying to come
up with you know an example that really
boils it down to two like a minimal
example necessary to understand this
distinction and I think I got a pretty
good shot at this so so I bear with me
so at the end of the video you're going
to know the difference between is and
equals equals and you're going to know
when to apply them so the key thing here
is that there's a difference between two
things being identical or two objects
being identical and them being equal
like there's a semantic difference
there's a difference in meaning and so
for example when I grew up our neighbors
had twin cats so there were two cats
that looked pretty much exactly the same
but of course the way they were two
different cats I mean they were not you
wouldn't say like oh that's the same cat
right that we crazy because there's two
of them and I'm going to keep stretching
that analogy even thinner so bear with
me right so there are two different cats
and they're two different entities but
they
the same like you could say oh there
they're equal but really what this
example shows is that there's a
difference between something being two
things being equal and two things being
identical and that difference is really
important if you want to understand the
difference between is and the equals
equals operator so let's start with the
equals equals operator first so this guy
here it compares by checking for
equality so if these cats were Python
objects and we compared them with the
equals equals operator we get hey these
cats are equal as an answer because they
you know they have the same properties
they look the same now on the other hand
the is operator compares identities so
if we compared our identical like
seemingly identical cats or identical
looking cats with the is operator then
we get the answer that well there are
two different cats right they're not the
same cat like there's two of them like
are you crazy before I get all tangled
up in this cat analogy and let's
actually come up with some Python code
here so what we're going to do first is
we're going to create a new list object
now just create this new list one two
three and then we're going to create
another variable that points to the same
list so now these two variables a and B
they're pointing to the same list so
when we inspect a you can see here okay
this is the contents we what we put in
earlier and if we inspect B then we get
the same result now at this point we we
know that they kind of look the same
right so if we compare them with the
equals equals operator we get true as
the answer because well you know they
they look the same they have the same
seemingly the same content now what that
doesn't tell us however is whether or
not a and B are actually the same object
I mean in this case we know because we
created them and we assigned B to point
to the the same object that a points to
but suppose we didn't know right like
how could we find out and this is where
the operator comes in so if we went a is
B then in this case Python would tell us
yeah they're the same object like they
are the same thing and that would mean
you know if I go in and change a by
let's say putting in a string if I
change a that will also change B because
they're pointing to the same underlying
object right and so now I'm actually
going to undo this and just you know
create a new list here and then replay
everything I did before so now we're you
know I undid this change here where I
added this string so what we're going to
do now is we're going to create a new
copy off the this list that we're going
to call C and the way we can do that is
just by calling the list function or the
built-in list function on a again what
that's going to do it's going to create
a shallow copy that will look exactly
the same so let's take a look at a again
look at B again and then look at C and
you can see here they all look exactly
the same right if you're just looking at
their contents they look exactly the
same
so now this is where it gets interesting
right because when I go and compare a to
C then we get the answer okay there they
look identical they are considered equal
now if I go and do a is C then we get a
different result because Python tells us
hey they're not the same object they
might look identical but they're not the
same freaking cats there are two
different cats that just look the same
right they're both like they both have
black fur and the same eye color and
whatnot but they're they're two
different cats and really this is the
key distinction between equals equals
and the is operator because the is
operator or an is expression it
evaluates to true if two variables point
to the same like identical object and
the equals equals operator or an equals
equals expression if
to true if both objects are equal or
have the same contents but they're not
necessarily the same object like we
don't care about that alright so I hope
this clarified this difference to you
and just think of cats so every time
you're going to have to make a decision
between equals equals and is just think
of twin cats
I mean think of cats all day you can
also think of dogs it works the same way
with dogs but that's really the key
distinction need to remember all right
so I hope this was helpful
like I said if you enjoyed this kind of
micro example where I'm explaining an
aspect of Python part of the language in
sufficient detail to kind of you know
get started with it and really
understand the underlying principle then
be sure to check out my new book it's
available for early access right now and
I think you might really enjoy it cool
talk to you soon thanks so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
