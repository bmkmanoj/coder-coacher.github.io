of sorts it's a bit of a longer one
again but I think it's a again it's a
really really interesting question and I
really wanted to talk about this in this
video so um so buy it ashesh rights he
left or a comment on one of my videos
and he says hi Dan thanks for your
videos and I also ordered your book on
Amazon yesterday that's awesome thank
you very much so
yeah this is the book if you want to get
a copy it's called Python Trix the book
you can get it on Amazon my question is
this I work for a big production
industry corporation
more than 20,000 employees where I solve
problems from people that took hours of
manual work of their time with Python
that's really cool now it only takes
seconds and the program makes no mistake
now senior IT management told me Python
is too risky and everything related to
IT installing Python and other machines
has to come from IT and they have no
interest therefore my teammates have to
do everything manually again any advice
so the really really challenging
situation you're dealing with all the
corporate red tape and it sounds like
this is a huge corporation you know big
giant company of more than 20,000
employees and they're not willing to add
python to their existing IT
infrastructure which is understandable
right like if if we put ourselves or if
I put myself into their shoes
you know we imagine you have this like
company there are processes everything
is is sort of chugging along and if you
introduce new technology that is
introducing introducing risk that's
that's just the bottom line you know
every time you add a new moving part to
a complex machine whether that's you
know a company or a program or like an
engine every time you do something like
that it introduces risk and that's often
not what these big companies like
because they have something that works
and for them you know maybe for them it
actually doesn't make a difference if
this stuff gets automated maybe they're
happier if they can hire you know just
hire a bunch of people that do that
manually they know it gets done they
don't have to update their processes
now do I personally think this is the
way to go no that's why I stopped
working in corporate environments
because I didn't enjoy it as much as as
a salaried employee I feel like if
you're coming in as a contractor or you
know freelancer or consultant it's a
different story because then they're
you're often hired to actually you know
be a little bit disruptive but I I know
exactly what you mean you know if you're
inside in a big big machine like that
and you want to be you want to bring
that innovation it can be very hard to
do it and sure enough that you know as
always depends on the the leadership or
like you know the management that you're
working with directly like if you have
like a really great leader manager and
they're open to this maybe they can open
some doors and make a case for you but
it can be very hard to be to bring in
innovation in that case as as a
developer just because you know there
are other forces at work so okay so I'm
you know just read this start recording
this video and I'm kind of thinking
about where to take where to take my
response next on the one hand I'm
thinking well let's talk about some
things you could do maybe to get a
chance to bring this in and on the other
hand I'm thinking probably the easiest
for you is just to accept that situation
maybe rewrite this thing in in one of
the Blessed languages that this company
uses and solve the problem that way so
and then you know then you're gonna have
a success or option three just you know
walk away and be like yeah whatever
that's it and start looking for a new
job and in that way the the you know
you're not trying to change any anybody
else you know trying to change any any
big like ingrained system but you're
only like you're dealing with this
yourself and internally which can often
be the easiest way to deal with that
sort of resistance you know just be like
yep okay walk away right now I'm not I'm
not sure if this is what what you want
to do is will very much depend on your
own but you know this this sort of stuff
this is exactly why I went out
and became a contractor your freelance
developer consultant whatever you want
to call it and and that's also you know
the next step was starting my own
company and working on that and just
just because you know after doing a
start-up and that I really enjoyed that
working environment and then I just
found myself increasingly more and more
corporate environments and I was just
wasn't happy with that so you know I'm
not I'm not like I don't want to go
there and like you know give you advice
on that situation because essentially
like this is just you know these are my
own my own thoughts my own experience so
I kind of want to keep it to what you
actually wrote in this question so you
know but that's just a sidetrack happy
to go there in the future if people are
interested but not gonna do it for now
so so maybe let's talk a little bit
about you know some things you could do
to maybe convince them to do Python just
caveat there I think it will be very
very hard to do that already you've
gotten some pushback and if you keep
pushing I'm not sure if that's the the
battle worth fighting right because it
could also totally backfire fire and you
don't want to get I don't think you want
to get a reputation as as someone who's
you know maybe challenging to work with
or anything like that you know this is
I'm not saying this is gonna happen and
and you seem like a really great guy but
you know it's definitely danger always a
danger if that happening if if you're
the squeaky wheel and a big corporation
it's just a reality of it I think so
okay so what could you do
I've done a video in the past on how can
you convince your company to to
introduce Python or start using Python
and I think the best way to do that is
to to show the merits of Python it will
be very hard just to you know just to
try and sneak it in sure that could work
but it's also it doesn't seem
sustainable and doesn't seem like the
best way to do it so I think you want to
sort of become an evangelist for Python
and and see if you can prove that it's
it's a great tool for solving these kind
of problems
and try and get some buy-in over time
and then you can do another you know try
it again to see if you can bring in that
application now obviously this is going
to take a ton of energy and a lot of
work on your
and and I'm not sure if you want to do
that and there's no guarantee for
success right like honestly the
situation doesn't sound like to just be
changed around quickly like that so but
that's probably what I would try to do
you know little baby steps like maybe
give a presentation about Python you
know tell like you know start start
working up sort of the start working up
the hierarchy and the chain you know if
you can if you can convince your team
that Python is a great idea like your
peers you can maybe over time convince
your your direct manager that Python is
actually a really really great
technology really great tool for solving
these kinds of problems and maybe you
know that person can convince their
manager and so on maybe you can give a
little presentation to the engineering
department in your company and just kind
of spread that gospel of Python and see
if you can get some buy-in that way and
just kind of get get everything ready
for for then coming and be like hey
actually you know we have this tool and
it would be great if we could use it or
then you can start solving problems with
Python but I think it will be very very
very difficult just to change this
situation so that this other team or you
know senior IT management will be like
oh yeah you know we're just gonna go
with Python it seems seems great I feel
like it will be very hard just because
of the yeah you know the corporate
structure and this is a huge company
things are moving slower and nobody
wants to get fired for introducing some
kind of risky new technology even though
you know we might not think that Python
is risky technology but any technology
that you introduce into an existing
company is is risky you know it doesn't
matter like if if you introduce C into a
Python shop you're introducing risk
because you're your existing team
doesn't have experience with with with
Python or C you know and in that case
and this is those are probably the same
fears that senior management has in your
case where you know what's gonna happen
if you leave tomorrow or if you get sick
or you know and and then there's a
Python application that nobody else
really knows how to maintain because
there's no Python expertise in-house and
the only way I think to to get that
acceptance is by building up that expert
and building up the understanding that
python is is an OK language to use so
yeah right well I hope this wasn't
discouraging you know just telling in
telling it the way it is would be great
to hear how this story ended how you
decided what what you did and wishing
you the best of luck I would be really
cool to see to see some more Python
being used at this at this company and

that you want me to tackle then just
leave a comment below and I'll try and
do a video on that in the future so
thanks for watching and happy Python II</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
