cool little tool and that I actually use
a lot for Python development and it is
called the Python and it is an
alternative rep whole or alternative
interpreter for the Python programming
language I'm gonna show B Python to you
in a minute but to give you a motivating
example let's just boot up the regular
Python interpreter here just in my
terminal right it starts right up I can
go ahead and define a little function
here and I actually have to go in and
fix the intonation myself and I need to
remember what the print statement is
called in that case the print function
so yeah I want this thing to say hello
to whatever the name is that gets passed
in and so we're defining this here and
we're gonna make it say hello Daniel run
it okay it works that's pretty cool but
the sad thing really is that we can't we
don't get any syntax highlighting here
so the this is actually really hard to
read if you're used to a programming
environment like sublime text or like a
more fancy IDE even so this is really
not that great if you're doing a lot of
work in the Python repple here and then
also if you're exploring a new module or
new library then it's a pretty
bare-bones environment for that too so
let's say we want to play with the math
library here and just kind of see what
it has to offer
pretty much have to call that their
function here on it to see what the
available attributes and functions are
in here so let's say I'm interested in
the math dot seal function to get some
help on that I'd have to pretty much
type all this stuff out manually and
then I get the the doc string displayed
and the function definition for the seal
function so that kind of sucks I lose
all my contacts I can't see the the
other code I have on my screen here and
it's not super awesome it gets a job
done it can be made better with some
tweaks to give you autocomplete but
really not much beyond that
so we're going to quit that interpreter
by hitting ctrl D and drop back to the
shell and so what I'm going to show you
now is this alternative interpreter that
it's called B Python and it's pretty
much the same thing as Python was before
but it has a couple of extra features
that I think make it a really really
nice tool and just make playing with a
Python repple a lot more enjoyable so as
I work through this example again you
can already tell that some things are
different here first of all you get some
syntax highlighting here so we can see
that the different tokens in that line
are actually also highlighted
differently and get different colors
which is really awesome and much much
much easier on the eyes we also get a
feature that does highlighting for
matching parentheses we can also be
handy if you're editing like a really
long string with nested parentheses and
the good news is it actually does the
indentation automatically for us this
time so as I go ahead and type out my
print function here I can actually use
the autocomplete that is also offered by
B Python so I can just hit the tab key
and it'll run through the different
options that were offered here and now I
can just keep on going and I saved a
couple of characters typing this out the
other really cool thing is is if I make
a syntax error in here so let's say
we're using you know the wrong kind of
parentheses to complete that line I get
the the syntax error printed out and I
can tell okay something went wrong the
cool thing is now that I can hit ctrl R
to rewind that last action
and it'll even show up here in my
history as this kind of ghosted line
here and I can just fix my syntax error
and then commit that and I've now
defined that say hello function
successfully you can give it the same
the same example here and what's also
really cool is that just to show it
works as I type this out you can see
that I get the function definition for
this again and if it has a doc string it
would also show the doc string so let's
clear that out
the other cool thing that I find really
helpful is the autocomplete and help
functionality for exploring modules or
just kind of seeing what modules have to
offer so let's import the math module
again and again here you can tell it
even does autocomplete frees modules as
I type out em and then a and then T it
kind of narrows down to autocomplete
until only math it's left and can import
it right away so now where previously I
have to use the dur function I can just
go and type out math and input a dot and
the autocomplete shows me all of the
symbols or I guess functions and
attributes it finds in there that I can
then reference so let's say we're
looking for the seal function it's just
autocomplete adhere type and open
parentheses and now I actually get the
function definition and the dock string
for that displayed in line so I don't
lose any of my my context here I know
exactly what I typed before and I can
learn all about that is to know about
the seal function and then we're just
gonna call it passing a value yeah
numbers get highlighted differently too
and I think that is really really
awesome and the good news is you it
doesn't require any configuration at all
like once you've installed it you're
you're done and you don't have to fiddle
with any interpreter config files to get
the functionality that I've just shown
you
so again we're gonna quit this now and I
want to show you real quick how you can
install B Python if you haven't if you
haven't installed it already alright so
you just go ahead and do a pip install B
Python I recommend using sudo for it
because then it becomes available
globally so this can be handy in some
situations obviously if you're using a
virtual end of 10 it's probably better
to put it in there but that command will
get you started so if you run that it'll
ask you for your root password
and obviously I already had it installed
but then you're ready to go and you can
jump right in and play with B Python
yeah let me know how that worked for you
and say hi on Twitter if you if you
enjoyed that and want to talk about this
stuff all right take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
