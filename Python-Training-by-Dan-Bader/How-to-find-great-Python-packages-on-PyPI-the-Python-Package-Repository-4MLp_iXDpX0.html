management is of course the ability to
store packages somewhere so that you or
other people can install them now let's
talk about Python package repositories
Python packages are collected in
so-called software repositories the
biggest or official software repository
in python is called pi pi it's also
sometimes called the cheese shop because
python developers just love their Monty
Python references
developers can
for free pipe I account and then submit
new packages to the repository and once
a package appears and pipe I everyone
else can install it through pip so this
is a really popular method to distribute
open-source Python packages and there
are literally tens of thousands of
packages available for free that you can
just install through pip and by the way
there's no review or QA process for
packages submitted to pi PI so whenever
you install a package from pi pi it
makes sense to invest some time into due
diligence work and reviewing what's
available so that you get a quality
piece of software
let's search for some packages on pi PI
we're going to take a look at the pi pi
website now you can find it at pi PI
Python org
let's fire up a browser and then take a
look at the pi pi website
alright this is pi PI you can see some
stats here so right now there are close
to a hundred thousand packages available
here on pi PI and when you scroll down
you can see sort of a update log off
recently updated packages as people push
them to the package repository you can
see here what was updated and of course
one of the most important parts of the
site here is the search box so into the
search box you can enter keywords and
basically do a full-text search on the
descriptions and the metadata for the
packages available on pi PI so you've
probably heard of the really popular
requests package which is a HTTP
download library so I'm going to go
ahead and search for requests here
okay so these are the search results for
requests and what's interesting here is
that the actual requests library that I
was looking for is not the number one
search result right because this is just
doing a search across all of the
descriptions in the metadata in all of
the available packages so I get some
very exhaustive results here and you can
see here as I scroll down this is a
really long list because obviously the
keyword requests seems to be quite
popular
all right so I'm going to go ahead and
click on the requests library here
because every package in pipey I
actually has its own landing page so it
has its own page on pi PI where the
developers can host the readme and gives
some links to the documentation or
release history and stuff like that so
what you can see here is that right now
I'm looking at the specific version of
requests and you can also see that
reflected here in the URL so this will
be at pi PI slash name of the library
slash the version so this is handy if
you ever want to link to a specific
library or a specific version of library
because you can just use that link this
is the readme file or the description
that the creators of the request library
have put together so the contents of
this description here will largely
depend on the information that the
library creator's put in sometimes the
formatting as it's displayed on the pi
PI website isn't perfect so you're going
to get these super blown up images here
just ignore that for now actually what I
wanted to show you is when you scroll
all the way down
when you scroll all the way down here
there will always be the summary with
metadata about the package that you're
looking at and this is often very useful
if you want to find the home page for a
specific project or if you want to
identify its author or if you're
interested in the license that the code
is under then also you can see the
categories the code is filed under the
library was filed under and in also what
other dependencies or secondary
dependencies that library requires to me
the most useful information is usually
these top three items here I want to
know about the library author I usually
take a look at the library homepage and
then I also want to know what license
the software is under and of course you
could also click through these
categories here and maybe find some
interesting packages that way
okay that's it for pi PI
you can also search for packages from
the command line using the pip search
command usually I would recommend that
you stick with the pi pi website though
the PIP command doesn't really give you
very much information about those search
results so it's just the package name
and then a very brief description which
can be useful but as you've seen in the
pi PI demo oftentimes a single key word
can lead to many many search results so
it's a little bit hard to untangle that
from the command line if you only have
limited information available
nevertheless that feature exists and it
can be useful in a pinch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
