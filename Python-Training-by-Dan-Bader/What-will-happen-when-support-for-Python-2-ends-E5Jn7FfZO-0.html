question that I got so the question is
what will happen to software written in
Python 2 after the support for it ends
so you may have heard about this Python
2 the support for Python 2 is going to
end eventually and Python 3 is gonna be
the supported version of the language
moving forward and this is going to
create an interesting situation for
existing software that has been written
in Python 2 so a couple of thoughts on
on this question or on this this
phase-out of Python 2 that's starting to
happen I think what we're gonna see here
is that many projects if possible are
gonna be migrated over to Python 3 so
this is gonna create opportunities for
people who can offer that as a service
right like if you're this is kind of a
sidetrack but if you're if you're a
freelance developer and you want to kind
of pick a niche for yourself and you
want to be be seen as an expert in a
specific niche this is maybe something
you could start your your freelancing
career on you know if you can offer this
as a service where you can help people
migrate existing Python 2 projects to
Python 3 it could be a really great
opportunity for you over the next couple
of years anyway so but essentially I
think that's what's going to happen
right we're either gonna have to migrate
these projects and update them to Python
3 and if that doesn't happen then these
projects are just gonna limp along kind
of on life support there's gonna be no
future bug fixes and updates for Python
2 I'm sure there will be sort of
unofficial fixes if or even official
fixes if there's something really really
big they like a security issue or
something that that needs to be fixed in
the interpreter in the in the standard
library but I think essentially these
are the two options and again if you
know we've seen that in the past with
languages like COBOL for example that
aren't really officially supported
anymore I mean I'm sure does vendors
that offer support for their COBOL
environment still because there's a huge
huge amount of software written in COBOL
still that that some you know giant
corporations like banks
need to do their business and so again
those are kind of limping along and
there are some highly paid people who
still have the skills to maintain these
projects I to be honest I don't think
we're gonna see anything I'm crazy or as
intense like that with Python because
it's a much smaller leap to go from
Python to to Python 3 but maybe we're
gonna see it on a smaller scale right
where if somebody is really skilled at
Python 2 maybe they can make a great
career out of supporting these Python 2
applications indefinitely so again
something to think about like I'm trying
to frame this also as an opportunity and
not only is something negative because
well we're gonna have to do something
with with that existing software so you
know again this is just happening every
once in a while in in this field that
we're all in in the software development
industry that older technology gets
phased out and we either need to upgrade
or somebody needs to support these
existing systems and well it creates a
lot of trouble it also creates a lot of
opportunities for developers to be
honest so yeah just some thoughts here
