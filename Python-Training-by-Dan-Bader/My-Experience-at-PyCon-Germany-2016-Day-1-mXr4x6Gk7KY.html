from the first day of PyCon Germany 2016
and I just wanted to do a quick video
for are you guys who you know can't
attend and would like to know what it's
like to be at a PyCon or maybe you've
never been at a tech conference you're
really interested you know what what
it's like how how it all works so well
the first thing you you do is
essentially in the first morning or
first day of the conference you you
check in or your register and they give
you a badge so I know the video quality
is program not gonna be the best but
like this is my my badge and you just
wear that all day so you you know you
don't get kicked out and people can see
your name and it kind of know what you
do so I try to be a smartass and I
actually had an emoji in my tag line
here and a Python mystery it's this
Python mystery dictionary example that I
shared on Twitter
a while ago anyway it worked fine
printed nicely and it was I thought it
was gonna be a nice conversation starter
but people were like okay I can't read
that right so couldn't really work I'm a
speaker this time so my talks gonna be
tomorrow I'm gonna talk about
entrepreneurship and a small app that I
built as a prototype for the Shopify app
store and I'm pretty excited about that
talk tomorrow so I want to do some more
prep work tonight for that and yes like
when your speaker you get this you know
usually they call it out on the badge so
I found that that's actually a pretty
good conversation starter like a lot of
people ask me about you know what you're
talking to be on and yeah doesn't hurt
so you run around with that all day and
it's always good you know to look at
people's badges so that's a lot easier
to remember their name so I found that
there so many people from all over
Europe here right now which is really
really cool like I met so many cool
people you know from Slovenia from
Russia from France Spain Germany
everywhere and I I really like that
diversity so
do let's see okay so the other thing
that we all got was this fantastic PyCon
bag which which actually looks pretty
cool I mean you know some a lot of times
with the conference bags you don't
really know what you're what are you
getting into but I I really like this
like this could be a good gym bag I
don't know and there's a ton of stuff in
there so you know free advertisement for
all these wonderful people gather
there's stickers
and like a conference schedule like this
tiny little magazine and you know free
pens with stats
yeah bunch of pins and then basically
all the companies there they're
advertising their their services and
their stuff right so I got this little
pie charm wristband which is kind of
nice I wish I wish I would have gotten
one that says sublime text I oh maybe I
should I should make those I know anyway
yeah that's awesome so there's a bunch
of of these things and then we got our
conference t-shirts which again is
pretty oh wait you got to turn that
around because it has a logo on it as
well so those turned out pretty well too
and it seems to fit okay so I'm excited
about that too so I got has a nice PyCon
logo again and yeah that way everyone is
gonna know you know who sees me that I'm
a huge Python nerd and so it's good to
have these these t-shirts okay yeah so
and then alright maybe target let's I
want to talk a little bit about I don't
my my what I do when I attend a
conference because one thing that I
noticed is that the real value for going
to a conference I actually noticed that
for me it's changing more and more where
I feel like I'm getting more out of just
hanging out in the hallway and talking
to people and out of the coffee breaks
then I'm getting from going to the
actual sessions I went to a couple of
sessions today because like frankly just
completely exhausts me to talk to people
all day like I'm I'm I just need some
time to recover and so I spend a lot of
but I spend a lot of time talking to
people today and I feel like I can just
watch the videos and everything after
the conference but nevertheless I went
to a couple of talks that were we're
really interesting actually so there's
this other piece of swag that we got
from a company here it's like a free
moleskin or molesky new or yeah I don't
know how you pronounce those but you
know a notebook and you can write stuff
in it so like usually what I do I always
bring a fresh notebook or just some some
paper to write my notes on and then I
will do like one just a one pager with
some handwritten notes on any session
that I go to and then I usually have a
page at the end where just take notes on
the conversations that I had right so I
know I kind of know who I talk to maybe
you know what they're interested in what
they're doing with Python where they're
from
maybe their contact info if I don't like
exchange contact and for with them right
away and then I found that really helps
so I'm probably gonna run into a bunch
of these people tomorrow again and then
I have just you know a way to connect
with them again even if I don't actually
go and like you know take out my
notebook and then look up their
information that would be kind of
awkward but just the act or
the fact that I'm writing this down
really helps me memorize so I started
doing this and it's great that I don't
have to use my own notebook for this but
I can use the free one so I'm enjoying
that yeah so the other thing is that I I
always bring some business card you can
maybe you can't see this so I always
bring some business cards and I got
these like small ones so I you know I
just put them in carry them around with
me and then you know if sometimes I know
sometimes it's easier to just follow
each other on Twitter or maybe exchange
email addresses but I'm actually found
that it's nice if you have some business
cards and you can just make sure you're
not losing like a critical connection
that you make with someone and also like
in terms of how do you connect with
people at a conference I found that it's
definitely a skill that needs to be
practiced I mean I would say that by
default I'm I'm pretty introverted and
so definitely yeah that was takes you
know takes a little bit just to gear up
and like feel comfortable chatting up
strangers and and talking to them but I
hey I want to say you get a lot better
with practice and then be what I did
what i didn't do today but what i used
to do is like just give me a you know
some kind of quota where it's like okay
you got to talk to you know have like a
conversation with five people today or
ten people it doesn't matter about what
but it just really gets you out of your
comfort zone and gets you in touch with
these people and then i'm the first
person to have you chat with in the
morning that's that's usually all you
need to get started on your day and then
it's it you know it's just it just goes
and it's always fun to meet people and
hear what they're up upto and yeah so
that's also why I carried those right
like sometimes it's just easier to hand
out a business card than it is to use
other apps or try and memorize someone's
email address or maybe you write it down
incorrectly and yadda yadda yadda so I
know like and maybe it makes makes me
look a little bit more professional I
don't know
and and yeah so like I said it was a
really good first day with some good
lunch to lots of coffee and let's see
maybe I can share some of the things
that that I took away from going to
these sessions like like I said I am
I'm starting to notice that I'm getting
more value out of going around talking
to people than I am I feel like I'm
getting value out of sitting down in
these sessions because I could just
watch a video right I mean you can't
talk it's it's good to talk to the
people who are through the speakers
afterwards so I think that that's why I
like to go like going to some sessions
but in a lot of cases there's just not a
lot of value that I get out of these
sessions so I try to be picky about that
and then rather spend some more time the
hallway chatting with people so anyway
so in terms of stuff that I found
interesting today there was really good
talk by Dmitriy trough him off I think
pronouncing that correctly he works for
a jet brain so he works on pycharm and
yeah he gave a really nice overview on
profiling in in Python he was actually
talking about a bug that like some
performance issue in the actual pycharm
debugger that there were then profiling
with a bunch of different profiling
tools to narrow down what the issue was
and then fixed it and I always liked
these kind of story based almost
post-mortem kind of talks so I thought
that was pretty cool um there was oh
yeah the Lightning talks they're always
fun someone was talking about Euro
Python which is the other or like
another big Python conference it's gonna
be in Italy next year I believe
someone's talking at PyCon Namibia which
seemed pretty fascinating too and then I
learned about koala which is like a
multi-language static code analysis tool
which seems like a really cool idea so
you can basically run it on a project
that is that uses not just Python but a
several languages other languages and
then koala is going to figure out what
tools to run on what pieces of the code
and I thought that was a pretty neat
idea there was a really good keynote by
Daniele proceed I think that's how to
pronounce his name or talking about kind
of how we have this attitude
open-source developers to think that you
know if there's a bug we're obligated to
fix it for free like he was I'm you know
I'm having a hard time like kind of
summarizing this in like two or three
sentences but essentially he was talking
about that it is maybe not a good
attitude to expect that all of these
open-source projects and the the authors
of these projects that they're obligated
to maintain these projects forever and a
lot of people actually expect that and
get sometimes they get really angry when
they're submitting bug reports and I
experienced some of that myself with
some of the projects that I did you know
where people are just pissed off at you
because they're using your free software
and they found a bug or maybe it doesn't
have a feature that they want it and
they they can't deal with it and they
you lash out I mean 99% of people are
awesome and like super supportive and
friendly but you always get someone
who's just has this like sense of
entitlement right and and so Daniela was
saying that well maybe that attitude
should change where like the default
should be okay don't really expect me to
support this sure I created it but I'm
not obligated to support it and I know I
haven't really made up my mind yet on
this but I thought it was a pretty good
good no it was just a riga talk like a
really good like story driven very
emotional heartfelt talk so yeah highly
recommend that talk there was a small
session on i think the title was like
doctor i can't stop coding something
like that about how it's better to write
less code and there's kind of fun there
was a really good session it was more
like an interactive kind of
conversational style talk instead of
like a presentation where where someone
was talking or we're speaking about or
kind of leading a conversation on the
human factors off developer productivity
so you know we he covered a lot of a lot
of things like okay you want to make
sure your blood blood sugar levels don't
fluctuate too much because that there's
like scientific
research that shows that this kills your
willpower and you should try and keep it
as stable as possible and he's accident
he actually bought some of the the soil
and stuff which is like like a super
protein shake right where it's like you
buy this since this goop and it it's
like a replacement for your meals and
you just eat that instead of I know
eating a proper meal or cooking a proper
meal and he was experimenting with that
and he kind of uses that when he's
really busy with work and he needs to
just hunker down get something done then
he will have like drink that during the
day just to kind of keep us his blood
glucose on on the same level and then he
found he found that he was more
productive and you know how hydration is
super important and yeah I thought that
was really interesting he was also
talking about how drinking coffee
apparently there's a lot of research
that shows that coffee consumption or
caffeine consumption really relates to
and people getting anxiety and you know
this nervousness and actually I noticed
some of that today because I had so much
coffee today if just from hanging out
all day and talking to people just
drinking more coffee and I felt pretty
frazzled after a while like you know
just like having after having too much
caffeine and just feeling like super
hyper and I think like this really
inspired me actually to go back and
maybe do a no coffee experiment for a
month a year I don't know I should
probably do this for at least like 90
days for it to be effective so yeah a
lot lots of good stuff in in that and I
think it was recorded so I'll try and
like put that in the description at some
point yeah I'd really don't want to
ramble on too much but day one was a
success really looking forward to my
talk tomorrow and I'm gonna do some more
prep work just rehearse my talk a bunch
more times so that's really tight and
I'm below the the 30 minute limit and
then hopefully I can share that with you
soon as well because I think it's going
to be recorded
all right cool well that's it from PyCon
germany 2016 day one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
