don't actually remember where I got it
from but I wrote it down so the question
is how to avoid premature optimization I
know it is bad but I keep doing it so
this is an interesting question if you
don't know what premature optimization
is it's kind of the idea that you try to
optimize or it's the problem that when
you write a program you spend too much
time too early on trying to optimize its
performance or you know to make it
optimal in some other way like make the
code as clean as possible I would also
say and that's premature optimization
and in many cases we can have the
classical definition is to spend too
much time on performance optimization
and doing that too early when the
program is not finished yet and this is
a problem because well any time you
spend on polishing your program there's
also the term gold plating where you
spend time adding fancy bells and
whistles without actually making the
software better at solving the real
problem at hand and this is a problem
and it's it's kind my opinions all kind
of rooted in the same the same issue
there so when I catch myself in gold
plating mode or premature optimization
mode and if if the team that I'm working
with in if the team that I'm working
with kind of it finds itself in that
mode it usually has to do with it's
almost like procrastination in a lack of
direction usually right like if you
don't really know what you need to be
working on next and what the real goal
is that you want to solve it's very easy
to you know to spend time and optimizing
stuff and trying to make it as beautiful
and as fast as possible because that's
fun that's like a fun technical exercise
but it's often not really adding real
value to the users off your program or
it's not really adding real value period
and a good way around that is to always
remind yourself off you know not doing
that essentially you know this sounds
stupid but you know it should always be
on the back of your head that as
developers we have this natural tendency
to
into this premature optimization a gold
plating mode and it's just something we
have to counteract right so there are a
couple of exercises I guess you can do
one thing that really helped me is to
start using the Pomodoro Technique which
which is a Productivity technique where
you give yourself these little time
boxes and you try and finish a task
within that time frame and what that
does for me is that it really keeps me
focused on my goal and you know if after
a Pomodoro period of 20 or 40 minutes or
however long you pick that after that
time box I want to have a tangible
result and usually you know if I catch
myself trying to prematurely optimize
stuff that's that means I didn't set out
to do that you know when I started my
time box and I started like my goal for
for the day let's say or for the morning
was to implement a new feature and I
catch myself doing optimization work
then that means something is wrong I
need to readjust right I only do
optimization work if I purposefully
schedule it like if I sit down and say
okay now you know this needs to be
cleaned up this needs to be rewritten
because it's a liability now and we have
to be careful or you know now we're
we're handing this off to someone else
and needs to be nice and clean or now
we're shelving it we know this actually
solves the problem now we just need to
make it nice and make it make it run
fast so that's kind of one tactic that I
use another thing is this idea and I
think it's something that uncle Bob
Martin came up with great guy like if
you're doing any kind of programming
work definitely look up his his writing
and his books highly recommended I
learned a ton from him and anyway so so
he has this thing where he talks about
make it run make it right make it fast
and the idea there is that any kind of
development work you do any kind of
programming work you do you want to get
you know get something out there make it
make it run like get it to compile and
get it get some output it might be wrong
you know I might just be some sketch
that you've thrown out there but it does
something it's a basic like foundation
you can you can work with then make it
right make it actually produce the right
result make it produce or use
result and then make it fast your you
can swap that out for you know make it
pretty make it make it nice and that's
kind of the priorities that that you
have I think whatever you do you know
and this is kind of applies at
recursively where you want to you want
that to be true for your whole
application and you want that to be true
for any single feature that you're
working on at the time and so this is
this is something that I keep try to
keep myself reminded often for awhile I
had this like you know had this written
on one of my Walt's make it run make it
right make it fast
because I wanted to make that sort of my
mantra when I do programming work so
this is something that could also help
you if it's just something that you want
to remind yourself off and that has
certainly helped me try and not to try
not do too much optimization work too
early because it's often a waste of time
although it's so much fun I know but you
know this person who wrote the question
they've identified it as a problem and
these are some ways that can get around
it alright if you enjoyed this video and
