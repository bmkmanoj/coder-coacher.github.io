a quick recap of sorts for pythons
argument unpacking feature so um to give
you a motivating example here let's say
we have this function that takes these
three arguments X Y Z and you know you
could imagine this is some kind of
vector that we're passing in and we want
to process somehow and in this case
we're just gonna print it out right but
you could imagine this would scale
transform this vector do something with
it so now we're gonna define a couple of
different representations for a 3d
vector so one idea would be just to have
a tuple and that would be the data
structure that would represent a single
3d vector we could also come up with a
sing with it with a different solution
where we say okay we actually we're
actually going to define our vectors
such that they're dictionaries
you
where we kind of explicitly give names
to each to each field and it's probably
not something you would do in reality
like I kind of like the the tuple the
tuple approach here but what I wanted to
show you is that let's say we want to
actually pass these vectors to myfunc
right so one way to do it will be to
actually go and say tuple vac zero tuple
Veck one to pull back to right so we
basically pass in the XYZ coordinates
manually we need to unpack that from our
tuple vector and then we get that
printout and it would be really it would
work really similarly with with the
dictionary vector so again we would say
okay well take the X argument and try
and see if I can make this a little
faster by copying some stuff around you
can already see you know the fact that
I'm copying this stuff around is not a
good sign so a better way to do this and
of course the Python people the creators
of Python have thought of this is
actually to use the unpacking feature in
Python so let me show you how that works
basically what you can do you can put a
little asterisk here looking a little
star and then just pass tuple Veck and
what this is gonna do it's it's gonna
unpack the tuple here and just pass it
to the function in exactly the order
these values are specified in the tuple
vector so what this is gonna do is it's
gonna lead to exactly the same result
right so this is gonna take okay it's
gonna take the first field here and it's
gonna put it into the X argument it's
gonna take the second field put it into
the Y argument it's gonna take the third
field and put it into the Z argument so
we get exactly the same result right so
this guy and this guy they're equivalent
and you can actually do the same thing
with the the dictionary vector because
again here you can tell Python to unpack
the to unpack the dictionary and if you
put the double star it's gonna be smart
enough to actually map the keys in our
dictionary to the function arguments and
and their names because you know a
dictionary doesn't really have an order
associated with it right so it's not
going to be stored like it doesn't know
that X comes first and comes Y and in
comes Z so we need to tell it to to
actually map these keys to the
corresponding function arguments and the
way you do that is by using these two
stars so when you do that it actually
also works and if you try it with a
single star then you're gonna get this
random well it's yeah not really a
random result but basically what happens
is you get the keys unpacked in random
order and that's not what we want so
this might lead to really weird bugs but
if you do it correctly then it can be a
really handy handy shorthand for passing
these larger data structures to a
function just kind of make sure
everything has a nice name to it and you
can you know pass different
representations to the same function
with the same signature and it's gonna
be able to deal with it so something to
keep in mind you know as usual with all
of this stuff you gotta be a little bit
careful not to do or use too much magic
because it can kind of office key office
Kate what you're really trying to do and
what your intentions are but I think in
this case at least it's it's pretty
benign right so if you have your vectors
represented as Python tuples which I
think makes sense in a lot of cases and
you want your function maybe to work
with named coordinates here then doing
something like that I think would be
fair and would actually be a good thing
in terms of readability and making the
code look nice cool I hope this was
helpful kind of a short one and come
back for more if you want
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
