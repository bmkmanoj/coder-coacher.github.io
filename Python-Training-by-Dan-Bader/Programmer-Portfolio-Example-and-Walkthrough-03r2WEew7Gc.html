want to talk a little bit about what
should go on to your programming blog if
you want to run it as you know a
programing portfolio of sorts or
something that that you're creating so
that you know it speaks for you and it
kind of shows your expertise and it's a
way for you to get touched in in touch
with the developer community and also to
make you more desirable as a potential
hire for these companies and I actually
you know to talk about this I went back
to one of the first versions off my
website which is debater or it looks a
little bit different today in terms of
the content and I'm offering and you
know it's just a lot more content up
there in general but how I started out
was very very simple you know I launched
my website debate org and in 2012 and in
terms of what I had on there there was
almost nothing on the site you know this
is um this is not the perfect example of
how he should get started and I'm gonna
walk you through like a better example
that I think would be a good way to
start out today but just in terms of how
I started out back then you know I
basically had two blog posts actually
made that blog post overview really
really big you know I used a huge font
and like this big blurb and the article
preview so um so I had something that
could fill the whole page because I
didn't want to launch with like two tiny
little bullet points um so I try and
make that a little bit more impressive
and then I had like an almost empty
about page and that was it right um now
that's a perfectly fine way to get
started if you know if you just want to
throw something out there do it like
write two articles post them maybe have
an about page that links to your Twitter
whatever it's good enough to get started
if you want to go if you have a little
bit more time to invest and if you want
to spend a little bit more time building
a little bit you know a bit more of a
comprehensive package I'm working on
this thing as an example blog for a
Python developer and I call it
the Jains Python blog example and in
terms of the structure here is actually
quite simple right so I I like having a
very simple navigation it's kind of like
on my side where you just have the nav
on the top here I put it on the side and
it's basically divided into a landing
page which I call start here which which
would introduce yourself and kind of
what you're all about then a list of
articles um some projects that you've
worked on as basically a proof or you
know that you know what you're doing and
some some of your portfolio stuff and
then also an about page and I think that
would be that would be a structure that
would be attainable for a lot of folks
starting out you know relatively simple
to set up but it would still cover all
of your bases that you need to cover and
I just want to walk you through that so
in terms of the landing page which I
call start here um I I think it helps to
just you know kind of give people an
idea of what you're all about right so
in this case we probably start with
something like this like some kind of
tagline and say okay
hi I'm such-and-such a Python software
engineer from such-and-such city and
then maybe a bit of backgrounds just
filler text of you know what you're
interested in why you're you're you
start at this page or the site and then
just give people an overview of some of
the things you offer for example if you
have a newsletter you could link to that
if you have products you could link to
that if people can hire you as a
contractor you could link to that and
then you could also include some recent
articles so that actually brings me to
the next section here so I'm clicking on
articles you can see that this is just
an overview of articles that are
published on the blog um and basically
this just gives people a way to click
through and then read your articles um
and in these articles you know they
could include code examples and you know
these are not real articles these are
just there for filler but in terms of
the structure I think I think that makes
sense and then also very important I
think it's good to have some kind of
projects page if you're offering you
know if what you're offering is your
expertise I think it's a good way to
show what you're offering in this regard
right and this these could just link out
to your github page or your bitbucket
page or whatever open source repository
site you use right so you could just
point people to that stuff and then I
would also include an about page um I've
kind of you know over the last four
years of running my site I've kind of
gotten more comfortable with actually
posting pictures of myself online like
for example you know I've got this like
mug shots kind of like a picture here or
photo here and I think it helps a lot
with actually you know building a
connection with people so these are just
stock photos just to illustrate that I
don't think that photo is actually ideal
maybe you want to look directly at the
camera but you know again start simple
like when I started I didn't have any of
that so I want to help you get a little
bit better than what I used back then
and arguably some of that is even better
than the page or the site that I have
right now so you know again very simple
stuff you could get started with this
relatively easily um it doesn't have to
be super styled like I think matter of
fact for for developer portfolio a lot
of times if you have like a really kind
of low-key style to your blog that or
your website that could be a good thing
you know just kind of um a lot of people
in that space dig the minimalism and
that's feedback that I heard initially
where people are like oh yeah I really
like you know how how all of this stuff
isn't screaming at me I guess like these
days it's a little bit different for me
where some of this stuff is really
screaming at you with these colors and
stuff but if you're just getting started
if you just want to throw something out
there this is perfectly fine and this is
going to put you above what 90 or 95
percent of other developers are doing
so this is absolutely going to make you
more desirable as as a potential hire as
a developer is going to show your
expertise and I you know one of the best
things I ever did for my career was
launching my website so this is a way
you could potentially get started in a
relatively small amount of time so if
you're interested in this topic maybe
you want to give this a shot and start
building your own website I have lots
more to say about this topic because I
you know this is really something that's
dear to my heart because it's done so
much for me and my career like starting
debate or quiz one of the best things
like hands down I ever did for my career
as a software engineer and you know even
when you start out with these humble
beginnings it can really regrow into
something that is going to help you a
lot and so if you're interested in this
topic then just go to debate org on
directly on the homepage you can scroll
down and sign up for my weekly
newsletter I just want to punch in your
email address and I've already talked a
ton about this topic on the newsletter
and kind of how I got started some tips
how people can get started how they can
get free hosting and all that stuff
and there's going to be more because I
think it's such an important topic it
could really do a lot for an engineer
just starting out or if you want to
improve your career as a software
developer as a Python developer I think
starting a website is one of the best
things you can do hands down get started
right now let me know whatever questions
you have to throw them in the comments
in there and I'll do another video where
I try and answer these questions and do
it
good luck with that Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
