I want to talk about how you can figure
out what a Python package or Python
module has to offer
so imagine you're working with a
brand-new Python module maybe one that
you installed off the internet or one
that was included in the Python standard
library and you want to find out how to
use it what what does this package offer
to you what methods does it have what
classes that it doesn't have and how do
you find that out and how do you work
with a brand-new package this is what
we're going to cover in this video so
there are a couple of ways you can
approach this problem and I'm going to
show you one or two that involve the
command line so this is what I have open
here and there's also one that involves
browsing on the internet if you like
that better we're going to cover that at
the end of the video so let's jump right
in into the command line approach we're
going to find out how you can inspect a
Python module the first thing that I'm
going to do is I'm going to install a
popular Python library called requests
and you can see here in this terminal
session I have an activated virtual
environment so a virtual environment is
kind of a sandbox to keep your Python or
to keep third-party Python code that you
install third-party modules that you
install completely separated from your
system Python install and this is going
to help you avoid version conflicts and
it's going to help you just keep a nice
and pristine system environment while
still having the ability to experiment
and to install different versions of the
same package at the same time so this is
a little bit complicated if you've never
done it before but there's a link in the
description where you can learn more
about how to work with virtual
environments and kind of the whole
managing Python dependencies workflows
and skills that you would need around
that all right so what I'm going to do
here now because it's really not the
scope of the video we're going to
install the the requests library
in this case I already had it installed
but you would have to run this pip
install requests command to install it
locally and then I'm just going to boot
up the Python interpreter and I'm going
to go ahead and import this module so
now we've imported it you can see here
successfully imported this module so now
that the question is what this is
request library actually offer me in
terms of functionality in terms of its
public interface in terms of how can I
access the classes inside what constants
are there inside what's what functions
can I call and for that you can use the
dur function in Python so I'm just going
to go and call dur so maybe to show you
that first order is a built-in function
that's built into Python and I can just
point it at any module or any object
really and it's going to tell me the
symbols and the names that this module
exports so now is actually pretty
interesting right because now I can kind
of explore this request module as you
can see here there's a bunch of
interesting stuff in here so if we
wanted to inspect one of them for
example the HTTP error here then we
could do the same thing again
you know we could drill down and kind of
get a sense for maybe what this HTTP
error does but maybe actually a better
approach here would be to use the
built-in help function so in this case
you can use the built-in help function
on a class and what this will do is it's
going to bring up this full screen view
off the doc string or the auto-generated
documentation for this class and there's
some syntax highlighting so you can see
here I can scroll through this and it
can kind of read about this class you
can also hit the spacebar to scroll down
faster and the U key to scroll up again
faster and so I can read everything
about this class without actually having
to consult the docs and to leave this
mode you want to hit Q and it takes you
back to the Python interpreter now the
same thing should work on the top level
request module as well so here we're
getting some help on the request package
kind of from all of the documentation
where I guess the kind of the entry
documentation entry level documentation
for a request library and also tells you
here what other data is available in
this package and sort of the contents of
this package so this can be extremely
helpful it's a great way to explore a
package from the Python interpreter and
there's one more trick I wanted to show
you here so you've just seen the Derr
function right now a lot of times it
would be really nice if we could search
for things for example if I'm looking to
if I'm looking for anything related to
HTTP in this case would be really nice
in fact if I could search for that and
this you can do this so in this case
what I sometimes do is write a little
list comprehension to do the filtering
and to find the stuff that I need so
what we're going to do here now is we're
going to create a little list
comprehension to do the filtering is I'm
just going to say name for name in there
Quest's can guess what this is going to
evaluate to is exactly the same thing
that we have before and now I'm going to
apply the filtering so here I'm just
going to say if HTTP in name so this is
going to do some filtering you didn't
find anything
however we knew that there was
definitely an HTTP error in there
earlier on right when we looked at the
result so what we need to do here is we
need to take a lower case of that name
and now we try that you can see here
okay so this is HTTP error we found in
there and I can search for other stuff
just by modifying this list that list
comprehension
for example let's see we get fur gets or
I guess there's a method name get maybe
anything related to connections or yeah
there we get connect timeout in
connection error and then I could call
helped on dose as well
and then just kind of work my way down
right I guess you get the idea so that's
that's pretty good you can do that with
the standard Python interpreter however
there is one other way that I want to
show you that works from the command
line so I'm going to go back to my
terminal here and there's a bunch of
alternative interpreters for example
ipython and PT Python and one that I
personally really like it's called beep
- and it's deliver a little more
advanced than the standard Python
interpreter so for example what it can
do is it does autocomplete so now I've
imported a request library and when I go
requests dot B Python is actually going
to show me all of the available names
here in this module and I can you know
search for them or kind of filter this
list down and it's kind of neat you can
just use this Auto completion and then
again you know it can call help on those
guys and inspect the help for that
particular class or name or object or
whatever it is and yeah but the basic so
use case here is getting the
autocomplete and the filtering so that's
kind of neat and it goes beyond that so
even you know when I ask something here
let's say this class and I put the open
parentheses it gives me a preview off
the docs trained for this class and also
the arguments it takes so again this Sun
you know some autocomplete or some I
guess like code inspection going on here
that shows me what's going on that's all
available completely from a command line
like I personally like to work a lot
from the command line because it's nice
and fast it's available on any system I
can use the same workflows wherever I am
this is not going to go away the stuffs
going to stick around forever it's
really stable so this is why I like
doing that of course you could do the
same thing you know in sublime text with
the anaconda plug-in or you could also
of course install pycharm or pydev or
any of the other Python IDs and they
have similar functionality personally I
really like B Python for the server
stuff because
I know it looks kind of neat and I like
working with it but obviously you know
do whatever works for you and the
autocomplete list is really nice on that
alright so you don't leave the
interpreter here and now I'm going to
switch to my browser
you
so like I said earlier there's also a
way for you to get this information from
documentation or you know by browsing
the internet so you don't have to
necessarily work on a percentage with
the command line to figure out what a
library does like matter of fact you
probably shouldn't in most cases in most
cases you should be consulting the
documentation for those libraries so now
here I'm on Python requests org which is
the documentation for the requests
module and what's really great about
this is that this module has great
documentation right so they kind of tell
you how to use the library to tell you
what's available here and this is made
for human consumption
so someone specifically sat down and
wrote this user guide and you can
benefit from that right so often most of
the times a good library will have
something like a QuickStart guide that
you can click through and you can kind
of inspect that or you know you can read
that and work through the examples and
this is often going to be a much faster
way for you to find out what the library
has to offer there's one more thing I
wanted to show you so look for generally
generally what I try to do is look for
the API documentation because that's
going to tell you what the library has
to offer and it's going to give you a
nice overview of the classes and the
methods available and how what you can
do with them and how to use them right
so here requests again has pretty great
documentation all this stuff is
clickable so this is going to tell you
you know this constructs in sense a
request this method here so now we might
be wondering okay what's actually
request what we can click on that and it
takes us exactly to give the
documentation for a request object even
has a little example here and it tells
us what's available on on this object in
terms of other methods and you can even
in this particular documentation setup
we can even jump to the dark edge to the
source code directly without having to
you know pull up the source code in an
editor you can just jump here and then
kind of read what's going on
and you can see here that this
documentation is actually auto-generated
from the docs string which is pretty
cool because that makes it more likely
that it's actually accurate and up to
date so I guess in most cases it makes
it makes a lot of sense to try and find
if a module that you want to use have
proper documentation right like all of
the built in documentation are also
built in modules for Python have great
documentation that's been worked on you
know over years and really stable and
sort of well thought out and the best
modules are you're going to find the
best third-party modules they will also
provide really good documentation and
you know requests here I think it's
doing a fantastic job and have all kinds
of things that it covers here and I'm
going to be very very helpful when
you're getting used to a new Python
module for the very first time so just a
quick recap what we covered in this
video I showed you some command line
workflows for inspecting Python modules
and classes and kind of find out what
what you can do with them and then also
we talked about how you can do the same
thing by finding the online
documentation for a module I'm just kind
of browsing through that and working
with that so if you enjoyed this video
and you learned something from it then
consider subscribing to my channel here
on YouTube where I have many more videos
and tutorials for Python developers and
you can find the subscribe button the
lower right of your screen or in the
description for this video so good luck
applying some of these techniques in
your own development workflow and happy
