question as a YouTube comic here from
San Shi and I'm I'm gonna try and tackle
it in this video so this is gonna be
there's gonna be a challenging one and
I'm not gonna read the whole thing but
you know I just want to go over the key
parts here and then kind of try and
circle in the the question might be a
little bit rambley video but what the
heck maybe it's helpful for some of you
alright so this is where I need my
glasses okay so the question is hello
Dan I'm starting to learn Python and I'm
still learning the syntax and functions
classes etc my problem with any kind of
programming is that no one really says
how it is done for example a login page
has to be made for a website okay you
make the program that wants to user
input and it checks a DB if the user is
registered registered if yes the user
can click away on the website how does
this process go on who implements all
that on the website on the server who
does the design for the page and
implements the small or your small login
program do you need to know all that
stuff so I'm gonna skip over some things
here so basically this is about
programming being so abstract and in the
way it's taught being very very far away
from from solving real world problems so
since she goes on he says in all honesty
I have no idea what you guys are doing
as program as a programmer and how and
if you are in a team and how the work is
split all the learning process for us
for a syntax is clear there are rules
and you just have to remember them like
a foreign language but no one wants to
show what they actually do with it
people talk about programming like
theory it's like real-life math that
solves problems and it's 99% of math
that is used and a 1% high class
theoretical mathematics that does not
even use numbers in the books okay sorry
if I came across a little frustrated but
I would love to really I would really
love to find someone who will talk about
this and bring some clarity into the
whole thing yeah so okay so let me try
and kind of kind of restate the question
or the way I understood this question so
Singhji it sounds like you are
well frustrated with with learning how
to program and kind of learning how to
solve real-world problems using Python
and that seems to be the case because
the way you've been learning Python is
that you feel comfortable with the
syntax if I got that right and kind of
the basic fundamentals but it's really
hard now to make that leap and to
actually you know write some software
that does stuff in the real world like
write a webpage or white write a web
application with the Python skills
you've picked up so far and this is
something you know that I hear all the
time from people getting into software
development it's kind of this this
terrible like almost like a valley of
despair you have to get through where
you feel like you know you've got the
the basics of the language under your
belt but how do you go to actually
making real programs you know how do you
how do you cross that how do you cross
that chasm and I think that is the
biggest problem in computer science or
programming education today because it's
very easy to go and be like oh yeah yeah
yeah you know you just learn the syntax
it's very easy right like you can add
numbers and like this is a function in
blah blah blah blah blah and then you're
gonna be a programmer well whatever the
definition of the word programmer is but
in my mind it's it's not just about
knowing the syntax it's about being able
to actually use programming as a tool
and to solve problems in the real world
and if you just know the basic syntax of
programming or if Python let's say most
of the time or most people are not going
to be able to make that leap on their
own and and likewise what happens a lot
is that you know there are great
tutorials that kind of take you by the
hand and they show you how to build an
application and to end and the problem
is if you just kind of click through
that tutorial
and copy and paste a bunch of code
around then again it doesn't really help
you with your ability to do this stuff
on your own so it's very easy to kind of
get get stuck in this in this valley
right and in this kind of bad place
where you feel like you know a lot of
stuff about programming but you also
don't really know how to apply it and
actually become a programmer quote
unquote so well I'm certainly not going
to be able to solve this problem because
I think it's an industry-wide problem
it's it's something that I think about
almost every single day right because
I'm now in the business of trying to
teach people how do how to get better at
Python and improve their programming
skills and I've got a couple of ideas
there on on this topic that I'd want to
touch on in this video so well the
problem here is that we're trying to
tell people that learning how to program
is just about you know getting a couple
of books reading them and maybe
following some tutorials and doing that
for 3-4 months and then they're a
programmer where that's just not the
reality and I don't think you know if
you're if you're asking me I don't think
we'll ever get to that point you know
where the education the material is so
good that this will be possible because
learning how to program is freaking hard
it's just the reality of it it's it's
hard and it takes a lot of time and it
takes just a huge investment you know in
a time wise energy wise and and just a
lot of practice to get anywhere good at
it you know if you're compared with
learning an instrument well if you're
trying to learn how to play the guitar
you would maybe expect to be able to
play an okay sounding song after after
six month or so but would you expect to
be the next eddie van halen
you know after six months no not really
you know like i this guy like he's been
practicing for four
decade and you know just hanging out in
his in his room and and playing scales
up and down and trying to compose songs
for years before he did anything kind of
substantial and anything anything
anything real if you will now of course
you know what I like here I'm comparing
someone who's like a musical virtuoso
with with kind of the the that that's
one extreme and the other extreme is
it's just wanting to add some real value
to the world using programming right so
so I'm not saying like you have to spend
like ten years in a basement to get
anywhere near to get anywhere with
programming but it's gonna be hard and
it's gonna take a lot of time and that's
the reason why this skill is so valuable
right that's the reason why people are
making six-figure incomes with this
stuff because it is a rare skill and
because it is freaking hard and because
it takes huge sacrifice and it takes a
ton of focus and it is very very hard to
do and so I think it's it's um it's
challenging to go around and tell people
that you know they can just be awesome
at programming in in in two or three
weeks like that that doesn't really work
like that in my experience and so to
kind of reel this this rant or whatever
back in what I want to say here to use
Senshi is that I think you're doing okay
and this is a natural you know a natural
thing this feeling of where you're like
right in between this knowing the basics
and then not feeling ready or
comfortable yet to build real-world
stuff and you I would encourage you to
actually try and bang your head against
these problems you know to try and get
get something small done to try and
build up that body of knowledge and and
you touched on some things you know as
especially web development is crazy
complex because you need to understand
so many different things like you said
there's databases there's the front-end
stuff there's web forms their CSS
there's all this stuff that is you know
it
it's it's just a super wide field in a
super deep field as well so try like my
advice here would be try and take it
step by step
try and see if you can solve the problem
that you want to solve in some other way
maybe you don't have to build a web
application maybe all you need to do for
starters is write a little script that
store stuff in a database and pulls it
out again and try and tackle these
things one by one and be comfortable
with the fact that this is gonna be a
long term project and it's gonna take a
lot of you know sweat and tears to to
become a good programmer to master this
skill so well I hope this wasn't too
discouraging you know I definitely
didn't want to do that I can definitely
sense you know that you're passionate
about this stuff and I think that's
great and you you please keep going you
know please keep going and there's
always an end of the tunnel here an end
of the proverbial programming tunnel and
and you're gonna get there but it's
gonna take time it's gonna take a lot of
banging your head against the wall but
it'll be worth it in the end all right
super rambling answer I'd love to hear
your opinion on this topic so if you're
listening to this video you know
everyone please leave a comment and kind
of share your stories and share your
perspective on this topic because I also
agree it's kind of not talked about
enough and I think there's strength in
that in that community and just you know
sharing our thoughts and and kind of
hearing about everyone's programming
journey alright so if you'd like me to
ramble on and talk about some question
that you had about software development
or programming or whatever just leave a
comment below and I'll try and tackle it
in one of my next videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
