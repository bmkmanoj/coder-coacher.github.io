Python developer in this video I want to
give you some actionable ideas that you
can implement into your day-to-day life
as a software developer as a wannabe
software developer to become better at
your development skillset so number one
you want to code as much as possible
coding is a skill where you get better
by doing so you want to spend as much
time as possible on actually coding and
honing your skills and getting better at
coding so whatever you can do if you can
make more time in your day make this a
daily habit ideally then that's going to
be good for you you want to spend as
much time as possible coding another
idea there is what if you could teach
other people how to program share your
knowledge share what you learned whether
that's online in the form of blog posts
or videos or if you can go to a meet-up
and give a presentation there give a
presentation to your team or give a
presentation at a Python conference
that's gonna really help you understand
deeply the topic that you will talk
about this is really something that puts
you on the spot you know or just puts
you puts you out there in front of an
audience in front of people and you
better know what you're talking about
and for me that that was really helpful
and kind of forcing myself to to really
understand certain topics that I maybe
didn't have enough time to do to spend
with beforehand and now because I wanted
to go out and show other people how this
is done as part of a workshop or
something else I really have to drill
down and really understand it so I could
teach it to others so this is sort of a
great hack that you can apply to kind of
push your push you forward and kind of
push yourself out of your comfort zone
how do you recommend to teach other
people how to program another thing you
can do is to work with other people it
is it is very very enjoyable to learn
from other people if you can work in a
group setting in a team setting and you
can just learn from you know the
programming teak techniques they use the
the feedback they can give you on your
code and just on the the general
interactions and watching someone else
code and kind of seeing how they how
they use their workflow
and and what they're doing so this can
happen either in person you can do
online pair programming with someone
else and it could also happen
asynchronously if you're a part of a
distributed team and maybe you're
working on an open-source project with
some other people and you're getting
feedback on your code there so I would
encourage you to go and seek out
projects where you work with other
people and to get some real-world
feedback on your programming code
because that's super important and
that's gonna help you gonna help you
move forward and really I think it's
also a great hack
just to force yourself or to encourage
yourself to code on a regular basis
right if you're embedded into some kind
of team you know I'm you know obviously
on your job you're the people will
expect you to code but if you're trying
to teach yourself Python on the side if
you're embedded in some kind of team
that creates this accountability for you
and and where people expect you to
deliver some value to add to the team
then this can be a great way to stay
motivated and to become better at
programming Python another thing you can
do and I would highly encourage you to
do that as well is to just consume as
much content as you can you know be
reading about Python follow what's going
on you can either do that with free
articles or paid books or courses like
the ones that I create and you can you
can find great content out there great
value out there and you can learn the
stuff from the comfort of your home it's
gonna really gonna help you increase
your skills and after your skill set and
it is it is a crazy time that we live in
right now or you can just do that by
sitting in front of your computer you
know or you could always just get a
digital copy of a book and sit down and
learn about a topic that you're really
interested in and this could be a great
way to improve your Python programming
skills as well alright so those were
some strategies you can use to improve
your Python programming skills if this
was helpful and you'd like to get your
own question answered in one of these
videos and just leave a comment below
and I'll try and do a video answer for
you in one of my future videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
