sublime text tip for Python developers
so many of you have probably seen these
little vertical lines here in your
sublime text window that kind of hint at
how your code is indented
they're called indent guides they're
enabled by default and they're kind of
useful right so they kind of tell you
how your code is indented and they would
also tell you if your indentation was
off by one or two spaces because you
would get an extra line where there
should be none so they're sort of useful
there is however one setting or one
change you can make to make them a
little bit more useful in my mind and
I'm going to show you how to do that now
so you can go to preferences and your
user settings and the indent guides are
controlled by the indent guide options
setting and by default this will be set
to draw underscore normal so if I remove
this line we would get exactly the same
result as what I just showed you so this
is just the default
however there's actually another option
you can put there and that is the draw
active setting so when I save this and
switch back you can see that these
guides kind of have disappeared because
now they will only show up for the the
code blocks where your cursor is play is
place so the the active code plot code
blocks so if I click here you can see
that the indent guide is back and it'll
only show up for the specific line and
kind of the the overarching blocks here
so I like this setting or like I like
setting the indent guides this way if
I'm writing Python because what's really
cool now is that you know when I'm
editing this line and I look to the left
I can immediately see that okay
this piece here belongs to that four
statement because of that guideline and
the whole thing also belongs to this
function here this method here
and then because there's another indent
guide here on the left I can instantly
know that this whole block of code for
for this function actually belongs to
some overlying structure so in this case
it's it's a class and I get all this
information just by kind of glancing at
these indent guides and what I like
about switching the setting to draw
active also is that it's a little bit
less cluttered because you know for when
I scroll down I don't place my cursor I
don't actually get these guidelines here
and I find that a little bit nicer
because usually I want to look at them
when I'm editing the code and it just
kind of kind of draws my my focus on the
lines that I'm editing however you can
actually combine these settings and you
could say draw normal and draw active at
the same time so you could activate both
of them and then you would get the
regular indent guides and also the the
colored ones for for active lines in my
mind that's a little bit too cluttered
so I usually just go with the draw
active setting by itself but you know
give it a shot and see what works best
for you I highly recommend this for
writing Python with sublime text cool I
hope this helped you out and talk to you
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
