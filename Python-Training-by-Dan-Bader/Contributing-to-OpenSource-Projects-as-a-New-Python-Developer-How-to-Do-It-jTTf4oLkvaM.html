to answer a question that I got from a
reader the other day so the question is
how do I start to contribute to an open
source project as a relatively new
Python developer um and he goes on and
says I want to build up a portfolio of
projects I have worked on and
contributed to and not just a portfolio
of my own contrived projects I'm
thinking that evidence shown on get up
or similar could be useful to a
relatively new programmer like myself in
order to demonstrate credibility and I
really like that thinking behind that
you know not whole motivation because I
think it is true so if you have an open
source project as a developer that
you've contributed to or dad you've
maybe started yourself that is going to
be a strong signal to potential
employers that you're you know you're
just going above and beyond what other
people are doing and I can really help
you get the job that you want so really
good tactic really good strategy I'm
totally aligned with that with that
thinking here and I guess the question
was about how to get started right how
do you start contributing to open source
as a relatively new Python developer so
I don't actually know how much
experience this person has but you know
I'm just going to assume they're sort of
like an entry-level junior level
position and when it comes to Python
they're Python skills so there are a
couple of thoughts and how you might get
started
I guess one way to do it would be to
just start your own project you know
just write something that you think
other people might find useful and you
could get inspired maybe by browsing
through Stack Overflow questions and
just seeing if there's some stuff that
comes up time and time again maybe you
could create some kind of library that
helps people with that or maybe you can
take an existing library from another
programming language that doesn't exist
yet in Python and you port it over and
you create a Python version of that
obviously you want to give credit where
where you did that and that could be
really valuable project and it's maybe
something that you can pull off even as
a relatively new Python developer
it might also just be too much work and
it might be you know super scary to do
that and it might be you know biting off
a lot more than then then you feel
comfortable chewing at this point and
you're in your Python journey right so
maybe not that great of an option um
the other option I can think of is where
you go in and you start contributing or
you try and start contributing to other
people's open-source projects you know
where it's actually something that
you're not starting yourself and you you
are not in control of the project but
you're working with other people and
that's actually a pretty great signal to
send to to other employers as well
because it kind of shows you know you
know how to play nicely with other
developers and you know how to navigate
everyone's quirks and you know some
personalities can be kind of tough to
work with and dad that could be a great
asset you know for your portfolio so how
do you get started with that well one
way to do it is to just jump in and
maybe create a pull request for a
project or you know just send someone a
bunch of code now I know that's what a
lot of people do because I get a lot of
those on some of my open source projects
but the problem with that is a lot of
times it's very hard for the maintainer
to to actually do something meaningful
with that code right you know they
didn't write it themselves so they don't
understand it they have to read it that
costs time maybe the person was
implementing the contributor was
implementing something feature that
nobody really asked for maybe it was
something that just complicates the code
maybe the the code standards are not up
to snuff like I get a lot of code that
doesn't have tests for example and if I
want to bring that in then I'm going to
have to spend a bunch of time write
those tests right and so whatever you do
there you kind of want to do it from
from the angle of where maybe you're
trying to build more of a relationship
first with the the team that's
maintaining that particular project and
actually see what what they're looking
for what they think should be done on
the project and they're going to give
you some tips ideally on how to
contribute to this project so this is
more I feel like this is more a social
problem than it is a code problem
so on what I would do is if there's a
project you really enjoy working with
maybe what you can do is you can start
you know helping helping an existing
project by providing some support to
other users and maybe there's a forum
where you can jump on and just reply to
people's questions or maybe there's the
github bug tracker for that for that
project or you know some other
open-source bug tracker for that
particular project and you can jump in
there and respond to a couple of
people's questions and just see if you
can be helpful and that's going to give
you an idea also who the people are that
are working on this thing and then once
you've you always want to count come in
in my opinion will always want to come
in and bring some value and demonstrate
that year that you're a good actor right
like in this system like that you want
to contribute to this thing and so one
of the best ways to do it if a complete
beginner is actually just trying like
you know help other people and take some
take some of the work off from the
maintainer by doing that and then you
know maybe one day like a little bit
later when you have some kind of
relationship with them or they've seen
your name a couple of times it could be
like hey do you actually have anything
you know that that could be worked on
like I actually notice maybe we could
improve the doc so we could rearrange
this or we could you know we could make
the website for the project little bit
nicer improve the readme so that is
often stuff that's very welcomed because
it takes a lot of you know it takes a
lot of work to maintain the technical
documentation but it's actually super
important for the long-term success of a
project like that so if you can come in
and help with some of those things that
most other people don't really like
doing then you actually stand a much
better chance of being accepted as a
contributor versus just you know
throwing a bunch of code over the wall
and seeing what sticks so this is
probably the strategy I would take as
more of an entry level Python developer
you know where you find a project and
there's always you know any project
whether large or small it can benefit
from having someone improve the
technical documentation you know having
like fixing some typos and doing stuff
like that you know that's always well
appreciated that increases your chance
so much more
to actually get a change merged into the
project and and to get credit for that
change so this is probably the strategy
that I would take you know it is this is
not only about like reaching out to
people on the bug tracker this may be
also like just sending you know someone
an email just being friendly like hey I
haven't liked this a bad idea what do
you think about this or you know ideally
you want to assume the person
maintaining a project is very busy and
you want to do whatever you can to not
create extra work for them but to
actually be a net benefit for them right
so where it's like whatever you can do
when you start that that that
relationship with that person whatever
you can do to just bring a bunch of
value without actually them having to
you know reply to like a 500 word email
or them having to read like your 500
word line code change and then having to
do a bunch of work whatever you can do
is to kind of come in in a way where
what you do is really really helpful
that's going to Vasc vastly increase
your your chance of success there to get
your your contribution accepted now you
know for my open-source project really
the people that I like working with are
our people where I feel like I trust
them you know I feel like they get it
and they get the the where the project
is supposed to go and then I feel much
more comfortable on bringing them on as
contributors because I don't you know I
do this in my free time I don't get paid
anything for it and I don't want to
create some sort of environment that
that I don't enjoy you know I don't
enjoy collaborating with people that I
don't like as a person and I don't care
you know how great they are as
developers and I feel like a lot of
other people maintaining open-source
project are similar like that you know a
lot of times like there's so much focus
on the technical stuff when it comes to
programming I feel like a lot of times
what is really important is the human
relationships and and you know I'm not
trying to like I guess like make this
all sound like very wishy-washy and kind
of like hippie flowerpower ish I mean at
the end of the day you know you want to
you want to have great code you want to
get the project pushed forward but what
I'm realizing more and more is just you
know how much energy
takes to work with people that you don't
like working with right and and that is
just something that I feel like a lot of
maintainer x' have come to realize and
for that reason they're they're more
likely to work with you if you can just
bring a bunch of value not create extra
work for them and then just kind of be a
pleasant person you know it's like human
interaction 101 and it totally applies
to this computer stuff as well the other
thing that I wanted to say is that um I
know it is really hard to take that step
right like it is super hard to take you
know to take that first step and
actually like share some of your
contributions with with someone else or
you know with with an existing open
source project and if you have a
maintainer who has done like really
great stuff for you know on this project
it's like a super well known Python
project how do you like how do you do
that you know I know it's very um it
takes a lot of determination to overcome
that this initial barrier right and
really really do it and reach out so
what I found is that it is much easier
to do that when you either meet people
in person or let's just say a more
personal setting um even though that's
online so what you can do for example
many conferences especially for Python
PyCon for example they have what is
called sprints where people stay a
little bit longer after the main
conference is over and they just get
together and work on a bunch of
open-source projects you know work on
some project and the great thing there
is that you can just show up there and
be like hey I would love to help I don't
know what to do here this is sort of my
skill level do you have anything that
that I could tackle and you're going to
find that a lot of times when you meet
people in person they are going to be
very very helpful and maybe they're
going to spend a bunch of time even to
train you to get up to speed with this
project so you can start making changes
so this can be a really good way also to
get your foot in the door if you can do
that and actually show up where these
people are you know and I know this can
be super hard when you're you know
living somewhere where there's no
meetups
there is no conferences where you know
you can't fly there because the stuff is
expensive too and maybe you just can't
do it so there's other communities where
people get together and do some of that
and happens in a more personable setting
so for example I run a forum called
pythonista cafe you can find it at
pythonista cafe comm and that is sort of
a walled garden or you know a closed
community of people where we put a lot
of emphasis that we accept the right
members into this community and so in
this community there have been some
projects where people have collaborated
and it's it's just a you know and a
better setting a safer setting in that
sense where people can ask can feel
comfortable asking quote-unquote dumb
questions you know where you can just
say like hey I would love to do this I
don't know how to do it but can someone
help me out and you have a far more
likely chance that someone else is going
to respond and kind of take you by the
hand rather than you just getting shut
down if you do the same thing on a
public forum where people you know some
people are just going to be mean and and
not treat the beginners or the newbies
nicely and so you know there is
community there are communities like
that even online where you can where
it's easier for you to break in and and
feel more comfortable and then actually
do these like meaningful contributions
and then you know you can work your way
way up so it's all about this like stair
stepping your way up right like once
you've you've kind of gotten the hang of
it like initially it will be maybe a
little bit frightening how the whole
like github pull requests stuff works
and you know how do you submit a pull
request how does it get reviewed how do
you make other changes how do you pull
in the latest changes from the the
mainline the master branch can get and
all these technicalities you know that
that you have to learn that are really
really difficult the first time you do
them but once you're past that barrier
you know with your first couple of
contributions then you can step up your
game and this was really like a long
term a long term play and and it's
really like about building those
relationships and you know doing this
over the long term and then maybe
getting invited or getting asked for
help
for other projects oh so this is kind of
the you know my perspective on this
stuff this is how I would view this and
this is how I would approach open source
contributions and building up a
portfolio with these open source
contributions as a relatively new
developer or as a relatively new Python
developer specifically alright so I hope
this was helpful let me know when you
contribute to open source you know just
leave a comment or just to share your
excitement with us here and let us know
what what kind of project you worked on
I'd really love to know that right
thanks so much for listening and have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
