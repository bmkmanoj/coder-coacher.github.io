Python is great so today I want to show
you pythons in place value swapping
feature let's say we have these two
variables you know a and B
and we want to swap them so that the
value of a is gonna be 42 and the value
of B is gonna be 23 the classic way to
do that is by using a temporary variable
where we're gonna say okay we're going
to store the value of a and then we're
going to say okay AE equals to B and if
override a and then we'll assign B to
the temporary variable so it has the the
previous value of a or kind of the
original value of a and then we'll see
that we've swapped these two variables
okay actually in Python there is an
easier way to do this which is really
handy to know so in Python you can
actually just say a B equals B a so you
can use the tuple syntax to swap two
variables so now when we check the value
of a value P you'll see we'll have the
original values again that we have in
the beginning because you know we first
swapped in with the temporary variable
and then that we swapped them back with
this trick and yeah this thing is really
handy you you're probably not gonna you
know have to use this all that often but
when you do it that's kind of the
pythonic way to swap the values of two
variables and always handy for
programming interviews and stuff so yeah
maybe something to keep in mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
