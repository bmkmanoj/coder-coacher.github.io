repository and while pi pi is the
official package repository for python
right now it is about to get superseded
by warehouse which is going to be its
successor so let's talk a little bit
about warehouse and how this transition
is going to go so warehouse is going to
replace pi PI eventually but right now
warehouse is only running in a public
beta testing mode the idea with
transitioning pi PI to warehouse is that
ideally you wouldn't have to worry about
the transition at all you would just use
your pip commands as you did before but
instead of downloading files from pi PI
they would actually find and download
packages from warehouse now let's take a
quick look at warehouse like I said
warehouse is available for a public beta
access right now and you can find it at
pi pi org so let's take a look ok so
let's take a look at a warehouse pi pi
successor so we get this banner here
that tells us this is a beta version or
a pre-production version of warehouse
and eventually that warning is going to
go away as warehouse takes over and you
can already see here the website looks a
little bit more friendly than the
classic pi PI but in terms of
functionality it is very very similar so
again I'm going to just search for
requests here and in this time you can
see that the search results are actually
a little bit better so they look a lot
nicer and they seem to be more relevant
so in this case warehouse seems to know
that hey there is a package called
request and it is the most popular one
so it actually number one search result
here so let's take a look again you get
a mixture off the readme or the
description for the package and in a
bunch of metadata and it's just
presented to you in a much more friendly
way and there's also this little hint on
how you would go about installing this
package for example which is nice and it
looks like they also got the image
formatting issue under control so now
all the package metadata lives on the
left here so again you pretty much have
the same categories and the same
information here
and then when you scroll further down
we're back at the changelog and stuff
like that so all the information is
still in here it's just presented in a
different way so warehouse in PI PIR
really similar but warehouse is just a
more modern iteration and a more
friendly version of what PI P I used to
be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
