question from Miro on youtube so Mira
Road hi Dan I've been really enjoying
your videos lately thank you very much
and I would like to know what we what
would be your advice for a graduating
high school student who wants to study
computer science or software engineering
so this is a super super broad question
which makes this kind of interesting
right because I just get to pick and
choose and talk about whatever I want
those are my favorite kind of videos so
if you're getting ready to go to college
I'm assuming with the with the goal to
at some point either get a job as a
software developer or to stay in
academia know maybe go for a PhD and
kind of go on the research track and
maybe become a professor at some point
in both case I want to give you the same
advice so just to give you a little bit
of background on myself so I actually I
also went to college got a computer
science degree there got a bachelor's
degree in computer science and also did
a masters and I was considering doing a
PhD I didn't do it in the end because I
wanted to go out into industry and do
something more practical but I've you
know I've been on that track I did that
in Germany but I feel like most of this
will actually translate to to your
typical college situation so what I
would focus on or would you need to
realize if you're going to college for
computer science is that a lot of the
stuff you learn a lot of your education
there it will be focused on theoretical
knowledge and that is good you know
that's valuable and that's really the
stuff that's gonna stick with you long
term like the computer science
fundamentals and the generic knowledge
that you can then apply to practical
problem-solving now what I would
absolutely try and focus on if you have
the time is to get enough practical
experience under your belt you know if
whether that's through doing side
projects or you know picking your
picking your courses so that you go
after stuff that actually teaches you
real-world programming
like like actual practical programming
and coding skills so for example I
remember going to school with a bunch of
people that were really really great
fantastic actually it's solving problems
in an exam situation you know doing you
know solving math problems in an exam
but they weren't actually that great at
implementing software that worked and
solving problems through programming
that that that involves other tasks like
you know actually building something
from scratch like setting up your
environment and actually figuring out
how to solve a problem in to end you
know in my experience like the
theoretical knowledge that's often just
a small slice of the other skills you
need to have to be effective as a
software engineer practice as a
developer in practice so I would try and
do stuff if you can that helps you build
those practical skills and whether
that's you know things that you do on
your own like build little side projects
maybe start a blog and actually write
that in in you know code that yourself
for example actual things where you can
later go to someone new apply for a job
and actually point to something
practical that you've done and this is
absolutely possible in a academic or
like a college context as well for
example some friends and I we we went
and wrote our own operating system which
again is like a very academic sort of
example you know we didn't really write
anything that would replace Linux or
Windows or whatever but we wrote
something practical and to end from
scratch and we didn't just sit into a
sit down in in our theoretical operating
systems class and read a bunch of books
and we're like oh yeah we sort of get
how that works no we took that and and
found a way to do that and actually get
credited for get credits for that to
write a real operating system from
scratch that we could then run on real
hardware and that was that was great you
know that's how I learned how to program
in C for example so I really really try
if I were in your shoes and try and do
something practical while you're at
college because
that is gonna be really really helpful
in the long run if you if you need to
apply for jobs and these these are
really the skills that are gonna make
and break you as a junior developer if
you have some practical hands-on stuff
that you can actually do right like some
bring really bring some value to the
table and not just have the strong
theoretical knowledge so that would be
my advice and really honestly I think
the same is true in most cases if you're
going for a more theoretical track or in
a long term you want to stay sort of in
academia and you want to get your PhD in
that case I mean sure the theoretical
theoretical side is going to be more
important competitively but it will also
help you immensely if you have some real
like practical coding skills that
they're just gonna help you in your job
you know whatever data crunching you
need to do whatever programs you need to
write it helps just so much if you if
you know how to use git and how to work
with source control and just to do all
these practical things that maybe seem
like menial tasks in some in some under
some circumstances right we're you're
thinking like oh I'm solving all these
complicated theoretical problem like
these this discrete math problems and
whatnot but really I would always try
and also see the theory of the practical
application for this stuff and and make
sure that you actually know how to
program and this is in my experience at
least something that you're gonna have
to focus on yourself and really make
sure it happens because most colleges
are most cult-like most of the time your
college education won't really focus on
the practical skills so with that said
wishing your best of luck this seems
like a cool journey I'm excited for you
that you can take this to the next level
and you know really build up your
computer science fundamentals and your
computer science and theoretical skills
this was great I really really had a
great time going to college as well
super glad I did get a computer science
degree and it was it was I had a great
time so I would encourage you to do this
