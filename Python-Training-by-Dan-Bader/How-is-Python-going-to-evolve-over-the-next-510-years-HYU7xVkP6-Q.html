Python QA call that I put out on Twitter
asking for questions that you'd like me
to cover I got the following very very
interesting question so run Thomas here
he asked how is Python going to evolve
in the next five to ten years and when I
saw this question I stopped for a moment
and I gave it some thought and I came to
the conclusion that it is very very hard
to predict what's gonna happen over the
next five to ten years in tech you know
not just Python but tech in general it's
moving so fast it's very very difficult
to predict that so I wanted to get some
more data so I actually threw this back
out to everyone on Twitter and there
were some very very interesting
responses so to answer this question how
is Python going to change or the next
five to ten years what's gonna happen to
the Python language I'm gonna go over
these responses that I got here and
discuss them and I think then we're
gonna get a very broad picture off what
the community thinks is going to happen
to Python over the next five to ten
years so let's jump right in alright
first reply here Python will grow into a
lizard that's fairly likely I'm not sure
if there's gonna be a good thing or bad
thing for us we're gonna have to rename
all of our projects but yeah because of
Python grew some legs
alright so Gorin says that python is
going to be a leading programming
language for IOT and I believe that
stands for the Internet of Things so the
idea that well basically you have a ton
of devices that that are all connected
to the Internet and basically every
little thing will be connected to the
Internet in the future which is
something that many people are
predicting just as you know a way for
tech to move in general and so göran
thinks that python will be a leading
programming language in this space now
this is very interesting this is not
something that I've heard
before I think with the the attention
and the traction that Python is seeing
at the moment where a lot of new
programmers are learning Python it might
be likely that Python is going to play a
big role in this and to be honest is not
something that I've considered but I
think this is an interesting thought
here saw Danielle here Daniel says that
Python will be 100% functional
programming no more for loops and nested
for loops so this is interesting - so I
guess Daniel is saying that Python might
in the future actually change the change
the the the recommended programming
paradigm or the Python language is going
to change in the future to change the
programming paradigm that that it's used
for primarily and that's a pretty
far-out idea I think personally I'm I
don't think this will happen because
it's very like when I look at the past
like how language has changed in the
past it's kind of hard for languages to
completely change the the initial
paradigm they started out with like if
you look at Java like it was meant to be
the object-oriented programming language
the oo P language and did it ever really
move away from that not really same with
c-sharp I think and and some other
languages that have been around for a
long time and with Python it's also been
not like that like it's more I guess
like python is more a multi-paradigm
language and I'd be surprised to see if
it moved 100 to 100% into a more
functional programming paradigm language
but nevertheless it's a cool idea it's
interesting to see is to see what's
coming up here alright someone else
Alexander here agrees with Daniel and
says that he believes also Python will
be 100% functional programming very very
interesting I did not really expect that
it wouldn't have been my first idea he
but very interesting nevertheless okay
so John says pythons gonna change into
something that's not backwards
compatible no doubt that's interesting I
mean we don't know what's gonna happen
over the next five to ten years with
Python it's a pretty long time you're
talking about a decade here
this definitely languages where we're
backwards incompatible changes have been
made and you could argue that you know
to some degree Python three is not fully
backwards compatible with Python two due
to some of the Unicode changes there
Saul
interesting too I mean fairly likely
that when you compare Python today with
what it's going to be like in ten years
that there's going to be some changes
that are not going to be 100% backward
compatible III I would think that's
probably true
all right so Alessandro says that we
will have a multi-purpose unstoppable
anaconda all right so first I thought
this was about the Anaconda package
manager but this is now that I read it
again like this response is more about
you know Python reaching into all kinds
of other places that it's maybe not
being used at the moment at least that's
how I interpret Alessandro suggestion
here and that's interesting he posts
this graph here Python compared to
smaller growing technologies so he's
comparing this to or the in this graph
they're comparing I guess the so this
might be from a stack overflow a stack
overflow survey where they're comparing
the number of overall questioned views
per month between some languages for
example our swift
type scripts gallic go rust in an Python
by comparison now would be interesting
to actually see also where you know this
other established languages like Java C
sharp are showing up in this in this
graph you know that's very interesting
when you compare and the Python graph
with the Swift graph for example I
always thought Swift was huge because it
is the now recommended language for the
iOS and Mac OS ecosystem basically all
of the Apple stuff it's kind of
interesting to see just in terms of the
engagement that these languages get from
the community that Python is so far
ahead by comparison
so I think this is an interesting
thought from Alessandro here and I would
agree that Python is probably gonna
expand into other industries in other
places where maybe right now it is not
as popular so maybe we're gonna have a
really great mobile development solution
or maybe a really great VR software
development solution for Python in the
future very interesting thought
all right Murat here says that he thinks
that new languages will evolve from
Python in that this is bound to be I
totally agree I mean Python is already
inspiring new languages that are
sprouting up that are inspired by how
the Python programming language works
and how the syntax looks for example
there is some the I believe it's called
cocoa nut which is a functional language
a 100% purely functional language that's
based on the Python syntax I'm not sure
if it actually also runs on the Python
interpreter or Python VM but it's
definitely inspired by it and yeah
totally agree we're gonna see a bunch of
languages that are gonna be feeding off
the popularity of Python in the years to
come
I think that is probably gonna happen
all right
Python 4.0 for the win and static typing
so this is interesting too I mean we're
probably gonna see a big jump in ocean
numbers for sure it's gonna be
interesting if we're going to see a big
change in the backwards-compatible as we
go from Python three to four I think
there was some I remember like reading
some interview with Guido van Rossum
that in the future they wanted to avoid
having big backwards compatibility
breaking changes in the future and that
that was one of the challenges with
going from Python two to three so yeah
we're probably gonna see Python 4.0 or
Python four over the next five to ten
years for sure static typing yes
absolutely I think so this is my main
gut feeling that this will play a big
role in the language in the future I
mean already you can see that with
static type checkers like my PI getting
more and more traction in the language
moving into a direction where it where
it makes it so much easier to support
these external static type checking
tools I think they're gonna play a
bigger and bigger role in the future and
yeah it's a good question whether or not
this will at one point be integrated
into the language or if it's gonna stay
an external tool I can I can see
benefits to both sides but I am curious
to see how this will play out and I
think if we get more static typing
features that's also going to open the
door to you know maybe
come like compiling Python to machine
language directly so it can run faster
and in in some cases where that we don't
were the performance impact of that is
really relevant so this could be an
interesting change for the language in
the future right so Ben says that number
one he thinks we will see improved
performance deployments will be easier
and there will we will get rid of the
Gil the global interpreter lock so yeah
improve performance I think this there's
lots of opportunity in Python for
improving the performance off the the
interpreter and the virtual machine so
I'm sure we're gonna see some changes
there even with projects like pi pi
gaining traction I could totally see
that become a viable option or some
alternative virtual machine actually
getting more popular than see Python in
the future could totally happen
deployments will be easier that is
interesting interesting interesting
suggestion there I'm my gut feeling is
that well as more and more people use
Python for sure there will be more and
more support to make it easier to deploy
our projects in whatever means what are
that shipping an app to a customer's
computer or if it's about running in
applications in the cloud somewhere like
a web application hosting it somewhere
or maybe even shipping it to someone's
mobile phone and running it there so the
colectomy is interesting tubes is a big
project that people are working on for C
Python right now so the Gil is the
global interpreter lock and it basically
means that when you have multiple
threads execute
at the same time really only one of them
can execute code can perform actual
computations and within a single
interpreter process so this has some
impact on performance of some types of
multi processing and Python or parallel
programming in Python they there are a
little bit harder to do if if your CPU
bound if your i/o bound it doesn't
really matter but if your CPU bound then
it can be hard to do that within a
single Python process and the idea then
or to work around this when people do a
lot of times these days is they just fan
out and run multiple Python interpreter
at the same time and then you can get
around that restriction but it's kind of
a a wart in the the interpreter and in
the language that is there for you know
historical reasons and people are
working on getting rid of this so that
we can actually have multi-threading
capabilities that are comparable to
other languages like Java for example
and I'm pretty sure there will be tons
of progress on this on this Galacta
mirror and this issue soon so really
looking forward to see some of the
results of that victor says we're gonna
have a PI Borg yeah because we're all
going to be assimilated into the Python
ecosystem looking forward to that um
Python in the web browser with web
assembly so this is interesting to web
assembly is technology that basically
standardizes a virtual machine that is
very close to the metal to the real kind
of instructions that your CPU would run
and it's about adding that virtual
machine through the browser and right
now the only way to run code in a
browser is through JavaScript which
means that well pretty much everything
has to be programmed in JavaScript if
you want to run code in the browser now
there are you know tools where you can
take other programming languages and
compile them to JavaScript there's also
the tools that do that for Python
compilers that do that for Python but
the problem has always been that this is
often not not very performant
so the idea with WEP assembly is that
you pretty much have a way to to just
compile some binary that you can run on
any web browser on a standardized
virtual machine and it would be a lot
faster than going through through
running JavaScript and and if that
project is successful then that would
mean we could see a lot more languages
as viable options for doing web
programming and this can only be a good
thing for a language like Python and
many other languages so this is a very
very interesting thought I'm sure we're
gonna see some interesting projects
happen based on that I'm pretty
confident and web assembly will gain
more and more traction in the future and
this is potentially a great opportunity
for Python
all right so Matt here says that he
would personally love to see optional
runtime type checking built in to see
Python when annotations exist in my PI
static chicking is built or built-in
well I guess the spirit of this reply is
that we're gonna potentially see
optional runtime type checking in the
standard Python interpreter and we don't
have to run it through my PI or an
external type checker to get type
checking ie I think this could happen it
kind of relates to what I talked about
earlier
I think type checking is a big deal and
moving forward it's gonna get more and
more important so be interesting to see
what's gonna happen here so Julia or
Julio here says that will program in a
derivative of Python I'm not sure what
ia is that's AI or some other acronym
that that I don't know okay we're gonna
program in a derivative of Python fairly
likely I mean the Python we have today
it's likely gonna gonna evolve and
change so one here says that Python will
be a mainstay in some sectors off the
industry and academia however its
popularity will fade with the next
paradigm shift in programming languages
now that's interesting too so as you've
probably heard there's a lot of traction
with Python right now it is growing like
crazy there's many many more developers
many new developers are being taught
Python and learning Python and it's it's
just a very popular language and it has
been growing in popularity over the last
couple of years so of course this
popularity is not gonna last forever
right if you look at any other
programming language there's always kind
of a peak in the adoption in the
popularity and then it always slowly
fades out and the same thing is gonna
happen with Python for sure and I guess
the question is like how long like when
is it going to start to fade out like
are we still in a growing phase are we
stagnating or are we sort of fading out
I think right
we're definitely in the growing face
nobody knows how long this will continue
and then we're gonna be you know peaking
sitting there for a while and then
slowly fade out as as people go to other
languages this has happened in the past
probably gonna happen to Python at some
point is it gonna happen over the next
five years or the next ten years after
that nobody knows and if if it's gonna
happen it's gonna happen for a good
reason right because other languages are
gonna have bigger benefits and they're
gonna make programming faster cheaper
more enjoyable whatever some tangible
benefit and if that happens then python
is eventually gonna decline just like
any other language so I think this is an
interesting prediction I certainly
well--don't hope or or foresee that this
will happen over the next five years but
you know nobody really knows okay
gradual typing will become mainstream
okay another typing suggestion here by
Ivan totally agree I think this will
really play a bigger role in in Python
alright so Hasan here says that the
semicolon will die
secondly the braces will be killed off
and thirdly I'm scared for job security
okay so a couple of things to touch on
there I guess if the semicolon dies and
we kill off all the braces that means
python is gonna have a huge success I
guess right because if all the other
languages that use semicolons and braces
are going away then Python is just gonna
totally take over I'm I'm not sure okay
so if I if you know if I think about
this as sir saying Python is gonna take
over the world the programming world and
it will destroy all other programming
languages then I don't think that's very
likely going to happen right there's
there's a reason we have this this
universe is multitude or ecosystem with
other with many programming languages
that have strengths and weaknesses right
and I think there will always be an
opportunity for other languages to
coexist with Python just like python is
coexisting with all these other
languages at the moment right like if
you look at systems programming nobody
is gonna write an operating system in
Python I mean maybe they will in ten
years right so so we'll have to see but
likewise few people are ever going to
write a 3d rendering engine in Python
right just because of the the
performance isn't there where you want
to be very close to the bare metal and
so I think you know where pythons
probably not going to replace all the
other languages that they're out there
at the moment but it's an interesting
thought and thirdly Hassan says he's
scared for job security so I'm not sure
what he means by that exactly I'm I'm
sort of taking it as well what's gonna
happen to the Python job situation are
there gonna be more or less Python jobs
in in five to ten years my personal take
on this is that there will likely be
many more jobs just because right now if
the language is booming and companies
are making big investments in Python in
adopting Python
and in training people to learn Python
and if you have people who are really
skilled in a language I think we're
gonna see more job opportunities as well
right because if I can hire someone that
who knows how to write Python and I can
put them on a Python project that's
going to be way cheaper for me as an
employer as a company as a consultancy
whatever compared with going hiring a
Python developer and in training them
how to write JavaScript or training them
how to write C sharp or whatever other
programming language where you could
think about here so I think this kind of
explosion in popularity will be a good
thing for Python for a long time to come
we're going to be able to write out that
way for for a long time but of course
you've got to be realistic you know
nobody knows what's gonna happen over
the next 10 years maybe there will be a
an AI revolution or a fantastically
popular programming language that will
just blow everything else out of the
water and then we're gonna have to adapt
now personally I think Python is a
language and that sets you on the right
path if you're starting out learning how
to program today
I think Python it it kind of guides you
in the right direction and it teaches
you many of the best practices and
skills that are gonna be valuable in any
programming language to work in so you
know I don't want to sugarcoat it and
say pythons gonna be around forever
really like if you're a programmer
you're gonna have to adapt over the
course of your career if you take on a
new job you're gonna likely have to
learn a new language and in many cases
or just be fluid and be be up-to-date
and and keep in touch with what's what's
happening in the space right it's not if
you're a program it's not a career where
you get trained once for for a year or
two and then you can just you know coast
on these skills it doesn't work like
that like the field is moving so fast
you got to stay up-to-date and you got
to learn new stuff almost every single
day that's just a reality of it and the
good news is that you're getting paid a
ton of money to do that as well and it's
a lot of fun so that's kind of my
perspective on Python job security again
like really really appreciate all of
these replaces was really really
interesting we touch on so many things
here that I would have never thought
about if I had just sat down and answer
that question
all in my head here so yeah this was
great
thanks everyone who replied back to this
tweet if you have a question dad you
like me to cover in some of my future
videos then just leave a comment below
and let me know alright
happy python ink and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
