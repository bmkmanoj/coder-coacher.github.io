coat I'm gonna take a look at it now so
basically what I've done is I've cloned
your repository I've got it here so we
can take a look in my editor and I've
also got your github page open and I'm
basically just gonna go through the
whole thing and mention things that
stand out to me or you know that that
just catch my eye so the first thing
that I noticed here is that you have the
pie cache folder committed into your
repo and when you when you look at that
you can see that it has all these
temporary files that not the Python
interpreter generates when it runs your
program and they're actually you know
they're temporary and they can be
regenerated or just a cache for the byte
code that the interpreter generates so
usually you don't want to put those into
the repository now I was actually
surprised that they're in there because
when I looked at your git ignore file
and I can bump up the font size a bit
when I looked at your git ignore file I
saw that you have the pie cache folder
in there and you also have a reg X here
or a pattern for the PI C files so
normally they you know this should have
just worked and shouldn't have included
that folder but probably what I would
recommend is that we'll just delete that
folder now because I'm suspecting that
it was added before you updated the git
ignore so what I would probably do well
first of all I would create a new branch
here and then we're going to delete that
folder okay we need to do that
recursively all right so we've just got
rid of that and then I'm seeing an empty
readme here usually what I try to do is
you know have some basic information in
my readme files so what I what I
personally feel is super important is
like okay how you know how do I actually
run this thing because here there are
two files I don't really know how to run
this I mean one of them is called main
script file it's probably the one we
want to take a look at it would really
help if you could just drop you know a
quick line like hey this is the
per program it does the following things
and this is how you run it if you have
tests this is how you run the tests this
is how maybe before you even explain how
to run it you could explain how to
install it because I'm seeing a
requirements txt file here so that
probably means we need to install some
of these dependencies so I would just
call that out and another thing you may
be you may want to add is just license
information and I've got a longer
blogpost on on that topic that I'm gonna
link in the description but basically
what what that blog post is about is you
know it's like a tutorial how to write a
minimal github readme file I think this
would really help you out make this more
awesome so be sure to check in the
description later alright cool so the
next thing I'm seeing here yeah so what
I want to mention about the gate ignore
I think it's really good that you have a
git ignore in there and it looks
reasonable to me so we just need to get
rid of that pie cache folder looked at
the readme and then now we have the main
script file writing data on CSV pi and
requirements txt so the naming here is
interesting I think on the one hand I
like that it's called main script file
because well you know it really explains
to you what the main script file is on
the other hand maybe a better name would
be to just name it the way your to just
give it the name of your program right
if your program is called scrapper maybe
you just want to call that scrapper dot
pine and I think would be really obvious
that it's the main file I think that
would be a more conventional naming
structure but you know no big deal like
I like explicit names so I think this is
kind of cute right so with these two so
I took a quick look earlier and it looks
like they're not really being so it
looks like they're two separate programs
right or this is like a test where we
have this or not a test but like some
experiment where you're where you were
writing that right on C's female CSV
method so what I'm gonna do is I'm
basically just gonna can ignore this
file and just focus on main script file
and we're going to do that in not in
github but we're gonna do that in
sublime text
my favorite editor so all right let's
pull that up I've already bumped up the
font size a bit and I think we can get
rid of the terminal now okay so let's
make this a little bit larger still see
you can see that well okay so a couple
of things that I'm noticing immediately
because I'm running a linter sort of
embedded in my sublime text setup so
linter is like a little tool that checks
your code and it's gonna call out stuff
dad goes against common best practices
or goes against formatting standards and
it also catches stuff that are just you
know plain errors like a syntax error
and I'm using the sublime linter plugin
with sublime lint or flake eight and I
find this super super helpful whenever
you know I'm writing Python code because
it's basically it's gonna really help
you avoid some of the the things that
that I'm seeing in your code here you
know before we dive into that I want to
say it's pretty cool that you're
actually structuring this stuff in two
separate functions what I what I'm
seeing a lot of times is where people
you know they just want to write a
simple script quote-unquote and I've
done that myself right we restart start
implementing hacking away on a simple
script and in three four hours later or
like a week later it's actually like
this super complicated thing that
doesn't have a lot of structure to it so
I'm really enjoying the fact that you
you actually you know have some
structure here and you split this up
into separate into separate functions
which which is cool so right okay so
what I said you know you can see there's
a lot of yellow here and that is stuff
that the linter is calling out and let's
just go through that really quickly
so the first thing I'm noticing here is
that your naming is a little bit
inconsistent so here your functions they
use these the snake case layout and then
here that function is almost named like
a class I think that's it's a bit odd so
I would probably just rename that and
call it generate HTML
space missing you don't really need
those lines here I think they make it
harder to read what's going on
so like typically what the Python style
guide we recommend is just you know to
get rid of these lines and we can do
that here everywhere okay cool and then
you know we had this inconsistent
spacing between functions all of this
stuff if it happens a couple couple of
times it's not that horrible but I think
what it it's really good to clean that
up and make it consistent because then
your brain doesn't have to focus on that
I always like to think of a programmers
brain almost like working almost like a
compiler right because if I want to
understand what your code does I need to
do the same things that a compiler would
do right I need to parse it I need to
understand sort of the structure of the
program and then I also need to kind of
build up this mental model in my head of
what the program actually does and if
you have like things like inconsistent
spacing I think it makes a lot harder to
get a good feeling of how the program is
structured quickly so I am really a
stickler for using you know formatting
best practices or some kind of style
guide and now that we have these tools
is actually really easy to stick to a
style guide so in your case what are in
the case of looking at your code what I
would do is like just make that a little
bit more regular right so so we've we've
figured out the spacing here and now
just a minor thing so this is using tabs
and it's so that that would look okay
right because using one tab indentation
here but then here we're using to tap
two tabs to indent the code and that
just becomes a little bit odd so what
I'm gonna do here with this whole block
I'm just gonna move that over to the
left and then I'm gonna actually convert
that to spaces because that's that's
usually the recommendation that the
Python pip eight style guide gives
alright so that looks a little bit
cleaner what I like to do with the
imports here as well and this is
something that I do
I don't think this is in pep 8 style
guide for example so what I like to do
is I like to split these up into imports
that are part of the Python standard
library like the CSV module and the OS
module and then third-party imports
because that really helps me understand
you know what does this code actually
rely on like which external libraries do
I need for to run that and then another
thing that I'm seeing already um is that
ok so this includes requests and
beautifulsoup
and in our requirements there's a lot of
other stuff so it might be possible that
this is actually getting pulled in by
beautifulsoup but I don't think so
so there's a lot of stuff you know in
your requirements txt that doesn't
actually relate to what your program
needs and I would usually I would really
recommend that you try to keep the
requirements txt as minimal as possible
so in this case you might actually be
able to get away with just putting
requests and beautifulsoup
and you would kind of get the same the
same result right ok all right so back
to the formatting to get that out of the
way there there are a couple of things
that you know just catch my eye here and
this is the in consistent formatting
again with how you're spacing out your
your arguments here I know an all of
this stuff it's not bad like this is
just part of learning how to write
Python I think we're in the beginning
you don't notice that stuff right
because your your brain isn't used to
but like this stuff is really jumps out
at me and it it makes it a lot harder to
actually read the code understand what's
going on so I'm gonna I'm gonna change
the formatting on those yeah so what I
probably would probably would do here is
because print is just a function in
Python 3 and you mentioned this is
Python 3 code it would just format that
like any other function call and in here
the extra parentheses they don't
actually do anything so we can get rid
of those as well so this looks pretty
clean now parsing and scraped data ok so
another thing that I'm noticing noticing
here is that see how the naming all of a
sudden is different so we had
in HTML and right on CSV and now here
it's parsing and scrape data so I would
probably just change that to a more like
active verb and just say parse and
scrape data we passed the raw raw data
and again here it would space out the
arguments okay so this is gonna this is
gonna make me sound like a horrible
person but I I really like having having
consistent quotes for Strings because
again I find a little bit confusing to
see you know how we have these strings
highlighted here and and they're using
single quotes and we get the double
quotes here so I would try and make all
of those consistent I know in this case
you probably did it because you're you
know if you using the double quotes you
can just use a single quote and I think
that's fine you know what you just got
to make a decision what kind of quotes
you want to use so in this case why
don't we use the double quotes
everywhere and then again the structure
becomes a lot more regular and I can
just parse that out mentally a lot
easier because it's all the same color
in my syntax highlighting and it's just
easier for me to understand what the
code does and and mentally parse it out
so again we can rid of get rid of these
parentheses and then here so you're
you're doing this thing where your
assignments there they're not formatted
consistently and and that stuff also I
which is try and make it consistent
right because if if that's something you
can you can pick up and just train
yourself to do consistently I think it's
gonna have a huge impact and just the
cleanliness on your cut of your code and
it's just gonna make it a lot easier for
other people to read right so we're
gonna gonna form that differently and
with all the stuff or that I mentioning
you know it's actually being called out
by the linter right so when I select
that piece and you look here I'm not
sure if you can read that in the video
but um it actually says but Poppa
missing whitespace around
operator so this is something that a
linter can catch so if you just you know
install a linter in your editing
environment or even if you just run it
from the command line so you can
actually do that really easily
just doing a pip install flake eight and
then even if you don't want to go
through integrating flake eight into
your editing environment you can just
run that from the from the command line
right it's gonna call out the same kinds
of errors and style guide violations so
I find this super helpful because it's
really gonna help you train avoiding
these kinds of formatting errors and
it's also gonna know things gonna
mention these these extra parentheses
but you know it's just gonna make a lot
make it a lot easier for you to to avoid
these formatting inconsistencies it's
probably a typo here yeah that's okay
you're on XYZ URL okay cool all right
let's take a look at right on CSV and
then again what I'm gonna do here is
just make all of the the string quotes
consistent hmm wait how did I do here
okay yeah just needed an extra quote
here Doon okay and there's a missing
space and then I would dent that a bit
differently okay
oh yeah error whitespace before let's
just want to open that file okay
so now there's actually Lintz cleanly
right there know linter errors being
called out here which which I think this
is good you know this is this is really
this is the kind of code you should be
committing I think because then you know
it's really consistent and all of your
files are gonna sort of look the same
and then you can really focus on the
actual structure off the code or the the
actual problem that code solves
okay so let's take a look at that um
what makes this a little bit challenging
here is that I don't really know how to
run this right so this is main script
file it kind of looks like a module that
exports a bunch or defines a bunch of
functions but I don't really know how
they're working together so I'm assuming
you you probably run this from from the
interpreter somehow they make it work
together and that's totally fine right
it's actually I think it's the right
thing what you're doing here
we're just throwing that into a module
and then you can import that and work
with the interpreter directly but for me
it's really hard to actually understand
how how these pieces work together so
again what would we help there is
updating the readme you know just
putting there how to actually run this
and then what you can do if you have a
main script file what you could do is
you would typically define or have like
a top level if statement that checks if
if someone is running that script file
directly from the command line with the
Python interpreter just type that out
right see I'm already starting to use
inconsistent quotes because I usually
use single quotes but whatever I just
like to do be consistent okay so now
what happens is when you run this script
oh okay so this is interesting now that
we actually there's another thing right
so now that we actually tried to run
this it we don't have requests installed
and I did actually install the
requirements but it looks like your
requirements doesn't actually have oh
hold on okay my bad was just my bad I
currently forgot to install
oh okay it didn't go through right so
the problem here is that the
requirements don't install cleanly and
should it check the error message so
this my sequel connector um can't be
installed so it looks like right now
what do you have in your requirements
txt at least on my machine I'm not able
to install that so something that could
help you with that and that's maybe
stuff for a little bit further down the
road is just having some kind of
automated built set up that whenever you
make a commit in github it just tries
and install all the requirements and run
your code from scratch on a new machine
and there are free services you can use
you can use Travis CI for that for
example it's a great service that I
would recommend is actually free for
open source or a public repos on github
and then you're gonna catch mmediately
you know something like that happens
where it might not it's probably not
your fault even it's just the fact that
there was a new release of my sequel
connector or some other dependency and
they don't play together well and you're
gonna be able to catch that if you have
automated bills for that but you know
again maybe that's something you want to
look into in the future alright so back
to what I wanted to show you in the
first place I'm kind of jumping all over
the place here but I still hope it's
gonna be helpful when you watch the
video in the end so what I wanted to
show you is that right okay we need
beautifulsoup as well more dependencies
so we just want to install beautiful
soup for okay alright so now when I run
this like so Python main script file up
PI then what happens is if you run a
script like that if you run a script
like like this through this method
Python sets that underscore or that done
their name variable to dunder main so
you can use this as a check to see if
someone runs your script like a program
because if I do import main script file
it doesn't execute that line right
because we're not running it like a
program so this is super useful in the
situation that we're in right now where
you want to use a module like that just
to work with it from the Python
interpreter which which I imagine is
what you're trying to do
but you also want to provide kind of you
know a way to run this as a standalone
program so you can use something like
this to do that and then you would kind
of to go to do you know do something
useful with this right you probably call
like that's the HTML first and then
parse it and scrape it right so you
could you could put that stuff here and
then you kind of get the best of both
worlds but yeah that's just a tip and
you could look into that in the future
okay so I'm seeing a bunch of print
statements I think that's fine in the
future you may want to log a look into
the logging module but I think would
honestly would probably be overkill for
what you're doing at the moment so I
think it's totally fine all right so
this fetch is this thing here I kinda
like what you're doing here were you
giving this a name right because our dot
content it's kind of hard to know what
that is and if you're as you're giving
it a name then we know that you're
returning the HTML for that URL I would
probably still shorten that because it's
kind of in the name so I would probably
just do return our content and then you
could put a doc string here and that
says you know fetches base URL fetch
base URL and return the HTML content or
something like that right and then I'm
not sure if you want to call that
generate HTML maybe fetch HTML because
you're actually doing an HTTP request to
fetch that
I'm not sure if you want to call that
base URL because usually what I would
think a base URL is you know it's some
kind of part of a URL that then becomes
the full URL when you tack something on
at the end almost like a prefix so maybe
just call that URL
I would probably rename it and just call
it URL I think would be fine okay
now okay we're not I don't think we're
using the generate HTML proper flow okay
so we don't need to rename it any
anywhere else okay so and then I think
the way this works is yeah would enter
here and then this would use right on
CSV somewhere here right okay
parson scrape data I really like the
name I think it's pretty cool because
well actually what's the difference
between parsing and scraping yeah we
parse it out and then figure out the
parts that we actually need so you know
one could argue here that it would make
more sense to split this up into two
functions where like one is okay we're
gonna parse it and then the another
function would actually pull out the
interesting bits so again you know it's
not a super long function which i think
is fine but if you want it to be super
clean you could think about splitting it
up okay so let's look at this alright so
this is just crazy
parser mm-hmm we're just iterating over
that so I think it would be fair to
actually get rid of that local variable
and just to say four items in soup find
all because I'm not sure if this is
actually you know a name like G GData J
I'm assuming is something like global
data or something it doesn't really give
me a lot in terms of understanding so I
would probably get rid of it just to not
confuse readers but could go either way
that's probably what I would do
okay so we're creating a new dictionary
here and din yeah
with this stuff I think would actually
be fair to just do this in inline right
and instead of saying a tag I think it
would be fair to just do this cuz
otherwise my brain has to keep track of
a couple more variables and here you
know maybe this thing that should also
be called just item because it looks
like we're actually looking at one item
would make more sense to me but you know
like the naming stuff is usually really
hard because I don't have a lot of or
you know when I'm looking at this I'm
just kind of renaming things here and
your coat then for me it's really hard
to know what the background story is
there what this actually does like I'm
assuming you have some kind of specific
website in mind that would that would be
that we're scraping here so but yeah I
would I think this would be fair you
know to have this dotted access go to
levels deep I think this would be
totally okay print link alright okay
this is the link yeah this is like a
debugging statement yeah if you want to
keep that and I think it's okay product
details alright and then we're setting
this up so again here what I would
probably do because we're you know we're
creating this structure here and then
we're not really doing much with it so I
think it would be fair to say to do this
actually um I think it would be fair to
do this
oops we're we're not creating the the
dictionary ahead of time but we're just
creating it with a dictionary expression
right like this and then I think it
becomes clearer what's going on here
because otherwise I'd have to remember
okay we're creating an empty dictionary
up here then we're not doing anything
with it and then at the end we're just
kind of populated so I would probably do
it like this and then what you can do
here is you can end always end those
lines with a comma because that Python
allows you to do that and you don't have
to remember adding an extra comma when
you add a new line at some point so it's
something I like to do in my code but
it's like super tiny unimportant tip it
anyway okay so we're doing this we're
passing this through to to write on CSV
and I just want to make sure I'm running
flake eight cleanly still yeah okay so
let's take a look at right on CSV so
we're passing so again so we're using
the name data here for this thing and
we're using that in a bunch of places
right remember how this guy takes raw
data and we also had G underscore data
so I think what's interesting here is
that we actually pass the product
details to write on CSV I would probably
just say instead of calling this thing
data we just call it product details
right and then here probably I don't
know what this really takes but I
imagine this will actually take the the
HTML right so instead of calling this
raw data you could think about calling
that pay date page HTML or something
like that but let's leave it leave it
like that for now because I don't
actually know what goes into it
okay so with this part file exists
equals oh is path is file and so is file
tests whether a path is a regular file
which kind of goes contrary to what this
thing says here we're saying file exists
so there is also an exists function in
OS don't pass the test whether a given
path exists which sounds like that's
so what okay wait what's this doing oh
okay I guess we're checking if we need
to append the header right
yeah let's think about that forum for a
second here hmm so I'm not gonna go too
deeply into this but I would think about
mode probably because so what can
actually happen here is that you can
have a race condition right where you're
checking if the file exists but what
could actually happen is that your
program here is preempted for another
process or threat to run and then that
other process is gonna delete Google
results dot CSV and so you're assuming
it still exists but then you're opening
the file and the file you actually get
doesn't have that header in here and
you're not writing the header because
you did that check earlier you know and
this sounds this may sound like the OL
you know what this would actually never
happen in the real world but you know it
might happen like if you're running if
you imagine like later maybe this code
you know becomes bigger and bigger and
eventually you want to run like a
hundred or a thousand scrapers at the
same time and then they're gonna you're
gonna get into these situations where
this kind of stuff is is really gonna
lead to some really really tough to the
bug problems and and believe me I've
been there so that's why I'm mentioning
it so I think we would have to think
about doing this a little bit
differently and at top of my head I
don't really know the best way to go
about it I mean it's probably fine for
for a small program like that for the
moment but just you know as a heads up
it's potentially something you want to
look into I'm thinking maybe it would be
better to just you know see how how
large the file is if it's completely
empty and there might be yeah there
might be another way to do it I really
know what the best way would be to go
about it but I'm pretty sure that this
could
you into trouble in the future so maybe
just something to keep in mind and also
I'm not sure if you want is file or if
you want dot exists and then also we
were using this string here a couple of
times so this is actually something I
would I would just pass in here
and maybe give it a default right
because then you get the same result but
you don't have the danger of accidently
having a typo in the second line here
and then this would you know the file
exists check would look at another file
a completely different file potentially
then the then here the context manager
when you open that file so again it's
you know makes it a little bit easier to
avoid that kind of inconsistency um
alternatively we could have made that
constant as well but I think seeing that
this is a function I think it's fair to
pass that in here
okay so we're opening at CSV file we
have the field names here um I think
that's fair I potentially could also do
that in line III would probably do that
in line and I would have constants for
these guys right so you could say you
could do something like that and then
everywhere we're using title I would do
this and then with Python 3 you could
potentially do oh wait this is actually
something else so I don't know what the
how dick writer really works but oh okay
see this is a little bit more ok so
let's actually do this a little bit
differently okay
this guy this key here is called links
and we pass link in here which is a
little bit odd
I'm sorry probably renamed that as well
just to make sure it's consistent and
then I would like I said earlier I would
say field title and I would do this give
it name here and then I would also do
this and then here so this is a list
which means it's mutable probably want
this to be a topple and I think big
writer can can deal with a tuple in this
case so I would I would probably do
something like this and just change the
formatting slightly I think that would
be fair or depending on how you want
your formatting to go you know could
also do it like this there's different
ways to do that yeah maybe that looks
pretty as long as it's consistent
doesn't really matter okay so I think
that's little bit clearer because now
what can't happen is that we use in
consistent naming for these guys right
because otherwise it would be really
easy to actually say whoops really easy
to actually say okay this is the tiles
field and we're using a different a
different key here than we use we'd be
using down there so it really helps to
make that consistent and you could look
into do it making that a Python 3 enum
as well but I think you know doing it
like that would probably be fine you
could think about instead of making this
a dictionary you could think about
making this a named
tupple which would give you a little bit
more naming guarantee so that I
basically defined like a product details
name couple up here and then you could
use it in all those places and you would
have a little bit more security in terms
of
how your data structures what they look
like instead of passing around a
dictionary but I think you know even
doing it like this is a little bit
better because then you you you you have
a gear a better the chance of using the
same the same names for keys and stuff
so I probably do it like that ok again
like the file exists check here yeah we
talked about that earlier and then we're
writing out that one row and we're
printing something out here I mean it's
pretty straightforward right
so all in all it changes but I wasn't
meant to mean spirit I think you know
your program probably worked before I
couldn't really test it out but I hope
you you learned something from from that
quick code review and just kind of me
going through this and like
restructuring everything or it was
mostly formatting stuff but I think
again you were on the right track and
yeah I like the fact that you have sort
of a basic structure in here I I really
like surf the the data flow through the
whole program that was really good and
my number one recommendation for you in
terms of how can you get to the next
level as a Python programmer look into
tools like flight eight I think it's
gonna have a huge impact it certainly
had a huge impact on my ability to write
code and to write clean code and to work
better with other developers and work
better on open source projects because
you know if if all that formatting
discussion is out of the way then it
just becomes a lot easier to scale your
programs make them bigger and bigger and
work with other people so really really
look into that I think that's probably
the number one thing I think this would
really help you become better as a
Python developer and it would just by
the fact that would free up a lot of
mental capacity because your brain
doesn't have to parse out all of that
inconsistent formatting
you're gonna have a lot more brain
cycles available in your brain python
compiler to to actually focus on the
important stuff and and yeah you know
best of luck I hope this was useful
useful and
I'm gonna just create a pull request for
that and you can take a look at that or
you know pick up some things that that
you find helpful or not cool
all right thanks Milton and have a super
fantastic day see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
