developer this is kind of the ultimate
Python career question well because we
all got to make some money to to survive
right and to have some fun so this is a
great question that was sent to me by a
newsletter reader and I just want to
give some thoughts here so I think
generally as a developer how do you make
money the main avenues I see for that
and those are also the ones that I've
tried personally or experienced
personally are well number one you can
work for something else in a salary
position join a company as a software
developer write code for them kind of
climbed that career path you know take
on more responsibilities if you want to
start as a junior engineer become you
know like a like a staff engineer or
whatever the path there is a senior
engineer and make get raises make more
money climb the career ladder in there
maybe you'll you go down the management
path you become elite developer and you
manage other engineers and who knows
we're just kin and so you know number
one option join a company do the
corporate thing number two become a
contractor a freelancer and in this case
you're not gonna get a month-to-month
paycheck but you're gonna have to go out
and and kind of market yourself or
market your own skills as a developer
and then try and find clients and
they're gonna pay you money in exchange
for you building software for them or
extending existing software fixing bugs
in existing software and this is
certainly something you can do as a
Python developer as well right there's
there's a ton of opportunity out there
and this can be a little bit more scary
because you never really know what's
gonna happen next month right you you
always kind of start at zero and you've
got to look for ways to find new clients
to find new work so that's option number
two the third option is you could start
your own company right if you have
programming skills you can start your
own tech startup or become a founding
member of a tech startup and make money
through that that's certainly an avenue
that's open if you if you know Python
you pretty much have all the skills you
need to go out there and do this if
you're trying to build a web application
for example like a software-as-a-service
application you can totally do that with
Python and web development skills alone
and you can go out there and create
value and then sell it and basically
have a product that you can offer to
other people so that's another option
then one more option that's I'm not sure
if this is cheating but you know
definitely if you're a Python developer
you have a knack for teaching your stuff
to other people you can do something
like what I started doing and that is
teaching other people how to work with
Python you can either do that online
through courses and and videos that you
can sell to people or you can do it in
person and do workshops go to companies
offer training teach people how to work
with Python and kind of spread the
gospel of Python so that's another
option and these are kind of the main
things that I can think of when it comes
to making money as a Python developer
all right I hope this was helpful I hope
you make some money using Python and if
you want your own question answered then
throw it into a comment below and I'll
try and cover it in one of my future
