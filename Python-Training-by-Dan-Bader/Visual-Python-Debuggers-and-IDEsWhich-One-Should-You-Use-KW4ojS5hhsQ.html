time today to answer some Python
questions so I got this question about
visual debuggers for Python from Charlie
see here I just want to read out the
question so the question is hi Dan is
there a debugger in Python in the Python
world that is anything like the debugger
in the Visual Basic IDE it seems so
simple incrementing through lines of
code and examining variable values and
so on yes there is so there's a couple
of tools that are available that you can
use to to achieve that to get visual
debugging with Python I'm gonna leave
out some of the command line oriented or
text mode oriented tools here personally
I really enjoy working with PDB and PDB
plus plus and I'm also a tool called PU
DB those all run in the terminal and it
sounds like you're more looking for
something that is actually a full-blown
GUI application for debugging your
Python programs if you can go with the
text mode stuff
yeah then absolutely read up on p DB p
DB + + + p UD b alright so in terms of
visual debuggers that operate like the
the one in the VBA IDE I would point you
towards a couple of IDs and actually
there's a really good list here on the
Python wiki and this list is just super
solid so I'm gonna link that in the
description and you can you can check
that out
my personal preference when it comes to
visual debuggers in python would be to
use the pycharm ide it's a great product
they have a really really solid high
performance editor
I remember at PyCon Munich like two
years ago there was an in-depth sort of
talk on how they how they actually
managed to speed up the debugger and
they're doing some really really
interesting things to give you a good
experience so this is you know
well-maintained really solid and if
you're looking for a proper like
full-blown IDE I will probably go with
pycharm I think it's a really solid
product there the bugger is great like
that's one of the the main selling
points at least in my opinion so
the other thing so PyCharm is a paid
product the other thing that you could
use if you're more a few more on the the
entry level and in terms of your Python
skills you might want to check out a
tool called Thawne II which is a I guess
a wordplay on on Python II or something
like that and it's it is it is sort of a
better version of the idle the idle
environment that is just you know your
your text mode interpreter for Python
and this this thing is is more like an
in-between between you know an editor
and an IDE but more from a learning
perspective and it has a pretty great
debugger that again is very much focused
on the learning aspect of this and I did
a video where I showed off funny in the
past so I'm also going to link that for
on this video so you can find it
probably check it out you know I would
just check it out it's a free free
product open-source tool and you might
have a really good experience with that
now there are a couple more IDs that
also have built-in visual debuggers
there's the pydev plugin i believe
that's a plugin for the Eclipse platform
I haven't used it in recent years to be
honest seems like a pretty good product
back in the past I at some point just
abandon it and went with pycharm and now
I'm actually using sublime text and I'm
using you know text mode debuggers for
off my all of my debugging needs but you
know if you want to if you want a visual
debugger at this point is probably
pretty mature choice told to at least
try out PI diff and and see how you like
it there's also the wing IDE and the
Komodo IDE and I would probably also
just try them out see how much you like
them if you want just one product where
where I could just support that choice
you know make a recommendation I would
probably just check out pycharm and see
if that does everything to want pretty
sure it will so that would be my
recommendation
alright if you enjoyed this video then
hit the like and subscribe buttons and
if you want your own Python question
answered then just leave a comment below
and I'll try and do a future video on
that I'm a little bit backed up with
questions but just leave a comment I see
them all in my YouTube when I log into
YouTube and I'll try and tackle there
single one of those with videos in the
future right take care and happy Python
