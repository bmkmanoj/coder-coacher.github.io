setting up a productive Python
development environment using the
sublime text editor in this course I'm
going to show you how to set up a Python
development environment from scratch
starting with the new Windows 10
installation and we're going to install
Python get in sublime text completely
from scratch and we're going to end up
with the setup that I'm demoing to you
now so I just want to show you some of
the coolest features in the setup before
we dive in into the actual lessons where
you learn how to set everything up so
the first thing you can see here is that
I've applied a couple of visual tweaks
to my sublime text setup for example I'm
using a custom dark color scheme here
which is just a lot nicer when you're
staring at your screen for a long time
working with your code for a long time
and it just makes it easier to focus
also it gets rid of this distracting
wide area here in the default sidebar
and it adds these nice and colored icons
for file types
I've also integrated Python code linting
into my setup so that way I can get
instant feedback on any code that I
write so for example if I introduce a
error here let's say by calling the
print function which clearly doesn't
exist
as soon as I save the file the linter
will run and it's going to call me out
on that error it's going to tell me that
I'm using an undefined name primped the
linter is also going to call me out on
common formatting issues for example
here my code doesn't follow the pp8 code
style guide and I can see that here in
the linter error where it says I
expected another blank line between
functions so as soon as I insert that
and save the file again the error goes
away and in here I can see an error
where the linter tells me that I
shouldn't compare to none using the
equals equals operator but the
recommendation is to use the is operator
and here I'm having some extra
whitespace that I should clean up right
now the file is nice and clean another
cool feature that I'm going to show you
how to add to your sublime text setup is
Python code completion so what I can do
here is just type the name of a module
and already as I'm typing this out I
will get the dark string for that module
on the Python documentation displayed in
line so I can make sure that I'm
actually using the right object here
as I type out a dot I get all the
functions in the time module and then I
can find the right one again by checking
the doc string that gets displayed in
line as soon as I accept that Auto
completion the doc string still stays
here and tells me what the arguments to
this function are of course the auto
completion also works with modules let's
say here we want to import the name
tuple function from the collections
module and I can do that no problem and
again get the doc string displayed in
line yet another cool IDE like feature
is the ability to jump to the definition
of a Python symbol so I can just click
on go to definition and this will take
me directly to the actual implementation
the Python standard library of course
the jump to definition also works for my
own code so I can just right click on
cancel job here and then click go to
definition and we jump me directly to
where that class is defined in my Python
code so this is a killer feature for
working with any kind of larger code
base inside sublime text I showed you
some of the formatting errors that could
be detected by the linter now I want to
introduce some more here now when I save
that file the linter complaints about
the incorrect formatting of this file
now a quick way to fix that is by
triggering the pp8 auto format and that
will take care of it and I don't have to
worry about it any more
I'll also show you how to integrate the
get source control system with sublime
text so a couple of cool features to
demo here this file is actually part of
a git repository that I cloned earlier
and now when I go in and delete a bunch
of lines here or make modifications to
this line and as I added the code I get
these symbols here next to the line
numbers that are telling me exactly what
was changed here so for example it tells
me here that I modified a line and here
it looks like I deleted a bunch of lines
now when I place the mouse cursor over
the symbol I can see what was changed
here and I can actually go and roll back
the change directly from within sublime
text I don't have to work with an
external get tool to get that done and
it's really fluid and really flexible
you might have also noticed that I'm
running a custom editor font here in the
course I'm going to show you how to set
that up and basically how to install any
font you find on the internet inside
your sublime text editor because there
are so many awesome choices for
programming fonts available there also a
couple of changes you can
to the font rendering settings to really
tweak the look and feel off the editor
area to make sure the code is perfectly
legible and just a joy to look at I will
also show you how to set up sublime text
to make it easier for you to write
beautiful pp8 compliant code so for
example we're going to add a bunch of
helper lines here that will make sure
that you can adhere to the line length
limits and we're going to set up the
editor to trim trailing whitespace so
that you don't have to worry about
managing this really boring aspect
yourself I will also teach you how to
integrate sublime text with your command
line setup with the subl command so that
you can just go subl and then the name
of a folder for example and it will open
right up in your sublime text or you can
use the Sobel command to create a new
file and it will open up in your editor
immediately there are many more useful
things you can do with sublime text from
the command line for example use it as
your git commit editor so you can write
your commit messages inside sublime text
with beautiful syntax highlighting and
recommendations for line length again
now this was just an overview and there
are many more tips and tweaks in the
full course so I'm looking forward to
work with you through the whole thing
and I'm going to teach you how to set up
sublime text git and Python and really
make them work together well so that you
have a great setup that will work
exactly the way you want it to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
