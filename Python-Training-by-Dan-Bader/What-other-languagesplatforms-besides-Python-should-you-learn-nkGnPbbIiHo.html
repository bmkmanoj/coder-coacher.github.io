should you learn if you want to be a
successful Python developer this is a
great question
because I like the mindset behind it you
know if you're if you want to be a great
developer if you want to have a great
career as a developer it's not just
about learning one single programming
language it's very much about mastering
one programming language above other
ones at least in the beginning but in
the long term you want to kind of fan
out and in know your way around
different programming paradigms
different languages so if you want to
start your career as a Python developer
there are complementary languages that
mesh really well with learning Python so
just a couple of thoughts here if you
want to be a web developer and you want
to work with Python I would highly
encourage you to learn the basics of
JavaScript and CSS as well this is gonna
pay off hugely and actually throw in
HTML there in the mix like no question
about it you know that the standard web
front-end technologies if you have a
basic knowledge there or you know as
much knowledge as possible this is gonna
make your life as a back-end developer
so much easier and really this is
something that I would focus on if you
want to learn Python for web development
then you definitely need to build up
some skills in the front-end world as
well so get started learning the basics
of HTML CSS and JavaScript for sure now
when should you do that
I would not spread myself too thin by
trying to learn all of these at the same
time but it just makes sense to have the
long term goal of becoming good at those
you know because they just play such a
huge role and if you're doing any kind
of web development you want to feel
comfortable in these technologies now if
you're coming or if you're planning to
be more in the data science world then
you might consider you know picking up
the basics of our as well for example
and right now there's this big battle
between Python and R and Python seems to
be seems to be actually winning by a
large margin and nevertheless I think
there is some great opportunity right
now if you if you at least understand
both languages you know if you can read
R and maybe refactor and rewrite things
in Python then that's going to make you
valuable because you are
and if the Britch gapper you know can
you can gap the the bridge and you can
take over some code and rewrite it in
Python so this could be a valuable thing
now if you want to be a mobile
application developer and using Python
for the backends there again I would
encourage you to learn the basics off
whatever language is used on the client
side there like if you're working on a
project that's actually written in
Python to do this and great but if
you're working on an iOS project for
example in the front end maybe it's
written in react native then you want to
learn JavaScript maybe it's written in
in the native language of that platform
so that would be Java for for Android
and it would be objective-c or Swift for
iOS then you definitely want to pick up
the basics of that language so that you
can bring value to the table if you're
working with a team where you can jump
in and just be like yeah you know I mean
I found this bug or whatever and I also
make the front-end fix I also make the
application fix not just the API fix and
this might not be possible in in any
kind of situation you know a lot of
companies they unfortunately have like
big separations between the front end
and the back end teams which in my mind
is never a good idea but you know if you
can kind of be the person that can jump
in there and not just sit there and be
like yeah I'm a back-end developer I
never touch front-end code then that can
bring a lot of value and it's it's also
going to help you in terms of job
security right like if you always like
there comes the point where you want to
spread out a little bit and and just
bring more skills to the table
and you want to have that ability to be
fluid in your programming career and go
and learn another language and this is
something that makes sense to build up
as soon as possible because eventually
if you have a successful career as a
programmer if you want to have
successful career as a programmer there
comes the time where you will have to
learn another language if you want to do
this for it 20 30 40 years absolutely
you know technology changes quickly and
eventually you need to be able to pick
up a new language and get comfortable
with it quickly alright so those were
some of my thoughts on this question if
this was helpful then subscribe and
leave a comment below if you want me to
tackle your question if you have a
question that relates to
Python software development your
software development career just leave a
comment below and I'll try and cover it
