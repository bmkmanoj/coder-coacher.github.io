Python 2.7 and Python 3 so this is a
question that I got from a reader as
part of my Python QA series and I want
to cover it in this video so how do you
write code that works on both Python 2
and 5 on 3 I think the answer here
involves using the 6 module so 6 is a
third-party Python module that you can
just install from pi PI and it's a
Python 2 and Python 3 compatibility
library so 2 times 3 is 6 and that
explains the name of the library you can
use this library to to round out some of
the rough edges in a transition from
Python 2 to Python 3 so the 6 library
basically is a collection of helpers and
other tool functions utility functions
that allow you to do things that you can
do in Python 2 and 3 but they're done in
different ways through a common
interface that's defined here in the 6
in the 6 library so let's take a look at
an example here so for example if you're
using iterators in your Python code and
you want to be able to run your program
on python 2 and 3 there's some small
differences in how the next function
works and or how the next method works
in Python 2 and python 3 and the 6 next
function here is a common interface that
just kind of does the right thing what
are you on Python 2 Python 3 so you can
use this utility helper or this utility
function in 6 instead of calling the
built-in next method or next function
directly and then that's going to make
your code work just fine on Python 2 and
python 3 so there are many other
functions here that that you can use to
smooth over some of the kings here and
this module is highly useful if you're
working on any kind of project that
needs to support python 2 and 3 at the
same time so i highly recommend that you
check that out alright if you've got a
Python question that you'd like me to
end
just leave a comment below and I'll try
and cover it in one of my next videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
