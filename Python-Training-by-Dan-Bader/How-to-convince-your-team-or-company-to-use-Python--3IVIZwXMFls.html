the right choice for our needs so this
is a question that I got over email from
a debater auric newsletter reader and I
want to share some of my thoughts in
this video so this is written from the
perspective of someone who's trying to
convince their company their team to use
Python because they love Python
themselves and now they want to get
their team their whole company on board
the Python train so I think the answer
here heavily depends on how much
influence do you have in the
organization right like are you someone
that carries a lot of weight that people
trust and that people lean on for advice
then you're certainly gonna have you
know an easier time convincing people to
go with Python I mean if you own the
company or if you're the CTO then you're
gonna have a really really easy time
because you're just gonna tell everyone
what to do and that might not be the
best strategy to get the buy-in but you
know it's it's gonna that's gonna
influence kind of the strategy that you
want to apply there so for my answer I'm
gonna assume that you know you're you're
kind of in an established position out
of competent a company you're working
with a team and you really love Python
you want to get them on board the Python
train but you don't really have the
power to you know pull rank on on
everyone else and just kind of steer a
ship and be like yeah we're doing Python
now I'm also not saying that that's what
you should be doing if you can do this
because people are gonna are not gonna
like that and you know it's not not
gonna be a great result so how do you
build that buy-in from from people how
do you get people to consider Python for
their programming work and I think in
order to do that successfully
essentially you have to become an
advocate for Python within your company
you know you have to go out of your way
to show people what what nice like how
nice the language is and how much you
enjoy working with it and maybe how much
they would enjoy working with the
language and personally I found a great
way to do that is to to see if you can
give presentations in front of the the
whole engineering team or parts of the
engineering team or just for you
team you know if you can go out and show
people as part of a workshop or just you
know it's part of a 10 or 20 minute
presentation what you've built with
Python and how Python is a really nice
and enjoyable language then I think
that's that's gonna help you build up
that momentum and you know I wouldn't
try and sell the language too hard
because if well if you're not in a
management position or if you're not
within the company leadership people
might not appreciate if you're you know
trying to get everyone to write Python
and the company may be has decided to do
to do Java primarily right if their Java
shop it'd be very hard to kind of move
them away from from that mindset and for
good reason right it's often very hard
to kind of change the whole company
mindset and switch languages therefore
for everyone so you have to build that
change slowly and kind of feel what what
the response is you know how do people
react to this and if things go well and
you keep doing this over time then maybe
you can get more and more people
convinced to try out Python and do a
little bit of programming and Python on
their own and I think this is how you
build up this momentum over time and
this is how you kind of rolled a
snowball up the hill and then eventually
if you get enough people on board there
maybe you can consider you know Python
for a small project like maybe building
some tool in Python and then showing
that it was a good experience that
people enjoyed it that it was a more
productive experience and that it could
save the company money by making
everyone more productive and I think if
you can demonstrate that outcome you
know this is really a show don't tell
moment if you can demonstrate that
outcome then it will be easier to help
the company make the shift to a more
modern programming language like Python
so these are some of the strategies you
can apply there if this answer was
helpful and you'd like to get your own
question answered then just leave a
comment below here in YouTube and I'll
try and tackle a a question in a new
video by the way I'm trying to figure
out my lighting setup here I'm almost
getting blinded because now I have this
little lamp above the camera it's like
right into my face I'm trying to get
away from sort of the zombie look or
kind of the two-faced look with a lot of
shadow on my face in these videos so if
you've got any tips for me then I'd be
happy to hear your thoughts and how to
improve that as well all right take care
and happy Pythian e</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
