common complaint that I see from new
Python developers or those Python
developers who want to take their skills
to the next level boils down to saying
my Python code looks ugly and it's
confusing how can I fix it and there is
a couple of ways you can move past that
barrier and get better at coding Python
and I want to show you one that I've
seen work very effectively over and over
again and it is using a Python code
linter and there's exactly one that it
would recommend very much called flake
eight because it's a combination of a
static analysis tool that you know is
going to call you out on some just plain
bugs in your Python code and also a
Python code style checker which is going
to call you out on formatting
inconsistencies and just things that are
ugly or confusing about your code so
I've got a little example here and we
can look at this and say okay you know
it looks kind of decent like what's run
it um creates two random numbers
multiplies them seems to work awesome
let's ship it
but when we actually you know try and
read this file look at this
it just looks hilariously ugly it is
really inconsistent like we're you know
doing these things we're importing more
than one module per line then the
formatting is not consistent we're using
different indentation levels we're
actually creating this variable here
that we're not using there's all these
random spaces that shouldn't be here it
just kind of seems just really ugly and
not very organized now the good news is
that there's actually a tool that can
help you with these problems and it's
called flake eight so let's go ahead and
install it right now using pip we're
just going to go pip install flake eight
run this and once it's done we have a
new command available called flake eight
and we're just going to run this on our
example python file and just like that
it's detecting a whole bunch like a
whole list of things that are just weird
or odd or plain wrong about our code and
if you've got your terminal set up
correctly and I've got another video
that shows you how to do that
you can actually click these
recommendations and jump directly to
that line in your editor so here in the
first line flake eight is complaining
that we're importing cysts but we're not
using it so we want to get rid of Sis
here right and then it also complaints
about the fact in the same line that
we're using multiple imports on one line
so again this should be split up and
it's finding all these other problems
like we're not spacing our functions
apart we're using inconsistent
indentation and all of these things now
this is pretty usable by itself right
you might as well run this tool like go
and run this tool right now in any
Python program you've ever written and
you're going to learn tons and I promise
it's going to make you a better Python
programmer now the other thing you can
do is actually integrate flake eight
directly with your editor I personally I
really like sublime text so I've got
this set up here where every time I save
a file
it runs flake eight and it gives me
feedback on my
code and I think this is really the
secret to moving past that stage where
we're you're writing in consistent code
that is not formatted correctly and you
catch yourself making all these tiny
little bugs in your in your day to day
work right this can really help you with
that because it makes it extremely easy
to avoid these mistakes right we can
just get rid off these unused imports
and then here we want two spaces
according to pepp eight here for example
you can see that the indentation isn't
right
now if I run flake eight again I'll
actually see that we're creating this
variable this local variable that we're
not using so let's get rid of it um add
some more spaces here all right we've
got some inconsistent formatting here as
well so let's fix that again same thing
here and that's probably complaining
because we have too many extra spaces in
here and all of a sudden this whole
thing just became a lot easier to read
and it still works
so if you're interested in getting your
sublime text set up in a way where it
gives you that feedback on your code I
wrote a step-by-step guide book that you
can find at sublime text Python comm but
that shameless plug aside I think for
every Python program are watching this
right now go and install flake eight
this is the tool that I would recommend
there's a couple more like pile inter
and but flake eight will get you started
it is very easy to use it is low and
false positive so you will most of the
time only call out things are actually
just plain wrong or ugly in in the
Python coded checks so I've personally
seen great results from using flake
eight and just getting that constant
automatic feedback I've seen great
results and co-workers and pretty much
anyone I ever talked to and recommended
this tool to so go and check it out
I absolutely love flake eight and I
think it's going to make you a better
Python programmer in the shortest amount
of time possible all right thanks for
listening and good
with setting everything up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
