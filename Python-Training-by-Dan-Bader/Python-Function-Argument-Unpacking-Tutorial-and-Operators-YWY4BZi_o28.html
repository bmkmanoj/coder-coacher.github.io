new video in my Python tricks series
right so today I'm going to talk about a
really cool feature in Python that is
called function argument unpacking and
I'm going to jump right in to an example
here and I really like this feature
because it can make working with your
code a lot easier and it's it's not
super well known I can seem a little bit
arcane but really when you get to the
bottom of it it's it's a really helpful
feature and I think you'll like this
alright so what you'll know at the end
of this video is how to use the Python
function argument unpacking operators to
simplify your code so the operators I'm
talking about here are the asterisk and
double asterisk or I guess double star
operator and I want to give you a simple
example here so let's say we have a
function here that lets us print a
vector and we just wanted to print you
know a nicely formatted vector so this
is just going to call the print function
and then I have some some format string
here that lays out the vector nice and
clean so that it's nice and readable and
we're just going to pass these
components to do that string format and
to give you an example how we might want
to call this function let's say we have
this vector here three component vector
we're going to print it and it's just
going to look a little bit nicer right
you know that now we know that's a
vector and maybe we need that for some
kind of output format or whatever yeah
it's a toy example but I think it still
has a bit of a useful purpose here so
now depending on how the depending on
how we choose to represent these vectors
in our Python code in terms of the data
structure we use to store these vectors
it can get a little bit awkward if you
want to print them so let's say we've
got we've got our vector stored in
tuples like this
or maybe we've got them stored in lists
like this now if we want to print one of
those if it actually gets super awkward
because now what I need to do well I
need to give these indexes manually
right I can't really concentrate like I
can't really talk while I'm typing so
bear with me for a second so you know if
I want to print this vector it gets kind
of awkward I'm sure I could write a
different function that would just take
a tuple vector directly but then what if
my vector is going to be represented as
a dictionary or something else it gets
really awkward and this is where the
function argument unpacking could become
really helpful because function argument
unpacking can do something really
similar to what we've been doing here
manually right where we're was unpacking
this tuple manually there's actually
shorthand to do that in Python so what
you can do here is I call the print
vector function again I can use the star
operator the unpacking operator and just
pass my tuple vector to that print
vector function and and this line here
is exactly equivalent to this line up
there so when I go ahead and call this
we get the result that we expected right
now the cool thing is this would work in
exactly the same way with our list
vector as well and it's even more
powerful than that so I can go ahead and
for example define a generator
expression so this is just going to
generate a bunch of square numbers here
for us and oh yeah that was a typo depa
done for X in range right so this is the
generator expression that we have here
and now I can do the same trick on this
generator expression and what that's
going to do is it's going to fully
exhaust this generator and in passage to
the print vector function so this is
really handy
because now we can transform all these
different data sources and pass it to
the same print vector function and we
don't have to implement you know ten
other versions of print vector but we
can reuse the same print vector
implementation that we wrote in the
beginning and so it's like it's a way to
you know to match together and connect
these different pipes that might not
have the same diameter but you know we
can still connect them with the right
adapter and that is that a little star
operator kind of a crazy analogy I guess
but you know that's that's maybe a good
way to remember how this works all right
so I mentioned the star operator but
there is also the the double star or you
know the dictionary unpack operator so I
want to show you how that works as well
so let's imagine we had our vectors
represented as dictionaries so again I'm
just going to put in a bunch of keys
here that that give a name to these
components in the vector all right and
now we've got our dictionary vector and
now of course we have a problem if you
want to pass that to the print vector
function right because if I just do this
then well that doesn't work can I index
this not really right like there's no
key called
zero so that that doesn't work however
what we can do here is we can use the
double star or unpacking operator to
unpack this dictionary and it leads to
the desired result right so this is
pretty much what we expected here and so
the reason this works is because our
print vector function you remember how
we defined that earlier it actually had
these arguments here that were named XYZ
so so this is the reason why we can do
this so if they were named differently
it Python wouldn't know how to match up
these argument names but in this case it
will work nicely and in the trouble in
general here is that there's no
predefined order to these dictionaries
right so we can't just say oh yeah you
know take the first key the second key
in the third key because there isn't
really an order to them it's it's random
or I mean it's not random but it's
arbitrary like depending on the machine
you're running this on there's no
guarantees on how this is ordered and
you know big sidebar like this is going
to change in Python 3 6 where
dictionaries are going to be ordered by
default for all intents and purposes you
shouldn't assume that they are ordered
so the only way we can do this is by
matching up the argument names here to
clarify that point on the dictionary
argument order so actually you might be
wondering what happens if I use the list
unpack operator to pass this dictionary
vector to the print vector function and
what you can see here is that we're
getting these we're getting just the
keys so this is a way to extract the
keys but we're getting them in in random
order right so this this doesn't really
work for that purpose because there's no
order to these keys like they're
appearing in a different order than in
the initial dictionary expression that
we had here and so that's why we can use
this trick or like the only way to use
this in a sensible way is to use the
double asterisk unpack operator and
having these matching argument names all
right so you know you might already
notice that there's some a bit of a
magic to this so imagine having this
having to explain this to someone
joining your team like every you know
once a month that will probably be
pretty frustrating and so it might not
be a technique you want to use in every
single Python program that you write but
nevertheless it's super important to
know about these function argument
unpacking operators because they can be
such a great tool they can be super
helpful and if you apply them within
reason and you know keeping in mind that
too much of a good thing can be a bad
thing they can be a fantastic tool in
making your Python code more readable
and just making you you know a better
faster more effective Python programmer
so again super cool feature and
basically this whole lesson I've just
been following along and pulling that
out of my new book called Python tricks
the book and it's available for early
access right now so you can get in on a
beta version of the book and you're
going to get new chapters as they come
out and I'm going to put a link to that
in the description so if you're
interested be sure to check it out you
don't have to obviously but you know I'd
really appreciate it and I think you'll
really enjoy it and I think it's going
to make you a better Python developer
alright thanks so much for listening I
hope this helped you out and talk to you
soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
