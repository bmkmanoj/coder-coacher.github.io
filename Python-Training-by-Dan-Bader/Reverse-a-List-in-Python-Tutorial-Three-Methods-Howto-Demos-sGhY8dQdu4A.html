tutorial you're going to learn how to
reverse a list in Python reversing a
list is a very common operation in
programming so in this case you might
have an array or a list let's say with
the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 and you want a
similar list with the same elements but
in reverse order kind of flip the whole
thing on its head and get all the
elements from end to beginning now how
do you do that in Python there's three
good ways to achieve that your first
option here is to use pythons built-in
reverse method so every list object in
Python has a method called reverse that
you can call on a list object and it
will reverse the list in place so this
means we don't create a new list and
copy these elements to that new list but
instead you're going to modify the
original list so this is very fast
because it can happen in place and it
doesn't take up any extra memory however
it will modify the existing list so if
that's what you want if you just want to
flip a list on its head and you're happy
to do that in place then this is the
right choice for you so let's do a quick
demo of what this looks like in practice
so I am in a Python reptile here Python
interpreter session and I'm just going
to go ahead and create a simple list
right I'm going to call this object my
list I'm going to go new list 1 2 3 4 5
so now I've got this list object here
and what I'll do next is I'll use the
dot reverse method to reverse this list
in place so here we've got the reverse
so now when I call this you can see here
there was no return value or I just
didn't return anything or I guess it
returned none implicitly but what this
did was it modified the list in place so
when I inspect the list element again
you can see here now we've got the same
elements and we just flipped the order
so previously we had 1 2 3 4 5 now we've
got 5 4 3 2 1 and this operation
happened in place so it's very fast we
don't need to create a new list
copy these elements around but we're
just taking the existing list and we're
shuffling the order so this can be a
great option if you want to do that
however it's not going to create a full
copy of this list for you and this might
be what you want or it might not be what
you want in any case what I like about
the dot reverse method is that it is
very clear it speaks for itself right
when I go my list dot reverse if anyone
else reads that it's pretty clear what's
going on here right this is very easy to
understand even for someone who's new to
Python or who comes from another
language background they're going to be
able to understand what's going on and
for that reason I really like this
approach your second option would be to
use the list slicing syntax pythons list
objects have an interesting feature
called list slicing basically what you
do you take a list object and you put
square parentheses behind it and then
you use double colons and minus one and
that will take the list and create a
reversed copy of the original list so
will contain all the same elements but
in reverse order now this is going to
take up a little bit more memory because
we need to copy the original list right
we're not modifying the original list in
place but we're creating a full copy
that will be reversed as we're doing it
now this list slicing option is kind of
neat it's kind of short and concise but
the downside is that this is a more
advanced Python feature so it's it kind
of hides what's actually going on behind
the scenes and this is why it's not
really my favorite because it's a little
bit harder to understand what's going on
so if someone sees this for the first
time they might be a little bit
surprised that the outcome of this
operation is that the list gets reversed
so I would probably stay away from it
under most circumstances but sometimes
it can be handy and it's also kind of a
nice way to play with the Python list
slicing syntax let's take a
look at the list slicing syntax so again
I'm going to create a simple list here
again we're going to go one two three
four five and make sure it's worked okay
now we've got this list object and what
I can do now is I can use pythons list
slicing syntax and the way this works is
of all you just put the name of the
object and then you start using the
square brackets indexing syntax I guess
and then you just want to put double
colon and minus one and this will create
a copy of the existing list and the copy
will contain all of the elements in
reverse order you can see here I ran
this operation right I use this
weird-looking syntax to create a
reversed copy of this list and now when
I inspect the original list it didn't
actually modify it and now how can you
hold on to the result of this operation
well you know in this case I've got my
list and I could say okay we're going to
create a reverse copy and we're going to
use the exact same code and now I still
got my list in the original order and I
also have list underscore copy which has
the same elements but in reverse order
so this really confirms that we're
creating a full copy here and this can
be helpful under some circumstances
right if you if you don't want to modify
the original list and just want to get a
copy then this is a good way to do it
now what I don't really like about this
approach is that the syntax can be kind
of hard to understand this is a pretty
advanced Python feature and if you're
looking at a piece of code like that you
know I have to think about what this
does I have to like mentally parse this
out to remind myself that this is a way
for someone to reverse a list and it's
not a very clear way in my mind so in my
opinion that's the downside of this
method now if you're wondering how this
all works behind the scenes so the list
slicing syntax is really powerful so I
just want to you know this video is not
about list slicing it's about reversing
list in Python but I think you you might
enjoy this quick intro here so what I
can do here is I
and use the list slicing syntax for all
kinds of interesting things so let's
take a look at my list again
and then I'm going to go ahead and I'm
going to say hey Python give me a slice
of that list and I want you to start at
index 1 and I want you to go to index 3
and what this will do is it will start
at index 1 and it will go up to index 3
but not into it right so this is why
we're only getting this sub list here
right because the indexes start at 0 and
then you kind of go 0 1 2 3 4 so you've
got to make sure you're not region
around off by 1 because these boundaries
are well I guess they're not really
intuitive or it could be ambiguous right
which is another downside of this list
slicing syntax but basically what
happens here is that you can go like you
put the start index and end index and
then you can put a step so I could say
okay now give me the whole list and I
want to step over every other element
and this is going to give me a sub list
that doesn't contain all of the elements
and really this is the trick that we're
taking advantage of here because we can
say hey give me the full list : : give
me the full list but go over it in step
size minus 1 so maybe that's a good way
to remember what's going on here but you
know like I said this is a little bit
arcane and the good solution I think
it's a pretty fast solution but it's
also a little bit hard to understand now
you've kind of seen the pros and cons
for this approach of course you can use
the syntax but remember that with great
power comes great responsibility
the third option for reversing a list in
Python is using the built-in reversed
function and that's a really exciting
option because neither will it reverse
the list in place nor will it create a
full copy but what it will do instead is
it will return an iterator we can then
use to cycle through all of the elements
in the list to go through all of the
elements in the list in reverse order so
it's not modifying the original and it's
not really returning a new list object
but instead we just get this view into
an existing list that we can use to look
at all the elements in reverse order so
this is a really powerful technique that
takes advantage of some of the advanced
features in Python and as you can see
here in the code example what I'm doing
here and calling the list function on
this reversed function again or on the
result of the reverse function because
what this does it will go and exhaust
the iterator and put all of the elements
from the iterator into a new list which
then gives me the desired result which
in this case was a fully reversed copy
of this list I know this may have been a
lot of gibberish because we just covered
a bunch of stuff iterators and you know
how does that all work so what I'm going
to do next is we're going to take a look
at a demo to play with this approach so
you get a really good understanding of
how it works behind the scenes so I've
got a fresh list object here can take a
look at it
yeah so it really is a list and contains
all the numbers from 1 to 5 now what's
going to happen we call this reversed
function on this list and you can see
here you know I'm using this interpreter
called B Python that gives me
autocomplete and shows me some of the
documentation for built-in Python
functions what you can see here is that
the reversed function returns a reverse
iterator or the values of the sequence
now what does that really mean right so
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to pass my list object to this reversed
function and now what we're getting back
is not a real list instead what this
returned was a list underscore reverse
iterator object very mysterious so what
can we do with it well the interesting
thing is that an iterator doesn't really
copy a list object it doesn't really
modify the original either but it's more
like a cursor that points to elements in
the list or points to one element in the
list and we can go and say hey give me
the next one give me the next one give
you the next one until we reach the end
of the list and now every list supports
that by default but with the reversed
function we can flip the order of this
traversal like how we're going through
all of the elements in the list so
here's another example what I'm going to
do this time I'm going to hold on to
this iterator so I'm just going to say
ref Peter that's you know my fancy name
for this generator and I'm going to call
reverse on my list again and now I've
got this recipe der variable points to
the iterator what I can do now is I can
use the built in next function on this
iterator and every time I do that it's
going to return the next element in the
list here right so we're recycling
through all of the elements in the list
but in reverse order from right to left
and we can keep going here keep calling
next on this iterator and eventually
we're going to hit a stop iteration
exception which is just a normal part of
the life cycle off iterators in python
because that tells us or that tells
python hey you've reached the end of
this iterator and if I try and keep
calling next on it it's going to tell us
hey there's no more values I can return
you've exhausted the iterator so you can
take advantage of that for example very
easily if you're writing a loop so for
example here I could say for item in
reversed my list and I'm just going to
print all of the numbers here but of
course you could do anything with that
value right so when we run this this is
going to very nicely iterate over all of
the numbers in the list but in reverse
order so this is a really good use of
the reverse function because it's nice
and fast
it doesn't actually modify the list it
doesn't copy
it just goes or the elements in reverse
order so this can be really powerful in
these kinds of situations now of course
we can also use the reversed function to
create a reversed copy of a list but as
you saw earlier we just call reversed on
my list we get this reverse iterator
object which is not a real list right so
what we need to do here is we need to
say reversed list so this is just a
variable that I'm defining here and then
I'm calling the list function on the
result of reversed my list so I'm
creating the iterator and then calling
lists on it and what the list function
will do it will exhaust the iterator so
it will go over all of the elements the
iterator can provide and store them into
a list and then return that list so in
this case you know we take a look at
reversed underscore list it's a new list
object and it has all the elements we
want it and it left the original alone
so this is why you sometimes need this
slightly weird-looking syntax or I guess
series of function calls to be able to
turn a reversed list into a real list
object again but you don't have to do
that you can also just use a for loop
and go through all of the elements that
are being returned by that iterator so
this is a really powerful feature great
little feature in Python and it's a
really nice solution I feel like it's
very clean very clear very pythonic
communicates clearly what's going on
here and even someone new to the
language could kind of get the idea of
what's going on even if they don't know
much about iterators now how all of that
works behind the scenes they're probably
still be able to understand that this is
for a versing list
right so that's the reason why I really
like this third option so you just saw a
couple of examples on how to reverse a
list in Python so let's do a quick recap
on what we covered and then we're also
going to talk about what is the best
option for you to reverse a list in
Python so the first option we looked at
was to reverse a list in place with the
dot reverse method and this is a really
nice-looking option kind of clear what
it does it's built into the Python list
object itself so it's going to be
available in most
and like I said it's very clear it's
very pythonic it really speaks for
itself so that's kind of neat the second
option was to use a list slicing trick
to return a reversed copy of the list
and you can see here that the syntax for
dab is a little bit weird it's a little
bit strange and it's kind of hard to see
what's going on here probably not going
to be my first choice but it's always
good to know you know what's available
in the language and that potentially you
could use this then the third option we
looked at was using a reversed iterator
with the built-in reversed function the
challenge here was that this would
neither create a copy of the list nor
would it modify the list in place so we
have to think a little how can we
actually take advantage of this iterator
because you know if you remember the
iterator is just a view into an existing
objects kind of like a cursor inside
that object and it gives us the next
element the next element the next
element and in Reverse does that in
reverse order so using this solution can
be a little bit challenging because
there's advanced topics and
functionality in Python that you need to
know about in order to effectively use
the solution but it can be a really good
solution and it also speaks for itself
it's very clear it actually have the
word reverse in it so if someone else is
reading this code you can probably
understand what's going on and so I
think that makes a pretty good solution
so here's my final verdict in terms of
what you should use to reverse a list in
Python so personally I really like the
first and the third approach using the
list dot reverse method is a great
option it's very fast it's very clear
speaks for itself so I really like that
so whenever you have a situation where
you want to just reverse a list of
elements in place and you don't need a
copy and it's ok to modify the original
then I will probably go with that and if
that's not possible then I would lean
towards the reversed iterator approach
where you just call reversed on the list
object and you either cycle through the
iterator or you actually turn the
iterator into a list object again by
calling lists on it I really like this
because it's very clear and it speaks
for itself I don't really like the list
slicing trick you can use it but it's
kind of arcane it's kind of hard to see
what's going on here and
I think the first and the third option
are both much more pythonic than that
and this is what I would use depending
on the circumstances
alright that was my tutorial on how to

channel I put out a lot of free content
there every single week and if you want
to go beyond that and you're looking for
