sublime text settings you can use to
manage your whitespace and I find them
extremely helpful for making sure that
your Python code remains clean then you
don't have a mixture of tapping spaces
and extra spaces in places where there
should be none and so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna go over these whitespace
specific settings that I have or that I
use most of the time and just kind of
show you what they do so you can pick
and mix and match for for your own
sublime text configuration alright so
the first thing I want to show you is
the draw whitespace setting that I have
set to all and what that does is it
gives me these little dots in places
where there is a space a character and
in places where there is a tap character
it's gonna give me this little
horizontal line and I find that I find
that extremely helpful for being able to
pick out places where there's a mixture
of taps and spaces which is not really
allowed in Python 3 and it's not really
recommended in Python 2 so it's
something you you want to avoid usually
I go with spaces for everything and what
it also does it shows you extra
whitespace at the end of the line which
is also something that you know you
don't really want you want that for
example if you have an empty line here
that is just a line feed you you kind of
want to look you you want it to look
like this and you don't want it to have
extra space characters in here so
luckily there's a setting to fix that
and well number one would be to actually
make it visible by setting the draw
whitespace setting and then what you
want to do is to use these two settings
in conjunction which is the tab size
setting and the translate taps two
spaces setting I recommend setting a tap
size to four but you know you could
choose other values kind of depends on
the code style that you use or that you
have to cite it on in your team in your
company um and the other one is
translate tabs to spaces which means we
want to use four spaces in place off
what would otherwise be a single tab
character and that's the setting I would
recommend for
writing Python too just to show you what
that looks like I'm actually gonna
restore these settings here in the file
that I have open and I'm gonna convert
my tabs to spaces all right so what you
can see here is that now we have a nice
and clean file all the tab characters
are gone and we have uniform spaces in
place of these these tab where
previously we had like a mixture of
spaces in tabs
what's still there are these extra
spaces that are kind of ugly and they
can lead to merge conflicts if you use
source control so we also want to get
rid of those luckily there is a setting
for us to do that and that is the trim
trailing whitespace on safe setting it
kind of does what it says actually if
you set it to true and then save the
file
watch the extra whitespace it's it just
removes the extra whitespace so it's
gonna remove extra whitespace at the end
of lines it's gonna trim it down and
that's kind of useful because it's gonna
keep your files nice and clean and you
don't have to struggle with these stray
lines that have extra spaces because
someone edited a file and didn't have
that setting enabled so it makes it
really easy just to clean that up and
kind of normalize all of your blank
lines for example the final setting that
I have enabled is the ensure new line
@uf on safe setting and you also want to
set that to true so now what this does
is whenever you save a file it is going
to add an extra line feed at the end of
the file which is kind of the
recommendation for many programming
languages some parsers I'm actually not
too sure where it comes from I I think
it comes from some C compiler that you
know wanted to have that would ignore
the last line if you didn't have an
extra line feed there but I'm actually
not too sure so maybe I just made that
up on the spot however it's a general
recommendation to have that in there
just for for cleanliness and it helps to
just turn on that setting and you never
to worry about it right because if
everyone on your team has that enabled
then you don't have to struggle with
adding or removing that extra extra line
so I find that really helpful especially
being able to see the white space when I
write code and these are the settings
that I would recommend for writing
Python with sublime text</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
