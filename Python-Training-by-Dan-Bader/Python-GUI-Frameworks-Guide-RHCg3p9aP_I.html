interfaces or gooeys using Python super
important question for any Python
developer who wants to build native
applications and in this video I want to
give you a quick overview of some of the
more popular packages and options out
there you can use to write and build GUI
applications using Python so the first
framework I want to talk about here is
part of the Python standard library it's
called TK inter tickle enter and it is a
platform independent windowing toolkit
so you can use that to build simple
simple applications simple GUI
applications that are in a
cross-platform way so these are gonna
work on any graphical platform and that
Python works on that Python is available
on and this is built into the standard
library to be honest it's maybe not a
very enjoyable library to work with but
it's definitely an option so check out
the TK inter module in the standard
library
the second option I want to show you is
called PI cute or PI cutie
so the PI cute library is a third-party
library that provides Python bindings
for the QT or
cute framework that is an application
framework that allows you to build
cross-platform GUI Xand they will be
native looking so pi QT or pi cute
however you want to pronounce it can be
a great option to build GUI applications
with Python so definitely encourage you
to check it out you will be able to
build applications that look and appear
like native applications on the platform
that you're on now keep that in mind
because with the next option I want to
show you that is KB you can also build
GUI applications and this is also
available for mobile platform so you can
build Android and iOS applications with
keavy however they're not going to look
like native applications they're gonna
use a different UI toolkit so your
buttons and your controls will look
differently and this can be
or a bad thing certainly a good option
if you want to target mobile and is also
a great framework if you're thinking
about building games and you want
something to to program the graphical
site for your games with so you may want
to check out Kiva if you're doing any
kind of GUI work with Python it's a
fairly popular framework and you should
definitely add it to your list of
candidates for for doing gooeys and
python alright so the next project I
want to show you here is the beware
project and there is a so the beware
project is a collection of different
libraries and frameworks that allow you
to build native looking applications on
various platforms including mobile
platforms so this project is still in
the the early stages but it's very it
looks very promising and I think in the
future this could be a great way to
build native applications using Python
or native GUI applications using Python
so I would also check that out to be
honest as of the time I'm recording this
video which is late 2017 I'm not sure if
this is ready actually to to do very
extensive work but I think it will be
soon and I think this is gonna be a
really really awesome project moving
forward so be sure to check it out at PI
B org all right just for completions
sake I will also wanted to mention the
PI game library here
mmm it's more as the name says it's more
meant for programming games so you can
do graphical games using Python with
that library but because you can do
graphical games you can also use it to
build gooeys they're just not gonna look
like native controls or native GUI
controls so again similarly to Kili
you're gonna have to build your own
controls and I think with PI game you
have to do that from scratch
whereas TV gives you some pre-built
controls like text forms and buttons and
stuff like that but you know it might be
a good option to write your stuff in PI
game especially if you're trying to
build a game which is most likely also a
GUI application
all right so I hope this gave you some
pointers on the different options to do
gooeys with python let me know if I
forgot about anything or if you have
another favorite framework that I didn't
cover just leave a comment below and if
you want me to cover your own Python
question your Python development
question or a career question then also
please leave a comment below and I'll
try and tackle it in one of my future
