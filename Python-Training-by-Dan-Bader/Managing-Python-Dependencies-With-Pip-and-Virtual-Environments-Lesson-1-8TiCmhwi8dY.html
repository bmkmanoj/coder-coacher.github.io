with pip and virtual environments
dependency management in managing third
party Python packages is a super
important topic for any professional
Python developer
in my experience even if you begin with
a simple question like how do I install
a third-party Python package you can
quickly go down a rabbit hole of other
tools and new questions that pop up and
it can quickly get overwhelming this
course will be your one-stop shop for
becoming proficient at dependency
management with python let's take a look
at the course goals by the end of the
course you will know how to install use
and manage third-party Python packages
with the PIP package manager you will
know how to isolate your project
dependencies with so-called virtual
environments you'll know a complete
workflow for finding and identifying
quality third-party packages that you
can use in your own Python projects
you'll also know how to set up
repeatable development environments in
application deployments with a complete
workflow for that using requirements
files
if you're wondering who the disembodied
voice inside your computer is hey that's
me dan Bader I'm a complete Python nut
and I would love to help you improve
your Python skills I started writing
code when I was eight years old and was
hacking away in my Commodore 64 and I
never stopped since programming is a
complete passion for me and I eventually
got a bachelor's and master's degree in
computer science I worked in full time
positions for a few years first as a
software engineer and then later as a
lead developer and today I'm an
independent software developer and
consultant I run a number of Python
projects and I've also been a speaker at
various conferences around the world if
you want some more Python learning
resources check out my website at debate
org I've got tons more tutorials and
videos that will help you master Python
alright enough about me let's take a
look at the course curriculum right now
you're in the first module on the course
the welcome and course overview module
every time I show you the course
curriculum I will always highlight in
bold text where you are at the moment so
next up you'll dive into managing
third-party dependencies with pip and
then after that you'll learn how to
isolate your project dependencies with
virtual environments in the fourth
module you'll learn a complete workflow
for finding and researching quality
Python packages next you'll learn how to
setup reproducible environment and
application deploys
and finally in the sixth module there
will be the course conclusion in a quick
recap that's the course curriculum now
this will be a really practical course
in each module you'll encounter a
mixture of slide based presentations and
hands-on live demos so you can see and
follow along with the exact workflows
that I use to research and find Python
packages or to manage dependencies in my
own Python projects
well congratulations you've just
completed the first module in the course
time to jump in and learn about managing
third-party dependencies with pip</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
