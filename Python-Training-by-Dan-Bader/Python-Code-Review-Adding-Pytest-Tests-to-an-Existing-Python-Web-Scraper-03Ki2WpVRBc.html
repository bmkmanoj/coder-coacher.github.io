code I've got your github page open
already cloned the repo to my machine
and I've already have it open here in my
editor I really like that you have a
readme file that just explains how to
set up some of these dependencies in
requirements txt because I know that
it's a little bit challenging sometimes
to get El XML work especially depending
on a platform but I was actually able to
get this to run and install all of the
dependencies I didn't go with the step
here where I think this compiles it from
scratch but I'm using homebrew as my
package manager and Mac OS and I was
able to just go brew install lip XSLT
and something else that I don't remember
I'm just gonna send you that in in a
comment so potentially that would be an
easier way for people on Mac to get this
to run but in any case that was really
helpful I really like that you have this
here I also like the fact that you have
a proper license file which I think it's
just good practice for any open source
project your requirements txt looks good
it looks like that's actually also the
stuff that we're really using there all
the all the dependencies are pinned to
specific versions which is something
that I think is really good because if
you know if someone were to not do that
then we could easily get into a
situation where people install this at
different times and they end up with
completely different requirements which
just blow up so it's great that that you
have those yeah so what's interesting
about your project is that's a little
bit larger than the project that I've
that I've the projects that are if
you've reviewed before for this code
review series so we're just gonna see
you know how much I can cram in before
it just turns into a super long video
that no one's gonna watch alright I've
got all the dependencies ready and I
just want to make sure I can actually
run this locally all right it's auction
results top pie let's run this it's
doing something and then it blows up
with a
Nexen air connection refused and we can
see here that this is because I don't
have an SMTP server set up locally
that's gonna send email so with this
stuff I think what you could do you know
maybe have something like a special flag
like - - dry run that you check in here
and if that's set instead of actually
trying to send an email we're just gonna
print print out that message so that
someone who wants to run this doesn't
have to actually set up an email server
to send emails and I think something
like that is eventually also going to be
helpful when we're getting into writing
some tests for this as you mentioned in
the email you wrote me that you want to
start testing this codebase writing some
unit tests for it which I think would be
a great next step and eventually you
know we're gonna need something like
that or we either either stub out or
mock out that email sending thing one
more word of warning this is probably
something you want to look into so the
SMTP lip dot SMTP it doesn't use an
encrypted connection by default and I
know there is I think an SMTP underscore
SSL or I don't know how you know if it's
uppercase or lowercase but essentially
that one the other one is encrypted this
one isn't so this might be okay for just
connecting to localhost but could be
something to look into if you ever want
to run this and talk to a remote email
server definitely look into the the
encrypted connection here okay what I
like is that using this pattern here to
kind of factor out a main function
instead of just throwing it into a
script but kind of making sure that this
is separated out and I really like that
just you know one thing that's that's
really jumping out at me right now is
that this main function has these
different faces here right like we're
loading the config file we're
initializing a bunch of settings and
then we have this for loop and we do a
bunch of stuff here
including the email sending send results
where where I would be thinking what if
you would actually factor this out like
pull it out in two separate functions
and then you would end up with you know
something like this where where you
could say okay we have a function to
load the config then we have a function
for scraping the results you know on
some specific site or whatever like this
is not actually real code is more
pseudocode but what would happen is that
instead of having this relatively long
main function you can actually pull out
these parts and then that will give you
the power to test them separately so
maybe to demonstrate that I actually
want to do this refactoring with the
load config function because I I think
that could have the benefit for you also
where in the future you know you're
probably gonna need something like that
repeatedly right like eventually you're
gonna work on another project it's gonna
need some kind of config file parsing
and if you already settled on yanil for
that which i think it's a good choice
then you're probably gonna want to reuse
something like that so I think it pays
in the long run to actually write these
little functions so that you almost have
your own library of things you can reuse
and all of these bricks you can use
reuse to build new programs so yeah so
like I said you know we're gonna
refactor this thing a bit and then see
how that works out so I'm just pulling
this out into a different file here and
now I think what's interesting is that
um it gives or that that piece of code
it actually has the config file
hard-coded I would probably change that
so that it takes a filename and then the
next thing so okay so this is completely
random because I actually worked with
this you want to look into the yamo
library and the load function
because there's also a safe load that's
probably gonna be the better choice in
this case so kind of the the problem
with Yama load is that it's it's
relatively insecure so this is similar
to the the pic whole module in the
standard library which basically has the
power to execute arbitrary Python code
that's fine if you completely control
the the input here let's say the config
file you know if that's always just
loaded locally you write it you know
you're a hundred percent sure there's no
malicious contents in there then using
dot load it's totally fine however if
this piece of code at some point ends up
you know in another project gets copied
and pasted around I've actually seen
this happen at a client where I worked
where there was a very insecure Yambol
dot load in production with user data
and luckily no one exploited it but it
could have been you know very very easy
to do that so yeah my recommendation
would here would be definitely use the
safe load even if it's not giving you a
huge security benefit right now but it's
just gonna keep you a lot safer in the
future ok so now this parses out the
config file right so because now this is
a function I would just say alright it's
gonna return a the actual config
dictionary right and in here we could
just say config equals load config and I
believe it was config dot yam all right
and then I can actually drop this
comment here
well a because we've just completed it
and B now I don't need a comment that
says load the config because the
function is called load the config right
so I'm giving more explicit names to
everything which personally I think
that's a good thing so the next thing
here is I first of all I think it's
great that you're actually checking for
errors here I think that's good
what I would
try and do is to actually give a little
bit more output here with the you know
what would actually went wrong so when
I'm going config Yambol and we're just
gonna move that to rename that to config
back right so now that that file that we
want to load is gone so if I try and run
that program again it's gonna say fail
to read config yeah mo but we don't know
why right I could have also edited the
config file and introduced some kind of
syntax error and then I would get the
same error so what you can do here is
you can just hold on to that exception
and then do something like this where
we're just gonna tack on the exception
message and now if I trigger the same
run I actually get this this error
message here and that tells me no such
file or directory config yamo which i
think is a little bit more helpful so
let's undo that sure it still works yeah
so I would look into that okay so now
the next challenge is that because here
we're actually we've turned this into a
function I'm not sure if this should
have the power to exit the whole program
by itself right because if you imagine
you want it to test this load config
function a challenge with that would be
that you don't want to exit the program
all the time and there are ways to
prevent that from happening but then you
you know you really have to kind of dig
around in the innards of Python and kind
of monkey patch some stuff to to prevent
that from happening which is in my
opinion not the best way to go about it
so I think what this function should do
is we want to maybe define a new
exception class so we can just say
invalid config it's just based on
exception and that class doesn't even
have to do anything where you
but what what we're gonna do now is
instead of triggering an exit we're just
gonna say okay throw this error with the
message we were using before and then
you know it's already pretty clear
what's happening like I don't have to
comment this heavily I don't have to
pass around some kind of string it's
just yeah I get an exception and I know
what happened so okay so I actually kind
of got a do like break that config again
and then run this again all right see so
now already this is getting more and
more explicit right and now we're
getting this invalid config failed to
read config yeah Mel no such file or
directory config yeah mo and actually
just noticing that we've got the the
name of the config file hard-coded here
as well which now isn't even true
anymore so I would probably actually
just change this so that the error we
get in the end is going to be invalid
config no such file or directory config
yeah mo and I think that is
cleaner or actually clearer to see
what's going on now the thing is like
that actually changed the behavior of
your program in my opinion would
actually be fine
to do something like this where you just
let it die with a with an exception and
then you get the full stack trace and we
know what happened I think it's very
it's verbal enough to for people to
figure out what's going on but to
actually make sure it behaves the same
way as you had it before I would do this
invalid config and then we could still
say exit like we will probably want to
print it and do an exit one so now we'd
get exactly the same behavior we would
lose the stack trace so you know
arguably that isn't the greatest the
greatest results here
we probably want to make this a little
bit more explicit so something like that
I think emulates fairly closely what you
had had earlier and then here instead of
doing the exit again I think main
shouldn't really have the power to
trigger an exit by itself but what it
should do and you know this is a minor
point I just like to do that
what if you just returned the error code
you know then it becomes kind of a very
C like and where you're returning the
actual error code and at the end we're
just gonna call exit on the the return
code here okay so let's copy that back
make sure everything still works at the
end I'm not actually sure what happens
when you call exit none so just to make
sure we're probably gonna need to return
a zero just to make sure this is still
behaves the same but then so that why
the reason why I made this change is
then if you're gonna write test for this
eventually you can actually test this
whole main function and it's not gonna
exit the program it's just gonna give
you a return code that you can then test
for in a test case or check for in a
test case and that will give you the
power really to to also reuse this in in
different different programs and in
different scenarios and so I think this
is a change for the better so I'm not
gonna do you know similar things with
this other stuff I think will be really
easy for the the email sending part but
I think the general technique that I've
applied you could use that and use it in
other parts of the code as well right
like here for example we're loading a
sample file again you know this would be
an opportunity for you to turn that into
a constant maybe use it in a separate
function and so on so I think that would
clean it up a little bit I mean there's
you know this is super nitpicky this is
really Pep 8 because the lines are too
long but you know maybe you're using a
different setting like the one reason
why I
like keeping my lines at 79 characters
or kind of the peph eight
recommendations is that in github code
reviews it's just so much easier to have
two files side by side without having to
scroll horizontally and I feel like it
just makes it so much easier if you're
working with a team so much easier to
review each other's code if if there's
just no opportunity for you for people
to scroll horizontally because it's just
it makes it so much harder to line them
line up the files and actually get an
understanding of what's going on at the
same time but yeah like I said this is
super nitpicky and in general I think
your code is formatted formatted well
you know it's it uses consistent
formatting uses consistent spaces for
everything and I really like that okay
so I'm gonna try and like speed this up
a little bit because I don't have too
much more time so here with this thing
initialized global settings mm-hmm I'm I
mean I understand why you're doing it
but I think you would be better off
actually rewriting this at some point so
that you're not just reaching in into
this auction suburb suburb class and
setting these things but instead you're
passing it in every time you create a
suburb object I believe right so right
now what happens like we're reaching and
actually changing this this attribute
here and I would try and change that so
that you're actually passing this in and
as a
a different argument to the dunder init
method because then again again it
becomes easier to test this piece of
code right where now you would have to
make sure that every single test
overrides the settings the changes that
the previous tests made and this all
this housekeeping just makes a lot
harder to write tests but if you changed
it so that you would just create a
suburb object and every single time you
just pass it in that base URL you know
which isn't all that much work then you
can be sure that every suburb object is
actually independent and doesn't have
these global settings so I would
probably change that okay yeah I think I
mentioned that before you could do
something similar here with the sample
sample data
I would probably also extract these guys
here - just to be constants I'm not sure
if they should be in line you know
probably just have these as constants up
there and then set them instead of
having them as plain strings here I like
the fact that you're writing comments
and yeah like I said earlier you know if
you if you refactor this a bit you could
actually in my opinion get rid of these
comments because the code is gonna speak
for itself right the load config part
here it's actually gonna tell us exactly
what's going on okay my suburb yeah this
is a bit of inconsistent formatting I
guess I can Python you would always you
know do this let's leave that for now
like you're you're changing the the
casing style but yeah that's that's not
too horrible okay okay so let's actually
look into the suburb module real quick
again
okay it looks pretty sensible so far I
guess a couple of random things um
you're switching quote styles which
that's like another super nitpicky thing
that I bring up all the time but I
really like them to be
you know consistent for yeah actually
why I don't know I just like things to
be consistent because it otherwise I my
OCD kicks in and I just get this like
okay why ice is forming it differently
if I want to search for for all the
strings in a file you know it becomes
harder to write the right reg X to do
that and all these things so yeah for
some reason I'm just a stickler for
making that consistent yeah okay so
there are a couple of things and this is
actually being called out by the linter
as well so I'm seeing that you're you're
doing this right where are you going if
none equals equals separator and so I'm
thinking you're probably doing it in
this order to avoid like isn't this like
some kind of C trick to avoid turning a
comparison into an assignment like if
you had if x equals equals null right
and then we're doing something and then
that could accidentally turn into x
equals null and then you would this
would always be true and it would be a
huge bug essentially and if you're
flipping this around null equals equals
x then if the same mistake happens it's
a compiler error because you can't
assign to null so I I think that's where
it comes from now the idea behind that
is actually really good because the same
thing could happen to you in Python
right like you could be like separator
equals equals none and then actually
dentally do this and then you can end up
with an assignment which
you're not sure if this is this valid
Python let's see okay yeah so you can't
actually do that in Python but the idea
is good right like you're you're
thinking of stuff like that which it's
something that I really like so actually
the recommended recommendation Python
would be to to not even use the equals
equals comparison I mean this is being
called out by the linter as well right
so flake eight-tails mean comparison to
none should be if condition is none so
you want something like if separator is
none and the reason for that is with
equals equals you're checking for
equality and that will depend on how
that object or the object you're
implementing how they are at the objects
you comparing how they are implemented
so you're you're not you know some of
them might actually say hey yeah I'm
equally none because I'm empty or
whatever but you don't want that usually
what you want is an is comparison which
checks for identity so in this case none
is like a global singleton there's there
can only ever be one none object in an a
Python process and therefore if you're
using the is comparison you're on the
safe side because then you know you also
can't accidentally change that to an
assignment and we just established that
that wouldn't even work but this is the
way you would compare to none and you
wouldn't use the the equals equals
comparison right and it would be the
same here where you would just use is
not none and this is interesting because
again I think it really shows how
powerful a good linter like flate if
lake 8 is where it actually calls out
these things right and tells you about
them so i think again you would really
benefit from from actually running flake
8 over your your code just to maybe
demonstrate that really quickly how you
would go about that just install flake
eight my running pip install flake eight
and then we could just run that on the
auction module and we should get yeah
forget a bunch of messages here where
we're comparing to none and and this
seems like it's happening quite a bit so
you know maybe you want to look into
that and actually just train yourself to
use is to avoid these comparisons but
overall it's looking pretty good I like
that you're breaking up these yep that
would work I mean again here you know I
would change the quote style on all of
them just to make them consistent but
I'm you know I'm not going to be trying
not to be so nitpicky this is a bit
weird so we're creating this feature
dictionary and then setting it to the
empty dictionary not entirely sure why
we would do that
yeah I think I've seen that a couple of
times were you computing the hash of
something again that could be its own
function I think it would be totally
fine if that was its own function right
it's up here as well we're doing the
sha-1 I mean here you're passing an
image but with all of this stuff maybe
it makes sense to actually extract this
because then it makes it really easy to
change the hash function globally for
example mm-hmm yeah okay so I think my
general comment here would be that maybe
again this is doing this object is doing
a bit much like so my main feedback
essentially here would be that this
seems to be doing some parsing and
scraping right we're running a beautiful
soup on this thing now what this also
does is is actually it creates these
emails that we're going to send and
again I think you could come up with a
structure where these are separate
concerns right so you have like a supper
parser object that is only concerned
with parsing out some HTML that you hand
it and then you would have a suburb
massive suburb report generator or
something like that that could take a
parsed suburb and then based on that
actually generate that report or maybe
it would take multiple suburbs like
essentially you could split up these two
concerns of parsing the HTML and
generating the report I think I would
probably split those apart again that's
gonna help you with testing we're gonna
get to that in a minute and I think it
would make your code a little bit
cleaner and then also you know these
classes would be if you split that in
two they would be half as big which I
think would be good in terms of
maintainability and like I said for
writing tests and just understanding
what's going on so I think this would be
helpful I don't want to go too deeply
into this but
what I want to do is I want to get a
little bit into testing just because you
mentioned it and so we're gonna do that
in a minute all right so one more thing
I wanted to dig into is just give you
you know a very simple set up for
running tests so you can get started in
writing tests because that's something
you actually mentioned in your email so
I like using PI tests which is kind of
um yeah it's a Python testing tool it's
kind of an alternative to just using the
built-in unit test way of structuring
your tests it has it requires a little
less boilerplate code which i think is
good I really like simplicity and it is
also a very good test runner that will
find your tests automatically so you
don't really have to worry about running
them manually writing scripts to do that
so I'm a huge fan of Pi tests and I just
want to show you how to set it you know
how to set it up in how it all works so
all we need to do really is
we need to pip install PI test and what
I want to do is I want to write a little
test for this load config file with the
refactoring we did earlier so what I
would probably do is just create a new
file that we're gonna call test config
let's call this what should we call the
module config parsing PI I just want to
make sure this actually works so what I
would usually do first is have a failing
test so I can make sure we're actually
running the tests and then once I have
something that fails I can add to that
and kind of work towards where we have a
test a suite of tests that actually
tests something so what I need to do
here and you might not have to do this
is I need to ignore my virtual
environment so that PI test only finds
the test is actually relevant to us
all right so now to run this test just
gonna go PI test - - ignore equals vnf
because I need to tell it to ignore the
virtual environment folder because
otherwise it's just gonna find a crazy
amount of files to test that are really
irrelevant to our project here your
project here okay so this is running it
found the test config parsing and it
actually the test failed right just like
we wanted it so now we know this works
so in order to test this I think this
could actually be its own module so what
I would probably do here now is create a
new module we're just gonna call config
parsing PI I'm just gonna dump all of
that in here and you can get rid of the
Yambol stuff I think as well then I
would say from config parsing import
load config and invalid config using
gamble anywhere now okay so now let's
make sure your program still works which
is you know if we had a proper test
suite then we would just run tests and
hopefully that would give us a good idea
of everything's still working okay all
right so now in the test config parsing
we're essentially going to do the same
right we're just gonna import that and
now we can start writing our tests so I
think a good test would be to to try and
parse a simple Yama file
well actually let's try and make sure if
we give it a file that doesn't exist
it's not gonna work so test missing
config and you always want to start your
so essentially how bad the PI test
runner works is that it loads all the
modules let's start with test underscore
and then finds all the functions that
sort with test underscore in those
modules and then runs them as test cases
and the way your your testing conditions
in tests you just use the built in
assert statement and then PI test is
essentially going to do some magic to
give you really nice error messages for
these tests so in this case I would just
say load config does not exist
yamo right hopefully that doesn't exist
so now the thing is with that is because
that function now raises an exception
and invalid config exception we got to
make sure that this exception we expect
this exception to come out right so
there's actually a helper in PI test to
do that where we can say with PI test
races invalid config and then it that's
our test case so when we run this it
passes and what this helper statement
makes make sure is that actually you
know we throw like this load config
function actually throws a invalid
config exception so if I change that to
just return 42 we should get an error
that we're not calling an exception
right did not raise
invalid config that way we can be sure
we're actually testing the right thing
all right so the next test I want to
write is one where we actually try and
parse out a valid config file so we're
just gonna call this test valid config
don't keep it there simple so now the
challenge with that is when you look at
this load config module it actually uses
open to parse out a file from the file
system and this stuff is always a little
bit hard to test but I also really like
PI tests because it has some support for
that kind of situation with its fixtures
mechanism and so the way this works is
and this is gonna seem a bit magical
which is some well I think that's a bit
unfortunate but on the other hand I
think it's really powerful
so maybe just bear with me and see if
that you know feels right to you I think
it in this case would be a really good
way to test this piece of code so what
you need to do is just tell PI test to
give you a temporary directory fixture
and that just works by giving it a temp
Deere argument and then magically PI
test is gonna give you a temporary
directory to work with that so we can
just say okay the temp config is
something that we create in this
directory right we're just gonna create
a new file here temporary file and then
we can actually write stuff into this
file write text so we can just say
something right let's just say hello yes
and then we also need to pass an
encoding we're gonna go with utf-8 here
and now what you can do is you can call
ster path or you can take the star path
off that config file or that temporary
file and this is actually going to be
the areal path that then open can work
with and and read through the contents
that we just wrote to that file so we
can actually say parsed can
Figg equals load config give that path
and then we can do a bunch of assertions
right we could say parsed config hello
should be equal to true and it actually
worked right because the animal thing is
gonna convert the yes to true and you
know just to make sure this actually is
making sense let's actually get this to
fail so that's one thing I always try to
do break the test before you're moving
on because otherwise you're not gonna
know if it's really actually testing the
thing that you want to test yeah so in
this case we're getting an assertion
failure here and I think this looks
pretty good I mean we could go we could
go crazy with this and you know make
this more complicated which maybe is
worth it it's a good question you know
like we could we could actually change
the contents here make that a little bit
more complicated right like if we wanted
to do something like this we could do
that
oh wait like this I could say okay hello
yes
on number 42 and then we're gonna write
that out to file and then we could say
okay hello is true
yeah let's just you know make sure it
actually fails but kids - oh yeah never
mind
maybe - don't need that okay so we could
run this okay and then we can have a
little bit more complicated tests so
yeah so this should still work okay so
this is looking pretty happy and you can
pass - V for verbose mode and then you
can actually see a little bit more
closely what's going on here okay and so
now that we have our test for a valid
config file I would actually do the same
thing but for an invalid file and let's
move that up here for super consistency
so all the bad tests or in one section
and the good tests are below that so I'm
here let's try and come up with a way to
actually have an invalid yamo file I
don't know let's just put a bunch of
percentage characters here
and now what I would expect to happen
there is this to actually throw an
exception so let's just run this okay
and we're getting a crazy
yeah mol scanner error here and there is
actually I think there's like a base
class for all of the yam Belarus right
which is called yeah no error so I think
what we want to do because we actually
found a problem with load config here as
well where right now this is just
looking at OS error and IO error that
this should also handle other yama lairs
that we weren't really handling before
so now when I run this again it's
throwing an invalid config exception and
then PI test races I can do the exact
same
pattern here there we go
and oh wait what did I screw up now oh
okay I'm missing closing braces okay so
now we're again we're checking for an
invalid config exception yep doing this
so now I think this is looking pretty
good this is not you know by any means
exhaustive yet but I think for a program
program or a tool like that like we have
here it's actually pretty good test
suite you know just for this little
function yeah I guess probably what what
you're thinking I was like oh man this
is gonna take a lot of work to write all
these tests yes on the other hand
they're also gonna uncover a lot of edge
cases and stuff that you know like going
into this I didn't realize like we're
actually missing that that piece here
where we're checking for Yama lair and
this might not actually be you know it
might not make sense to spend that much
time if it's just a simple script or as
a small program that like you have here
but just having the ability to write
these tests and then kind of building on
top building on top of them I think
makes this whole development process a
lot more I'm sustainable in the sense
that you know you can eventually use
that config parsing module in another
project and if you just bring over that
whole test suite you're you're gonna
have a pretty good idea of well you know
you're gonna have gonna be able to put a
lot of trust into it and so I think that
pays dividends but you know in the end
it's it's totally up to you if you want
to go down that route
do check out PI test I'm a huge fan of
that and admittedly this was a little
bit more challenging to test because we
were actually access accessing a file
here so you know normally you wouldn't
have to have to deal with all this
craziness but we would kind of focus on
simple assert statements just to make
sure your your functions work
the way you want them to and you know if
you want to go deeper into this I would
actually recommend that you try and do
similar things with the rest of your
code right like try and break it out
into simple sort of self-contained
chunks and then write tests for those
and I think whatever happens there this
is gonna be something that is gonna help
you in your in your Python journey and
it's just gonna help you establish these
these patterns and you're gonna see
stuff like that sooner then right
because you're you're gonna be writing
these tests and as you're writing a new
function you're gonna be like oh how do
I actually actually test this and this
is gonna create this like feedback cycle
where the need for writing good tests is
actually gonna influence how you write
your code and usually like I believe
that code that is easy to test is
usually also easier to understand and
easier to maintain
so yeah look into that it actually seems
like a really cool project seems like a
really useful thing that you've built
here for for yourself and it's a great
sort of baseline or great result you can
build on top and it's just kind of you
know make it nicer and cleaner and nicer
maybe just as an exercise to try and
write the cleanest Python you can like I
find that a lot of fun so maybe you'll
enjoy that too cool that was a bit of a
long one so I hope this is gonna be
helpful enjoy the video and talk to you
