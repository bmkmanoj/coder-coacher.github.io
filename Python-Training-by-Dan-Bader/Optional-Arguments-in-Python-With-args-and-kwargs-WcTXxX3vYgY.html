talk about the star args and double star
quarks or keyword arguments and this is
again a feature in Python that can be a
little bit arcane if you're seeing it
for the first time just because it looks
a little bit weird and it has this
strange sounding name right arc and
quark and what is this even good for so
I want to talk about how these things
work what they're good for and how you
can use them to write better programs to
write more pythonic Python and just
become a better Python developer alright
so how do these guys work how do these
arcs and quarks work so let's take a
look at the simple example here some
defining this function foo here that
takes one required parameter and then it
also has these arcs and quarks here and
what it's then going to do it's it's
going to print all of these these
arguments right so if you have arcs
we're going to print them if we have
quarks we have them we're going to print
them and we're also going to print the
required argument and that is going to
be our test bed to actually inspect
what's going on behind the scenes so
first of all what you can see here is
that this function because of this
definition it will require at least one
argument that's called required but it
can also accept extra positional and
keyword arguments now if we call this
function with extra arguments then args
will collect all of the non named or
positional arguments and quarks will
collect all of the keyword arguments and
this happens because these parameters
are called arcs or quarks but because of
that little star operator right it's
just sort of a naming convention to call
them arcs and quarks and they're kind of
piratey and easy to remember right arc
and quark okay so we have this foo
function now and what I want to do now
is call it with various
combinations of arguments so that you
can see what actually happens behind the
scenes so the first case is really easy
we're just going to call foo without any
arguments and in Python is going to
complain that hey I need at least this
one argument called required so I guess
that was kind of expected now the second
case is where we would call foo with the
required argument just going to put in
hello you can see here okay we get hello
as the printout it looks like we didn't
have any arcs or quarks and now what I'm
going to do next is I'm going to call
foo again I'm still giving it this
string here as the required argument and
then I'm adding a bunch more numbers
here that are going to be the extra
positional arguments so when I call this
you can see here that it printed the the
arcs here right so now we had arcs it
arcs wasn't empty but now it's actually
a tuple containing all of the extra
positional arguments that were collected
and now we can go beyond that and
besides having these extra positional
arguments I've also added these two
extra keyword arguments right called
them key one and key two now when I run
this you can see here that this results
pretty much the same as before but now
we also have this dictionary here dad
contains all of the extra keyword
arguments so we didn't order the
function didn't really ask for any of
these arguments to be passed in but it
was able to handle them and the Python
runtime collected all of the extra
arguments inside this arcs tuple and
this quarks or key word args dictionary
which means that now our function can
use them for something useful so with
that method you could create functions
that react differently depending on how
many or you know what kinds of
parameters you pass in which could be
useful they also allow you some other
techniques that I want to show you now
okay so the first technique that we can
use these extra positional and extra
keyword arguments for is that we can
write wrapper functions
that modify or you know do something to
those arguments and then actually pass
them on to the original function so here
I've redefined foo again and now foo is
actually calling bar but before it calls
bar with the same arguments it makes
some modifications to arcs and keyword
arcs so you can see that here we're with
keyword arcs is really easy because this
is just a dictionary so you can you know
mutate it in place and I just added this
name key to keyword args with arcs
because it's a tuple you need to create
a new object and then use that because
tuples are immutable so you can't add
stuff to them so here you know what I'm
doing I'm just taking args and I'm
adding this extra string here I store
that as new arcs and then when I call
the original function or the wrapped
function I pass all of this stuff to bar
the original X and then the new args and
the modified keyword arcs using this
star and double star operator and this
gives us a way to wrap an existing
function and actually make some
modifications to the arguments that are
getting passed in and then still kind of
reassembling everything and calling the
original function and kind of the nice
thing about that is that I don't really
have to know what args or keyword are X
looks like right so I can just kind of
take whatever I'm given and then or I
can write a function that takes whatever
its given and then it can make
modifications where it wants to and then
pass that on now this sounds a little
bit dangerous and it totally is because
it can definitely create a maintenance
nightmare but in some cases when you're
wrapping some external library this
could be the way to go right so I just
wanted to point that out but in general
you maybe want to be careful with that
all right here's another example so this
method can also be really helpful for
sub-classing so let's say you want to
extend the behavior of a parent class
without having to replicate the full
signature of its constructor in the
child class
and for example if you're working with
an API that changes outside of your
control so you know this is the
ever-popular car class that takes a
color in the mileage and then I've
extended that with the always blue car
class that is going to call the parent
class so it's going to call the parent
class constructor with this super dunder
init and then it's just going to
override the color and now you can see
here the way this is implemented I
didn't actually duplicate the
information up here the parameters up
here so I didn't call this color and
mileage and so on but I just said hey
give me everything that was there
previously and then I took those and
forwarded it to the original constructor
up here and then I just went in and kind
of overrode the color to be blue now
while this is a super powerful technique
for wrapping these these classes are
changing the behavior for class that you
don't want to kind of replicate large
portions of it and you maybe you just
want to selectively override something
if it's if it's not a class that you
have control over because the third
party class then this could be a viable
method just to kind of patch that
information in but on the other hand
there's some downsides associated with
it as well so one downside is that now
this always blue car has a really
unhelpful signature in its constructor
right it just says args and kwargs which
doesn't really tell you the kind of
arguments it expects so you would have
to fix that with a good dark string and
say hey you really want to look up the
car class this is just a thin wrapper
around it be careful with that now the
most likely scenario where you would use
a technique like that if you want to
override some external class or some
behavior in an external class which you
don't control which is a pretty good
motivation but you know it's always
dangerous territory to do that right or
otherwise probably it's going to be you
who's going to be screaming argh and
quirk if you're doing that too much so I
would definitely be careful with this
because it's a super potentially helpful
technique about on the other hand it
could also be extremely dangerous okay
there's actually a third way where you
can use this
ticking for great effect and that's when
you're writing decorators which are
basically wrappers around other
functions and there it's pretty much all
the code examples you see out there
they're going to use this technique to
wrap a function and just forward
arguments to it right so this is where
you can apply that method as well so
this is a really powerful feature in
Python and this is definitely something
that I would play with and explore if
you want to become a better developer
and make your Python code more clean and
beautiful and more pythonic because it
is used quite frequently so play with it
and understand how it really works that
would be my recommendation
but of course with a technique like that
it's kind of this with a lot of power
with with great power comes great
responsibility right so you want to make
sure you balance that to keep your code
explicit enough to kind of balance it
with the need just to well you know for
your convenience versus the convenience
off the future developer or your future
self is going to be working with that
code so you know again I just wanted to
mention that because it's a tough choice
to make it's definitely something that a
great developer should be thinking about
when they're writing code so I hope this
helped you out I go deeper into the
subject in my book called Python tricks
so if you liked this episode of Python
tricks the surf the videos and on the
YouTube channel then be sure to check
out the book I'm sure you'll love the
book it's a great way to recap all of
that stuff and then go deeper into other
subjects and it's a great way to
solidify your learning and to actually
have a handy reference for all of the
stuff that you can apply in your
day-to-day work all right happy python
Inge and I talk to you soon thanks so
