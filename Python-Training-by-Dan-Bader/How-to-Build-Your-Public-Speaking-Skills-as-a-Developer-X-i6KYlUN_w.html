a while ago I did a video on how to
speak at a tech conference and kind of
how to get in to a tech conference like
PyCon like I was talking about how I
spoke at at PyCon Germany and how I got
my talk into that conference now I was
talking about how you know you need to
kind of submit talks to these
conferences write an abstract for your
talk and just kind of try and pitch your
talk to these conferences and then
hopefully get in and so I think that
that is viable you know it's possible to
pull that off as a beginner even with no
prior speaking experience but it could
also be a bad experience right like if
you're overextending yourself on
speaking you know in front of a couple
of hundred people and you're you're
gonna have a bad time it's gonna be
recorded on video this could also really
suck so I don't you know I don't want to
scare you out of that if you think you
can pull it off go for it absolutely let
me know how it went you know I wish you
all the best but I I wasn't able to do
that I had to work my way up to get into
into bigger conferences overtime right
and so the way I built up that skill and
build up kind of that confidence and
just being comfortable doing that
you know I'm still like to be honest
with you like I'm still scared shitless
every time I give a presentation but I
just noticed that the quality that comes
out at the end has gotten much better
over the years
and he doesn't show as much but I still
feel the same basically to be perfectly
honest with you but okay so so the angle
in this video is going to be how you
know what are some other ways I can
build a speaking skill so that
eventually I can go in and use my skills
at a bigger tech conference okay so
here's the approach that worked for me
basically try and speak as much as you
can at work in your current job if
there's an opportunity for you you know
to give like a presentation over lunch
just to your colleagues and develop our
friends on some kind of technical topic
absolutely go for it you know it's gonna
be a very comfortable setting people are
going to sit around they're gonna be
eating lunch you know just three four
five of your colleagues and friends
there sit down give them like a 10 15
minute presentation I'm some tool that
you found or you just walk them through
it and and get some experience doing
that like this is I think anyone could
do that
or it could build up the courage to do
that I know it's still hard to do that
in the beginning especially with people
you know that you actually care about
and care about their feedback but this
is a really good way to start building
these speaking skills in in like a
comfortable setting now I think a step
after that could be either trying to
speak you know to a bigger audience at
your company or you know the people you
work with like you know go from three
people to maybe 30 people maybe you
could give a presentation for a whole
department or something like that you
know if you're working at a startup or a
company where this is actually possible
that will be a way to scale that up
another way it would be and this is
actually what I would recommend is to go
to development meetups so a meetup group
is just a bunch of people are interested
you know in in one topic like let's say
Python or JavaScript and they meet
usually on a regular schedule and people
will give presentations and often there
will be food and then you know people
just talk about this stuff and there is
a a really good site where you can find
these meetup groups and that is at
meetup.com and these meetups are usually
put on you know by people in the
community very often it's companies who
are sometimes trying to hire people you
know from a meet-up or like it's a way
for them to to kind of show that their
cool place to work at and almost every
bigger city will have will have a meetup
scene like that and so these meetups are
great to gain more speaking experience
because it's a lot easier to get in that
the stakes are lower you can just go
there speak to a group of you know
depending on the size like 10 20 30 some
meetups get like super popular but you
know you can pick a smaller meetup to
start with and just give a praise and
presentation of these people and the way
you get in there
you don't really write like a big
proposal and an abstract and all of that
you just talk to the people who put on
the meetup right you just find the
organizer and and usually they're
desperate for people to give
presentations because usually it's all
on the organizers so reach out to them
just email them or go to the meetup and
actually talk to them in person like hey
I've got this idea could I give a
presentation one of your next meetups I
you know really like what you're doing
and I would love to be a part of it and
like 99% of the time people are gonna go
for it and it is a perfect like learning
ground to get your feet wet with with
your presenting skills and just you know
get into get into that habit of speaking
in front of people and so I would
absolutely recommend going that route
starting with a meetup group and then
you can expand expand from there right
like it's not a super big jump from
going from speaking out of meetup to
speaking out of conference right it's
it's very similar in terms of what will
be involved like a meetup is gonna be
like less organized less professional in
some ways you know some of them are like
many of them are and they're smaller but
this is a really good way to get your
feet wet and they could look either look
for actual like larger conferences will
look for bigger and bigger meetup groups
and just get comfortable speaking in
front of larger crowds and this is a
really really good way to ease into this
whole thing of becoming a speaker at a
tech conference because it's it's super
worthwhile and and it's it's gonna you
know it's gonna pay off in so many ways
and like the relationships you built
with people even speaking at a smaller
meetup will be great for that I mean
even even speaking you know after your
company across teams will be great for
that
so absolutely do that and then try and
build from there and I you know I I
think it would be totally possible to go
from like haven't spoken at any
conference ever or meet up to like I'll
be speaking at a tech conference in
twelve months like you know and have it
have a success with that like not just
walking out and like completely bomb but
like building up those skills enough
that you could give
good like well-received presentation at
a tech conference within a year I think
it's totally doable and I wish you best
of luck with that let absolutely let me
know how that went if you if you do this
and pull this off sent me a video like
I'd be happy to share that or just tell
me how it went I'd really love to know
how this played out for you people have
so much interesting stuff to say and
they a lot of times as developers were
in some sense too timid to go out there
and share our perspective and you should
absolutely do that and and more people
should do that and it's gonna make the
whole developer community better cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
