after previous video I got some
questions around github and basically
open source portfolios or whether or not
you should make github a part of your
portfolio and your online presence as a
developer and so in this video I want to
cover some of that and also talk about
some alternatives here so maybe let's go
over the alternatives first so that you
know kind of what the space looks like
so of course github is kind of the
best-known I think it's the biggest
service offering a repository hosting
and it's free to sign up but then you
can only have public repositories and if
you want to keep your code private you
know for personal projects let's say
like your website or some other projects
you have to pay I think it starts at
four or five dollars a month seven okay
so I've got a paid account and I'm very
happy with github so personally I would
go with github if you're looking to make
this part of your developer portfolio
just because github is such a well-known
brand and it has so much traction that's
why I would go with github now some
alternatives would be good lab which I
think as the main distinction it
probably has a couple more awesome
features that I don't know about it
things like they have build servers and
everything integrated but if you're
looking at it from a portfolio
perspective I think the big difference
is that they do free repositories as
well which doesn't really mean I mean
you could still put your public facing
open-source stuff on github and that's
probably what I would do but good lab
could be a good alternative they haven't
been a lot around for too long it could
be a good alternative another
alternative would be a bit bucket which
again lets you sign up for a free
account they also have free private
repositories as a difference compared to
github personally like I said I would
probably go with github just because
they have the best known brand and I
feel like their interface is the best
personally so I would go with github but
really you know as long as you have as
long as you have some public facing
presence and one of the
platforms I think you'll be fine because
there's not that much of a difference
you know people are going to be able to
browse your code and all that right
let's take a look at my github profile
as an example
so um I set that up several years ago
and just kind of you know started
releasing all of my open source stuff on
on my github and I've got a couple of
projects here so they they recently
rolled out a change where didn't they
let you sort the project that are
displayed here
and you can take advantage of that and
kind of you know put your best work out
there so people can see what you're all
about and I think this is really a key
part of having a good online portfolio
or good online presence as a developer
you know this is I think you should
start with your blog or write about
programming and then very soon after or
almost immediately you want to add
something like a github profiler or a
good lab profile a bit bucket profile
where you just share some of your code
so people can see what your skills level
skill levels are and they can just get a
feel for you and I think it really helps
having some open source projects here
and you know the things you start with
they don't have to be super impressive
right like for example I did this little
thing where I was I was not happy that
there weren't any good readme templates
for open source projects out there so I
started this readme template repository
and it got a couple of likes and it you
know that stuff is very easy to to set
up but it actually provides some value
to people and and people are going to
see that basically you want to make the
world a better place right because
you're putting this work in and you're
giving it away for free and so stuff
like that it really shows that you know
you care about software you care about
programming that you want to give back
to the community and I I really care
about those things and so this is a
great way to do that and then at the
same time get some credit for it so when
you're applying for a job or someone's
going to seek out your github portfolio
or your guid lab or bitbucket portfolio
they're they're just gonna see that
you're active and you know you're
passionate about this stuff and now with
something like schedule which has you
know a couple of thousand likes on
github now or stars or whatever with
this stuff it's all about the humble
gamings right I start I wrote this over
a weekend threw it out there people on
reddit hated it and and now it's won it
you know it's a really popular Python
library on github so if you have
something like that like that has put me
in touch with a lot of people and open a
lot of opportunities for me so this is
great but you know you just got to try a
bunch of things and because you never
really know what's going to get traction
where people are going to like but to to
kind of put a conclusion on that yes
absolutely I think if you're serious
about building an online presence as a
developer I would definitely start with
a personal website add github as soon as
possible and then you probably I mean
you definitely want a LinkedIn profile
as well I think and you probably want to
think about adding a Twitter account as
well and then I think you've got your
basis pretty much covered but at least
that's what worked for me and that's
kind of bias towards that but I've seen
that work really well in other people so
this is kind of the strategy that I
would take alright so if you enjoyed
this video then please subscribe to my
channel I'm going to have many more
videos on this topic and kind of how to
build your online presence as a
developer as a Python developer if you
have any more questions about this topic
and feel free to drop a comment below
