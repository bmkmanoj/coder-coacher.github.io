from the gym and I checked my phone and
I keep getting questions about the
Python projects you should build two to
bootstrap a portfolio to create an
online portfolio for yourself you know
what what kinds of projects should you
be working on and there seems to be a
lot of confusion around you know what
should you be building what should you
be working on how do you get inspired
and how do you find these projects and
where do you get the ideas and how do
you implement them so I just wanted to
share some more thoughts here because
thinking back you know this was actually
also a problem for me when I when I got
more serious about learning how to
program and I think I just kind of
bumbled my way through it and so I'm
trying to you know trying to give you
some strategies you can actually use and
make this process a little bit more
controlled maybe anyway so hopefully
this is gonna help you figure out what
kinds of projects to build so what I
would recommend that you do and this
worked really well for me in the
beginning when I was learning
programming this worked really well for
me too so what I recommend that you do
is reinvent the wheel constantly you
know all the time like every single day
and they're sitting down to code when
you're when you're trying to hone your
skills rebuild an existing project with
your own programming skills you know
take something that that you know
someone else already implemented and
this could be you know it could be
something very simple like a little
clock application an alarm timer
maybe a little command-line unix tool
like the copy command or the list files
command you know dare if you're in
Windows and all of these little tools
just take them
assuming that you understand what they
do and how they actually work take them
and reinvent them like rebuild them from
scratch with Python and by doing that
you're you're you're really gonna hone
your skills you know and it solves the
problem that you have to you know you
have to figure it like if you're doing
any kind of other project and you came
up with on your own like some
kind of idea like you're gonna build the
next-best you know you're gonna build a
next social media website or something
like that or app the challenge with that
is that you have to do what is called
requirements engineering as well you
have to actually figure out what you're
going to build in the first place you
know how is this gonna work like what
kinds of views are there gonna be in the
app and what's the data model gonna look
like and how is you gonna store data and
you know what are you gonna present to
the user and that really distracts you
from the actual programming work you
know this is more design work and system
design work which is important but if
you want to if you want to hone your
programming skills then get rid of all
of that stuff so instead what I what I
would recommend that you do is take some
simple programs and tools that already
exist that you know how they work and
you're gonna remake them from scratch
you're gonna rebuild them and that way
you're gonna learn a lot about the
programming tasks so let's say you're
taking a command like the copy file
command in UNIX you know the CP command
can you do something like that in Python
you know can you sit down and write
something like that in half an hour can
you do it in an hour can I do it in a
day in a week in 10 minutes you know it
doesn't matter the the idea here is that
you take something that is very well
defined and already implemented and you
have some experience working with it and
you're remaking it so with the copy file
command you know you can also reduce the
fidelity maybe it you're not doing a
full-blown replacement which would
actually be a ton of work because
there's so many different command-line
switches and compatibility options but
you know if the simplest case would just
be your command takes an input file name
and an output file name and it just
copies the contents like it creates a
new file and copies the contents of the
input file to the output file you can do
that in Python and maybe doesn't sound
like the most interesting problem but it
solves the huge problem of finding
inspiration and it allows you to sit
down and do something every single day
and it's actually a lot of fun if you if
you ship you know if you
ship something in a sense that well
you've finished a little project and you
can play with it and kind of see how it
works where it breaks down can you make
it a little bit better can you make it
easier to use and and all of these
things right so I personally I find that
really motivating and you can take that
you can do that with all kinds of
different programs different programs
right you can you can apply that same
technique you can do it with unix
commands you can do it with little you
know like windows little like DOS shell
commands and you can do the same thing
of little games like maybe you can
reimplemented games like I feel like for
me the breakthrough and I was like man I
really want to make this my career and
work as a programmer was when I I was
sick at home you know didn't go to
school that day and you know maybe
didn't really like feel like going to
the school that day and I sat down and I
wrote like a Tetris clone from scratch
using using Delphi on on like Windows 98
or something like it must have been
Windows 98
and this just felt like such a huge
breakthrough and of course you know I
was looking up stuff in books and and it
was not like I was just you know in a
complete vacuum like like writing this
like totally without help but it really
you know it allowed me to complete
something and to ship something into it
to have something in front of me that I
could play with and just be it was just
like a really cool moment and it really
put me on that path where I was sure
that from that point on you know I
wanted to make a career out of
programming so I would encourage you to
to also try this technique and to go and
just reinvent the wheel now you want to
stop doing that at some point because
you know actually when you're when when
you've learned enough about Python where
you learn enough about programming you
want to stop reinventing the wheel and
you're in your day-to-day programming
work right because that's usually just a
waste of time but in the beginning you
want to do the opposite you want to be
reinventing the wheel all the time
because it's gonna help you hone your
skills and it removes that obstacle
where you're just thinking you know you
just think spending too much time
thinking about what you want to work on
next and what you should be building so
just remove that make a list okay
want to do something right now make a
sit-down right now make a list of 10
UNIX command-line programs that you're
gonna replicate you know and you're just
gonna write them right one of them you
know do it once a week dude once a day
whatever your schedule allows and you're
just gonna go for it
I promise you if you complete this
project you're gonna feel great and you
will have to learn a whole lot so just
off the top of my head a couple of
commands to get your list started do the
copy command the CP command do the cap
command where you just print out a file
to the standard output and do the list
directory command do the remove command
but be careful don't screw up your
computer and let's see what else would
be would be interesting to do you know
you can you can even do you can you try
build a little editor like maybe like
the the less command or something like
that right so there's so many options
you have here or you know something like
a file download command where you give
it a URL and downloads the file and it
stores it on disk somewhere it's sort of
like the curl command so just take these
and just run with it and do that for a
week or however long it takes you and I
promise you're gonna learn a ton and
you're gonna also learn a ton about the
areas where you should be focusing on
you know ever every time you get you
feel like you get stuck trying to
implement a command like that you can
you will know what you need to learn
next you know whether data is
interacting with files whether that is
exception handling whether that is
printing to the console you're gonna
know you're gonna know what the problem
is here and of course you know here with
this with the strategy I'm assuming some
some amount of computer literacy but
actually if you're watching this video
you probably have that already so
alright so best of luck you know please
try this let me know how it works for
you leave a comment below because this
this was huge for me and it really
really helped me start my career
software developer and kind of you know
get on the right track here all right
best of luck and happy Python II</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
