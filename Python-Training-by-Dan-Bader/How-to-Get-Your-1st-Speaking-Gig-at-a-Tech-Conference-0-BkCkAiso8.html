let's talk about how you can become a
speaker at a tech conference because I I
went to PyCon Germany a while ago and I
actually gave a presentation there so I
was a speaker and so a couple of people
have reached out to me after that and
asked me about you know how do you
actually become a speaker at a tech
conference because that seems like that
seems like you know a really fun thing
and and a really good thing to do for
your career and to kind of you know just
make yourself more known and and I
totally agree with that a it's a lot of
fun it's a lot of work too but that's
totally worth it it's great for getting
in touch with people making new
connections you know potentially finding
a new job or a better job and I would
absolutely encourage you to go for it so
coming back to the question how do you
actually become a speaker so you can get
the famed you know speaker a tag on your
badge not that that would matter you
know it's actually not a big deal
so um okay so you do become a speaker
add a larger conference essentially by
applying to be a speaker there right
like very rarely our conference is going
to seek you out if you're not well known
as a speaker I mean if you know that
like uh it happens to people who are you
know that might happen to people who are
super well-known who have published you
know really well-known books these
people will be contacted and people will
actually be seeking them out actively
but if you're if you're a guy like me or
you just want to speak at a tech
conference you have to do all the
legwork and essentially like pitch your
topic to see if you can get in and the
way it works is that okay so these
conferences they work on a schedule
right so let's say the conference will
be in in September one year and these
people they need to lock down a little
like lock in all the speakers they have
for the conference
probably
like in late summer or maybe even before
that depending on how the conference is
organized this is usually how it works
so the most important thing I would say
is you got to be early enough to
actually be able to pitch your talk you
know you need to know about the
conference early enough to be able to
pitch your talk so you can even have a
chance to have it you know reviewed and
and have a chance for it to be accepted
so you can speak at the conference so
definitely know you know when the
conference is asking for proposals or
they call it a call for proposals where
you can submit a talk proposal and then
usually the organizers of the conference
they will vote on that proposal and then
the people who get accepted as speakers
they're basically in and then it's all
about while putting together the actual
talk and in going there and giving the
talk so really the critical thing and
this is where a lot of people kind of
miss out on this is that you need to be
early enough to get your proposal in so
if you want to speak you know at a
conference and let's say six months from
now it's probably a good idea to get
started
like right now or really really soon
right start looking for conferences that
interest you and for example if you want
to speak at a Python conference then you
could just search for Python conference
on Google or find the Python event
calendar and I'm gonna link that in the
description where it lists all of the
upcoming Python events and you just pick
something that's a couple of month out
at least look on their site they will
all have like web pages for the
conference a look there and find out
when the call for proposals is now once
you know that you will know the deadline
when you need to submit your talk and
this is where it becomes more
interesting because now you actually you
know you need to start working on your
talk so usually what this looks like
depending on how well the conference is
organized like maybe they have some kind
of form that you need to fill out like a
web form you need to fill out and I kind
of walk you through what you need to
fill in or you can just send them you
know some kind of pitch like an email or
a PDF asking to accept you as a speaker
or sometimes people actually ask you to
create a pull request for
the conference repository so people can
review it there and now however you
submit that actual information you want
to make sure you cover some key things
to go into that proposal because that
having like a nice proposal will really
really increase your chances of actually
getting your talk accepted so the
structure that I use and I'm gonna put a
link in the description where you can
grab just my proposal template and then
use that you know for your own proposal
so the structure I use well of course I
put the talk title try and have some
kind of catchy title that actually looks
like people would be interested in in
watching that talk so put the talk title
I always put the intended audience level
you know you might say something like
this is for beginning Python developers
this is for intermediate JavaScript
developers this is for advanced web
developers just something like that to
give people an an idea of what audience
you have in mind and then that also
shows that you're thinking about this
stuff you know 80% of the people who are
submitting talks they're not thinking
about this stuff they're not thinking
about okay how could I benefit the
audience how could I benefit the
organizers so by putting stuff like that
like the intended audience you're
actually showing that you care about
your audience right when you're speaking
you just you don't want to go out there
and just talk about stuff that you care
about and you're the only person who
cares about that right so it always
helps to have that reflected in the
proposal then I would have a brief
description you know just around 400
characters like very short like a 1/2
sentence description that people could
quickly get an idea of what your talk is
about which also forces you you know
yourself to talk to think about what
your talk is really about what's the
core idea you know I would call that the
brief description or core core idea of
the talk and then I would give like a
proper abstract or some kind of summary
that is not just a high-level teaser but
sort of a brief you know TL DR like too
long didn't read kind of summary you
know what's going to be what's the
talking to be about
what's going to be the introduction to
the talk kind of the progression and
then the payoff at the end and this
could be you know a couple of paragraphs
don't go super long shorter is usually
better and just try and like lay out
that story that you're sharing in the
talk and you know you could even like
ask yourself what's the question this
talk will actually answer what's you
know why is this critical information
for someone who's watching your talk why
why do they why should they care about
this why is this a problem because it
really helps you put you in this mindset
of where you want to produce this talk
for people who really care about this
stuff and we're actually interested in
this and then I always close a proposal
with a brief about Me section and this
is where you put in stuff that kind of
shows what you are about and what your
background is and you want to show
people you know it's you want to give
some indicators of why you're not gonna
embarrass the organizers if they decide
to bring you in right that's kind of the
angle I try and write this under so for
example people are worried about
bringing in super boring speakers so if
you have proof that you're you're gonna
be an engaging speaker who's not gonna
board the audience to death and you know
I started out as a boring speaker and I
feel like I you know I probably still am
but I've gotten better so there's ways
to grow that skill but basically what
you know I want not trying to like
discourage you but I want to encourage
you to share this information if you
have proof you know that that that would
point out that you can be a good good
thing it would be good thing to bring
you on a speaker for example if you have
a YouTube channel you know kind of like
I'm sitting here talking to the camera
someone could look at that be like okay
I would hire this guy to be a speaker
bring him on as a speaker it girls B
could also go the other way and someone
could go go you know what is this super
boring I don't care you could get
rejected for that but it really you know
it gives people a sneak preview of what
you're gonna be about where you're gonna
be like as a speaker if you have a blog
if you have a website absolutely point
people to your blog because they're
gonna learn what you're about and what
your skills are and
why you know why your what do you have
to say about this topic right like what
is your expertise in this in this topic
in this area so definitely put a link to
that put a link to Twitter and people if
you're using Twitter you know people can
see that you're engaging with people and
sharing stuff and can just get a feel
for you always put your contact
information and if you have previous
speaking previous speaking experience
always put that in there as well right
like you know I you might just give a
quick list off conferences you've spoken
out before or meetups you've spoken out
before and this is kind of what I would
put into a conference talk proposal now
and I'm gonna come to this and talk
about this in another video if this
sounds like too much work then there's
also an easier route where you're not
trying to get into you know a proper
like full-on tech conference like PyCon
but you're trying to speak maybe you'll
speak at a meet-up first write this is
how i got started like speaking out
meetups and giving presentations in
these in these other events just to kind
of build up my my credibility as a
speaker in my skill as a speaker so this
was kind of the rundown of how you
actually submit a talk and and what
would go into that proposal but stay
tuned for another video where I talk
about kind of ways you can get started
with this easier you know trying you go
for it absolutely submit talks and write
proposals and try to get in if you can
do that great yeah I think you have a
great chance of getting in actually if
you put like put in a proper proposal
there's a big chance you'll will
actually get in but if that sounds a
little bit too scary then check out this
other video that I'm probably also gonna
link at some point here now in the video
and check that out and I'll speak a
little bit about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
