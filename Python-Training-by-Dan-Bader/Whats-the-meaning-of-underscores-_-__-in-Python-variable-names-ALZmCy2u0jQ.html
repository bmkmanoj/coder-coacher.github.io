gonna answer a question that I got from
Rio so Rio had a question around the
meaning of underscore characters in
Python variable names so I've put
together this little example class or
you know just a bit of example code that
we can play with and here in the
constructor of this class I'm creating
three instance variables so I'm creating
the Foo variable here assigning it a
value I'm creating another variable
called underscore bar and then also I'm
creating a third variable called double
underscore or dunder bass because often
what we do when we talk about double
underscores in Python we just shorten
that to dunder so and so so in this case
this variable here will be called dunder
bass alright so what I'm gonna do now is
I'm gonna create an object based on this
class look at my little T object here
which is a test object so when it comes
to variable names the underscore and
python has a specific meaning so the
single underscore and a double
underscore they both have meanings in
Python and some of that is just by
convention so what kind of everyone
believes what an underscore should mean
and some of it is actually enforced by
the Python interpreter with the single
underscore most of it is by convention
so this is generally seen as a hint that
a name is to be treated as private by
the programmer so if this isn't really
anything that's enforced by Python right
Python doesn't have these strong
distinctions between private and public
variables like for example Java does but
it's more a hint to another programmer
that the variable or a variable that
starts with a single underscore carries
some internal state and is not really
meant as part of the public interface of
a class so it's best to leave it alone
now with the double underscore or dunder
prefix there is actually something that
the Python interpreter does there's some
name mangling it applies so it's going
to change the name of that variable in a
way that's going to make it harder to
create collision
when someone else extends this class and
I know this sounds completely abstract
so this is why I put this code example
together here because what we can do now
we can take a look at the attributes on
this object right so now we're looking
at the attributes in this object here
and what we can do now is we can look
for foo underscore bar and dunder bass
in this list and then we're gonna notice
some interesting changes so with the Foo
variable that just appears here one two
one right so self dot foo appears as foo
on the class then we've got self
underscore bar and that'll appear as
underscore bar so you know nothing
changed here is just a convention a hint
meant for the programmer to say that
this is a private variable or you know
one that you should careful should be
careful about changing now with the
dunder Baz attribute here things are a
little bit different because when you
search for it here netlist there is
actually no variable called dunder bass
but there's one that is called
underscore test which is the name of the
class dunder bass and this is the name
mangling that's going on so the Python
interpreter does this to protect
subclasses so for example if you were to
extend the test class with another class
that inherits from test it does that
name mangling to prevent naming
collisions because when you create
another class based on this test class
maybe you want to use the same name
right maybe you want to use a similar
variable name and then these two names
would collide and it would kind of
create a pretty horrible bug or the kind
of crappy situation there so that is why
Python applies this name mangling and of
course this name mangling doesn't just
apply to what you can see with the dur
function but it also applies to well
you're just accessing attributes on the
object right so I can access T dot foo
and T underscore a bar but if I go T and
dot dunder Bath's
the object doesn't actually have an
attribute called dunder bass and this is
exactly what happened there with the
name mangling right so I can get at that
attribute using the mangled name but
this is a really bad idea right like
don't do this so this is not a good idea
because every time the name of the class
changes the name of the attribute is
gonna change and then you're gonna have
a bad time really the only way to access
these quote-unquote
private attributes because they're not
really private as you can see right
there just mangled to avoid naming
collisions really the only reasonable
way to get at them is to access them
from the class itself because here in
the class you know every time you go
self dot dunder Baz
pythons can apply that mangling
automatically and you don't have to
worry about it it's more protection from
you know subclasses changing the
attribute or other code reaching into an
object and trying to change it but you
know as you can see it's a sort of a
weak protection it's not really enforced
in any way it's more you know through
that naming change makes a little bit
harder to actually accidentally break
things all right so this is kind of the
short and sweet explanation of what's
going on with these variable names in
the single underscore and double
underscore prefixes that you sometimes
see in Python code if you enjoyed this
tutorial and you'd like to see more just
like it then subscribe to my youtube
channel I put out at least one new
tutorial a week so just hit the
subscribe button and you're gonna learn
Python as we go along
cool so talk to you soon and happy
