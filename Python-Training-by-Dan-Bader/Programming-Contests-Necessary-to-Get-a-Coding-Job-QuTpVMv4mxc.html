needed to be a great developer so this
is a question I got on YouTube here from
Chinmoy I just want to read out the
question before I share some of my
thoughts so Chinmoy says is competitive
programming needed for being a great
developer like participating in contests
and solve online judges problems like
UVA you are ICF hacker Anka's cetera if
yes how it is how is it helpful and how
do I start learning it as a beginner and
using Python so really interesting
question to be honest personally I'm not
a huge fan of these kind of competitive
programming situations because I tried
like back at the University we put
together a team I joined a team and
we're going to some of these
competitions and I just didn't really
enjoy the experience number one I didn't
like the pressure I like to think things
through and sort of do that in an
environment that just feels safe and
where I don't feel under you know the
pressure having the clock like ticking
away number two like we didn't do all
that great and for that reason it was
like a it was not like a super
encouraging experience and I didn't
really sort of you know it wasn't a
motivating sense of defeat it was just
like oh yeah like we like just bombed on
these problems and there's all these
like super smart people around us we're
just plowing through this stuff I mean
obviously they were like a you know just
far ahead of us in terms of the practice
they put in and it was like our first or
second semester that we did that but it
was maybe like a good grounding in
reality of you know how you know I just
wasn't good at solving these kinds of
competitive like algorithmic and data
structures problems under that time
pressure now I still found a job and
actually found several jobs and never
felt like this was holding me back a lot
I did realize later on that I would need
to learn some of the skills that are
helpful in these kind of competitive
programming contests if I wanted to make
it through a coding interview you know
you have to be able to deal with the
pressure and for many jobs unfortunately
you have to be able to stand in front of
a white board and explain stuff and you
know maybe code up some stuff while
someone else is looking over your
shoulder there unfortunately a lot of
times you know there isn't a way around
that and you're gonna have to learn how
to deal with that pressure that doesn't
really mean that you know I enjoyed
those situations but it's just a reality
of getting a job as a programmer today
and especially getting your first like
entry-level entry-level job there so
well do I think competitive programming
experience is absolutely needed no
because I don't have competitive
programming experience in the sense that
this is something that I trained or you
know worked on like my my my strategy
was more to actually go and build stuff
and build up a portfolio of projects
that I could show around and then learn
enough interviewing skills to be able to
not just completely bomb an interview
and you know break to have a heart
attack and start sweating like crazy so
so that was my strategy and another
strategy might be to actually you know
just be awesome at these contests win
one of these contests and they're
probably gonna have a really easy time
to get an interview of it one of the big
the big four companies but what I want
to say here is that I don't think it is
absolutely necessary you know and in
fact like when you look at how many
people compete in these contests and it
is definitely a very very small subset
there now I do see a value in solving
these problems and working participating
in these competitions if you enjoy it do
it absolutely I think you're gonna learn
a lot about sort of you know thinking on
quickly on-the-spot solving these coding
challenges
on the spot there and it's something
that's probably gonna help you later in
an interview situation but if you don't
enjoy it I don't think you have you
should force yourself to do it you know
there's this is a such a wide field and
there you know just as in human beings
like there's different there's different
different kinds of developer
personalities out there as well like
actually in my experience I found that
most people that are later on work with
they were not the kind of person that
would do like great in in a programming
contest like it's it's just a skill like
a highly specialized skill where you can
solve these problems over and over again
or where you solve practice solving them
over and over again and you just get
good at recognizing these specific
contest problems and solving them
quickly now sure there's a lot of skills
a skill and like a lot of exercising and
training involved in that but you know
later on I realized it wasn't some it
was not some black magic where everyone
around me was you know an infinitely
better programmer it wishes that in this
specific context of solving these issues
there were some people who are very very
highly skilled at that and you know if
you if you work with them maybe they're
actually terrible to work with maybe
they're complete assholes and then
they're gonna have a hard time a harder
time finding a job even though they
might be like the greatest people at
solving these contests compared to
someone else who is enjoyable to work
with who is working on their skills and
who's maybe not going to these contests
you know so it's all relative but to
kind of you know reel this all in and
and just find closure here I don't think
you need to be great at these kinds of
programming contests to get a job as a
Python developer as a software developer
in general is it gonna hurt
probably not in most cases is absolutely
necessary know if you don't enjoy it
don't do it that's that's what I would
recommend to you so if you enjoyed this
