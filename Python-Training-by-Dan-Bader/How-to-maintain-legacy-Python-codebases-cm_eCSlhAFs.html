code basis great question by a reader in
this video I'm gonna give some thoughts
around the topic so let's define what a
legacy Python code base is so generally
when people refer to legacy code they
mean code that has aged a little bit you
know we're talking about an older code
base maybe this is some code written in
python 2.5 2.6 Python 2 in general or
maybe it's you know it's even older it's
a system that's kind of hobbling along
on Python 1 and it's never been upgraded
to the latest version of the language
and so now you've been assigned the task
to maintain a code base like that in
general I think you have two choices
there either keep it on life support
keep it running as is don't upgrade to a
newer version of Python or option 2
you're gonna upgraded to a newer version
of Python your going to take the code
you're gonna make some refactoring and
you're gonna make it work you're gonna
take the existing code base and gonna
make it work on a more recent version of
Python or on the latest version of
Python even so these are kind of the two
options that you have really right and
there are a couple of strategies you can
you can apply to to each of them so if
you want to maintain the existing code
base which in a lot of cases will make
the most sense or will make a lot of
sense like generally it is very hard to
rewrite an existing code base without
introducing bugs and so upgrading a
Python one code base to Python 3 if it's
a lot of code that could be a very very
stressful a very very tough project not
saying it doesn't make sense but it is
often very hard to make a real good
business case for doing that you know if
you're asking me like what would I do as
a sort of idealistic developer totally I
would upgrade it and rewrite it in
Python 3 and make it super nice and you
know add linters and everything but
sometimes that is not the smartest
business decision you know
if this thing generates value maybe you
don't want to touch it when you want to
focus on something else or your employer
wants you to focus on something else
so you know if you have to maintain a
legacy code base then that's that's just
a reality of it and you can do some
things to make your life a little bit
easier if you're maintaining a legacy
Python code base so maybe you can
package the whole thing up into virtual
machines or at least you don't have to
worry about future OS updates breaking
your application you know maybe maybe
you can do things like that that
basically seal this thing off and kind
of preserve it and keep it hobbling
along and hopefully you don't have to
make too many changes to it now if
you're going the other route and you
want to take an existing code base and
upgrade it to the latest version of
Python then that's an entirely different
game right then you're likely rewriting
at least parts of the application to
make it work with newer versions of
Python you don't always have to go all
the way and let's say upgrade from from
python 2.2 to python 3.7 or 3.6 whatever
the latest version is at the time
sometimes it can just make sense to go
to the latest version of python 2 for
example you know it's a lot more work to
go from python 2.2 to python 3 compared
to going from python 2.2 to python 2.7
and python 2 is going to be around for a
long time so if you're on 2.7 then you
know that gives you some more mileage
out of the existing code base without
having to make more drastic changes and
really those I think are the two main
options that you have for maintaining a
legacy Python code base either keep it
around make it bearable or upgraded to
the latest version or a newer version of
Python all right I hope this was helpful
if you've got any tips to share and how
to work with legacy Python code bases
then please leave a comment below if
you've got a request for a video that
you'll like me to make on Python or Safa
development in future and please also
leave a comment and I'll try and cover
that in a future video all right thanks
so much for listening and happy Python
