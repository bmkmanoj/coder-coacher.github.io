platforms really interesting question
that I got from a reader in this video I
want to share some my thoughts on this
topic so let's jump right in
I want to show you some projects that I
think are relevant to this question so
number one is a framework called key B
and it is a cross-platform open-source
Python library for developing
applications that also work on mobile
devices that work on all kinds of
operating systems and it's a very cool
project so the purpose of kevie is to
enable you to build graphical user
interfaces that work on many different
platforms using Python here on the
website you can see some examples of
people have built in terms of graphical
user interfaces or little games and in
graphical applications using kiwi and
Python so keavy gives you some standard
controls and some graphical primitives
or UI primitives that will look the same
on any platform and you can use it to
build applications that work on mobile
phones desktop computers and so on
that's kind of the big advantage of
using TV the biggest downside in my
opinion is that these application will
not look very native so there are some
built-in UI elements that you can use
but they they look the same they look
the same across all platforms which
we're just kind of a pro and a con at
the same time
so with kevie you're getting different
UI elements like buttons and text fields
that look the same across many different
platforms because they're all
implemented custom or implemented
specifically for k.v and that means your
application is going to look the same on
a mobile phone and on a desktop computer
in terms of the way to look the UI looks
now this could be a good thing or a bad
thing kind of the biggest downside here
is that your application won't really
look like the native like a native
application would on the operating
system and you can see that used here
too to great effect or to really
positive effect in an application like
eco where it's like an external
multi-touch control
for for making music and here the custom
UI works really well you know you don't
really expect us to look like the
standard buttons on your desktop
computer but for some other applications
it might be kind of the opposite of what
you want to do so
Kibby can be great choice but it has
some upsides and downsides associated
with it it's gonna be interesting to see
how this develops in the future and you
know what new features are going to be
introduced here but it's certainly gonna
play a big role in the future of Python
or in pythons future in the mobile
development space now another project
that I'm really excited about is the be
ware project and this is kind of a
collection of different frameworks tools
and libraries that you can use to
implement native UIs across multiple
platforms so on the website there's
there's a good primer here where they
tell you about what you can do with
beware and took me a while to find this
actually but really this is an
abstraction layer you can use to write
native iOS apps native Android apps and
native desktop apps using Python and
it's kind of cool so what what the be
where are parts of the beware project
allow you to do is to write applications
that look exactly like they should on a
specific platform so an iOS application
reading with written with PI B or this
beware project it's gonna use the native
controls and it's going to look like a
first-class application on that platform
it's gonna be the same with an Android
application or a Windows application or
a Mac OS application those applications
build with the be ware project they're
all gonna have this native look and feel
and I'm really excited about that
because I really believe that whatever
application you build it should take
into account how the underlying platform
works the platform where you want this
to run on it should feel native to that
platform so the PI B project I think is
very very exciting it's kind of still in
the early stages but it is a very very
cool project and I'm
excited about the future developments
here it's open source you can contribute
to it it's the same with TV so if you're
interested in mobile development with
Python and you want to make the future
better there now is the time to join
join these projects and to jump in and
to do something great for the Python
world so in summary I think the future
for Python in the mobile space is
looking bright or let's say because
right now it's in my opinion it's not
very bright I mean if if I were to write
a mobile application today my first
choice would not be to do it in Python
to be honest but this can change in the
future and I think especially with the
adoption that we're seeing with Python
at the moment there's gonna be a pretty
good reason to to go and see if we can
enable people to write really
great-looking native looking
applications using Python and project
projects like kV and PI B or the beware
project here they're doing a great deal
to make that future happen all right if
you have a Python question that you
would like me to tackle in a future
