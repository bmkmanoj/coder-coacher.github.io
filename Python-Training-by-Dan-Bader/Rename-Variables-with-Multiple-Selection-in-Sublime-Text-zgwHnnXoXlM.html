productivity tip for all of you Python
developers out there so I've got a
Python file opened here in my sublime
text editor and what I want to do is I
want to do a little refracting where I
rename a variable in this function here
it's called run all and then the
variable that I want to rename is the
delay seconds keyword argument because
you know for some reason I feel like
it's not it's not a fitting name and
let's say we want to change that name
inside that function and we want to kind
of do it in the quickest way possible so
the way I would approach that is I would
double-click the first occurrence in
this case here in the the function
definition and you can already see that
sublime text highlighted the other
occurrences off the lay seconds here in
the texts or within that function so
what I can do now is I can use the
multiple edits command or multiple
selection command to actually change all
of these occurrences of the Leie seconds
at the same time and the way I'm going
to do this is by hitting command D a
couple of times and you'll know how many
times to hit command D because you
already got that little little outline
here so in this case you know I hit
command D two times
selected all of these occurrences and
I'm just gonna go delay and click
somewhere and I'm done I renamed all of
these occurrences in one go and that was
really easy to do and I can also undo
all of them in one go
cool so I hope the safety is in time and
maybe a little bit quicker in your day
to day work stay tuned for more stuff
like that feel free to subscribe and
I'll talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
