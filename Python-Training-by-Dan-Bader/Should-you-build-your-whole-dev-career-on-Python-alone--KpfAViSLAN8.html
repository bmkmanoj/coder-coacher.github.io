Python basket so that's a question I got
from a debater org newsletter reader and
I wanted to cover it in this video so
well what does this question really mean
right like the way I interpret it is
that if you're a Python developer should
you just stick 100% to Python you know
should you build your whole career 100%
on Python moving forward should you put
all of your eggs in one basket and that
is Python and I don't think you should
you know spoiler alert I don't think you
should know programmer should do that
you know in fact most people don't want
to be an XYZ programmer but you want to
be a programmer period right you want to
be sort of a multi-faceted person and
even if Python is your favorite
programming language and it's how you
make your money and it's what you do at
the moment well in 20 years hopefully
you'll still be able to work with Python
you know there's people working on COBOL
software these days still and they're
making a ton of money because it's
there's fewer people around who know the
language but in general it's a very
fluid field and it's moving fast and I
don't think you ever want to put all
your eggs in one basket in the long term
now if you're just starting out then I
would kind of do the opposite right
because you're not gonna have you're
gonna be spreading yourself too thin if
you're trying to be you know if you're
trying to be sort of a
jack-of-all-trades and learn five
different languages at the same time now
that's not a good idea but in the long
term you want to have the fluidity and
the ability to learn a new language
right so by all means if you're if
you're starting out if you're the
beginning of your career then absolutely
you know focus on Python get really
great at Python and kind of make a name
for yourself as a Python developer but
the day will come where you will have to
pick up another language just as part of
your job and it'll most likely actually
be a really cool experience for you
because you get paid to learn new stuff
and that's one of the things that I
always enjoyed the most about
programming
working for software development
companies because essentially a lot of
times I was getting paid to learn new
stuff and ensure people were expecting
results right but I thrive on that kind
of pressure and it's it's great to kind
of be thrown into the deep end and
having to learn a new language or at
least you know that's the kind of
mindset I think you want to have when it
comes to this stuff because otherwise it
can get very very frustrating because
you're always served on the move and
like the Industries is moving and it is
moving but it's also not moving so so so
fast that you have to do this constantly
right it's just more about the awareness
that in the long term
just like with any investment really
right like would you put all of your
money into a single investment like if
you're investing in stocks would you put
all of your money into a single stock
well it could go absolutely amazingly
great but it could also completely
tanked and and could bankrupt you right
so at some point you want to diversify
and you want to make sure that you're
sort of a well-rounded developer and
that you have the skills to adapt to the
situation at hand all right if you'd
like to get your own question answered
then just leave a comment below and I'll
try and tackle it in one of my next
videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
