developer without any experience so this
is another question I got from a reader
it's a fairly popular question I've
heard this one before and so I want to
cover it in this video and give some of
my thoughts on it so in general if you
have almost no experience or you know
like this person if you don't have any
practical experience at all you're gonna
have a really hard time getting a job
even as a junior developer I feel like
the bar for hiring a junior developer is
that they should be able to at least you
know do basic programming tasks and
they're kind of a developer that can
already solve problems on their own but
you want to check in with them and still
give them support so you can really get
a job as a junior developer if if you
don't have any programming skills that
you can bring to the table you're gonna
have an extremely hard time passing any
kind of coding interview and convincing
somebody to pay you money to to
basically learn everything on the job so
if you're trying to break into the
software development world and you want
to do it with Python and you're hoping
to get a job as a junior developer
you're gonna actually have to bring you
know a considerable amount of skills to
the table there is a reason that
software development pace very well
these days and the reason is that it's
hard to find people who can do it and
these are not easy skills that you can
just pick up in a month or two right
this is gonna take some dedication to
get there but if you put in the time I'm
convinced that you can do it I mean
actually the fact that you're watching
this video right now and you're seeking
out this information that actually goes
beyond what most people are going to do
right so if you can kind of keep that
momentum and and grow your skillset and
grow your ability and also grow your
your network then I think you're gonna
have a
chance of getting a job as a Python
developer but it's really not realistic
to say you know without any experience
whatsoever trying to get a job as a
junior developer that's gonna be very
very hard now there's also a different
way to interpret this question and I
guess that's to say well if you have
some programming skill and maybe you've
taken a couple of courses and you have
the basics of programming under your
belt but you don't have any real-world
experience and again my answer is is the
same essentially it's going to be very
very tough to get hired if you don't
have any real-world experience to show
for now the good news is you don't have
to have any kind of paid projects under
your belt that can serve as at least
some proof that that someone should be
willing to invest in you and bring you
on and grow you as as a team member
you can totally demonstrate your
real-world knowledge by for example
building of a portfolio of Python
projects that you worked on making open
source contributions maybe starting a
blog and talking about what you've
learned in in your journey of learning
Python
so these are all ways you can use in
strategies you can use to build up some
of that experience at least a minimum
amount of real world experience so that
you're gonna have an easier time for
getting into a junior developer position
with your Python skills but you know I
want to be very clear like in general
you're gonna have to work for this and
you're gonna have to bring some value to
the table I think most people that are
hiring junior developers they're
expecting them to actually deliver some
value and add some value to the team
this is not usually not a you're getting
trained on the job kind of position so
you want to have something to offer and
you want to just come across as a nice
person and ask someone that other people
want to work with this is also gonna
play a huge role so you know work on
getting something to show for building
up some kind of portfolio so that you
can go out there and say you know I
might not have any real paid
work experience with this but this is
what I've learned this is what I've
produced and I'm passionate about this
stuff and I really want to learn and I
think I'm going to be able to add a net
value to your team all right if you have
more Python questions and more Python
career questions please fire away just
add a comment below to this video and
I'll try and cover it in one of my
future and videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
