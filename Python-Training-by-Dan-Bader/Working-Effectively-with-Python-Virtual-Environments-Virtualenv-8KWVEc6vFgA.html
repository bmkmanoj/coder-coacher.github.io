can use to make your life easier when
you're working with these virtual
environments so I want to show you a
quick walkthrough through the virtual
end setup or the virtual and workflow
that I use personally for working on
Python projects so I'm in a fresh
terminal session here and let's pretend
I wanted to work on a project called
test project it's the one we created
earlier so the first thing I would do is
to switch into the project folder and
then I have this alias command here in
my shell that I called AE for activate
and I can use that to super quickly
activate a virtual environment without
having to type out this source command
so I'm going to run this and what this
does is it's automatically activating
the virtual environment because I use
this naming convention where I just call
all of my virtual environments vnf so
the command is just going to look for a
VN virtual environment and it's going to
activate it next I would do my actual
work on the project run my tests work
with the Python interpreter run the
actual project and then when I'm done
with the project I would just type de
for deactivate and that deactivates the
virtual environment I'm going to show
you how these aliases work in a minute
there's one more thing I wanted to show
you first though and that is how they
allow me to quickly switch between
different virtual environments so I'm
going to activate the virtual
environment for test project again and
now let's imagine I wanted to switch and
work on a different project with its own
virtual environment so I'm here now in
the different project folder and now I
would need to switch to its new virtual
environment in this project's virtual
environment uses the same naming
convention so now I can just go a
again and what that's going to do is
it's going to deactivate the previous
virtual environment and then activate
the new one so I don't have to type
deactivate first and then of course I
could do my work and just deactivate the
virtual environment again so I'm using
these AE and de shortcuts or aliases to
make it a little bit easier to work with
virtual environments from the command
line and now I'm going to show you how
those work behind the scenes so what
I've done here is I've modified the
config file for my shell I'm using bash
so this would be bash profile and I've
added these two lines here that
configure an AE and a de alias here's
what the AE alias does it tries to
deactivate any virtual environments that
I'm already in and then it sources the
activate script in the local VN folder
so if I'm using the same naming
convention for my virtual environments
this will just work every single time
I'm working on a project and the de
alias just points to deactivate which is
going to save me some typing in the long
run so the usage for this is really easy
I just switch to a project folder I
punch in a e hit return then I can work
on the project when I'm done I just type
D and I leave the virtual environment
and this makes working with virtual
environments just a little bit smoother
so this is something you could try out
and see if you want to incorporate that
into your own workflow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
