mine that I want to tell you about so I
actually wrote a book about setting up
sublime text for Python developers and
actually it's three books because I did
it for Windows Mac and Linux and it is
some sort of an end to end very very
detailed guide of how to set up an
amazing and very productive sublime text
and Python development environment from
scratch and this is a topic that's been
really really dear to my heart so I've
been a huge sublime text fan for you
know three and a half years or even a
little bit more than that and I've been
doing these YouTube screencasts and
videos where I showed my setup and kind
of showed how to configure parts of it
and I got so many questions and email
space on those videos and those blog
posts that I wrote that I decided to you
know go and write the ultimate guide for
setting up sublime text for Python
developers and I just released it so
it's finally here you can get it right
now and yeah I just want to give you a
quick overview of what's actually
included in this package so like I said
it's three books one for Mac one for
Windows one for Linux and they go over
setting up a great and productive Python
development set up from start to finish
you can either you know work through the
whole book in sequence it's actually
gonna take you from a blank operating
system install to a really great set up
that is based on the setup that I use
personally or it is actually the person
that the setup that I use personally and
you can get these three editions off the
book so you can get the Mac version the
Windows version and I actually went
through all these setup steps three
times on these systems from scratch to
make sure that you have a series of
install instructions that are going to
work because I played through them
numerous times through virtual machines
and I did that on Windows Mac and Linux
and you can be sure that this guide is
actually gonna take you to a you know
working and very very productive Python
development setup
so you can get these three books they
actually come with the sublime settings
packaged up for all the the plugins that
you're gonna be using and this is going
to show you things like how to get a
working autocomplete for sublime text
and Python how to integrate get with
your sublime text setup how to integrate
Python linters with your sublime text
setup and how to actually install custom
fonts and make it you know really really
nice and how you can actually set this
up so that you can work with it from you
can work with sublime text from the
command line as well so it's sort of an
all-inclusive guide book that shows you
exactly what you need to do to get a
very very productive sublime text and
Python setup and like I said the book is
out there now you can get it from my
page there's a little bit more
background story on you know why the
book exists what what's included with
the book and feel free to check it out I
think it's a super helpful resource
based on the testimonials and some early
reviews that I got for the book I think
there's a lot of value in it and I'd be
really curious to hear what do you think
about this book so if you're interested
check out the description below you can
get the book at sublime text Python com
just gonna redirect you to my landing
page for the guide book or for the guide
books there's different packages you can
get and yeah check it out if you're
interested I think it's gonna be really
really helpful get the book and let me
