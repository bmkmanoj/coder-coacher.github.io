going to learn how to check whether a
file or directory exists in python using
only built-in functions and functions
from the Python standard library so
checking whether or not a file exists is
very important for many kinds of Python
programs that you might want to write so
maybe you want to check and make sure
that the data file is available before
you actually load it or maybe you want
to make sure you're not overriding an
existing file and the same could be true
for directories so in python there's
several ways to verify whether our file
or directory exists and in this tutorial
i'm going to cover three different
methods alright so I'm in my terminal
here and you can see that the directory
that I'm in at the moment this one that
I created here file exists it's
completely empty there's no files in
there so what I'm going to do now is I'm
going to create a simple file I'm just
going to go and I'm going to create a
file called test dot txt and we can
check that so now there's a test dot txt
file and I'm also going to create an
empty directory for us to test so I'm
just going to call that test dot there
and now you can see we have a file in
here test txt and a folder or directory
called test - there it really this is
all we need to go through these three
different approaches for testing
whatever file or directory exists and so
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to
launch into my Python interpreter so I'm
running this on Python 3 most of this
will actually work on Python 2 and I'll
you know mention it in the tutorial and
if there's something you may want to
change in order to get it to work so the
first approach that we're going to take
is the OS path module so this is a
module that's built into the Python
standard library I'm going to import it
it's the OS dot have module and Oh star
path includes some interesting functions
that we can use to check whether file or
directory exists so the first function
here is the exists function
and you can see here I'm using this this
Python interpreter called B Python I
have a video on that as well if you're
interested that shows me some
auto-completion information and so I can
see here that we can use this function
to test whether a file exists or not so
let's just write out so I'm going to go
in here and say this file doesn't exist
you know just give it a name where I'm
sure that there's no file under that
name in the current directory so when I
run this OS path exist tells me hey the
file doesn't actually exist now let's do
the same thing with a file that actually
exists so I've got this file test dot
txt that I created previously and now
when I call oh is path exists I'm going
to get true as an answer and the same
thing is also going to work for
directories so I can go in here so I can
go in here and say OS path dot exists
test there and then it's going to tell
me hey this directory actually exists
right so this works for both files and
directories now in some cases you may
want to make a distinction between a
directory and a file so in order to do
that there is also the OS path dot ace
file function and that's going to tell
you whether something exists and it's
also a file so I can go in here and give
it something give it a path that doesn't
exist and tells me false then I can go
in here and say
Paytas test.txt exists and is it a file
yes it is and then you can also ask it
the same question about the test
directory data created in this case well
it exists as you've seen before but it's
not a file so this is why the if file
function is going to return false and so
this is a pretty good approach is the
first option for checking whether a file
or directory exists in Python however it
doesn't actually verify whether you can
access the file so I only ensures that
the file exists at that very moment in
time but it doesn't actually make sure
that your program or the user the
program runs under has access to the
file it could actually open it so we're
going to tackle that problem next so now
we're going to talk about what you can
do to actually make sure a file is
accessible to your program as well for
that technique to work what we're going
to do is well we're just going to try
and open the file so if I try and open a
file that does not exist you can see
here that I'm getting a file not found
error and so we're getting some feedback
through through that exception mechanism
so what we can do is we can use this
feedback from the exception to check
whether a file exists and whether we can
actually open it whether our program has
the necessary permissions to actually
open the file and so the way you do that
is with a try except block so what I'm
going to do here is I'm going to start a
try block and then I'm going to say all
right so open the file doesn't exist txt
this is not going to exist and then
actually if you succeeded we'll just
close it again
and if we failed on a file not found
error
and then we can just say the file does
not exist so let's run this okay so this
printed the file does not exist and you
can see exactly why because trying to
open the file it race they found that
found error and then we caught that
error it actually turned it into a
message that we printed out to the
console now the only thing this does
until now is it checks whether a file
exists and if the file exists but we're
not allowed to open it this is still
going to race an exception so this is
going to erase an i/o error exception
the good thing about this is that we can
actually leverage this exception or use
this exception to determine whether a
file is also accessible to us so let's
talk a little bit more about this whole
idea of checking whether our file is
actually accessible so what I'm going to
do here is I'm going to leave my
interpreter so you can see here we have
this not allowed to txt file and it
belongs to my user so what I'm going to
do now is I'm going to take away my
access rights so I'm going to say I'm
going to take away the right to read
this file for everyone and so you can
see here so that change the permission
flags here and now when I try to access
this file I'm going to get a permission
denied error so now we can take a look
what that looks like that particular
error how that gets represented in
Python so I can go in here now
and I can say okay open this not allowed
file and we're getting a permission err
so that's different to the
file not found error that we got
previously now all of these errors their
subclasses off the IO error class so we
can take advantage of that and actually
make sure that a file is available and
also accessible again using a try except
block so I can go in here and I can say
okay well you open the file open
actually try it with this not a loud
file if you open it or close it right
away and for that particular part you
could also use the with statement which
would automatically close the file I'm
not going to cover that in this tutorial
but I've got another tutorial that goes
into that and shows you how to do that
because some people consider that more
pythonic but it's really a little bit
out of the scope of this tutorial so I'm
going to do here is we can actually
catch this other error so I could say
okay file let's actually go io error so
IO error is the parent class for
permission error and also the file not
found error so that way I can handle
them all in one I can just say file not
found or not accessible all right I can
just mash these two error types together
and in this case we get an answer that
actually matches the reality of the
situation so as you can see this is not
a loud file it actually exists but we
can't open it so if I go ahead and ask
always path exists whether the file
exists is going to say yes but we still
can't access it so there's a difference
between being able to access a file the
just the fact of whether that file or
directory exists there's also the OS dot
access function that does something very
similar to what I've shown you here in
this code snippet so you might want to
look that up as well because that could
also be helpful if you don't want to
write this code and of course it could
always extract this snippet here into a
separate function and then have a
reusable function that you can use for
these accessible checks
or you're just going to use OS dot
access all right then there's one more
option for you to check whether a file
or directory exists in python and that
works using the path Lib module so this
is a relatively new module that was
added to the Python standard library in
Python 3.4 and so it's only available in
Python 3 however it is a way you can
install it as a third party module that
makes it available in Python 2 as well
but probably a good idea to to use it on
Python 3 and up and this is a cleaned up
version of many of the things that you
find in the OS path module so what it
does at its core is it provides an
object-oriented interface to these to
dealing with paths and files on the file
system which is kind of neat so here I
can go and create a new path object and
then I have this path object and I can
query it so I can say hey this path
actually do this yes it does
file yes it is and of course I can also
do that with another path so I could say
I could say it doesn't exist txt
and probably one
that to something path to and so now I
can go path to dot exists in this case
is going to tell me hey this other file
that you want to this other path your
path you are asking you about it doesn't
actually exist so this is an
object-oriented way to work with the
functionality that's available in the OS
path module also so the path Lib module
provides a cleaner and object-oriented
interface for working with the file
system which can be nice so previously
we're just you know dealing only with
strings that would represent these paths
but now with path lip
we actually have objects that represent
a path and we can query these objects so
this could be a way to abstract away
some of that functionality in your own
programs and to make sure that you know
100% a certain object is actually a path
and it's not just a string this might
sound like a very small and minor
benefit but in a more complex program
this could be actually really helpful
also for long term maintainability so
let's do a quick recap here so we've
covered three options for finding out
whether a file exists in Python or
whether a directory exists in Python and
then also we specialized that a little
bit more and looked into whether a file
is actually accessible to your program
so the first option we looked into was
using the OS path dot exists function
and that was purely for existence checks
and the second option we looked into was
using the open function and a try accept
statement with IO error and file not
found error and we were able to use that
to check for the existence of a file and
to also check for accessibility can our
program actually access the file so this
is another thing that we've tried and
then the third approach was to use path
lead path and then calling the exists
function on that
just seen these three different
approaches for checking whether or not a
file exists in Python and before you
leave I want to give you a quick caveat
for these file existence checks so when
you're running a file existence check
with OS path dot exists for example
you're getting an answer for that
particular instant where this exists
function ran so if at that particular
moment of file exists then of course
python is going to tell you hey this
file exists right now now this doesn't
guarantee that the file still exists at
a later point in time because someone
else could just go in while the program
is running and maybe they're deleting
that exact file have this exact instant
it's might be fairly unlikely but if you
run your program often enough maybe
hundreds or millions of times eventually
something like that is going to happen
right and this is called a race
condition we're trying to open a file
and in the meantime it might have been
deleted or you know there's some other
actor that's trying to remove the file
and the race condition is who gets there
first are we going to be able to open
the file before that other thing or
other program can delete the file or are
they going to be able to delete at first
and we can't open it so this is called a
race condition now the problem with
these exists checks is that usually they
only give you an answer for that
particular instant does the file exist
right now
so actually a better approach usually if
you want to do something with a file is
to just straight-up open the file so
instead of check checking whether the
file exists before you open it just try
and open it right away and then keep it
open work with it and then close the
file so that is usually the safer
approach because it can help you avoid
many of these race conditions and I've
got a longer tutorial a written tutorial
about this topic that I'm linking in the
description so if you're interested you
can learn more about this type of race
condition and how you can avoid it I
just wanted to put a heads up at the end
of this tutorial so that you know about
some of the disadvantages of this
technique or just something that you
need to look out for
now you might be wondering what's
actually the best way to check whether a
file exists or not in Python and I would
say on Python 3 or 3 4 and above I would
probably use the path Lib path exists
function because I think the path Lib
module is a really great library for
working with the file system so I
probably use that on Python too I would
lean towards using OS path exists and I
would do either one of these options or
use either one of these options unless
you're actually trying to avoid this
race condition so if it's purely for an
existence check then it's okay to use
option 1 or option 2 but if you actually
want to try and work with the file and
not just check whether it exists then I
would actually recommend that you use a
modified version of the second option
here where you just open the file and
you work with it until you're done and
then you close it and you just look out
for a file not found error and a
permissions error all right it's a bit
of a longer tutorial on how to check
whether a file or directory exists in
python but you know sometimes the Devils
in the details so I hope this gave you
some insights and helped you solve your
problem all right so if you enjoyed this
