quote yesterday no actually a couple of
days ago and I got some really
interesting responses and 140 characters
is just too short to reply to this so I
decided to do a quick video reply also
I'm trying out this new this new
screencasting tool so yeah so the quote
was the object oriented version of
spaghetti code is of course lasagna code
because you're ending up with too many
layers and layers of abstraction that is
and so yeah I got some really cool
responses here from from avi or I hope I
pronounce your name correctly avi he was
saying or if you're in the
micro-services world ravioli code
everything in its own pocket it's just
hilarious that that's a great quote I'm
gonna make that another quote on that
I'm gonna post and then assign you as as
the author mentions the author
as the author we're gonna see what
happens um yeah now I want spaghetti I
hope you're proud of yourself
yes Germain that I had spaghetti the
last two days and I wonder if it has
anything to do with that tweet so
definitely had the same effect on me all
right and so Tobias Reitz how to avoid
this is something wrong with the single
responsibility principle and I think
that's a pretty good question right
because well the way I would interpret
this is that the too much of a good
thing is a bad thing or you know it all
depends on the the dose and I think it's
with it is like that with any of these
tools right like a tool or a principle
like the single responsibility principle
it can be a really good thing for
structuring your code and writing better
or more maintainable more readable code
but you can also take it to an extreme
and then you end up with something
horrible right and whether that's called
like lasagna code or or whatever you
know a giant like ball of twine code
um you could totally take the single
responsibility principle to an extreme I
think where you basically you know you
end up in this your programs gonna look
like all of these joke examples for
overly complicated Java programs right
where you have like abstract factory
factories and all of these crazy design
patterns apply it in a way that just
takes them you know into absurd
territory and just absolutely makes them
makes the resulting code ridiculous and
so I think like my interpretation here
is that the quote is exactly about that
I mean first of all like I think it's a
bit of a joke but it goes to show that
you know too much of a good thing is a
bad thing so if we if we go and just
take you know object orientation or the
single responsible responsibility
principle as like the only hammer we
have and we try to apply it like to any
nail we can find then I think we're
gonna end up with something horrible
like lasagna code and the way to avoid
this is I think to know about many of
these tools and to build up this kind of
experience or feeling for when to apply
a certain tool right in what situation
you want to apply one one of your many
tools in your toolbox so I think that
will be a that would be my strategy to
avoid over applying one of these
principles or one of these these
methodologies and you know it's the same
with everything it's the same with like
agile you know it we probably all heard
or worked at places where that was just
taking that was being taken too you know
too far you can be too agile and you can
kind of you know you can spend all you
know hours every week in retros in all
of these like meta things that don't
actually help get the work help get the
work done and so it's the same thing
with these these design patterns and
stuff so okay so a bit of a rambling
answer there but I hope this helps you
out and I'm just gonna post that to
Twitter now see
what happens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
