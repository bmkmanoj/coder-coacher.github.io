productivity tip for all of my developer
friends out there so I guess all many of
you know hacker news at Newstart Y
Combinator comm it's a great news site
and it is also it is also a crazy busy
news site right there's so much stuff
that gets posted there and it's pretty
much impossible to keep up with it and
so what I found myself doing is just
wasting a lot of time trying to catch up
with hacker news and reading articles
there um however I've actually gotten
this under control now where I feel like
I still get the most important news off
hacker news and I get all the most
important articles that I care about
without sort of constantly following
what's going on in hacker news and
spending a lot of time there and I've
solved this problem in two ways so
number one is to only read a digest so
instead of going to the hacker news
front page directly and just kind of
hanging out there and trying to find
something worthwhile to read what I did
instead was I signed up for a newsletter
and there's a pretty good one that is
called hacker newsletter at hacker
newsletter comm and what they do is they
aggregate the articles dad have been
popular for a whole week and then I sent
them to you via email and you can
unsubscribe anytime and you know I'm not
affiliated with them or anything but
it's a really great newsletter and I've
been pretty happy with their choice of
articles so that pretty much guarantees
that just by investing you know maybe
half an hour per week
you're gonna be aware of all the
interesting stuff that comes out and you
can be confident that you're not missing
anything super important right you don't
want to miss that latest awesome
javascript framework the second
technique to avoid spending tons of time
on hacker news that I started using is
instead of sort of mindlessly browsing
hñ I would start
searching for specific content so the
the tricky part here is that I felt like
using Google or the other big search
engines wasn't really effective for
searching hacker news so luckily I found
this other search engine and that's
available at H n dot L go Lea dot-com
and I hope I'm pronouncing that
correctly it doesn't really matter
anyway and so the really cool thing here
is that they index comments also so we
can go and say all right so I want to
find some stories sorted by popularity
that have happened over the past year
and let's just punch in Python and
update really quickly and it is sorted
by by points by votes and so this is
pretty awesome just to get a good grasp
of what's been popular or what happened
what happened popular articles for a
certain keyword so for example this
article seems pretty interesting right
new Python modules of 2015 obviously
there's been something going on with
with pi pi rusts always super popular
here and I found that just punching in
some keywords here and in searching for
the time frame that you want is really
helpful in in just getting the content
that you want without wasting a lot of
time browsing HN mindlessly and yeah
this totally worked for me and I rarely
ever go to new start Y Combinator comm
anymore I just read the digests or
search for specific stuff whenever I
feel like I should probably do some
research on a topic and yeah I would
encourage you to try that out I've
actually written a blog post about this
that I'm gonna link in the the comment
section here or like in the notes
section here and try it out let me know
how it goes
and potentially this could really save
you a lot of time in the future
okay take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
