review of the 2017 macbook pro 13 inch
in the base configuration so without
touch bar and i work as a software
developer i also create training
products for other software developers
and so this review will be from my
perspective you know what's it like to
do actual software development work on
this machine can you do it what's the
situation like with the screen real
estate
what's the battery life like you know is
this nice to carry around how do you
charge it all that does it have enough
port i'm going to be chatting about all
of that also go over the keyboard
quality and you know what's the trackpad
light and all of these things so
hopefully this will be a pretty good
review for you if you're also developer
and you're thinking about getting this
machine for yourself as a developer or
for someone else who's maybe training to
become a software developer and
wondering if this would make a good
machine
alright so let's jump right in let's
take a look at the 2017 macbook pro 13
inch
in the first part of the video I just
want to take a look at the exterior of
the machine give you some feedback on
how I like working with this thing and
in the second part I will actually
switch to screen recording and just talk
a little bit about the screen resolution
and how it works for me from a developer
perspective all right so let's jump
right in
I really love this thing you know first
I want to say that first like this is a
great little machine I upgraded from a
2011 15-inch MacBook Pro and compared to
this 13-inch 2017 MacBook Pro my
previous machine was just an absolute
hulking monster like this thing is it's
just so thin it's absolutely insane I
really like the way this machine looks
and the way it feels and just the build
quality is absolutely freakin amazing
like you know this is going to make me
sound like a complete Apple fanboy but
for me the extra cost of this laptop
actually absolutely made sense like I
think you could probably get the same or
similar performance for a cheaper price
but you know I got so much mileage out
of my 2011 MacBook Pro and it's been
just absolutely worth it for me so this
is yeah man just I just really love this
machine and I'm going to talk a little
bit more about screen real estate
because I think that is probably
something that's that's really
interesting for you guys if you're
thinking about doing a bunch of
development work on this thing so right
now for example I'm working on a
self-published book for Python
developers and the way I've got my
screen setup here just works out
perfectly for me in terms of readability
and the size and I've done development
work on this as well so I primarily work
with Python and do a bunch of web
development and this is working really
well all right the other thing that I
really like about this machine is the
keyboard so I know a lot of people have
doubts about I guess the the quality and
the the click enos of this keyboard or
kind of you know how deep you can press
the these individual keys but actually I
really love it like especially compared
to the older macbook pro keyboards I
think there's actually an improvement
so for me it worked out really well I
didn't get the touch bar version because
I don't think it's worth it
I think the touch part is pretty useless
I don't really see how it would add to
my experience I really wanted to have a
proper escape key so the version that I
bought is actually the lowest tier
MacBook Pro 2017 and you can tell
because it only has these two USB C
plugs and the headphone jack okay so I
know a lot of people don't like the USB
C port so I'm kind of on the fence about
them and basically what it means is that
you only have these two ports on the
base model 13 inch and I think the
bigger ones are being the ones would
touch bar they also have two more USB
slots on the right-hand side so
basically what it means is that now
instead of having a regular USB port you
get this USB C port that you need to
transform in a regular USB 3.0 port if
you want to plug in your existing curved
Ferrell's and these adapters they cost a
ton of money and you need a different
adapter for you know if you want to plug
in HDMI that's like 80 or $90 adapter
this thing was twenty or twenty-five
bucks and if you want to plug in display
for it for an external monitor then
that's yet another adapter so this
adapter game here is it's not that great
because well obviously you know as long
as not all the other devices have
switched over to use B C we're going to
be in this adapter hell so is it a huge
problem for me personally so far no you
know I'm mainly working directly on this
machine like I just moved to a different
place so I don't have a separate like a
separate screen and like a separate
workstation set up so really all I all I
do is you know plug in the power
occasionally when I need to charge this
thing and it's been pretty good on
battery life honestly you know I I
mainly work in Python so for me there
isn't like constant compiling
like I said maybe makes a little bit
easier for the battery to last a little
bit longer
but it hasn't really been a problem with
the battery life it's been very happy
with this thing and what's kind of cool
is that you can plug in the charger into
any one of these ports which wasn't
really possible before so if you get the
bigger version you can also plug it on
the right hand side it could be nice
sometimes to okay there's two more
things I wanted to talk about before we
jump into the screen real estate session
it's kind of hard to find good sleeves
for this thing and I didn't want to
spend you know 100 bucks on on like a
sleeve like this so I found this one by
a company called Tom talk and this is
actually a four F a 11 for 11 inch to 13
inch laptop so it's on a smaller side
but it's apparently you know based on a
research that I did that's the only
sleeve that really fits this laptop that
cause doesn't cost a fortune so this was
relatively cheap I think was like 19 or
18 dollars on Amazon and I'm really
happy with the build quality so I'm
going to link that in the description if
you want to get the same one it's let me
show you it's nice and fluffy it has
like little pouch you can use to protect
against the zipper and yeah just you
know basic basic sleeve here that seems
to work really well so why did I get the
base model well I got the base model and
then bumped up the RAM and the the SSD
space to to the maximum so I got 16 gigs
of RAM and I got 15 12 gigabytes of
storage because to me that's more
valuable than getting like a 5 or 10%
CPU speed increase so actually when you
compare the performance numbers there in
my mind it doesn't make sense to go on
to do a CPU upgrade on the 2017 macbook
pro if you're using a 13 inch version so
you know you're all you're getting is a
dual-core with hyper-threading and
bumping the processor to the next tier
it doesn't really seem to make a huge
difference in benchmarks but it actually
makes a quite a big difference
financially so for me it wasn't worth it
and I think I made the right decision
because I can you know just the extra
RAM and the extra storage space for me
it's just so much more valuable you know
because with 16 gigs I can run a bunch
of docker VMs and I can just keep
running more stuff at the same time and
I don't have to worry about running into
the limits there
some people say 32 gigs would be.we be
nice to have for my workflow in my
workload it doesn't really make a
difference you know if I would need that
much memory I'd probably just get a like
rent some machine in the cloud and just
you know run my apps there - my number
crunching there but you know totally
understand it for some people it will
make a huge difference so the other
thing I really like is the ginormous
touchpad that's actually a really nice
upgrade from the 2011 MacBook Pro that I
was using before
and it's it's awesome so the cool thing
is that now it clicks on every Saturday
I guess it doesn't really doesn't really
click anymore at all it's just like this
little motor underneath it that you know
makes makes it appear like it you would
press it down and really it's just it
just stays in place and whatever you
like about this is yeah just the size
and it's it's just a lot nicer to use
like previously I was actually using an
external mouse a lot but on this machine
I noticed that I really enjoyed working
with the built-in trackpad so that was
pretty great the screen is fantastic I
really really love the screen just
previously it wasn't on a Retina screen
and so this was a huge difference in
terms of clarity and yeah readability so
this is really awesome and I'm going to
show you an app later that you can use
to to crank up the screen size or the
resolution past the limit dad Apple
allows in its in its settings I really
like the keyboard except for the weird
layout on the left and right and up and
down keys so previously there was um you
know there was some empty space around
the up and down cursor keys and that was
made it relative
easy to just kind of you know slide your
hands and your fingers in place and then
you wouldn't have to you could like feel
instantly if you were on the cursor key
so now I have to kind of retrain myself
to to find that that spot here again so
well that's a bit of a downside but
other than that I'm pretty happy um
maybe one more thing we should talk
about is the fact that this think
smudges so easily so I actually tried
cleaning this up before I started
recording this video um I couldn't so
you know I guess I have like pretty
sweaty fingers or whatever but this yeah
it just smudges so easily and it you
know maybe takes a little bit away from
the the clean look but now like this
this computer is awesome it's like a
it's like a piece of art to me I you
know makes me sound like a total Apple
fanboy but honestly I think the build
quality of their hardware it's it's
worth the extra price for me so one more
thing I wanted to talk about is the
charger right because now this this
doesn't do the magnetic what you might
call it you know when it just snaps off
and it's you don't you don't pull your
laptop down on the floor when you when
you walk into the cable MagSafe or
something now we don't have that anymore
so when you plug that in you know it
doesn't it it doesn't really come out
that easily so you're just going to
destroy your laptop essentially if
something gets caught in the cord there
there are third-party solutions that can
can fix that so we basically get like a
little dongle again here and that has
the the MagSafe thing attached to it but
you know I didn't get that yet I might
in the future what's kind of cool about
the powered power brick here is that you
can replace the cable very easily so
this is just a you know use BC port here
and you get a standard USB C cable and
you can plug that in and so that's kind
of cool
so you know also recently got the
Nintendo switch and it uses the same
plug for example it's also used BC and
so I can charge all of that with with
this power brick
which is kind of obvious if you think
about how the use be standard and stuff
works but it's kind of neat all right so
I think we covered everything here from
the outside this is what okay does one
more thing I wanted to mention so I have
a monitor that uses uses this play port
or I guess mini displayport now of
course I can't plug that in here right
so I'm going to need an adapter to do
that so I went to the Apple store and
asked them what kinds of adapters they
have available and they said well there
is a display port adapter but it is a
thunderbolt adapter so this is only
going to work with an Apple display now
you know I'm I don't think it's worth it
paying for an Apple display so I I have
like a Dell display a Dell monitor and
it it wouldn't work with this adapter so
technically there's no way to plug in a
display port monitor into this computer
which is kind of upsetting so I think
the way my screen resolution works out
on that monitor I already own
I can I can power it or it can drive it
through HDMI as well but the problem is
if you have let's say like a 4k monitor
if you if you power it over or you could
drive it over HDMI from this machine you
will only get a 30 Hertz refresh rate so
on my monitor I think it has like a 2500
by something-something resolution
I get the 60 Hertz update I haven't
tried it yet but I think I should be
able to get that now you know if you
have a high resolution you don't get it
going to get the 30 Hertz update and
personally I couldn't work on a 30 Hertz
refresh rate doing any kind of work you
know with an external monitor so this is
kind of shitty and I hope they're going
to change that in the future I mean
there's got to be some way to make this
work adapter wise but you know it might
just cost a bunch of money so this is
definitely one downside of this machine
it's I guess like on the cutting edge
plug wise there but there's just not
enough adapters and and all of the
existing peripherals don't get used the
new standard so that's definitely
something to keep in mind but other than
that I'm I'm very happy with this
machine and now I'm going to jump in and
switch to screen recording and then show
you a little bit about how I set up my
screen and kind of what screen real
estate is available to you all right
so let's take a look at that alright so
we're back and I'm recording this in an
app called ScreenFlow so screen
recording software that I use I produce
a bunch of Python training and you know
courses and training for other software
developers so I work with this a lot and
now I'm using it to show you the kind of
screen screen real estate you can expect
from this machine like I said I switched
from a 15-inch MacBook Pro 2011 which
had a 1600 1680 by 1050 resolution to to
this machine and that means I went a
step up in terms of resolution so this
this machine has an interesting setup in
terms of display like its applicants
with a Retina display it's just like a
really high resolution display and the
way they drive it is that you by default
you don't get access to the full
resolution this display provides so
there are different scaling modes
available and Apple adjusts the UI or
macros adjusts the UI
so that you get like still get like
large enough text and everything is
rendered in like the double or quadruple
the amount of pixels right so everything
looks a little bit nicer and sharper but
the downside is that you can't really
access these crazy resolutions they're
so kind of the highest I can crank it up
with the standard Apple settings is to
1680 by 1050 and I don't know what's
going to happen to my recording when I
do that but let's just try it
all right so it looks like ScreenFlow
actually handles the the resolution
change pretty well so okay so what that
means the more space sitting here I'm
pretty much looking at the exact same
resolution that I previously had on my
15-inch MacBook Pro and this is still
pretty usable I mean obviously
everything will be a little bit smaller
because it's a it's only a 13-inch
screen on this machine but kind of the
setup that I usually use when I'm just
working on the laptop is that I have my
output on the left so in this case and
I'm working on a book so I've got my
output on output on the left if I was
working on a web app I would have my
browser open here on the left hand side
and on the right hand side I have my
editor and the way I've got this set up
is um I I use a tool called size up that
is like a window manager for Mac OS and
I have predefined settings there where I
can just align my windows in a way you
know where it makes sense for me to work
with them so I've got my terminal window
down there I've got my sublime text
window here and I've got my output on
the left and it can kind of you know
read that and browse around here and
that's a setup that works really well
for me I also do a lot of writing in
full screen and a lot of editing in full
screen mode just to get rid of the
distractions so that's a really sweet
setup for me and now the other thing I
want to show you because you may have
noticed this isn't this still isn't a
full HD resolution and so if you're
doing any kind of screen recording like
I am I want to have my output is always
going to be Full HD 1080p resolution the
problem is if I record the screen as
full screen then it doesn't match up
with the aspect ratio right so the
staple macbook screen has a different
aspect ratio then then the sixteen by
nine 1080p resolution and there is the
solution that i found is this tool
there's a number of tools that allow you
to change the resolution of the display
beyond the settings that the apple
display allows and I'm using one that's
called easy rest you can just get that
for free on the App Store I believe so
basically what you can
with it is you can go beyond the retina
resolutions and access the the
one-to-one pixel mapping resolution
that's available on the display so that
way you can access the full pixel
resolution in in your workspace so what
I can do here I can crank this up to 288
by by 1800
and this might actually blow up my
screen recording again though seems to
hold up and I can do that and then of
course I could rearrange my editing
environment here and adjust the font
size is to get the same you know a
similar result but you can see here that
all of the other UI elements are now
actually way smaller so why am i showing
you this
well what this allows me to do is to
record at a full 1080p resolution
because now you know if I use about this
size or something I have like an overlay
that I use to get the exact size and I
should probably write some scripts to
just align my windows correctly I have
this area here that I can record it's
going to be in full 1080p resolution and
I still have some space around to keep
my notes and stuff so now I basically
have a full recording studio that I can
take on the go with me which which is
pretty great which wasn't possible
previously with the the 2011 MacBook Pro
so yeah I guess we that was a little
detour into into screencasting and
whatnot but
but yeah in terms of per
performance I'm pretty happy with the
screen real estate and let's set up chat
a little bit more about just the general
performance of the system so you can see
here that I'm using the base 13-inch
model with the 2.3 gigahertz Intel Core
i5 so that's a dual-core CPU with
hyper-threading which makes it kind of
emulate 4 cores but really only have 2
full course but the hyper threading
allows like some computations to happen
in parallel even if you don't even if
you don't have a full CPU core and that
can speed up some work workloads you
know I don't have any like real data and
stats and how this would affect like a
typical programmers workflow but I guess
it can't really hurt and I got to say
like performance wise I'm very happy
with this machine so previously the
MacBook Pro 2011 had a quad core i7 and
well the first you know I did some
performance comparison and the first
thing I noticed was that you know the i5
and i7 and all these these these names
that Intel gives their CPUs these days
they don't mean anything so there's huge
differences between an i5 on mobile and
an i5 on desktop and you know an
ultra-low power CPU and an icer like it
doesn't it doesn't mean anything you
know it's very hard to estimate the
performance difference is even if chips
have the same the same operate at the
same frequency it can be very hard to
have a you know a reasonable guess in
terms of what performance you will get
at the end so you just got to compare
benchmarks and what I realized is that
going from the base model to the the the
fully decked out like upgraded build to
order I 720 720 17 micro pro 13-inch it
doesn't actually make a huge difference
in terms of performance so I didn't do
it
so I spent my money on getting some
extra memory here and getting more
storage so I got the the 500 gigabytes
disk and you know because I record a
bunch of video and have a bunch of
project and virtual machines on this on
this thing
so I just wanted to up the upgrade here
and actually the SSD is insanely fast
like previously it was running an SSD it
was just upgraded from a regular hard
drive in the 2011 MacBook and this thing
is just it's insane like it this is just
it just feels so much faster and
snappier it's it's pretty sweet so that
was a huge update for me the other thing
is I'm pretty happy with the the the
built-in graphics like I'm probably
never going to get another MacBook with
dual graphics so the previous MacBook
that I had it had an a discrete graphics
chip like an AMD GPU in it and this it
was just a piece of crap you know there
was there was like a recall and an
extended repair program because the GPU
would cause all kinds of trouble and
every every time that happened you would
have to get the the mainboard
the logic board exchanged so it's not
like you can just replace the GPU and on
a laptop I think that's just an extra
point of failure so I expect to get a
lot of mileage out of this laptop and so
it's like yep
you know the built-in GPU is fine if I
want to play games well I can play on a
console or build a Windows PC or
something for dad I don't have to do it
on my work machine so going from the
2011 MacBook Pros this machine it really
feels like a considerable upgrade plus
it is so freakin portable so I can bring
that everywhere when I'm traveling and I
can yeah I can just work on this machine
wherever I go and it's it's beautiful I
really enjoy working on this laptop
alright so that was my rambley review of
the 2017 macbook pro 13 inch in the
baseline configuration without touch bar
