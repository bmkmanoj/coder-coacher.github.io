debater or aku's letter reader what
computer should I buy to learn Python
programming so I understand why this
question exists and it is very easy to
get a terrible answer for this question
namely if you need to buy X Y Z computer
you know if you buy a MacBook you're
gonna be a create great programmer and
and fundamentally I think that is the
wrong advice so I won't give my thoughts
on this question here what computer
should you buy if you want to learn
Python or any other programming language
for that matter so today in most cases
the development environment that you're
gonna be using certainly for Python will
be available on any of the major
operating systems so it will be
available on Windows Mac and Linux and
that means you have a fairly wide choice
in terms of which computer you should
get you know it's it's never like with
iPhone development for example where you
absolutely need to get a Mac computer to
be able to create your apps and then
ship them so with Python it is you have
to you just have a lot more choice right
there's a lot more flexibility and what
I would recommend to you if if it comes
down to making that choice I would
probably go with a Linux machine just
because the development tools and the
command-line tools on on UNIX based
machines like UNIX based operating
systems like Linux and Mac in my
experience have just been a lot better
and a lot more solid now Windows is a
great operating system too and recently
you know they they made some changes
where it's possible to make to make it
very easy to use Linux or UNIX
development tools under Windows as well
but in general I would lean towards
Linux if you're looking for a cheaper
option or actually Mac OS like that's
the operating system that I use but you
know I'm gonna I'm gonna come at this
question also from the perspective of
someone who's not sure how much money
they want to invest into a computer to
program
so I'll you know with with that intro
what I want to say here is that really
if you already have a computer that is
not a let's say you know a tablet that's
locked down in terms of the software you
can install you probably don't need to
go out and buy anything you can just use
whatever computer you have like you can
even program Python on on your iPhone or
a tablet computer or if it's an iPad
using the Python ISTA app and this is
not in my mind the best way to learn the
language but it's certainly an option so
you know before you go out and buy
anything like definitely consider what
you have available and what you can use
in general any computer that you can buy
today will be powerful enough to do a
development work if it's if it's a
proper computer if it's a proper
unlocked machine so well what I would do
here I would go out and see if you can
just you know get a good deal on a basic
office machine and then I would make
sure to get a keyboard that you enjoy
working with a mouse that you enjoy
working with and a monitor with as high
as a resolution that you can afford
because that's really gonna make a
difference to your programming ability
if you want to go the laptop route then
you can pretty much use any computer for
programming Python at least to get
started if you're the more you get
towards the you know the more
professional development at that point
it really becomes a question of like
well if this makes you you know if a
faster computer makes you 10 10% more
effective because you don't have to wait
for stuff to load if it makes it 20 20
percent more effective if you're
freelancer
that potentially makes it a very good
investment to spend some more money on
that because then well you're gonna you
know you're gonna pocket that 20%
improvement there if you can make 20%
more revenue but you know it's kind of
hard to really come down to or to really
figure out what the what the connection
is there between making money and the
speed of your computer as a developer so
at the end of the day you have a lot of
choice when it comes to picking a
machine for learning Python and I would
encourage you to if you're just trying
us out to not go out
just buy something you know try and use
whatever you have right now a basic
office computer will suffice to to get
into this and will make sure it has an
SSD drive it has at least eight
gigabytes of memory and then you'll be
golden right like if it's that's
definitely something that you can use
throughout your university education if
you're not if you're not banking on or
if you're not planning to do any sort of
you know super state-of-the-art 3d
programming and and even then there's
options around it you know and it just
you're gonna build like a little gaming
PC to do that on or whatever if you
already have a gaming PC you know if
that's if that's where you're coming
from you can totally use that machine
for programming as well it's very likely
that this machine will be powerful
enough for you to do this that said
there is definitely you know I
fundamentally believe that if you're
using a tool as much as your computer if
you're a developer it makes sense to get
the machine that really works for you
and to try out a bunch of things so for
me that over the last couple years has
always been sort of getting an Apple
computer just because I've been very
happy with their build quality and you
know it's for me was worth the
investment but I'm totally don't want to
push you that direction you know you
gotta make your own choice and see what
you're most comfortable with and also
what operating system you're most
comfortable with working but just for
starting out if you want to learn
programming don't worry about investing
or don't go out and invest a bunch of
money right now I mean if you have the
money lying around it you know it can't
hurt to get a fancy computer but you
don't have to do this and this shouldn't
stop you from going out and learning how
to program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
