question here so the question is where
can I get the most of Python data
science web development so this is an
interesting question
because I feel like it's it's a bad way
to think about your programming career
it is it's it's it's gonna result in in
you or you know that person making a
decision based purely based on the
economics like you know what is like
what's what is the you know should you
go into data science just because that's
the best field for a Python no I don't I
don't think so I think you should work
on stuff that engages you and that you
find you know mentally mentally
stimulating and that you want to work on
and that doesn't necessarily have to be
data science or web development it could
be it could be you know anything else
really anything where you can add value
with your programming skills and I would
discourage anyone who's thinking about
building a career with Python making the
the niche or the specialization that
want to go into making that purely based
on on on the idea of trying to make the
most with with Python right like you you
should be passionate about the field
that you're working in and you should
try and find work that not only engages
you based on the tools in a programming
language that you use but ideally also
on the the general like the domain that
you're working in right like if you if
you don't like if this person doesn't
doesn't want to be a data scientist but
I tell them oh yeah you know Python is
great for data science and it is you
should totally go into data science
that's gonna be awesome for your career
that person is gonna hate their career
in in a year down the road or even
six-month right because if you you want
to do this stuff for eight hours every
day maybe sometimes longer and if you
want to if you want to build a
sustainable career
don't make a choice where you're going
into some some specific niche or
specialization purely based on what the
market is doing at the moment I mean
sure you know if you're trying if you're
struggling to put food on the table and
this is like almost like a
life-and-death kind of situation then of
course like pick whatever job you've got
but or whatever job you can get rather
right but if if you want to make if you
want to get on the track and if you want
to build a sustainable and enjoyable
career as a Python developer then don't
just pick something based on what the
market is doing at the moment right like
I feel like there's always opportunities
if you look for them and sometimes it's
going to take a while to get there
but ultimately I don't think you'll be
very happy if you if you work in a
domain that you don't enjoy and if you
work on something that that you can't
really engage with I mean we've all done
that right I've worked on consulting
projects and interviewed with companies
or is like yeah maybe this isn't so
great but it's gonna make some money and
that's also just a reality of it right
but long-term if you're thinking about
picking a niche as a Python developer
don't do it based on the numbers you see
in the market try and do something where
you feel actually engaged with the topic
cool if you have any other Python
question that you like me to tackled and
just leave a comment below and I'll try
and talk about it in one of my future
videos if you found this answer helpful

talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
