you a little website that any Python
developer should know about so you may
have heard off the pep 8 style guide for
Python code it's pretty well known in
the Python community it's kind of the
standard style guide for Python code
it's fairly wide used and people often
refer to it so definitely something
worth knowing about and it's really
something that can push your Python code
to the next level because it helps you
avoid some of the common mistakes that
people make and it's a pretty
interesting document to read and it also
makes it easier for you to work with
other Python developers because you can
make your code look like everyone else's
Python code and that makes it easier to
contribute to Python open source
projects or just to work with other
developers on a project so these style
guides are really important if you want
to become a great Python developer if
you want to become a Python developer
that can work well with other people
so highly recommended to read the style
guide and to learn more about the style
guide and just to give you that an idea
of you know what's what's contained in
the style guide so the style guide talks
about very basic stuff how should you
control your indentation levels which is
always a bit of a a challenge or can can
be a bit of a challenge in Python if you
have long-running lines and it makes a
lot of recommendations and shows you
these you know good versus bad examples
here and this document is great so I
love pp8 I love this style guide really
helped me improve my Python skills when
I read it the first time but the problem
I think with this document is that it's
kind of hard to read so please PP
documents they're their way for the
Python language to evolve so they're all
hosted on Python org people can submit
these Python enhancement proposals so
that's what PPE P stands for and then
they kind of grow over time they're
improved over time often times they are
then turned into actual libraries or new
functionality
gets added to Python and in this case
the style guide is kind of this ongoing
thing that only exists in PP form on
Python org now like I said this is a
little bit hard to read there's no
syntax highlighting for code and it's
kind of hard to just navigate this
document and so what I've been
recommending to people is a website
called PP 8 org and it was initially
created by Kenneth reeds who also is the
founder of creator of the popular
requests HTTP library so this guy is
actually one of my Python heroes and he
did a really great job here with pph org
because basically what he did is he took
all the content from the original PP age
website and/or the original PPA document
and then started reformatting it so he
didn't change the content but he just
made it a little bit easier to navigate
and to find what you're looking for so
for example here on the left you have
this persistent navigation that makes it
easier for you to find what you're
looking for and you can just click one
of these points here in the table of
contents it will take you exactly to
what you are looking for
also there is syntax highlighting now
for these code examples which I find
really useful because it just makes it
so much easier to read these code
examples
now besides that there is also some
functionality some highlighting applied
for the good and bad code examples so in
the original document you would
generally just find like a little no
marker that tells you hey you know don't
do this this is bad and here at P or on
PP 8 org this was replaced by these
little highlights red highlight bars
here on the left so you can kind of even
add a glance you can just see directly
is this a good example or this is a bad
example and I really like to improve
formatting here and it's just so much
easier to read and so much easier to
navigate so I've been referring people
to PP 8 org and another you know huge
benefit for this is that it's just so
much easier to remember
PEP PP 8 org verses Python org slash dev
slash PP slash P P - 2 0 0 8 ensure you
can always Google for this stuff but if
you want to send people to you know a
nice readable representation off the
Python style guide then I highly
recommend that you check out PP 8 org
now PPA org is an open source web site
so it's um it lives on github and you
can just go in and suggest modifications
or you know if you find a mistake or if
you can come up with some kind of
improvement you can collaborate with us
and help make this website better so
after a meeting Kenneth at PyCon I you
know just thank him for his website and
he was like oh you know what is actually
out of date and there's some recent
changes that were made to PP 8 or the
original PP 8 that weren't actually
tracked on the PP 8 org website so I
offered my help and now I'm essentially
a co maintainer on pph org and over the
last couple of days I made some small
changes and create some pull requests
that bring in the missing content so PPA
orgs now fully up to date cannot deny we
also enabled HTTPS supports
can browse this securely like I said pp8
I think it's a really great project
there's probably tons more preference we
could make to how this how the
information is presented and I think if
we can make
pp8 just easier to digest and easier to
understand and easier to browse you know
that the style guide not necessarily pph
org if we can spread kind of the
goodness that is pp8 in the Python
community more and more then I think it
will lead to to more maintainable Python
code it will help people collaborate on
open-source projects because it will be
easier for people to work together on
these projects is to use the same coding
coding style so I think this can be a
really helpful and beneficial project to
the Python community and so if you're
interested in this project or if you
think this is a good idea then I would
appreciate if you share it with your
friends tell everyone who's looking for
a Python style tip style guide tell them
about PPA org if you want to contribute
to the project then please go ahead and
you know submit a pull request or see if
you can find some we have some bugs in
there we have some typos in there and if
you can find any anyway we think we
should approve PPA org please go ahead
and submit a pull request and then
either kenneth or i will review it and
we can make this website better and
better over time
alright that's it for me so go and check
out PPA org I think it's a pretty
fantastic website and I think it's great
that Kenneth put that together and just
launched it and bought the domain so
Thank You Kenneth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
