productivity tip for all of you Python
programmers out there who are using
sublime text so today I want to talk
about how you can use the sublime text
split layouts feature to make it a lot
nicer to work on tests code and
production code at the same time so this
is really handy if you're doing sort of
test heavy development and I want to
show you how this works real quick right
okay so the default situation is kind of
um we're working on a Python file and
let's see we'll make a change and we
need to update the test so we need to
update some other file that relates to
that particular file that we're
currently working on so usually how you
would do that you would have these two
tabs open and then kind of switch back
and forth between them to work on your
test code for example and then you know
work on the actual implementation that's
okay but I find that a much nicer way to
do this is by actually using the split
layouts feature in sublime text so
usually what I'll do is I'll have the
production code open on one side of the
layout let's say on the left here and
then I have the the test code open on
the right and if you pick the font size
right and kind of picked the the window
size right you can fit in two files
easily if you use the full screen mode
or if you have you know a larger monitor
and just using a portion of my screen to
record this right now you would actually
fit you know three or potentially even
four panes and I also like to get rid of
the sidebar here which gives us a little
bit more space and we can you know bump
up the font size or whatever and so this
is really cool because it gives you a
really nice overview and you can see the
text and implementation code
side-by-side and like I said you could
also do this with four panes at the same
time and if you crank down the font size
a bit so you probably you know when
you're watching this in YouTube you
probably won't be able to to read this
but I could actually work with this
and have four files open at the same
time right so I could you know open my
little read me here because getting a
lipid hard to read but if I actually
made this full screen I bet I could
still work with this and you know I
occasionally I do but really usually I
leave it at two files open at the same
time and if you want to leave that mode
there's one shortcut you need to
remember and that is command option one
that's gonna take you back to single tab
mode and if you go command option two
that's gonna take you back to the split
layouts feature cool so I find this to
be a really big time-saver in my work
and if you like seeing productivity tips
like that then subscribe to my channel
there's gonna be more stuff like that
cool talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
