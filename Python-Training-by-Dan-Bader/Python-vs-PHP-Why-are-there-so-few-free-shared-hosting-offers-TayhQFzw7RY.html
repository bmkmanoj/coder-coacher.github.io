question in my inbox and in this video I
want to share some of my thoughts so
here's the question why are there so few
Python shared free hosting offers
compared to PHP this is a really
interesting question because I never
really thought of it that way you know
by by comparison I never really felt
there was less hosting or shared hosting
offers for Python compared to PHP and in
every occurred to me I think if you
specifically look for shared hosting or
you know the kind of hosting or just FTP
up a bunch of files and then you have
your web application running that way
then I think this is an accurate
observation though right like this kind
of hosting setup it exists much more for
PHP and not so much for Python I think
there's actually a ton of free Python
hosting out there it just follows a
different methodology than what most PHP
hosts offer so so let me explain what
I'm what I'm saying here right typically
when you host a Python application what
I personally do and what I see most
other people do is that you would just
host it on for example a platform
as-a-service
kind of offering like Heroku or the
Microsoft Azure cloud or the Google
cloud engine or something like that
where you can just you know bundle up
your application hosted in the cloud
somewhere and it'll run if it's a Python
web application the the hosting model
where you get FTP credentials and you
upload a file and it just runs through
CGI on a server and you have some kind
of web app website running there like
it's often done with PHP that isn't
really that popular in the Python world
and I could totally go on a rant here
and say some very bad things about PHP
and maybe how it has like a less
professional developer audience but I'm
not gonna do that I mean fundamentally
we all just want to get stuff done and
we use whatever means whatever means and
whatever tools we have at hand right
whether that's PHP or Python so I don't
want to be all smug about it but on the
other hand I think there's a certain
truth to that so you know
takes a little bit more skill and more
experience to use these platform as a
service providers but they actually
offer you a ton of advantages right by
comparison if you need to upload your
your Python file or PHP file just
through an FTP server then that doesn't
really give you scalable deployments and
it doesn't really help you you know
maintain that code base and and deploy
it in any kind of reproducible fashion
with something like Heroku you can just
deploy straight from your git repository
you can rollback deploys you can do
these deploys atomically and you can do
them seamlessly so that the new version
of your app comes up as the old version
goes down and there's kind of a seamless
deploy process and and you can do it's
very hard to do that with the kind of
FTP upload run a CGI script kind of
hosting so well - to answer this
question or maybe to give some some
advice on how to do your Python web
application hosting well I think you
have to just pick up these skills you
know figure out how to package up your
application so you can deploy to Heroku
and then do that it's actually a great
thing for you and you don't want to do
the classical you know upload an FTP
file to some server and run that on
shared hosting I've been my mind that is
a bad development or bad deployment
practice and if you can get away from
that then that's actually a great thing
and if you few the if you view the world
from that perspective or the hosting
world from that perspective you'll see
that there's a ton of options for Python
hosting out there and the reason for
that is that usually these hosting
options they're not advertised as Python
hosting specifically it's just a cloud
provider a platform as a service where
you can take your programs and run them
on there whatever the programming
language and Python is just a very
popular target in that respect all right
