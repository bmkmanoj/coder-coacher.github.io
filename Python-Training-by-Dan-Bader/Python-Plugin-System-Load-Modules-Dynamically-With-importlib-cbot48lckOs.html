Python tutorial in this video you're
going to learn how to load Python
modules dynamically from your Python
applications and this can be handy if
you're trying to build a plug-in system
or basically want to make your
application configurable so that based
on a string setting your application
will load a different module and then
execute it as a plugin so I know this
sounds very abstract so I want to show
you a simple example here imagine you're
working on an application that includes
different plugins that can be
dynamically activated so for example
maybe you have something like this in
there where you can go from plugins
import my plug-in and then you know
we've reported that module and we can do
something interesting with it so we can
call an example function and do
something with that now this is pretty
static right if I want to import a
different module here maybe I want to
import my plug-in - if I want to do that
I have to change the Python code you
want to make it so that your user can
just change your configuration setting
and then you will dynamically import a
different class or maybe the user can
even add new plugins to a file that
maybe you didn't ship with the
application and they could still be
dynamically loaded so the question here
is how do you modify this code so that
you can do something like this right
instead of actually using the import
keyword here how can you make it so that
I can you know this is pseudocode now
but imagine this this was fully fleshed
out imagine we wanted to do something
like this
and then do this right where we we want
to import the actual plug-in that's
specified in this config variable now if
I if I try and run this code this
wouldn't work because it would always
try to import plug-in name and and
really plug-in name would be a string
like this that would then say my plug-in
or you know plug-in 2.0 or something
like that how can we do this certainly
we can't do it with the import keyword
but there's still a way to implement
this functionality and this can be
highly useful if you're trying to build
an application that is user configurable
or if you imagine instead of this
plug-in name coming from a config
variable what if we just looked into a
specific folder and then try to load
those files so so how do we make this
work this is what this tutorial is about
so let's get started what I'm gonna do
first is I'm gonna start fleshing out
the application so I've already created
an empty folder here that I can work
with this is where we're gonna put this
example plug-in system application and
right now this folder is empty so what
I'm going to do is I'm gonna create a
bunch of files I'm gonna create a file
that's called
app dot py this is just our example
entry point for the app and then we're
gonna create a new folder for all of the
plugins then I can see here we have this
app dot P Y and the plugins folder and
then inside plugins I'm gonna create
well I'm just gonna create a file called
1 py let's plug in number 1 I'm gonna
save that and then I'm also gonna create
another plug-in that is plug-in number 2
and when you look at this folder now it
looks like this right so we have app py
that's the entry point for our
applications the main file and you have
the plugins folder they're a bunch of
plugins in there and now the question is
okay well do how do we make it so that I
can just based on a string setting I
just can just go in and load these
plug-in files so we're gonna build up a
very simple plug-in system here and
we're gonna start by fleshing out one of
the plugins are actually fleshing out
both of these plugins and the way I
imagine these plugins would work they
would just have a high-level class that
almost always follows the same naming
scheme and we're just gonna make it so
you know for demonstration purposes
we're gonna make it so that we can pass
a bunch of arguments here and then this
is just it's just gonna print out I'm
gonna print out some info here so we
have something to to play with so I'm
just gonna print out whatever gets
passed in here so we can make sure
passing around arguments actually works
and then we're gonna have a method foo
that let's call this something else is
called us execute and then we'll have
the self parameter a and B and now this
is just gonna return a plus B and then
we're gonna copy and paste this for the
plug-in number two and here we're
actually gonna subtract alright so you
see what I did here I created these two
plugins one and two and they both
they're both just modules that contain a
top-level class that's called plug-in
and then we have an init method in an
execute method that does two different
things so this here is plug-in number
one let's add a little doc string here
you know just to make sure you can see
what's going on and we're gonna do the
same thing over there right and now of
course the interesting part is well
what's gonna happen let's make sure this
also Lynn's clean so but now the
interesting part of course is what's
going to happen in app dot py like how
can we dynamically import these modules
and and well of course I could go from
plugins
import one two and then well I just
print them out and see if this works
make sure this works so here I'm just
going to call Python on app dot py and
you can see here well of course it
successfully imported these modules and
we were able to print out the module and
then now we can go and say one plug-in
and if we do this this should actually
print out our message here plug-in in it
one right now we can pass we can pass
something here hello world so so this
all works now of course this is not very
interesting because well we just you
know did exactly what I showed you in
the beginning you just hard coded these
plug-in names but how do we make it so
that we can dynamically import these
modules so so how can we go from this to
just something like this I'm gonna
create a constant here so here I created
a constant and I set this to the name of
the plug-in and want to make it so that
this setting here it's gonna influence
or it's gonna determine which plug-in
will load and you can imagine you this
string here now I've have this
hard-coded as a constant but this could
also be loaded from them from a file or
from a UI setting or you know from any
other kind of source so now how do we go
from having this string here to actually
being able to load the module
dynamically calling it executing the the
the plug-in function so for that we need
in the import lip module so I'm gonna do
some cleanup here so actually let's
leave that here that could be handy
later on for comparison so there's a
built in module in Python it's called
import Lib and it allows you to or it
gives you a non keyword based interface
just a function based interface to
pythons import system or module import
system so maybe that sounds will be
confusing let's just
we can do with that so with import lip
you can go and you can say well I want
to import a module based on a string
name so here
I can pass it the the name and then I'm
gonna tell it that I want to load this
relatively to the current folder and
just because I get nitpicky let's also
make sure the hit the quotes here look
exactly the same so let's load this
dynamically and what this will do it it
returns a handle for this module right
so let's actually get all of this stuff
out of the way we're just gonna print
the plug-in module and see what happens
okay so you can see here does have the
exact same result as importing the
module the way you've seen before with
the the import keyword but the cool
thing now is that I can toggle around or
I can just change this setting and I run
the app again it's gonna load a
different module so this is pretty close
to what we want already and now we can
flash it flush it out a little bit
further right so now we have a way to
dynamically import these these plugins
based just on a string name or like a
string reference to them and and now
we're gonna flush out this this plug-in
system a little bit more so typically
and this is you know this is where this
part comes in right this is why I've
named these classes in exactly the same
way and gave them the same interface so
what I can do now is I can say well okay
the actual plug-in class is are comes
from our dynamically loaded plug-in
module and then we need to initialize
the plug-in module you know we're just
gonna give it some arguments here and
you could of course pass it whatever you
wanted so let's do this
and then we've instantiate 'add the
actual plug-in class when I run this
we've initialized this plug-in here and
now each of those plugins also has an
execute
method well that you know it does
something semi interesting just for for
example purposes so here I can go in and
I can say plug in execute let's go five
and three and then well stores in the
variable and then we're just gonna print
the result right okay so now we've got
this little test bed here so now when I
run this app it did load plug in one
from plug in slash 1py
and then the result of that execute
operation was eight now if we load a
different plug in we're hopefully gonna
get a different behavior alright so here
the result of the same code was actually
two because the plug into well it does
this it does a minus B instead of a plus
B so you know this is mainly just for
illustration purposes but really if
you're trying to write a plug-in system
using Python and you want to make it
dynamic so that you don't have to code
up all of these different import
statements but you can just have a user
configurable string in a config file
somewhere you know wherever this comes
from and you can just dynamically load
these modules that's how you would do it
and you could do the same you could use
the same technique here with this import
Lib module you could use the same
technique to actually enumerate all of
the potential plugins inside a folder
and then try to load those dynamically
in that way you could make your
application user extensible right so
users if they're skilled programmers or
maybe if they're just skilled users and
they get the the plug-in from somewhere
else they just need to copy it to a
folder and they can extend your
application that way and what this what
this video also touched on was the
necessity for you to have a very clear
interface for these modules right so
here we had this kind of common plug-in
interface where well the plug-in classes
that were both called plug-in
we have them here and the both of these
classes they had an execute method that
I was able to call here in that way I
was I was able to seamlessly switch
between these two plugins and it would
do different things now of course you
know they're not doing very interesting
things but if you imagined you know this
the sky's the limit here you could you
could provide all kinds of different
implementations and do all kinds of
interesting things here so this is
mainly for illustration purposes so
before you go I want to show you a
little example of where this can be
handy so this is a project that well at
this point that I worked on a long time
ago more a side project so I built a
Raspberry Pi based internet radio I was
using this LCD display and it was all
written in Python it's called PI radio
and this thing allowed you to
dynamically load different drivers for
the LCD so yeah so basically what I did
here is I use the exact same technique
so we can just browse through the code
here and there's a an LCD driver that
uses the exact same method here where we
have a bunch of strings that specify
which driver to load and this can come
from a config file and then we're using
import Lib import module to try and load
the driver and so this gives a lot of
flexibility and it's not you know always
strictly necessary to introduce a
plug-in system into your into your
applications of course but if you want
to do it this is a pretty good way to
implement it in Python all right so I
