is the easiest way to achieve c-like
performance in Python without in-depth
knowledge of scythe on or other
libraries so this is challenging because
my gut feeling was well if you want to
make Python faster usually it's about
swapping out the the kind of the hot
code path the stuff that gets executed a
lot and then needs to run really fast to
kind of swap that out with native code
you know if you can if you can write a
little C library that it's much closer
and to the bare metal of your machine
and then call that from Python usually
that's a really great optimization
strategy for your Python programs if you
have performance relevant code and it
can't really be fixed by changing the
algorithm which would be my first choice
right like if you absolutely have to
write something in machine language or
something that runs natively on your
platform then typically I would look for
something like C types or scythe on to
be able to offload some of that work to
C code and something that runs on the
bare metal and I've done other videos on
that in the past so this question kind
of takes away all of that and says well
how can I get C like performance in
Python without actually doing this trick
off using scythe on or or C times now
what I would recommend is to swap out
your Python interpreter and if you're
running your current programs on C
Python you can try out something called
pi PI that is an alternative Python
interpreter
focused on on high performance so this
is actually a just-in-time compiling
interpreter or you know it takes your
code and actually converts it into
machine code on the fly and then
executes that instead of always having
some byte code around that it interprets
like the c python interpreter to see
python virtual machine so pi pi is a
great way to optimize many Python
programs without actually having to go
and write C code or some other language
that you can use to speed up the
performance intensive parts of your
application so I would look I would if I
were you I would look into pi PI and see
if you can use your program with pi pi
pi pi has is fairly compatible these
days that kind of always lagging a
little bit behind the see Python
interpreter but they're getting faster
and faster so this could be a great tool
you can try out and it's usually a
drop-in replacement so I've had some
projects where this gave me like a 3x
speed up and it was something you know I
had written odd to run on the old
version of the Raspberry Pi which is
kind of a slow machine and really there
it made a fairly big difference to
switch to PI pi
and I didn't have to make any changes to
my program whatsoever and it was a kind
of cool experience now this is not gonna
work with any library there's some
libraries that are just incompatible
with pi PI or some libraries where it's
actually slower than to run them on C
Python so this is just something to try
out and you know maybe you can take some
of the performance relevant parts of
your application and just run DOS on pi
PI and kind of ferry around the results
through a database or through a message
queue so you know so I'm taking some of
the more advanced application
development patterns there but really
the base case is maybe just running your
program on pi PI you can install very
easily there Linux packages for it
there's a homebrew package if you're
using Mac it's just a drop-in
replacement for the C Python interpreter
and I would encourage you to try it out
if you're trying or if you're looking
for a way to speed up computations in
your Python programs all right if this
