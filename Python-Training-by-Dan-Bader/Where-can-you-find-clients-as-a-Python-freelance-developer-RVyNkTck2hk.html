I got from a reader where can you find
clients as a Python freelancer so super
important questions for anyone who's
trying to make some money of their
Python programming skills there are a
couple of options that have worked for
me in the past and I've seen work for
other people so if you want some very
you know actionable stuff we can just go
out and apply that strategy I would do
two things so I would create an up work
profile just you know put your skills
out there offer your work and then make
a point of every day reaching out to
people on that platform where people are
looking for some Python help or some you
know web scraping tasks a data
transformation tasks and you can just
offer your help to people on that
platform this is not usually not gonna
pay you know a super-high hourly rate
there just because there's a lot of a
lot of talent on the platform but this
can be a great way just to build your
your experience and build your portfolio
and actually make some money doing that
another option that you can do and this
is something I call this prospecting so
what you want to do is like you want to
search Craigslist and search some job
boards and just email out you know
offers to people that you find there if
someone's looking you know to have a
website build or to have some kind of
app build email them and say hey I'm a
developer here's my portfolio
this is highlights the importance of
having a portfolio out there and I just
get in touch with them and offer your
services now you know this is totally a
numbers game if you do it like that this
is some this is also where kind of the
really crappy clients are you know this
is usually not like very sort of high
value and the best clients
you're gonna have a hard time finding
the best clients on these platforms and
doing these strategies and but it's
something that you can do almost
mechanically right like have a little
template and just email as many people
as you can and eventually you're gonna
see some results and this is very
important especially initially if you
don't have to network and if you don't
have the previous clients that you
worked with that are gonna bring you
repeat business so this is a good way to
get started another thing you can do you
can post your your your abilities or
kind of
make a posting on sites like hacker news
or reddit forums we can just say hey I'm
a developer for hire these is these are
the skills that I offer these as my
areas of specialization and just get
inbound email from people that
potentially want to hire you again this
is usually not going to lead to the
highest quality of clients but it's just
something you can do and this is
something you can use to attract clients
so really the best way to find clients
that are high value that are great to
work with is by building personal
relationships right and in order to do
that you always want to bring some value
upfront so if you're trying to meet a
new person and kind of convince them
that you've got what it takes to get the
job done you need to show them that
you've done this in the past and you
know what you're talking about so really
this is more a long-term game and this
is why I'm sort of balancing it with you
know these are some things you can do
very very directly very quickly versus
some more if the long term kind of like
strategy things that you want to do and
here it's it's all about building up
your your expertise and also your
authority in a way as an expert Python
developer and for dad you definitely
want to have a portfolio you want to put
yourself out there see if you can you
know submit a conference presentation
speak at a conference and I've got some
videos on that that show you how to do
that and how this has worked for me in
the past you want to build your network
by actually shipping projects for people
you know working for people and just
have that personal network where people
can say hey this person is a great
programmer and if they hear something in
their in their surrounding in their
network they're gonna refer you that
work so it's all about the referrals I
think in terms of the really high
quality work and this is how I found my
best clients another Avenue you know if
you can take that kind of authority
expertise building very far and start a
blog start a start a website and talk
about what what you can do by teaching
others how to do it and really this is
this is gonna open up a whole nother
level where people can see that you've
got the skills that it takes and your if
comfortable teaching other people this
stuff and that for me has made a huge
difference just in the amount of inbound
that I get in terms of you know job
offers or you know hey do you want to be
my co-founder and stuff like that so
that is really a long-term game and I
would encourage you to get into it
because it's very rewarding it's a lot
of fun you can help a lot of people and
then also have a source of a freelance
work by doing that but this is gonna
take a long time to build that momentum
and to build that recognition right so
this is why I want to balance it with
having some actionable strategies that
you can apply and some things that are
really more like the long-term long-term
strategies and long-term things that you
want to do and then you kind of want to
chip away at so so yeah these are some
tips and what you can do to find work as
a freelance Python developer if this
question helped you out it didn't leave
