I wanted to go over some of the cool new
features in Python 36 because I think
this is going to be a really cool update
for the language it adds some new
interesting syntax and I just wanna give
you a quick overview so I wrote this
blog post a while ago and with some
examples so if you want to you know kind
of recap this video you can just go to
my site and find it there I'm going to
link it in the description and yeah so
the first syntactic change in Python 3 6
I want to call out is the new improved
syntax for a numeric literals and you
can see an example here so what you can
do now is you can add these underscore
characters to space your number literals
apart and this is not going to make a a
semantic difference right this is just
purely a way for formatting your numbers
and kind of how they look in your source
code but still I think this could be a
really handy feature if you're dealing
with prices or if you're dealing with
these constants here right if you have
these hex constants or a bunch of binary
Flags this could be a really good way
you know to space that out and make that
a lot more readable and I think this is
a really cool change it's something I
think that was available in the Swift
programming language as well and it's
really nice to see you know some of
these new features getting added to
Python as well and in my opinion that's
another reason why you want to go with
Python 3 because the language is under
active development there's new and
awesome features being added you know
with every single release so yeah so I
thought those were really cool change
and you can find more about that in pp
515 again that's linked here in the post
and I'm also going to link that in the
description one of my favorite features
in this new Python release is the
improved string interpolation so what
that does is it adds yet another way to
format strings in Python and it's called
the formatted strings
formatted string literals and this is a
new way of formatting that lets you use
embedded
Python expressions inside your string
constants so here's an example for this
right so basically what you would do is
you would define a new string and then
just put an F at the beginning kind of
like you would do with a lowercase R for
raw strings and then you can use this
new syntax we're using these curly
braces and then you can just put a
Python expression in there so in this
case we're going to pull in the value of
the name variable so we're going to end
up with the string hello Bob and because
this just takes arbitrary Python
expressions you can do well you can
evaluate arbitrary Python expressions so
you can do arithmetic you can do you can
do anything right so for example this
case we're defining two variables and
then in the string constant we're doing
a bunch of math on that and it will get
the resulting string 5 plus 10 is 15 and
not 30 and we're calculating that like
on the fly within within that string
syntax and I think this is really cool
and it's very similar to the way the
template literals work in the new
iteration of JavaScript and this is
something that that I've really enjoyed
using in JavaScript and so I think this
is a great addition to Python the
language as well of course these these
format strings they have some more cool
features for example you can use all of
the syntax the formatting syntax that is
available in the string dot format call
so you can do stuff like hey we're going
to take this error this integer constant
and we're going to format it as a hex
string and you don't have to you know do
any workarounds for that you can just do
that with the new formatting literals or
formatted literal syntax as well which I
think is a really cool new feature and
it's quite a nice addition to the
language again you can learn all about
this change in PEP four nine eight so
the last thing I want to call out here
and there's a lot more
in this release but the last thing I
want to call out here is the type
annotations changes so there's new
syntax to annotate types for just
standalone variables and I think these
type hints are are really interesting I
think they're they're a really really
interesting direction the the language
is going in and I think it's going to
have a huge impact now we're going to be
using Python in the next couple years so
I've got a video about how you can set
up type hinting and actually validate
your tiya validate your programs against
these type hints with the mypie type
checker so i'm going to link that in the
description as well and yeah well what
you can see here this was possible
already in Python 35 right you could
define these type ins like this and you
could do it for function arguments and
also for function return values and now
with python 3 6 this syntax is actually
more flexible so you can use the same
syntax or like this colon and then the
type for just you know standalone
variables which which i think is kind of
cool like previously you have to do that
with a kind of a special especially for
minute comment which I don't think is
ideal and this just makes it a lot
cleaner and I think it just makes the
whole like writing type Python approach
a lot more valuable so I'm really
excited about this new syntax even
though it's a small change and yeah you
can learn more about this this in PP 5
to 6 and I've also got this other video
that's going to show you how to get
started with these PM with these type
extensions in your Python code there's
many more interesting changes in Python
3 6 so for example there's new syntax
for async generators and async
comprehensions a lot of people are
really excited about that I think it
would need like a longer video to really
kind of dive deeply into that and I
might do that in the future another cool
update is that dictionaries are a lot
faster and they use well they are faster
I don't think they're actually a lot
faster but they are faster which is good
right because like a free improvement
that you're getting for
for your Python programs and they
actually use quite a bit less memory now
which is cool change as well and another
cool thing in the PI in the typing area
is that the typing module the type hints
module is now considered a stable API
which it wasn't really previously and
kind of polished some of that and I
think now it's really a stable
foundation that people are going to be
able to build their type programs on top
of it and I think there's going to be a
huge benefit to Python in the long run
because it just makes it so more flex so
much more flexible and we're going to be
able to apply it in so many more
contexts where it didn't really make
sense
previously to use Python in so yeah I'm
pretty excited about that and there's
also a new secrets module you can use to
generate cryptographically secure
well random strings basically and that
is is super useful if you're building
any kind of web app or authentication
system where you want to create these
authentication tokens and previously it
was really easy to shoot yourself in the
foot with that and to accidentally
create insecure tokens and now with the
secrets module this is all getting
cleaned up and I think it's a really
valuable addition for web development
and for you know other kinds of programs
that you might write in Python as well
so yeah if you want a recap of that and
check out this article at debate org and
I would also like to point you to the
official what's new in Python 3.6
announcement which kind of goes into
more depth and what's been changed here
and really calls out all the little you
know smaller changes but the changes I
went over in this video those were
really the ones I was the most excited
about all right so I hope this gets you
excited about Python 3 6 2 and I'm
totally looking forward to use it I
already played with it a bit in a Linux
VM or just install the latest version
from source and it's it's going to hit a
public release really soon and then yeah
we can all start writing beautiful new
Python 3.6 cool well have a great day
and talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
