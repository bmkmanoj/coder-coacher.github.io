answer a question that I got from Maddie
over Twitter so Maddie writes hey Dan I
had a question for someone who wants to
learn to code but has absolutely no
knowledge on coding where should I start
and I think that is a fantastic question
so a couple of thoughts on that um first
of all it's great that you're asking us
question Matt II because I think it's
good to be somewhat analytical about
this stuff right it's a good idea to not
simply jump in and think everything is
just going to fall into place I mean in
most cases it will and it's better to
get started than to wait but it doesn't
hurt to actually think about you know
how you want to approach this like if
you want to learn how to code what's the
best way to do it because you know
realistically this is like a multi-year
endeavor to become a coder and it just
it's just going to pay off if you're
smart about teaching you all these
skills that you need okay so the
question was yeah I want to learn how to
code by I have absolutely no question I
have I have absolutely no knowledge in
coding where should I start so I think
the first step here would be to think
about why you want to learn how to code
because that's going to inform you know
if you have that goal that's going to
inform how you should go about achieving
it in my opinion so you know some people
they want to learn how to code just
because they're interested in it and it
seems like you know maybe seems like a
cool thing to do like a cool skill to
pick up that could be one reason another
reason could be that someone wants to
scratch their own itch you know maybe
they're working on something you know
maybe their job involves working with a
bunch of spreadsheets and Excel tables
and they're frustrated with the work
they have to do manually and in there
they're thinking oh you know I could
actually write some program to do this
for me and it would save me a bunch of
time it would probably be very enjoyable
and it would make me more effective at
what I already do right or I want to
build a home automation system or you
know there could be several other
reasons where it's a scratch
own each kind of situation rethinking
hey if I learn how to code this is
really going to help me achieve some
other goal you know it's going to help
me some solve some other problem or it's
going to help me make some progress on
some other project that I'm working on
the third option that I can think of is
some people do it for the money I mean
right now developers are highly in
demand it's one of the highest highest
paid professions in the world right now
and so you if you can get in on that for
career reasons that could obviously also
be a very strong motivation right if you
can train yourself to get a job as a web
developer mobile app developer you know
some other kind of software developer
that could be a life-changing you know a
life life-changing transformation for
for many people and so there are all
these different reasons why people want
to learn coding and I think it's a good
idea to become aware off your own
reasons there and why you want to become
a coder in order to decide what the best
way is to go about it because there will
be like for me one thing that is really
important for someone who wants to learn
how to code you know when I think about
this problem I think it's super
important to do it in a way that
motivates you like I said you know this
is not going to be easy and this is
going to take several months to several
years to get anywhere anywhere
meaningful and so if you can if you can
be clear about what your motivations are
then it's going to make it so much
easier for you to find the right
resources and to to then work with them
on a continuing basis because what I've
seen happen several times now is that
people jump into this and because
they're not clear on their on their
actual motivation on their actual goals
it's very easy to kind of slip out of
that practicing you know let your
schedule slip stop practicing and then
there's no progress so it's super
important in my opinion to decide on
your goals there and find out what is
really your core motivation why you want
to become a coder I can speak a little
bit about you know how I got into coding
what my motivation was and then maybe
that's something
that is going to help you also identify
your own motivation and then see how it
can go about it so when I got into
coding I was um I was I guess relatively
young by comparison so I I just got
interested in programming when I was
maybe seven years old or so you know I
could like maybe read like a little bit
I grew up in Germany and we didn't speak
English at all and so we my parents got
me this Commodore 64 computer that that
you could program in the basic language
so this is a very simple you know
old-school programming language and the
computer came with a couple of books in
English that were talking about how this
basic stuff works and obviously I had no
idea you know what I was doing there but
I was just fascinated by this machine so
it was for me was a very visceral
motivation just to play with this
machine and figure out what it was doing
and I can't really tell you like what
was so motivating for me about it
because clearly you know I didn't think
of making more money I didn't think of
solving problems that I had I mean you
know I was just a carefree like seven or
eight year old so that was my motivation
there was just something about coding
and about computers that I found utterly
fascinating and that's what sucked me
into this and you know if you jump ahead
like ten years later then that's where I
got my first job and and started working
as a programmer on the side and so you
know this could be another option where
you just want to become a coder and give
it just you're fascinated by it and
that's that's your main motivation now
because it maybe also give you some
insight on how you would go about
learning how to code so if it's just
something that you enjoy and you enjoy
playing with then start making these
little experiments you know like set
like little goals for your for yourself
like hey can I make this you know can I
change the color of the screen like can
I show some text there can i you know
I'm not sure of that these days it's
probably not that interesting anymore if
you can change the color of text and
whatnot but you know try and come up
with little motivations for you and
little motivating projects for you that
you can work on because in my opinion
the way you want to learn you don't want
to sit down and say I want to learn how
to code but you want to say your mindset
should be I want to solve this little
problem and coding or learning Python or
whatever other language you want to
learn that's that's my tool right it's
like it's like you're a carpenter and
that's your hammer and a carpenter well
few people I guess would sit down and be
like oh yeah I want to be a carpenter
but you know maybe they would start with
like hey I want to make this chair how
do I get there you know how what do I
need to learn to be able to do it
because certainly to make a chair you
don't have to be the world's best
carpenter and you don't have to know all
of this stuff you know and likewise with
if you want to make a little game or if
you want to change the color of your
screen on your computer you don't have
to be you know the best programmer in
the world you don't have to have a PhD
in computer science you just have to
learn these very specific skills and
then then you're golden you know you can
start with your first experiment and you
keep building more of these experiments
and that's going to help you assemble
this knowledge map and just learn more
about this whole field and then things
are going to going to start to come
together for you now
of course the question is okay now I
have this idea let's say I want to make
a little game how do I get there and the
most important part is that you pick
very very simple goals you know pick
maybe if you're saying like I want to
make a game
when I think back you know the little
games that I wanted to make
they were pretty high fidelity and you
know they didn't yeah if you if you want
to make a game like the snake you know
the old so like snake game on your Nokia
like non-smartphone or you know
something like Super Mario or something
like that that actually takes a lot of
work and you need to know a lot of stuff
too to get there you know we need to
know some graphics programming input
processing you know if you need some
design skills and this would be a fairly
complex project so what I would suggest
is like to drastically lower your aim
there so that you have these little
things that you can achieve in just a
couple of days or maybe like a week or
two at most and
once you've picked something there you
know like how can I I don't know take
the spreadsheet and export it in a
different way and calculate some numbers
of something once you've got a very
small goal then you can start just
looking around on the internet and
trying to find ways you can solve these
problems with programming you know and a
good way to do it is like just punch in
a couple of key words and then add the
programming language of your choice
so maybe Python which is the language
that I love and that I enjoy working
with and I think is a great choice for
someone to get started because it can it
can scale so well and it can help you
also later on get a job as as a
developer and then you're going to see a
bunch of stuff that maybe you don't
understand at the beginning but that's
going to allow you to that's going to
tell you a whole lot right like then
you're going to see stuff that you've
never seen before
so you can Google for that again and
maybe look for a book that seems like it
would explain you some some of the
things that you saw there and so it's
like you just got to start with this one
goal with this one motivation and then
kind of spread out from there and start
searching for the missing bits and
pieces that that you need I mean in the
beginning it absolutely also makes sense
to get some targeted education like a
Python basics course and you can find
really good ones on on YouTube here or
you can also search for them on the
Internet and that's probably a good way
just to kind of get the basics of the
language under under your belt but I
would actually not front load that I
would do that after you came up with
one two three four ideas of actual
problems you want to solve with coding
right because that's it's going to
vastly change your approach like if
you're saying like hey I want to become
a coder because I want to make a ton of
money when I get a job as a coder
personally I'm not sure if I would
recommend that but if you wanted to do
it then that would obviously change how
you go about it right like maybe it's
more more of an economic decision you
could say hey okay you know if I can
make like a six-figure income with a
programming job then I'm going to go
ahead and pay someone like ten or twenty
thousand dollars to go through a
bootcamp
or I'm going to sign up for some private
coaching and have someone actually teach
me how to program and get me started
right like then it makes all of a sudden
it makes a lot of sense to invest your
resources that way if you can make an
economic argument for this whereas if
you're just learning it for the love of
programming maybe that's not something
you're comfortable with right you're not
comfortable with investing so much money
in learning the skills and yeah so you
know I I know this was a bit of a
rambling answer and I didn't really
point you to specific resources but I
felt like just trying to give you um a
good mindset to think about this stuff
would actually be more valuable than
saying like hey you know I would buy
this book and I would buy that book like
heck like maybe you shouldn't even buy
anything in the beginning and just kind
of see how far you can get with free
resources to see how you like this but
the most important thing to repeat that
is to have a specific you know very
narrow very small goal that you want to
work on a very small project that you
want to complete that has some actual
benefit for you so that you feel
motivated to go through with learning
how to program right Maddy I hope this
was helpful thanks for asking the
question and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
