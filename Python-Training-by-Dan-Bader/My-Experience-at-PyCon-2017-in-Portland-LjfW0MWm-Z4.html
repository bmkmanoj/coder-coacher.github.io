from Pike on us 2017 and in this video I
just wanted to give you a summary of my
experience attending Pike on some of the
main takeaways and you know just to give
you an idea of what it is like to attend
a Pike on why you should think about
attending Pike on next year if you can
or going to a local Python conference
and just to give you an idea of you know
what it would be like to attend Pike on
so you can get get a sense for whether
or not I would make sense for you to to
attend in the future so I'm also moving
right now so it was a pretty crazy
couple of days and weeks for my wife and
I because we left the old place went to
Pike on now we're trying to get settled
in a new place so it's been just pretty
stressful and pretty crazy but also very
exciting so anyway so back to Pike on
and this Pike on was awesome so it was
for me was a huge shift to the previous
Pike ons that I attended or like really
the previous conferences that I attended
because previously like this was the
first Pike on for me where I had my own
agenda so previously it was always an
employer that was paying for me to go to
Pike on and they had expectations on you
know what they wanted to get out of it
because it's expensive to send someone
to a conference so he's usually about
you know making new connections that
would benefit the company or you know
help us solve some problem that we were
facing at work or it was about bringing
back as much knowledge as possible like
basically I did a lot of like just going
to talks trying to soak up as much
information as possible taking notes
like crazy and then coming back and you
know sharing summaries putting on talks
at the company that I worked at and just
sharing that knowledge and information
among my team and other teams and the
whole engineering department there and
that was really nice it was really
exciting but since I went independent
this was the first time that I went to a
conference or that I went to a big
conference like PyCon where
I have my own agenda which was awesome
but it of course was also a little bit
scary because well if you have no one
who sort of tells you what to do it then
it's you need to make your own
priorities and you need to make your own
decisions and I love that freedom but
them you know freedom also has has a bit
of a cost to it and so for me my agenda
I guess was to just make as many friends
as possible
you know just walk around try and chat
with as many people as possible
and it was much more about the
relationships and then it was about
going to talks and trying to bring back
that information so with the talks at a
conference like PyCon they're usually
all recorded so at PyCon they're always
recorded they even put subtitles and
it's great and you can find all these
talks on a website called pi video org
which is this giant archive or
repository of these conference
recordings that have to do with Python
and so there were a couple of talks that
I really wanted to see and unfortunately
couldn't get in so one of my personal
Python heroes héroes is raymond head
injure and his talks are just fantastic
so he's a core Python developer and I
really wanted to attend his talk and
unfortunately for for fire safety
reasons they have to close doors and
couldn't let anyone else in because
people are already sitting on the floor
and everything and of course I also
attended the the keynotes and that that
was all fun but we I spent the majority
of my time I spent in what is called the
hallway track so people refer to the
hallway track as there's the informal
conversations and informal like
knowledge sharing that goes on when
you're not going to a a pre-planned
session that's on the schedule but you
just go and you know hang out with
people in the hallway and chat with them
learn what they're up to you know
exchange contact information with them
and it basically make friends like
you're just out there talking to people
and and and making new friends and
trying to see what their what's there
with how you could help them maybe if
they can help you answer a question and
so I spend a lot of time just doing that
you know hanging out at PyCon trying to
chat with as many people as possible
and I was there with some co-workers of
mine their previous co-workers of mine
we're all sure and sharing this Airbnb
relatively close to the conference venue
so that was a great set up just for you
know strolling around and meeting people
and I would say that work very well so
long story short
sometimes it doesn't make sense to
attend the actual technical talks
because sure like you might be able to
ask a question right you can go up and
you can ask a public question they have
microphones at the end of the talk or
you have maybe a better chance to catch
the speaker right after and ask them a
question on their talk but realistically
you can always watch these talks at home
you know in the comfort of your own home
you can take notes you can post them and
just watch the recordings and this is
what I'm going to do I mean it sure it's
not the same like maybe a little bit
less energy that way but but really um
it's a pretty good experience and for
the technical stuff I think that's the
way to do it because you only like for
me you know there's only ever so a few
times where I'm like at a conference
venue with three like thirty five
hundred other other Python enthusiasm
people who love Python and for me the
values just trying to go out and like
meet as many people as possible and so
so that was a huge shift for me
attending this PyCon and and it was
great you know I met some people that
I've been looking up to for so long like
for example I I was able to meet Kenneth
reach the creator of the request library
and he's a great guy and he's a you know
I remember like when I released my first
open-source project I was like damn like
this guy's just often he's so productive
and creating so much valuable work and
it's you know he's putting himself out
there and he's just just churns out this
work and it's really good work and so I
was always really inspired by that it
was great to be able to finally meet him
and now we're actually working together
on a little project called pp8 org and
I've got another video on that if you
want to check it out
so so that was great also I was finally
able to meet my friend Michael Kennedy
of the talk Python podcast for the first
time in person and that was that was
also great it's just it's just so much
fun when you can finally you know put a
face to someone that he's been chatting
with for so long or that he's kind of
known virtually for so long so that was
awesome it's also able to meet Brian
Hawkins
off the Python bites and Python testing
podcast and Tobias may see if the
podcast in it podcast and it was just
it's just awesome to be part of that
community and just you know to meet a
whole bunch of people who are doing so
much great work for for Python and the
Python community so for me like it
really shifted from attending these
technical talks towards trying to meet
people who do entrance interesting stuff
in the community and I think now looking
back I think there's a time for
everything right like I remember the
first couple of conferences that I went
to when I was less experienced as a
programmer I just got so much value out
of attending the technical talks and
plus back then usually the they weren't
really the video recordings if there
were video recordings that were and what
directly accessible so there was a lot
of value for me to go to the technical
talks and take notes and just soak up
that information but I noticed that over
time if that was you know that learning
effect it was kind of diminishing was
petering out and now I feel like the
value for me and quite frankly also the
value for me building a sustainable
business in the Python space and on
sustainable training business in the
Python space
the value for me there is much more in
making those relationships and going out
and chatting with people and another so
forget another great experience that I
had there was I'm running this forum
called pythonista cafe which is a
peer-to-peer learning community for
people want to get better at python in
so for example if you're maybe you're
working from home like I am or maybe
you're you're working with a remote team
and or you're the only Python developer
at your place of work and you don't
really have a lot of you know a lot of
opportunity to talk about Python and the
problems that you're facing or talking
about programming in general with the
people around you or ask your career
questions or job hunting questions and
so pythonista cafe
the idea is to kind of provide this
community to provide it remotely and we
have this yeah like bus link bustling
community off about 85 Python developers
now in this private forum and we help
each other out we entries answer each
other's questions and we try and just
you know push our learning forward
together and it's been if they're pretty
awesome and so actually a couple of
people there that are part of this forum
they also went to PyCon and we have our
own like little mini meet up there and
that was just a surreal experience like
actually you know chatting with these
guys on on this forum before that and
then just sitting down at PyCon and
having coffee together what was pretty
cool and it's just yeah it was honestly
was just incredible ike it's really
really hard warming for me was like yeah
that is so cool like we just started
this and now we're sitting here and
we're chatting about python and it it
yeah it just really made me realize like
how powerful you know this sounds really
stupid I probably look like like an
idiot you know smiling into the camera
and be like just awestruck by oh you
know we chatted on the forum then we met
and had coffee together at PyCon I know
it's it's probably little bit ridiculous
but like honestly like thinking back
about it like this is really how I felt
and I got a lot of joy out of that it
made me realize like just how powerful
the internet is for these things right
oh it's like yeah this is people from
all over the world and how we got
together and sat in this room
Portland and we were just chatting about
stuff that before that we're just
writing about for for a couple of weeks
and now we're just sitting there so so
that was great anyway the other thing
that was really nice and I think I'm
going to take more advantage of that in
in a future or like hopefully if I can
attend next year's PyCon and the ones
after that so what was Pike on have
these open spaces and the idea of an
open space is that there's a giant
schedule that stands somewhere near the
registration desks
and there's these note cards and tents
and what you can do is you can just find
an open slot there on the schedule or
open spot on the schedule and you just
take one of these note cards and you
write down what you want to talk about
and you put that on the schedule and
that assigns you a room for you know for
this topic and that means other people
can see that there's a conversation
going on for example me and some other
people we put on a conversation around
marketing for developers which you know
can be a little bit of a loaded topic
and another one was Python training a
Python trainers get together or
something
so we just pasted it out there and then
people can just come and sit down in the
room and you kind of know they're all
interested in the same the same topic
and you just chat so there's no there's
no pre-planned like there's no
presentation or I mean there isn't even
no like a whiteboard or a projector or
anything so it's like it's all about
like sitting down and just talking about
stuff and I I went to a couple of those
sessions and I think next year I want to
try and go to many many more because it
was it was again a great way to make a
personal connection just to meet some
people in person and to put some faces
to people that you've maybe only seen on
Twitter or online so so in summary you
know to kind of reel all of this back in
in summary the biggest or what I like
the best about attending Python this
year was yeah building all of these new
relationships and and just meeting
people and hanging out rather than going
to all of the technical talks and
there's so many ways you can do it and
also Portland is a beautiful city so
yeah I recommend it if you have the
chance to attend a PyCon in the future
or any other conference for that matter
I think Python conference honestly are
some of the best tech conferences you
can attend just because the community is
so great and so friendly and it puts a
lot of focus on diversity and kind of
fixing some of the problems that really
bug the tech community at large and and
you
can see that everywhere right yeah you
can see that in the speaker lineup you
can see that in the just in the general
the organization in the in the keynotes
and it's just a common thing that's just
seeping through the whole event and and
and that's great like honestly I just
have such a great time attending pike on
this year and it's it's just one of my
one of my favorite conferences so if you
get the chance to go go and if you see
me then tap me on the shoulder and we
can grab coffee or chap cool well I hope
you got something out of this video it's
definitely a lot of fun for me to be
able to ramble on about Python in Python
and if you want to see more videos like
that in Python tutorials and some other
like hands-on Python teaching then hit
the subscribe button in the lower-right
in this video and I'll I'll chat with
you in the future all right talk soon
and happy pricing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
