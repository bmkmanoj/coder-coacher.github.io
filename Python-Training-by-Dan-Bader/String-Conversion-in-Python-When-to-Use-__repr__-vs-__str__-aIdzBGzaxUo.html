another Python tricks video so today I
want to talk about how you can control
how a Python class is represented as a
string and also when you interact with
it or inspected in a Python interpreter
session so let's start with a really
simple example here so I've got my
popular card class and we're just going
to create a simple car object here and
what you can see is that when I print
this car object we kind of get this
unsatisfying result and it's the same
when I just inspect the object in this
interpreter session so you can see here
well at least it gives us the class name
kind of the whole namespace of this
thing but it you know only gives us the
memory address if we run C Python you
know just gives us this ID and it's it's
kind of opaque and kind of hard to
understand what's going on so this is
better than nothing but it's not super
useful and now there's a common
workaround that I see some people apply
for example they start printing out the
class attributes directly and sure that
works you know you can do that so we can
kind of pry that class apart and kind of
reach in and take out the the color and
the the mileage here that works and then
what I see some people do is they would
kind of go ahead and do their own two
string method right and then that would
return or maybe like print directly or
return return a string we're presenting
the class but actually there is a
convention inside Python that that
handles all of that so you don't have to
roll your own you don't have to come up
with your own ways to do that because
there's actually pre-existing
conventions on how to do that so I want
to explain to you how that works and
basically what you're going to learn
today is how the dunder stir and dunder
wrapper methods work in Python this is
gonna be a highly useful thing this is
some a common interview question
so you know watching this tutorial could
literally pay you money in the future so
you know stay tuned if you don't know
how this stuff works okay so to kind of
ease into this with a simple example I
took the same car class and I added a
dunder stir method here so the dunder
methods or methods that start with a
double underscore just kind of been
shortened to dunder some people refer to
them as magic methods a lot of people
don't like that because they're not
really supposed to be magical in any way
they're just supposed to be while a
Python convention and the kind of the
dunder or the double underscore marks
them as a core Python thing so kind of
classes are not supposed to actually
define their own dunder methods because
they can could conflict with Python
features in the future and so this is
just a way I guess to kind of sum
namespace these things a little bit or
you know just by a naming convention
kind of keeping them separate a little
bit just like the dunder init method but
you know total sidetrack here so what
I've done here is I added a dunder stir
method and basically what I did here
whenever that method is called it just
returns the color of the car and kind of
tells us it's a car so you know just to
show you an example here again I'm gonna
create the same car and now when I print
this car I actually get a completely
different result right so this time I
get a red car which is the result of
this dunder stir method instead of this
crazy string with the object address in
memory however when I just inspect this
object I still get the memory address
and the previous result right so
inspecting the car object still gives
the same result but when I printed the
car object I got this different result
based on the stir method the the way you
would actually convert an object to
string if you if you wanted to force
that or make that happen you would just
use the built in stir method and then
that is internally going to do the right
thing and call the dunder stir method
and it's gonna give you back the right
result and now all of these functions
that deal with text representations for
objects like the print function they are
going to do that internally right
they're gonna do the they're gonna call
the stir function for you and it would
be the same with a format string for
example so if you do this and this would
also call stir and just give you the
result but kind of the key thing is here
that by convention if you add a stir
method then it's gonna do a lot of good
for you in controlling how your object
is represented with or represented as a
string so it's the pythonic way to do
this which is kind of the holy grail
right now still what you're seeing here
was that when I inspected the my car
object in the console I still got the
same result so there seems to be
different ways to convert your objects
into strings and now the first one we
just learned about it's called dunder
stir and now the second one is called
dunder wrapper and let's talk about what
dunder repre does and how it's different
to dunder stir in order to understand
what's going on here I defined this
class or you can kind of redefine my car
class and what this new version of the
car class does it actually has a repper
and a stir implementation and now those
implementations are just dummy
implementations they're gonna tell us
what's going on behind the scenes so if
something calls wrapper behind the
scenes we're gonna get rapper rapper for
car as a result and if something calls
stir wouldn't get stir for car as a
result right so now we can kind of walk
through the same example again and do a
print my car you can see here okay
called the stir function we could also
go through the format example again you
can see it called me stir function and
now if we do my car and just inspect
that we can see here that is actually
called wrapper for the car and another
way to to force this is to call the
built-in wrapper function and then
that's gonna do the right thing and call
the
the correct dunder repper implementation
for this usually you just want to use
the stir and wrapper helpers for that
now of course the big question is okay
so now we have these two what's what's
actually the difference between them or
what's a different use cases where where
you would use them all right so we have
stir and we have repper and they're both
called by some convention but you know
what's what's actually the difference
like what shouldn't they return the same
thing or how we're gonna deal with this
and the answer that I've got for you is
let's look at what some of the Python
built in class or some of the classes
from the Python standard library are
doing here so what I'm gonna do here is
I'm going to import the the date/time
module and then we're just gonna create
a new date object right so I just
created a new date/time dot date object
and then we're gonna try and experiment
with that so we can see how it reacts
right how does its stir and Ripper
function react and what result do we get
from it so let's call stir on that date
object and you can see here we get a
pretty concise representation it's quite
readable looks like an ISO date format
which is kind of standard representation
for a date in string form and okay now
we call wrapper on the same object
instance it actually looks quite
different because now we get a more
elaborate result that is really
unambiguous right so this is not any
kind of date but we know exactly it's a
date time dot date object and it was
created in this way and we could even
copy and paste this and execute that as
valid Python it would recreate the same
object right like I said earlier when
you call like when you just inspect an
object and an interpreter that also
gives you the wrapper
this gives us a pretty good idea of the
difference between stir and repper so
when you actually go to the Python
documentation do some reading on the
best practices that people have come up
with in the community then you'll learn
that the dunder stir method it's mainly
used for giving an easy-to-read
representation of your class right so
stir should be easy to read and it's
meant for human consumption right so you
can see that here it says III so date
you could just you know you could
display that to a user and it wouldn't
be too bad now with a wrapper on the
other hand it should be unambiguous
right so did I've typed that correctly
yeah so with Reppert on the other hand
it should be unambiguous so the goal
here really is to be as explicit as
possible about what this object is and
it's I guess more meant for internal
internal use and something that would
make things easier to debug for a
developer but you wouldn't necessarily
want to display that to a user right and
so some people actually recommend that
the result of your repper should be
something like this that that would
actually be valid Python and that you
could just run again it would recreate
the same object now I find that
personally I find that this is a really
good idea but it's usually really hard
to attain that in practice so I think
the bottom line is that you want your
repartee be unambiguous and more meant
for developers but the stir you want
that to be easy to read and potentially
for human consumption so now another
interesting or there are a couple more
interesting things that I want to talk
about here because they really you know
they really make this whole thing a
little bit easier to understand how it
works in a real world so the next
example I want to show you is an actual
implementation that someone might take
for for their class and because python
falls back to calling wrapper if you
don't define in a separate stir
implementation my recommendation is
actually
put a dunder wrapper on any class that
you define because then you get a pretty
helpful and readable result in all cases
and now what I'm gonna do is also give
you a complete example of how you would
do that because there there's some a
slight trick you can apply to make this
a little bit easier to work with so
again we've got my car class here and
I'm defining the wrapper and so how I
would go about doing this is well
returning a string that you know
contains the car class name and then I
probably do this color and self right
and then that's a format string and in
it which is past the self object now the
common thing that I see here is that
usually you have to retype the name of
the class inside the wrapper but there's
actually a way to get around that
because we can just reach in to the
class itself and ask it for its name so
what you can do here instead is you can
use self self dot class dot or dot
dunder class dot dunder name this is
getting kind of long so you want to make
sure you format that in a way that's
sensible but basically what this is
going to do it's gonna automatically use
the right name for the class so you
don't have to make sure you update this
right so you might not want that in some
cases maybe you want the wrapper class
name to be static but usually this is
this is like a good default
implementation for your reppers and now
when I create a new my car object and I
inspected I get a really nice result and
also when I call stir on it or when I
print the car I get the same result
because the default implementation
forrester just calls wrapper internally
okay so this is kind of the minimum
implementation I would recommend to you
where you're adding a Reppert to any
class that you define kind of leave the
distr on the side and you would
use something like this so you don't
have to type the class name again okay
so before we wrap this up there's one
more thing I wanted to mention and that
is how containers convert their child
objects or the objects they contain to
string and the maybe the surprising
thing is that even if you call stir on a
container so I'm creating this list
object here even if you call stir on a
container it's going to represent the
internal objects with the reparation so
when I you know I'm using the 2-day
object which is just a date/time object
or date/time dot date object so when I
have this list here of these three date
objects and then I call stir on it I
actually get a string back that has the
container and with the wrapper inside so
this is just something to keep in mind
how that works so if you wanted to kind
of convert those with the stir function
individually you just need a loop or
some some kind of list comprehension to
do that manually but you know that's
just a side note I think really the
bottom line or the one takeaway from
this thing here is at least add a dunder
wrapper to your classes all right so I
hope you learned something new today and
you're gonna be able to apply that in a
real-world program or in some code that
you write cool well happy Python Inc and
I'll talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
