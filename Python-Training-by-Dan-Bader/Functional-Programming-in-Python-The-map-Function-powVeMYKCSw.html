the third part of my functional
programming primitives in Python series
so in the previous two tutorials
I gave you an intro to functional
programming in Python what is a
functional programming all about how can
you represent data structures in in
Python so that they're well suited for
functional programming how can you
define immutable data structures in an
in a previous tutorial we talked about
the filter function and how you can use
it to filter down iterables or lists of
items to you know to a smaller output
list based on some arbitrary criteria
some all very interesting stuff for
nerds like myself and hopefully yourself
so in this video I'm gonna introduce you
to the map function in Python so again
that's another built-in function that's
available in Python you can just go map
I'm on Python 3 here python 2 some of
the stuff might be slightly different
you're usually gonna get a list object a
list object back instead of a an
iterable or an iterator so this may be
something you'll have to adjust for but
it shouldn't be showing me too hard so
let's take a look at the doc string here
so the map function returns an iterator
that computes the function we pass in
this bit here func using arguments from
each of the iterables so basically we're
passing in an iterable like a list of
something and in map is gonna apply our
function and on each item in this list
and it's gonna create an output stream
or an output iterator of items that are
the results of this function func called
on one of the items and we're stopping
once once we're done here and actually
you can I think you can pass like a
number of iterables here and it will all
kind of be chained together we're not
gonna be doing that in this tutorial so
okay so I know how this stuff sounds
super confusing right the first time I
read this I was like ok I have no idea
what this will be good for
and when I would ever use this and yeah
I know make me feel pretty stupid so
what I'm gonna do next is I'm gonna try
and make sure you get some real examples
of how how this would work house would
be useful so I just wanted to show you
this this dataset that we used in
previous installments of this series so
we have this data set of scientists
these are all named tuple objects so
that they're immutable and also the
whole thing is actually stored inside a
tuple so that the whole structure is
immutable so that's why I didn't use a
plain list for example and by immutable
it just means you know we can't reach in
and modify these objects if we wanted to
modify one we have to make a copy and
that way we can trace these changes and
we can make sure that this list is
always going to be the same so
immutability is kind of not having these
side effects it's kind of a big big part
of functional programming yeah this is
the data set we're working with and what
we're gonna do now is we're gonna use
the map function to do some interesting
stuff with it so typically you want to
use the map function if you want to take
and something like this like this list
here and you want to transform it into a
different list so basically all it does
it you know takes a list of stuff
applies a function to each item and then
assembles a new list based on that so
what we can do here I thought you know
it's always a little bit hard to come up
with good examples but what I thought
would be fun to do here if we would
actually take this list here and we
would assemble a new list that contained
the names and ages of these scientists
so you know we're gonna ignore most of
this these fields here and we're gonna
focus on the name and then some
calculated property that's that's based
on the the born field and the birth date
and I thought a good way to do this
would be to use the map function so here
again
we're gonna use the tuple function first
to convert the output of the map
function into a tuple and I'm going to
show you what it looks like without the
tuple call but just so you get a proper
proper output that's actually more
interesting and then what we're gonna do
we're gonna define this function that we
want to map so here I'll do it with the
lambda which is just a one-line function
in Python that takes has a single so it
can take arguments and then it can it
has a single expression here and it will
just automatically return the the result
of that expression if you're wondering
how lambdas work what they're good for
I have a written tutorial on them on my
website at debater org
and I'm also going to put a link in the
description so you can check that out
alright so what we're gonna do here so
in this case I'm just gonna define a
dictionary object for lack of a better
idea and we're gonna plug in the name
and we're also gonna create this new
field here called age and then I'll just
calculate the age based on the birthdate
of the person and that way we've defined
our function that gets mapped across all
these items and then we just need to
make sure our braces here or parentheses
are balanced so okay so before I run
this let's take a look at this from from
like a high level perspective so we're
defining this thing here names and ages
and that's gonna be a the result of
mapping this function here over the list
of scientists so this is gonna create a
new tuple actually so we can sort treat
this like a list it's going to create a
new collection or ordered collection
that's based on the scientists each
scientist it's gonna create a new
dictionary here that holds all of these
calculated properties so okay I'm just
gonna show you what this looks like I'm
getting tired here it's pretty late for
me I just want to record this video to
get it out for you and
and this is what I'm doing right nothing
happened because we need to print this
out and actually this looks pretty ugly
so let's pretty print it okay so what
you can see here and I'm hoping you're
starting to get the idea this took the
initial list and it transformed it into
a new list that was generated by mapping
a function onto each of the original
items so now you know this new list here
we don't have all of the information we
had previously now we have a name and
what we have the name and we have to H
there's one downside to doing it this
way because I you know just defined the
fine dictionary here so this again is
like immutable this is a mutable data
structure because we can reach in and
modify this dictionary object so if you
wanted to do this better you would
probably want to define a new name tuple
object but I kind of wanted to do it in
one you know one expression here and so
this really took the initial list and
transformed it into this new list
without destroying the original list
right and it's kind of beautiful and
which again shows you the power of
functional programming because you know
we have this this well this little map
function call here and it it did all of
this in one go and it was very
declarative we didn't have to you know
spell out the loop like oh you know for
each X in scientists do this and add it
to a list I can all do it in one go
which is which is kind of neat now of
course you might be thinking you know
what this looks kind of not anything
like the usual Python code that I see or
that I would like to write and I totally
get that back honestly I would probably
not recommend that you write code that
looks like this because it gets
confusing it's very hard for people who
are new to Python to understand what's
going on and it's kind of a different
mindset that you're in when you're
writing stuff like that so actually what
you would probably do to make this more
pythonic is you would define a list
comprehension so something like this
you know again I'm going to define the
same fields here X dot name and then I'm
gonna add this computed property called
age X unborn and then I would just do
this for any X in scientists all right
there you have it so that's our list
comprehension so you would do the same
thing typically what you would do it
with a list comprehension because that
just kind of gives you a more pythonic
syntax and and now this isn't equivalent
yet so we need to make some some small
changes here so first of all I would
probably do this if you know if I wanted
to make it as close to the map call I
would do this with a a generator
expression that I just passed his tuple
function like this and then I came to we
were doing this in one line now and we
can pre P print it pretty print it so
this is from the P print module if you
haven't seen the first installments of
the series and we can just print it out
and this is what it looks like and get
the same result so I would rather write
something like this a generator
expression and then you know
pause post process that or something
like this then this map call that we had
up here but it's kind of personal
preference and both of them it's good to
know about these things right it's good
to know how these functional programming
principles that are available in most
other programming languages how they
correspond to the Python specifics of
having a list comprehension here or a
generator expression here in this case
right well if you're wondering you know
what what this is good for like mapping
mapping functions across across a list
of things so you know here we could we
could do all kinds of things like we
could we add all kinds of computed
Bertie's right like I could maybe
uppercase the the name and you can
transform your input data in all kinds
of ways and the nice thing is if you if
you write your code in this in this
fashion where it's functional
quote-unquote in the sense that you're
taking an input that's an immutable data
structure so something that we had up
here and you define those
transformations in a declarative way
like this or with a list comprehension
or you know we had further down and and
you do this then you have this series of
steps that are completely independent
from each other you know this what we
did down there it didn't modify this
list at all it just took this list as an
input or this tuple as an input and then
generated a new list and so you know we
could keep adding more steps to it and
they would all be reusable and there
would be no side-effects like we're not
actually reaching into this thing and
destroying this data structure modifying
it but instead we're we're creating a
new derived list or derived iterable
from the input data and that's kind of a
cool concept it makes things a lot
simpler if you're talking about parallel
computation and it's a very very
powerful concept just from a mindset
perspective not necessarily from the
perspective that you should write all of
your Python code exactly like this and
always use the style of programming that
would probably drive some people now
here you learned how to use the map
function and this is a multi-part series
where I talk about functional
programming primitives and kind of do a
quick intro to functional programming in
Python so if you enjoyed this video
probably go back and watch the other
ones if you haven't seen them yet and
I'm going to add a new part to the
series soon or we'll talk about the
reduced function so the reduced function
is another functional programming
primitive in Python just like the map
and the filter function and you're gonna
see how you can use that for for many
other interesting things
all right so thanks for listening if you
want to make sure you don't miss the
next episode and then subscribe to this
channel and you'll get get to seed right
away when it comes out
happy Python inge and i'll talk to you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
