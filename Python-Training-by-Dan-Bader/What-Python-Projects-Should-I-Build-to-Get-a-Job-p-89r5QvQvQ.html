to talk about a question that I got from
a reader so the question is what Python
projects should I build I have no idea
which ones would help me to grow to a
point where I could put them on my
resume slash github and basically get me
a job right like what Python projects
should you be working on to build up
your portfolio so that you can get a job
as a Python developer I think it's a
great question
because modern software development I
think a lot of it is about building up
almost like building up that personal
brand and getting some recognition where
when you apply to when you apply
somewhere people are going to check out
your portfolio they're going to check
out your github maybe if you have a
website which I would highly recommend
that you set something like that up you
know like a blog where you have some
programming tutorials all of that is
going to going to demonstrate to your
potential employer that you are you are
more advanced than other people you're
you know maybe more in a position of
authority and that's going to have a
huge payoff for you it's going to help
you find the job that you want so okay
so what Python projects should you build
to start growing that portfolio and also
to learn the skills that you need to
become a Python Python developer
professional Python developer so what
I'm thinking there is if you just
want something to show an employer it
might not matter as much as you think
what kinds of projects you're putting on
your github what will matter much more
is just the way they are structured and
what they look like in terms of code
quality and if whether or not they're
actually you know a little bit more
substantial programs so I've you know
I've gotten jobs and part of the in
partly due to the you know kind of the
the online resources that I created you
don't like some open source stuff that I
didn't github my website and it really
helped me earlier on in my career to
actually get started get the foot in the
door and then I've also spent you know a
long time interviewing other engineers
to build out my team where I was
reviewing resumes and looking at
people's portfolios and so I feel like I
can speak to you know what what this
stuff actually looks like behind the
scenes and what people look at what the
hiring team looks for in when they're
reviewing a resume and taking a look at
someone's portfolio so what I want to
say there is
please do a github doesn't have to be
github could be anything else you know
big buckets good lab all these are good
I would probably go with github because
it's the biggest one and seems really
stable you can get free public
repositories so personally I'm a github
kind of kind of guy when it comes to
this stuff but you know pick your own
thing the most important thing is that
it's easy to browse the code like it's
so much better if you have a public you
know github kid lab bit pocket portfolio
versus just offering people like a zip
file to download or maybe having a self
hosted git repository because the
typical hiring team they're maybe not
going to go through all of the steps
necessary to actually look at your code
they just want to see some examples
right and so what I was always looking
for and you know might me and my
teammates we were looking for in those
situations was for someone to have a
little bit of code under github it
doesn't have it didn't have to be very
many projects so you know if you have
one or two like good looking solid
projects there you don't actually need a
ton of other stuff like actually get rid
of the stuff that is not very
substantial that's maybe just you know
I'm a testing script or at least don't
feature it on your resume right like the
stuff you actually send over to to
someone else that is that should be
something where were you're proud off of
your code now another thing you should
not do is include projects that are just
you know if you went through the Django
tutorial for example I wouldn't
necessarily sent that out as you know as
like as a demo project that shows my
employer what what what I can do right
like if you build a django app or based
on the tutorial that's great but just
having that some people just you know
they go through a tutorial or they just
you know fork a repo and maybe make like
a one-line change and then have that on
it under github and that doesn't tell me
as much as the person doing the hiring
and the reviewing in fact maybe tells me
a little bit you know something negative
about that person where I'm thinking
okay why you know what are you trying to
already trying to cheat here like they
just put up this code so that maybe some
people are less technical you would
think they're a great programmer so
could that can backfire right on the
other hand you don't have to have a
super complicated project or you don't
have to have you know you don't need to
start a popular open-source project
either so if you have one that's great
obviously we know you know but most
people are not going to have that and so
it doesn't matter as much of course it's
a great asset right but it doesn't
matter as much as as you would think
because most people don't have it so
pretty much anything is good you know if
you have a little script like if you did
some like home automation stuff or
whatever like something you worked on
you know like a spreadsheet exporter
like a little game you wrote anything
like that um if it's nice and polished
like you should look for like what I
would look for typically is like okay
does this person what does their code
look like you know does does it look
quote-unquote sloppy or is it does it
follow the Python code style guidelines
you know does it follow pp8 it does it
does it have like consistent formatting
does it look like something that I would
feel comfortable reading and maintaining
if I was working with that person later
on right that's kind of the signal you
want to give off here like you want to
give you want to create this impression
that you're a very conscientious person
and that you you're getting the details
right you know that you're not only
producing something some program that
you know does stuff but that you
actually get the details right that you
document the program so something like
having a really nice and clean readme
file can also be a huge asset right were
you showing people like hey I'm not just
throwing this out there but I understand
that for other people to use my project
I need to explain to them what what to
do here right this is kind of the vibe
you want to go off that you want to give
off on your github profile because as
you're working with other people at AB
in a team at a company it is so much
better to have someone where were there
thinking about the human factors in in
software development right like they're
not just thinking about
you know I wrote the algorithm like you
know just see here like the right number
came out but it's much more about okay
well you wrote the right algorithm how
do you explain everyone else how that
works like in it does everyone else you
know are the other people on your team
able to actually use it for something
useful like did you not only solve the
problem but actually you know actually
got your problem God got your solution
to the point where people are using it
where it's actually affecting people's
lives and language actually affecting
the the company's success in a
meaningful way right and and that
includes stuff like okay does it does
your project have tests so that other
people can make changes and there's at
least some like kind of smoke test that
finds out if there's if there's like um
you know a huge braking change so that
is great like anything that shows that
you know how to write software in a more
practical and team-based setting that's
going to be a huge asset for when you're
applying for a for a job you know that
includes stuff like having automated
unit tests having that setup so that
they actually run automatically when you
make a change on that github page I'm
having a good readme for that project
you know having like just the way you're
explaining things you know are you
giving people a good idea what this
project is even about and how it could
benefit your your user then another
thing is the more popular project it's
also kind of interesting to see how the
people as maintainer x' interact with
the people who create issues and stuff
and you know are they lashing out at
people or do they get angry do they
never respond do they respond all the
time and I'm you know I'm not saying
like one is necessarily better than the
other like I get really overwhelmed
right now with some open source projects
that I have and I just don't have the
time to respond so you know I wouldn't
take this as seriously as a signal but
if you have a maintainer you know
getting like really really angry in
there in the issues on their own project
and and you know responding to people's
pull requests very rudely then that
would certainly give you a sign as the
interviewer that maybe that person is
not so so great to work with in the long
run you know
that this is this is what I'm going
going at you know you want to give off
the right vibe here and kind of create
the right impression that you're going
to be a fantastic person to work with in
terms off in terms of how much stuff do
you need you don't need a lot and in
terms of you know what Python projects
you should build also to train yourself
to get the skills you know not only to
have a portfolio but also to train
yourself to have the right skills I
think that also depend on ultimately in
what you want to do you know if you want
to be a data scientist well then do some
data analysis and write you know some
nice scripts there some nice programs
that help you with that and then put
them on github if you want to get a job
as a Python web developer well you know
then write like a basic crud app you
know create update delete app maybe
you're using Django maybe using some
other framework may be using multiple
frameworks to kind of show your
expertise in a wide range of topics and
maybe you want to have something were
you doing a Web API you know a REST API
and you're putting that stuff together
and the project project you're going to
build there they will depend on the type
off of job that you're going after you
know if you're obviously you know if
you're if you're trying to get a job as
a back-end developer versus more of a
front-end person you know the tools that
you would use would be completely
different I think what in general makes
a nice portfolio piece for anyone is if
you have one or two libraries that are
actually available on pi PI the Python
package repository you know if you can
put that together and that also shows
that you're going above and beyond the
call of duty here and and you're
creating value for the rest of the
Python community so this is always
something that's that's nice to see you
know and well I hope this gives you a
better idea of the sort of things you
should add to your portfolio the sort of
programs and projects you should build
to improve your Python skills and in
half something can put in your portfolio
and if you do all of these things then
you will have a much better chance at
you know attracting employers and
getting responses from them
it's going to put you so much above the
rest of the pack you know if you have
this stuff because most people don't
most applicants that I've seen they
don't do this they don't care about it
or they have you know just some other
project that they forked and copied over
so if you actually have some programs
that provide value that look good and
then make you look like a like a
somebody we can you could rely on or you
know somebody that would be nice to work
with that would really add a lot of
value to the team or the company then
that's the kind of signal you want to
give off all right so if you have any
more questions about this leave a
comment below and thanks for asking the
question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
