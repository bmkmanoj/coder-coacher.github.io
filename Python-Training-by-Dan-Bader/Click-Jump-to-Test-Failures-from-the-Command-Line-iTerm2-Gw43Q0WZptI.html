Python developer tip so I've got I term
to here which is the terminal emulator
that I use on my Mac and it's got a
super super handy feature that allows
you to click on any file name in the
terminal and an open at in your favorite
editor so check this out I've got a
Python project here and I'm gonna kick
off a test run with PI tests and before
I started the recording I actually broke
one of the tests and I get this
wonderful printout from PI test right
and now what I can do I can hit press
down command and then click on that file
name with the line number and what's
gonna happen is that I term actually
opens that file in my editor which in my
case is sublime text 3 and it bounces me
directly to the failed test case so did
you see that right just command click
into I term 2 and it's gonna open that
file directly on that failed assertion
based on the line number it can fix my
test and run it again so this is a super
super handy feature if you're running
Python test from the command line like I
do like it's kind of my workflow and it
took just cuts down on the time that you
need to actually find these test
failures and then fix them now the cool
thing is it doesn't just stop there so I
can just do that with any file name
right it doesn't have to be part of a
test failure so even if I just run the
LS command to list my files I can just
click on any of those files and they're
gonna be opened in the editor that I
have configured which is super super
useful it has another feature where if
you click on a folder or directory it's
actually going to open that folder in
finder so you can browse it and I use
that feature all the time it is so handy
and now I'm gonna show you how to
actually configure that so what you want
to do is you want to open the
preferences for item 2 and then click on
profiles and then go all the way to the
right to the Advanced tab from there you
want to go to
the bit that says semantic history and
you want to use these settings so I have
to set to open with editor and then I
just picked my editor of choice which in
my case is sublime text 3 so you can you
know pick any editor that's in your
Applications folder and it's just gonna
gonna work and well then you close the
Preferences and you're ready to go just
try this feature out out it's actually
really easy to setup once you find this
setting which took me I know like a year
to actually realize that I term 2 could
do this and I was really glad I found
this so I think I term 2 is actually a
really great program that I use
well basically every day in my
development workflow and I probably
gonna do more videos about that so if
you're interested in this topic you want
to learn more tips like that then either
subscribe to my channel or actually go
to debate org slash newsletter where
which is my website I have a ton of free
stuff for Python developers tutorials
and videos just like the one you just
watched
and if you want to go there then and
sign up for a newsletter and you're
never gonna miss out on another video
and I'd love to stay in touch with you
cool thanks so much for listening I hope
this was helpful have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
