debater orga reader so what techniques
do experienced Python developers use
versus inexperienced ones really
interesting questions so that's why I
wanted to tackle it in this YouTube
video so some of my thoughts here I
think there are some differences in how
an experienced developer approaches
writing code versus an inexperienced one
and a lot of it has to do with I think
with an intuition about how to tackle
the problem once you've been programming
for a while you know once you've
attacked like once you've worked on many
programming problems and you've written
and shipped real-world application you
kind of get this intuitive sense of how
you might want to tackle a specific
problem so you you surf develop these
heuristics that will help you to be more
productive than an inexperienced
developer and some of it has to do with
just being more skilled at you know
maybe pacing yourself and having better
project management management skills so
you know you know you know how to solve
the ultimate goal at hand
and you kind of know how to work towards
that and how to lay the foundation for
example what I've seen is that it's very
easy for beginners to paint themselves
into a corner you know maybe you solve
the immediate problem at hand but you do
it in a way that means you can't solve
the next two or three problems that an
experienced developer might see already
coming down the pike you you kind of
have a harder time solving those and
that's what compounds and slows you down
over time
you know I know super abstract example
but it's kind of hard to point to really
concrete things so it's more a more an
intuition and an experience thing but I
also want to point out some concrete
things that that you can actually you
know work on instead of just saying like
oh you just got to write more code so
another thing is that experienced
developers are usually better at
debugging so they have experience using
the the tools they need for for
debugging their programs or you know
maybe they're just more experienced at
again having an intuition
how to debug a program but in general I
in my experience many inexperienced
developers and new developers they
overlook the power off debugging and
building up building it up as a skill
you know because you almost want to
approach it like like scientific
research right you want to have sort of
a theory at hand and and look for it for
evidence whether or not what you're what
are you trying the problem you're trying
to solve is actually like the real
underlying issue and I found that a lot
of beginners are struggling with that
kind of mindset and if you know if
something unexpected happens then it's
it's very easy for them to get stuck and
kind of not know where where to go and
where to look for for help and how to
debug their program I think another
thing is that an experienced developer
just has strategies that that they can
use to solve most problems that they
encounter you know they either they know
who to reach out to who ask personally
for help they know how to Google for
stuff which is probably the most
important skill honestly you know they
know how to turn the problem that
they're facing how to turn it into
keywords and what to type into a search
engine in order to get an answer for the
problem that they're working on and
again that's you know that's a super
useful skill these days because that is
how most programming work is done right
you're not just sitting in a vacuum
there and you're writing everything from
scratch like no you know professional
developers Google for stuff all the time
I search for stuff they look up stuff on
Stack Overflow
maybe they ask their friends maybe
they're part of some community where
they can ask questions and you can of
course if you're working with a company
you can just always tap someone on your
shoulder and be like hey you know I know
you have a lot of experience like
working with this kind of problem can
just sit with me and we'll try and
tackle this so it's it's also matter
about knowing how to help themselves I
think let's see I can't really think
about anything anything else here but
all of these things are things that that
come with experience and
they usually not thinks you can just
teach yourself by reading a book you
know they're more like meta skills if
you will so the best way to learn is to
work with an experienced developer and
to kind of have that color off on you
alright if you have another Python
question then leave a comment below and
I'll try and tackle it in one of my next
videos if you liked this video then well
