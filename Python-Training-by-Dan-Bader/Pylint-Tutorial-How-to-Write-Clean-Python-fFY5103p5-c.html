video tutorial you're going to learn how
to use the pilant linter for python so
you might be wondering what is actually
a code linter so a code linter is a
program that inspects your Python code
and essentially it gives you feedback on
your Python code
so the linter will inspect for example
this file over here so I've got some
example file that is kind of iffy it's
not great Python code or some formatting
issues some common issues are in there
for example I'm not using some of the
variables I'm declaring here and it's it
could be improved you know let's just
keep it at that and so a linter is a
program that can identify these issues
and tell you how to resolve them in in a
fully automated way
so it's essentially it's almost like a
robot tutor for your Python programs and
the great thing is because a linter is a
program you can just constantly run in
the background or you can run it when
you run your automated tests or when
your team runs your automatic tests so
it's a great way to ensure a certain
minimum quality standard when it comes
to your Python code or the Python code
of your team or your whole company so
it's a really really great tool there
are a number of linters available for
python in this tutorial I'm going to
talk about pilant and show you how to
set it up and how to install it and
there are some other linters that I
would also recommend my personal
favorite is called flake eight and I've
got another video on that that will show
you how to set this up and that also
have some more background on code
linting in python and that will be
linked in the description and also on
that little info button in the upper
right so you can check that out today I
want to show you how to install pilot
pilant is a really well-known linter for
python like I said earlier soap island
has a number of very useful features
number one it can check your Python code
for compliance with the pep 8 style
guide which is a very common style guide
that's often used on Python project so I
would highly recommend that you learn
more about it and Pyland can help you
make sure that the Python code it runs
on actually follows the
debate style Thailand can also find and
tell you about certain classes of errors
that might be in your code you know
things like unused variable stuff stuff
that I mentioned before and it it has
some more like really interesting
features for example it can also
generate UML diagrams and it is very
customizable in general that's actually
I think that's one of the downsides of
Thailand or potential downsides of
Thailand that there's a huge number of
settings you can play with so it might
take you a while to find the optimum
setting but once you've got it set up
well or you just you know running with
the the default configuration which is
also a viable option then it's a regreat
tool that provides you with a lot of
helpful feedback and will help you write
better code and cleaner Python code all
right so I'm going to show you how to
set up pilot now so in this case I've
got this little example file here and it
doesn't look great right it's sort of
not very good Python code or some unused
or deserve an unused variable here the
naming is kind of off the formatting is
off and we're going to take that as an
example to see what Pyland can do with
this file and so over here I've got a
virtual environment set up because
generally I recommend that you install
any surf Python tool and use our Python
dependency into a virtual environment
and I've got a longer in-depth course on
that if you're interested but it's not
reading the scope of this tutorial so
here you can see I've got this example
file here in this directory that I'm in
right now what I'm going to do now is
I'm going to install pilant so pilant is
just a Python module essentially that
you that you install so you can install
it through hip or condor pretty much any
package manager you would want to use
and I'm just going to go ahead and
install the pilant module now which also
includes a command line tool that's
called Thailand and this will also be
set up now all right so now I've
installed it and we can just make sure
the pilot is actually installed and it's
available here we just run pylons by
itself or on its own then you're going
to get a bunch of helpful information
on how to use the program as you can see
here Thailand is pretty extensive when
it comes to its configuration so kind of
the minimal example for using Thailand
is to simply pass it a Python file and
that actually gets you very very far so
in this case I'm going to go Thailand
space example dot PI and I'm going to
run pilant on this example file alright
so this took a short moment and now we
can see all of the feedback that PI lint
has for this particular code that you
can see here on the left so in this case
it actually dug up some interesting
stuff so essentially you get several
columns here so in the first column you
can see the type of error or problem
that was identified or the type of
feedback the Pyland found in this case c
will stand for code style and then we've
got w4 warning and these different types
some of them will actually be errors
where the Python program wouldn't work
but I guess you could also find that out
in a different way and yeah here the
second column it tells you where this
problem is located now just a word off
well not read a word of warning but just
some and some tip here with these
obviously this is kind of hard to go
back and forth and identify this
feedback you know like based on the line
numbers that I printed out but there's a
way you can integrate pilant feedback
into your editor which again I also
highly recommend that you do that if you
want to do that with sublime text I've
got a whole course that shows you how to
set up a really awesome and productive
set up for sublime text that includes
pilant integration fly Cajun integration
so you might want to check that out but
basically you want the sublime linter
plugin and then the pilot plugin to get
that up and running on sublime text
alright so now back to the feedback we
got here in our code then here in the
next column you can actually see what
it's talking about
so here pilot says ok so there's a code
style piece of code style feedback in
line six which is over here and
we have we're lacking a space and that's
true right like when you check over here
it actually also prints that out with
this some kind of inline example here so
this is a bad wide space air and we're
lacking space character here and now I
fix that and when I run pylons again we
don't get that error message anymore we
don't get that warning anymore and the
other thing you can see here that at the
end pilant will always print out a score
for your code which is you know some I
guess arbitrary metric that goes from I
don't you know from you know what the
range is but I think goes up to 10 or
like 10 is perfect and like minus 10 is
the worst or bad I know you know it's
like some negative is bad and then the
higher you go the better it is and you
can see here that now it's actually a
little bit better it's still negative
but it's we're doing a little bit better
because we fixed that one issue now you
know with any of these metrics I'd be
careful because it's very hard to put a
an accurate metric on any kind of code
or program that you know that gives you
a value like valid feedback it's very
people try that all the time and I see
that you know when development teams
someone comes in like a manager comes in
they're like okay we're going to focus
on code quality now you know we have
this one metric and we want that to
always go up in and essentially what
happens is that people start optimizing
for that metric and you can still write
programs that don't actually have any
value have no business wall value
whatsoever but they have like really
great metrics so you know all this is
always to be taken with a grain of salt
but that said it's still a healthful
metric because it's like a little game
right you want to make the numbers go up
in this case so I really like using
linters because partly because of that
sort of gamification aspect I guess
because you know you always have some
number that can you can make go up and
kind of improve and make better and that
makes me feel good now you know you
always want to keep in the back of your
mind that this number is maybe not that
meaningful after all but you know still
like when you look at this here this is
all very valid and helpful feature
feedback and like obviously you know
to tell you the truth like I said this
example up so that we would get some
helpful feedback and actually have
something to do alright so now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go over
these some this pile enter for pilant
feedback here and I'm just going to fix
these issues so again we have another
code style issue here in line 12 and
then we've got a missing module doc
string here so let's just turn that into
a doc string and at any time you can
just rerun pilant right so this is
there's no harm and that's not going to
execute it programs not gonna do
anything it's just going to inspect your
code alright so invalid class name car
so I think that's also interesting
because again here what we want is an
uppercase class name for this class if
we want to follow the Pepe style guide
and that's a very good recommendation
right so now what you're going to see in
a minute or I guess in a second is that
when I run this and now we should
actually get a new problem that tells me
that car isn't defined right because now
car doesn't exist anymore like I just
renamed the class from lowercase car to
uppercase car or like it starts with an
uppercase character now and now this
code is broken and pylons are told or
pilant told me about this which which is
kind of nice
alright so now the code is actually
terrible right like now our score is
really bad because we have I guess we
have some critical error in here that
means the program wouldn't actually run
so we have like a real error here it's
not a warning it's a relay err right so
let's run this again okay missing class
box train all right I'm just going to
put a terrible doc string here example
class right it's not a real good talks
talk string okay now now we're getting
into some territory so here let me
refresh this we're getting into into
some territory where this is very sort
of subjective feedback right so now it's
telling us that hey this class doesn't
doesn't have enough public methods
and and I mean that's true but then
we're sort of you know this might still
make sense given the context of the
program so Thailand is very opinionated
in that sense and it's going to tell you
it's going to point out some things that
you might disagree with and that's where
it's important to look into how to
suppress some of these so that you can
kind of tweak it and tune it to your
liking right if you're doing this
intentionally then you might not want to
see that error and to a certain degree
that's why I prefer flake 8 because
flake 8 is only pointing out code style
issues and things that are just not a
good idea to do right it's not going to
tell you hey you didn't define enough
public methods on on a class but it's
going to it's going to tell you that you
know you made a formatting mistake or
you you're doing something that is not
recommended like for example comparing
to two to none with the double equals
operator versus the is operator and
stuff like that right so it's going to
point out these things that are that
should just be changed in Pilon does
that too but it also adds stuff like
this sort of subjective code feedback
and you know it might be a good thing
might be a bad thing like actually I
think for someone who's just starting
out to write Python or they want to get
better at their Python it can be a very
helpful thing so I actually used pilant
a lot in the past and in all since the
last couple of years I switched over to
flight eight for dad pretty much that
reason so you can always run both to
write that's always a possibility anyway
so let's fix some of the remaining stuff
here okay I've got invalid constant my
car okay because we're not using that
for anything right because oh wait we
are okay so this is actually so this in
this case because this is like a
top-level constant we would want this to
be uppercase which again you know this
is something you you might disagree with
but let's just fix all of the things
that pilant pointed out here
missing function dog string an example
function that so now this is telling us
about a missing or unused argument in
this function definition here you know
as you can see here we defined car two
but we're never really using it in the
function and again this might be
intentional or this might not be
intentional and this is a good example
to show you how we can suppress these
errors in pilant as well alright so what
you can do in this case is you can add a
hint for pilant and that usually takes
the form of a Python Python comment so
in this case you could go pile int colon
and then you can go disable equals and
then you want to put the error message
or the error type that we saw here so in
this case it will be unused argument so
I want to suppress that and I'm going to
zoom out for a minute so you can see
what this looks like so that's that's
the hint for the PI Pyland executable so
now I'm going to lint this code again it
it ignored this error and actually here
we're going to ignore this other error
as well right and we're going to put
that on the whole class disabled equals
boom and now okay we did great right we
suppress a bunch of errors and now our
code is perfect this is perfect Python
code and I mean that's obviously like
not how this works and you can you may
or may not like how these pilant hints
or annotations how they're cluttering up
your code so the utter route you can go
you can create a pile int our C file
that stores some of these settings per
project or even globally and that makes
it a lot easier to manage them you can
add that to your source repository for a
project and that way you can control how
pilant
checks your code in the feedback and
give
but you know in summary this is how you
use pilant you just pip install it and
you can fire away it's a command-line
tool so that means you can run it on
your tests it can run it as part of a
build script or you know if you can run
that in any way you like and it is it is
a great tool it's going to give you a
lot of valuable feedback on your Python
code there are other tools just like it
in general these tools are called static
analysis tools and I would highly
recommend that you start learning about
these tools and start using these tools
because they can give you a lot of
valuable feedback on your Python code
actually I just noticed something so
here I'm not sure why this wasn't called
out but you see that I had some extra
spaces here and so I'm not sure why
Pilon didn't call that out because it
looked kinda looked like would actually
violate the coding guidelines here the
code style guidelines so anyway you know
that I guess that's also an example that
shows you that these tools are not
perfect right that's what I mean like
now we've got supposedly perfect code
quality but of course I've got to take
that with a grain of salt because I mean
it's not like this is actually a useless
program right so this doesn't really do
anything interesting so just wanted to
mention that again right because very
easy to kind of go that route where it's
like oh yeah we just need to make all
the metrics go up and then we'll write
the perfect programs will be that much
more productive generally that's not
true nevertheless please use these tools
like I'm you can see this but right now
I'm doing the double thumbs up here in
front of my computer as I'm recording
this because they are great try and
integrate them into your editing
environment you know whether you're
using pycharm or sublime or adam or vim
or Emacs they all have tools and plugins
that allow you to get this feedback
straight in your editor and it is very
very useful it's very very helpful I've
disabled that for this this video here
in my editor because I wanted to show
you kind of the bare-bones kind of
manual approach with the command line
but in general I would encourage you to
actually pull that feedback into your
IDE or your Python editor all right well
I hope this was useful so happy pining
and I'll talk to you soon if you
