Python tip for you so today I want to
talk about how you can make your code
more readable using custom exceptions so
to give you an example when you might
want to do that let's say we have a
simple function here we're going to call
it validate and we're going to pass it a
name which is just a simple string
variable and that function is going to
do a simple check on name just to see if
if it's less than 10 characters long
right and if it's less than 10
characters long we want to reject that
name because we're just going to say hey
you know what it's not a valid name so
one way to communicate that to someone
who might be calling that function you
know one of your co-workers maybe you're
going to call that function yourself
somewhere in the code I mean highly
likely considering up we're writing the
function um what's the best way to
communicate that right sure we could
just return none it's kind of easy to
miss and just ignore that so typically
what you do is you'd raise an exception
um and we would probably pick something
like pythons built-in value error right
and so what would happen now is that
when we take this function and we call
it on a name that's less than 10
characters wrong long we get a value
error so let's take a look at what that
looks like so let's define validate here
and we're just going to call validate on
a three character name here and we get
the value error right that's sort of the
error report that we would get in in a
trace back when our program crashes
that's okay you could probably use that
to trace it back to the line you were
working in you could kind of figure out
why you got that value error maybe a way
to to make that a little bit more clear
and just to communicate the intent a
little better would be to say okay we're
going to do a value error and we're
going to tell you that the name is too
short so if you do that what happens is
um that you get a little bit of more
context right we're going to tell you
hey the name is too short so the
downside of that is programmatically it
becomes really difficult to distinguish
between you know a name to short kind of
value error and just any other old value
error so that's not great but there's a
really good way to fix this
that I'm going to show you now so what
you would do in this case is you would
create a new subclass off value error
and we're going to call that name too
short error and that's going to be based
on the original value error and because
we're not you know we're not even trying
to add more stuff to value error we're
not going to add extra behaviors or
property so we're just going to say pass
here to leave the class alone but what
we've done now we've created a new type
that we can now actually use in our code
here and what's cool about this now is
that when we when someone runs this code
and they actually trigger the condition
a traces the value error they will get a
name too short error right we get that
initial console because I'm running this
in inside the Python 3 interpreter here
but it gives someone who hits that error
a bit more context um and tells them the
the original programmers intent right
you're going to be able to quickly
figure out oh ok you know this is being
triggered because the name was too short
and we can make this a little nicer
still so what I like to do in in a
situation like this is to actually pass
the value that cost the error to my
custom exception type right so in this
case we obviously pass name and then
when we run this in the Python ripple
you will see that the error report is
kind of nice at this point
because you know if this blows up this
is what you would see eventually in your
in your trace back when you get the the
the exception printed out at some point
and you would see something like that
name too short error Joe and that was
cost in validate so at this point it
would be really easy for someone else or
maybe your your future self to identify
what went wrong here and you're probably
going to save yourself more time then
the time it you know then the time it
took you to to go and define that custom
exception type so as with all things you
know it's not something you should
overdo but it can be extremely helpful
especially if you're defining a public
API for for let's say a module that you
want to share with other people that
sort of stuff is going to save you tons
of time and it's just going to make you
a lot more productive as a developer
cool I hope this helped you out take
care and write more Python</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
