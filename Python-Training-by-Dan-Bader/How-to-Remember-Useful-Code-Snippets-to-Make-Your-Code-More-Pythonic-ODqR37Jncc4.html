YouTube just gonna read out the
questions so if I discover more a more
useful pythonic way of doing something
for example from your book the book is
called Python tricks be sure to check it
out it's available on Amazon but it
doesn't make sense to use it in any of
my current projects to practice how can
I remember to use it in the future when
it is relevant I have FOMO fear of
missing out for that sort of thing so I
thought that was a really really
interesting question so I want to
discuss it in this video now what I
would encourage you to do because this
is you know it's an understandable sort
of fear that you're seeing something
cool and you want to remember to
actually use it what I would encourage
you to do is to have some sort of
journal some application I don't think
it makes sense for this to be
paper-based so I I would do that in in
some kind of app that you can just add
notes and make them searchable I
actually blogged about this in the past
I'm just the system that I use and maybe
I'll do a video on that in the future
just kind of run people through it um
there are a couple of options that are
really great for software developers and
the the tool that I used in the past
actually just switch to something else
but what I use the password he enjoyed
was called is called quiver
it's a note-taking app for developers
and you can do cool things you can add
like little I believe you can do UML
diagrams then you can just add code
snippets and it's kind of all kind of in
there and I I think that is a great
choice for for keeping your thoughts
around I actually well now a while ago I
switched to just an app called simple
note and I use that to synchronize my
notes across all of my devices you know
I have a have them on my phone I have it
on my iPad I have it on all of my
computers and that way I can always
access these notes and I can just drop
in a new note and at least at the time
quiver didn't do that and I really
wanted that functionality because I
often you know I go for a walk or I sit
down in the morning and I just want to
add a quick note and I don't want to
necessarily like have to walk up to my
computer to do that I just want to you
know pull out my phone and do it there
so
I'm using Simplenote now it's a free app
you could just go with your phone snow
taking app to be honest doesn't really
make a big difference if you want to go
nuts with this process it probably also
starts some kind of personal wiki you
know just spin up some wiki wiki system
on on on a web server and could also use
that and build a system that you can
access from anywhere in the world maybe
the user experience won't be that great
compared to like a native app on your
phone for example and what I would do
with that is just at these little
snippets you know everything every time
you find something cool just take a
little note like maybe copy and paste
some of that code and just put it in
there and make it add some keywords just
make it searchable you know add some
some things that will allow you to fight
this again so if this is about like
writing more pythonic code whatever your
personal definition of that is then you
will be able to search for that and find
it again so I would definitely encourage
you to do this journaling you know it's
it's not but maybe journaling is
actually it's not the right word for
that kind of system it's more like
filing these little things and building
up sort of a library of these little
snippets and little you know hints that
that you can use when you're working on
a problem and I've absolutely benefited
from that you know it's a lot of times
it's like my personal version of Stack
Overflow and I just punched something in
and and I'm like oh yeah I did that in
the past and that way I can find it
again another really cool option that
you could do here is why not start a
blog and actually you know share the
things that you found like why not talk
about this in public because that has a
number of benefits hey you're gonna
write down the stuff you're gonna find
it again and be it's also gonna be you
know it's the office is coming back is
gonna be coming back to you it because
you're building up a public portfolio
and you're kind of showing the world
that that you're a great programmer
because you're sharing your knowledge
and you're sharing that the things that
you learned and you know it's just it's
just a way for for you to to show that
expertise and that you care about your
craft because many people just don't so
this will put you on top of
off the pile in a lot of cases right
just make you stick out so I know if you
feel comfortable with that I don't do it
I sort of you know take the best stuff I
learn and then turn that into articles
and blog posts but I don't like just you
know take notes publicly in that sense
maybe I should I don't know but that's
definitely not another thing and you
could you could do let's see here um and
yeah I think that that's covered my
system or the system that I use so yeah
definitely use some kind of app throwing
notes in there and then that way you can
find them again so yeah let me know how
that goes you know leave a comment if
you if you see that if you watch this
video and I'd be curious to hear about
your experience experience using tools
like that or just using workflows like
that all right take care and happy
