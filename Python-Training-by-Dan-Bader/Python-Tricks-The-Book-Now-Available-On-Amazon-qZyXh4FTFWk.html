happy to announce that my book called
Python tricks the book a buffet of
Awesome Python features just came out on
Amazon and honestly it was kind of crazy
to receive the the proof copy in the
mail because when I opened up the
package and kind of just skim through
the book I was like holy
I wrote a 300 page programming book
anyway if you're learning Python right
now or if you've kind of made it past
the basics in Python you know the basics
of the language and you feel like you
don't really know what to focus on next
where to go next
and really get to the point where you
can write developer style quote-unquote
Python then this book is really for you
this is the book that I wish I had when
I was past the first let's say six month
of learning Python this is really you
know the the tricks and the the kind of
the the little things you can do with
Python with the standard library with
some of its more advanced features that
I was having a hard time picking up so
if you feel like you're at that stage
with your Python skills right now then
check out the book you can get it on
Amazon you can get it as a digital copy
on my website and I think it will be a
great help for you I spend almost a year
writing this book and going through at
least 10 or more iterations with the
community getting community feedback
making the book better and improving it
every step of the way and I'm really
really happy with how the final result
turned out so be sure to check out the
book on Amazon and get a copy if you
want to improve your Python skills and
take them to the next level alright
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
