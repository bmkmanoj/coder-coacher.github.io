question from Reuben on YouTube awhile
ago I just wanted to cover it in this
video so Reuben says quick question what
if I plan on selling my desktop GUI
should I worry about creating more
competition for myself if I put the code
on github so this is a question about
open sourcing a commercial project I
assume and whether or not that's a good
idea so my thoughts are Reuben I would
be very careful be very careful with
that it sounds like you're actually
selling the product and you're not
selling support contracts right like for
example this is the business model I
guess that people made work with with
Linux where well the kernel and and
everything is is available for free
essentially but companies and and
consumers are in some cases paying
paying distributions money to get the
support you know this is how Red Hat
works and how how people have been able
to build successful business models in
the open source world so I'm not saying
this is impossible but it's also a
completely different game so if you're
selling this app right now let's say on
your website you know it's a digital
download people pay you a one-time
payment they can download the
application and then just use it on
their computer because you said it's a
GUI app so I'm assuming this is for
download this is not a SAS application
or software as a service application
this could you know you could quite
possibly create a competitor for your
own application for yourself and I don't
really see based on the information you
gave in the context that you gave I
don't really see the benefit of open
sourcing this application you know it
makes sense to open source it if you
want to use it as a portfolio item of
sorts I mean you wrote the app you know
I'm not sure if it's if having the
source out there is is so important you
know it still could be an impressive
project I'm not sure if that's a valid
valid argument for open open sourcing it
you are hoping to get contributors from
the community you you know maybe you're
hoping
that people are gonna be submitting
patches and maybe making improvements to
the app and you can continue to sell it
that would be a more valid reason but
how likely is that right how likely is
someone else to contribute to to a
commercial product and essentially for
free I'm not sure of that if the right
incentive is there sure could you know
could be possible again if it's more
like a support support kind of situation
where you're selling out the support or
selling the support and not the actual
product then this could work better but
again like I feel like it's not you know
based on what you said it's probably not
like a valid reason to open sourced as
as well now another reason could be that
you just want this to be open source
because you believe in what what that
stands for and I can very much relate to
that you know I have a couple of open
source projects and I don't get paid
anything for them
I maintain them for free creates a lot
of work you know reviewing stuff giving
people feedback on their code people get
angry if if I let their pull requests
sit there for too long and and it you
know it's it also creates work but you
know I really I benefited from open
source so I believe in giving back to
the community and you know other ways
would be to donate money but I'd rather
coat some stuff and then just just give
that away so so I can very much relate
to that kind of thinking but on the
other hand if you if you're building you
know if you're building your business
around this stuff I mean I'm you know I
give up actually I give away most of my
teaching material I give away for free
here on YouTube and on my website and
you know in social media and all these
other outlets like I create a ton of
free content that I just give away but
there's some stuff that is closed source
in that sense right where it is it is
paid training and it is more in-depth
stuff and it is things like things like
my book or you know the managing
dependencies course and and products
like that I don't open sourced and I
don't give them away for free
I you know that's how I feed my family I
want to make some money I want to you
know this is what keeps the business
alive I'm trying to give away as much as
I can because I want to you know just
make the Python community better but I
also got to make a living somehow so I
feel like this is really similar to to
this situation here where you got to
decide you know which parts where does
it make sense to give these things away
for free or open-source them and where
where do you want to keep them close
source because you're gonna invite
competitors and in this case you know
based on what you said I would probably
be careful about open sourcing it
because I don't see a huge upside to it
and I only see a downside if this is
like a one-off digital purchase product
that you're selling right now I don't
really see the upside of open sourcing
it now if you're selling support
contracts that could all change you know
I'm not saying there's not a business
model where this would make sense but
based on the context that that I think
that is implied here I probably not do
it I would maybe do it long term if you
stop maintaining the application or you
know the it's it's it's outdated and you
stopped selling the product at that
point it would be sort of a nice gesture
to open-source it so that that I can
continue to to to exist in the future
and other people can maintain it if they
want it I mean okay so I just thought of
one reason like a valid reason if if you
open sourced it and the reason would be
that you can say you know when you're
selling your app you can say hey you
will always let's imagine this is some
kind of backup tool like I'd be really
concerned about not having the ability
to access my data at a later point in
time and if if the author says you know
if you say well this is open source you
can then I would feel more comfortable
being able to pull the source and make
changes you know and make sure that I
can get this to work again the future
hire someone to do it if if you ever
stopped maintaining it so that this
could be like a small reason to like D
risk it for your customers but you know
you could also offer you know you could
offer people to pay extra and then buy
the source code that way and again that
might also invite competitors and stuff
but you know I
probably not open-source it at this
point because it's very hard to take
back once it's open source it's gonna
get for it it's gonna get copied you'll
never be able to make it close source
again it'll just be out there so yeah
probably would be like I would be a
little bit careful with that in your
shoes probably not do it for now all
right I hope this advice was helpful let
me know how you decide were you gonna do
and best of luck with your app yeah so
if anybody else has a question if you
have a question that you would like to
get answered in a future video and just
leave a comment below I'll try and do as
many videos as I can here and and just
give out free advice answer answer these
questions because I really enjoy it and
spin it's been pretty cool
interacting with you know with everyone
in the community and getting feedback
and just getting better at doing these
videos like actually I feel like I
really enjoy you know doing these videos
and just getting better at talking into
the camera over time at least I hope I'm
getting better anyway so click the like
and subscribe button and stay tuned for
next video
