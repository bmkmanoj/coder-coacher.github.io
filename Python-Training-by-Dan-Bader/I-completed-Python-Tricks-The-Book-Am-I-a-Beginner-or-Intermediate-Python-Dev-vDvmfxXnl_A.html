so Tony asks hi Dan at what level can I
assume myself to be if I have completed
your Python tricks book beginner or
intermediate Thanks
so what Tony's referring to is my Python
tricks book the book is called Python
tricks of a Fae of awesome features and
in this book I'm covering some
intermediate and advanced level Python
topics like how to work with generators
what generators are in the first place
how to work with decorators and Python
and some other patterns that you can use
to kind of go beyond the basics of
Python and the Python syntax so well
Tony what I want to say here is that
it's very hard to put people into these
buckets right like it's someone a
beginner in are they an intermediate
level developer and an advanced level
developer at an expert level developer
it's it's kind of hard to really find a
clear definition for those terms what I
want to say though is if you work
through the book and if you feel that
after reading the book and trying out
some of the examples if you feel
comfortable with these concepts like
decorators generators some of the
advanced level dictionary patterns that
you learned in the book then I would
absolutely say that you're way past the
beginner stage I think for a beginner a
beginner is often someone who's who's
really learning the basics of the
language the basic syntax and the basic
features off of Python and if you if
you're beyond that and I would certainly
say that if you feel comfortable with
the concepts in the book then in my
opinion you definitely be beyond that
stage and so I would put you more
towards an intermediate level in Python
but it's it's kind of hard to judge
exactly where where you fit in I think
it's a very it's a very wide field right
someone could be the world's expert on
the Python syntax but they couldn't
program their way out of a paper bag
just because they maybe they lack some
other skills they don't know how to work
effectively with editors or they don't
know how to
all packages and you know what I mean
right like I'm trying to to come up with
with some examples here but generally
it's kind of hard to to judge someone
solely on the fact that you've that
you've read the book I mean there's
another possibility is that someone
reads this book and they only read it
and they don't really take any of the
stuff to heart and don't really do any
of their own experimentation then it's
very easy to kind of be stuck at the
same level and not not get a lot of
benefit from from that material right so
that's kind of the flip side of that
coin but again you know my answer here
is if you've read the book if you now
feel comfortable with the concepts
explained in the book you've done some
of your own researching some of your own
experimentation I would absolutely say
you're no longer at the beginner level
and Python right well thanks for the
question if you want your own Python or
software development question answered
just leave a comment below and I'll try
and cover it in one of my next videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
