talk about the difference between class
methods static methods and plain or
regular instance methods in Python kind
of demystify some of differences between
them when you would use each what are
some of the common scenarios and how you
can use them to actually make your code
cleaner and more maintainable and easier
to work with in the future
okay so let's jump right in I want to
make this really hands-on and kind of
work from a simple example that I can
use to show you the difference so I
created this class I called my class
just a really simple example and it's
got a couple of different method types
on it so the first one is just called
method or the method is called method
and it's just a plain instance method
you can see here it takes one argument
the self argument which points to the
object instance and that means within
method we can actually modify or read
attributes on the object instance and
when you compare that to a class method
so I just called this one class method
and then use the class method decorator
to actually mark it as a class method
you can see here that the class method
only has access to this class parameter
or this class argument it doesn't have
have a self argument so this means a
class method it can only access the the
class itself or the object representing
the class because while everything is an
object in Python but the key difference
is that when I create an instance of my
class and then call class method on it
it won't be able to to actually access
the self object right so it can only
access attributes that actually exist on
the class itself and not on the instance
now with static method again the
approach is really similar you just you
know define a regular method and in
market with the add static method
decorator what you can see here is that
it
doesn't take any arguments at all so it
has no access to the class or the object
instance at all so it's completely
separate from that it's really just a
way to namespace your methods so now you
know I know this this is a very very
theoretical at this point and it's going
to become much more clear when we
actually try and do some experimentation
with the stuff some hands-on work so the
first thing I want to show you here is
that when I create an object instance
base on this class I can actually call
any of these method types on that object
so I can call a plane method and it kind
of structured these these methods in a
way that they return a string that kind
of explains what's going on right so
when I call object dot method we can see
here that well we call the instance
method and we have this self object
pointing to an instance off of my class
now I can do the same thing with class
method and I want to call this you can
see here that again we're calling this
class method method and this time we
also have access to this class object
now the difference here is that with the
instance method we actually had access
to the object instance right so this was
an instance off a my class object
whereas with the class method we have
access to the class itself but not to
any of the objects because the class
method doesn't really care about an
object existing however you can both
call a class method and static method on
an object instance this is going to work
it doesn't really make a difference so
again when you call static method here
it's going to work and it's going to
know which method you want to call but
really the key difference now is going
to be that we can also say okay my class
and I'm not creating an instance of this
class and I can go in
say class method for example this is
going to work fine I can also go ahead
and say call call the the static method
it's also going to work fine but of
course when I try and call method that's
going to fail because we didn't actually
call it with a class instance so I hope
this makes this distinction between
regular methods and static and class
methods a little bit more clear now of
course the big question is okay why why
do we need that right why why is that a
thing and I want to go over some
examples here of what you can use these
methods for because I think they're
actually really powerful concept or a
really powerful tool for you to
structure your code in a way that makes
the most sense okay so this is what I
came up with the classical pizza example
for teaching object-oriented programming
so what I've done here is I defined this
really simple pizza class it's got a
constructor takes you know some bold
arbitrary ingredients object we're just
going to assume in some kind of lists or
container with these ingredients and it
also put a wrapper on it so we can
nicely format it as a string and in here
if you're wondering what that is so that
is the new format strings in Python
three six which are really awesome so I
really encourage you encourage you to
try that out could just use regular
format strings of course so okay so so
basically what I did here I created is
pizza class and now we can use it to
create pizza objects right and so if I'm
not mistaken that's a margarita
my wife's Italian you'd probably kick my
ass if I got that wrong but I think
that's a margarita well what you've seen
here is that we can create these pizza
objects but as we create more and more
complicated pizzas hem
like a prosciutto or something I don't
know maybe we need some mushrooms on
that as well right and and you can
already tell I'm struggling with the
naming here right I can create all
create all these wonderful pizzas here
but I need to remember all of these
ingredients so now it wouldn't be too
much of a stretch to actually have like
solved this problem with a static method
okay so I wanted to make it a little bit
easier for us to create new pizza
objects without having to remember all
these ingredients and so a really good
way to structure this in my opinion is
to actually use class methods to have
different factory functions for the
different types of pizza you can create
and I'm going to show you how this works
in a minute now
so what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to define a margarita class method
here and then that's just gonna create a
new instance of the class and we just
type that out here so what i'm doing
here is whenever this margarita method
is called and we can call it on just a
pizza class we don't actually need a
real pizza pizza instance i'm just going
to call i'm going to create an instance
off a pizza or you know whatever class
is named like the nice thing here is
that I don't have to refer to the name
up here so I can keep that name just in
one place and whenever I updated I don't
have to worry about changing the rest of
the code but it's it's just going to use
the class objects just going to call
this init init method here and it's
going to create a new pizza with these
ingredients and so this is kind of a
really maintainable way to do these
factory functions so I could also have a
prosciutto I didn't actually look the
spelling up for this right so if any
italians are watching this
then let me know if I if I screw this up
so here we actually want cheese I guess
that would be mozarella right
you're not cheese but whatever it's it's
a kind of cheese anyway this is about
cheese this is about a Python so okay so
I'm creating and creating a different
kind of pizza here and now when I when I
finish defining this class I can
actually say hey
I want a margarita and that returns a
new pizza object right it could have
also called this make margarita or sore
new margarita or something like that
right just to kind of have a better
naming scheme but the same thing is
going to work with the prosciutto and I
feel like this is a really good use for
these class methods if you have classes
with complicated constructors you know
that take a lot of argument and you want
to provide a simplified interface for
your users then I think using a class
method in this fashion can be really
beneficial and it's just going to make
the API a little bit easier for people
to work with so this is one example of
where I would use a static method and of
course you could always argue that you
know maybe there should be a separate
function yada yada yada but I think in
some cases this could really work well
if you if you structure your your
classes that way up next when to use
static methods so it's a little bit hard
to come up with a really simple example
here but you know I'm gonna keep
stretching the pizza the pizza thing
here so okay so this is what I came up
with basically a static method doesn't
have access to the class or the object
instance at all right and now that's a
pretty big limitation but it's also
really good signal to well to show that
a particular method is is really
independent from everything else around
it right so for example if I flag this
as a static method it's pretty clear
that this method it it's probably not
gonna change the the object or the class
in any way because it's not remit to
have access to it I mean sure you know
you could probably work around that and
it could kind of work with a global
variable but in general like it's a
pretty good hint that this is a
self-contained method which has all
kinds of benefits for later testing this
thing and just kind of understanding the
limitations of this method and so in
some cases can really be helpful to make
your code easy
to maintain in the future because we're
really communicating this intent right
where you can someone else reading this
code can pretty clearly understand that
in this case our little circle area
function here it's not going to modify
the state off this object itself
so let me walk you through this example
real quick so basically what I've added
here well I kind of changed the
constructor around a bit so now we've
got a radius argument here for the pizza
as well forgot to update the rapper but
you know doesn't really matter for now
and then I added this area function and
well I could have just calculated the
area of the pizza directly in here but I
you know wanted to have a static method
in there and so basically what I did
there instead of calculating the area
directly with an expression here
I'm just offloading that to the circle
area function and then the circle area
function just takes an R which is the
radius and uses the classic R squared
times x pi formula to calculate the
circle area so you know this is honestly
like kind of a simplistic example and
you usually wouldn't implement it like
that but it goes to show the concept and
now what happens here is I can
instantiate a pizza so for example you
know this is a really sad pizza with
like 4.5 but we don't have a unit on
that right let's say meters a giant
pizza cheese only and we're going to
create this this object this pizza
object and then we're going to call the
area function on it and it's going to
give us this this result so the way this
is calculated is that area actually
Forks off the all that work to the
circle area function and now the circle
area function is actually completely
independent and I also used a single
underscore to mark it as kind of not
part of the public API of this class but
kind of an internal implementation
detail but nevertheless now the cool
thing is that we have this circle area
function that is completely independent
from the rest of the object
can actually modify the object state and
this is a pretty good hint for someone
else reading the code it also simplifies
testing right because when I write my
tests for this then I don't have to
worry about instantiating a pizza object
making sure it doesn't get modified
because the circle area helper it can't
do that right and so I occasionally use
static methods to communicate that
intent and to keep my helper functions
nice and clean and make sure that
they're not modifying the object state
all over the place again just a quick
recap so we talked about plain methods
class methods and static methods when
you can call them pretty much all you
need to remember is that a regular
method needs an object instance to be
called on and in a class method
it needs a class and it has access to
the class and a static method doesn't
really have any access to the object or
the object instance or the class at all
and it's just kind of a way to namespace
your functions alright so have fun
exploring the the pizza analogy here and
building the perfect pizza API in an
object-oriented fashion talk to you soon
and happy Python II
