tip for you there's a cool new feature
called unpacking generalizations in
Python 3 5 and you can use it too well
as a shorthand to merge two dictionaries
together so just to show you what I'm
talking about imagine we have these two
dictionaries it's gonna call the 1 X's
and it's gonna look like this and then
we have the Y's and it's gonna continue
in the same way just so we have
something to experiment with ok so
imagine we have these two dictionaries
and now we can merge them together with
this new cool syntax that looks like
this and the resulting dictionary will
have the keys and values from both
dictionaries combined now in in the two
dictionaries that I showed you they
combine really easily because they don't
have overlapping keys but maybe um you
know a question you might have is so
what actually happens if I have
overlapping keys so let's redefine or
let's actually define a new dictionary
here the Z's and just call these keys a
and B as well
and now let's actually merge the exes
dictionary with the ZZZ dictionary and
you can see here you know that they
those guys are gonna have overlapping
keys right so the question is what's
gonna happen now and what you can see
here is that kind of the right-hand side
wins
so these dictionaries they're gonna be
merged together in the order they're
listed here in this expression so we're
gonna you know create basically create a
copy of exes first and then kind of
apply at the Z's on top of that and so
we're gonna it's gonna result in in this
dictionary we're seeing here where we've
replaced the values for B and a with the
values that were actually stored here in
the Z's and because this is Python 3/5
like the dictionaries don't have a
guaranteed order right so the keys here
it's essentially it's it's not really
random but essentially you can you can
look at it that way and so yeah I think
all you need to remember that this is a
really nice shorthand I think for
merging two dictionaries together if you
wanted to do that and I always thought
this was a neat little feature that was
just recently so if you want to learn
more about these unpacking
generalizations there's actually a lot
more useful things you can do with it
besides like this little trick to merge
two dictionaries you can find it in PEP
four four eight so pep four four eight
the unpacking generalizations that's
where you can read all about this new
stuff cool have fun with that and enjoy
merging dictionaries with this shorthand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
