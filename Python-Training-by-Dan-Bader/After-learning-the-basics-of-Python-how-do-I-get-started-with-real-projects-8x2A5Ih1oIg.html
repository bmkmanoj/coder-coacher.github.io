do you get started with real projects
working on real programming projects I'm
sure that's a question that a lot of
beginners ask themselves and I was asked
this question by debater org newsletter
subscriber so let's talk about that for
the next couple of minutes what I would
do once you have mastered or you know
get gotten comfortable with the basics
of Python meaning the syntax how to
install packages how to run your
programs how to bug check your programs
and all of these things meaning you can
actually bring some value to the world
with your proper programs and solve real
problems that people have how do you
take the next step I think a critical
part here is to realize that when you
have some programming skills you
actually have a really really powerful
ability and you can take that ability to
go out and solve problems for other
people and that can make it a very
rewarding thing to do and it can be a
great thing for you to help build up
your skills so for example what you
could do if you don't feel comfortable
yet applying for jobs or doing paid work
just to go out and see who you can help
with your with your programming work
right and it could be I don't know
helping your neighbor doing some some
data crunching you know with his outside
weather station and that's probably a
stupid example but maybe it's something
you know at your existing or current
place of work
maybe there's a colleague you can help
automate some of his tasks or her tasks
maybe there's something that you can
apply in your own life and maybe you can
swap out a spreadsheet for a little web
application or just for a little script
that does some number crunching so
there's opportunities for software to
provide a lot of value everywhere you go
I totally believe that and I see it
every single day and if you can leverage
your ability to program to to solve
other people's problems it it's going to
be great thing for your skills as well
it's gonna help you a lot becoming a
better programmer becoming more
confident in your abilities and feeling
comfortable to to
take on paid work feeling ready to
charge money for these skills that you
can bring to the table and the value
that you can create so that will be one
thing you can do you know you can go out
seek out people you can help in person
by writing little programs for them or
scratch your own itch write programs for
yourself another thing you can do and
it's a sort of dabbling into freelance
work is you can sign up for platforms
like upwork.com
and actually offer your services as a
freelancer and a lot of times people
there are looking for someone to write
them a little web scraper script or you
know to to write some conversion program
and your programming abilities can be a
very very helpful asset on a platform
like that now granted for the most part
you're not gonna make a ton of money
because these are not like highly
specialized skills and there's a
difference between you know doing of
writing a web scraper and doing some
number crunching or some transformation
versus building someone a full-blown web
application you know as part of some
startup company now you can still
provide a lot of value but it's kind of
hard to really get a contract that way
that pays a ton of money or that's a
long term consulting engagement but it
could still be very very valuable work
and can be great way for you to build
your portfolio so this could be another
option going to platforms like up work
just posting an ad on Craigslist
offering your services and and then you
got to know you know where you are on
the spectrum like how comfortable are
you taking on larger contracts maybe of
compared to just you know on an hour or
two or three hours worth of work but
this is certainly something where you
can dabble into and get your feet wet
and well another option would be if
you're not interested in doing paid work
another option would be to contribute to
open source projects maybe you can go
out and seek out some existing open
source projects and see if you can make
a useful contribution and that could be
something small like updating the help
documentation making a small fix to the
prod
website and stuff like that but this is
certainly something where you can also
grow into taking on more responsibility
and actually doing programming work that
effects the real world and that is
working collaboratively with other
people so I laid out a couple of
strategies in this video that you can
use and hopefully that will help you on
your journey to you know where to go
next after learning the basics of Python
if you have a question like that that
relates to python and software
development leave a comment below and
I'll try and tackle it in one of the
next videos in this series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
