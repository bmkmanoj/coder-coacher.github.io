you're a good Python developer and that
you know all of the fundamental
frameworks so this is a question I got
from a reader and it's about
certifications and there's a bit of a
hot topic for me honestly because I
don't really believe in software
development certifications and they I
know they're there all around us and I
know people take them and they get their
piece of paper whether that's you know
an online certification or you go and
kind of go through a workshop and get
your certification there and I think
they're they're limited in their
usefulness
right like honestly every place I ever
worked at you know software development
shops we never gave anything on
certifications you always want to see
like actual real stuff that people have
done because certifications they don't
really matter usually they don't really
correlate much with actual programming
skill and so I'm I'm kind of biased that
way right and so therefore my answer
would be the best certification that you
can you can have is well maybe a college
degree like if you have a computer
science bachelor's or master's degree
that could be helpful again it's not
going to be proof that people will just
take as is you're still gonna have to
demonstrate that you know what you're
doing and so I believe the best thing to
do here is to actually build up a
portfolio and to build a personal
network and to show people that that you
can do it and you can write programs and
can solve problems with software and the
the certifications that I've seen they
don't do a great job at that right like
maybe a certification it's it's a nice
thing for your for yourself to have like
I was like a little trophy or you know
proof of your progress but to be honest
with you I don't believe in in
certifications like I've done you know
I'm an ADD like an agile certified agile
product owner and it was complete
rubbish to go through the certification
you know like there were people sitting
next to me just on their phone the whole
time and they passed the certification
with flying colors because it was purely
based on a 10-2
and like a 10-question quiz and that's
ridiculous right like there is no
connection or correlation between most
certifications and your actual
performance on the job and software
development companies they've caught on
to that and usually they don't care
right like they don't care about
certifications they want to see actual
projects that you've worked on and they
want to talk to you and they want to
they want to figure out are you actually
a good programmer and not whether you
have the paper slip or not that comes
with a certification so is there just my
thoughts on the topic you know if you
disagree please leave a comment be happy
or very interested in hearing your
perspective on this stuff but in general
in my experience certifications kind of
suck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
