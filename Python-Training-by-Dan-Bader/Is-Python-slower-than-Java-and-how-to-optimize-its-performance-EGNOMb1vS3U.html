you optimize its performance great
question by Sonam so a couple of
thoughts on this in general Python or at
least the C Python interpreter will be
slower than the the dominant Java VMs or
virtual machines that are out there and
the reason for that is that Python is a
much more dynamic language so it's
harder to write an optimizing compiler
and an optimizing virtual machine for
Python so especially if you compare C
Python performance with the
state-of-the-art Java or.net virtual
machines Python will be at a
disadvantage now there's a couple of
ways around that so you can you can
optimize the performance of your
programs if that is relevant if that is
necessary so one thing you can do is you
can run your Python code on an
alternative interpreter called pi pi
this is an optimizing compiler and
optimizing interpreter for the Python
language that in many cases will just be
a drop-in replacement so it's a
just-in-time compiler that will make
your code much faster in many cases
another option would be to write your
your performance relevant code in a
language like C that allows you to be
much closer to the bare metal and then
to pull that code in as an external
module using the C types module that's
built into Python and you can find a
tutorial on how to do that on my website
at D beta org another option is using
something called scythe on that allows
you to compile Python code into C and
then automatically pull that in as an
external library it's kind of cool it
relates to the C types approach and you
may want to try it out and see if you
like it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
