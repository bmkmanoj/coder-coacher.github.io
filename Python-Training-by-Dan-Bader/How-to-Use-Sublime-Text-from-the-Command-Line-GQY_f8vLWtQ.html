text productivity tip and today I'm
going to talk about how you can use
sublime text from the command line so
let's get this window out of the way
here and I'm in my terminal window right
just sitting there at my bash prompt so
now the cool thing is that sublime text
actually ships with a little companion
command or a little program that's
called subl and you can use subl to
control sublime text so you could just
go type subl in the in the command line
hit return and you would get a new blank
sublime text window which is kind of
neat sometimes right so the other thing
you can do with it you can actually pass
it a filename you just go subl in the
name of the file hit return and sublime
text is gonna open the file you gave it
and this is super handy when you're
already working from the command line
and you just want to edit a file in your
favorite editor and you don't want to go
you know through having either the
finder or go through sublime text and
the open dialog to to browse to that
file so it's kind of a neat shortcut
the other cool thing is that you can use
subl to also create a new file so you
can just go subl new file dot txt for
example hit return and sublime text is
gonna pop up and it's gonna create that
new file for you it's already it's
already given it a name and we can just
say hello and save that file when we
close it we can check with the cap
command and we see that the file was
actually created and it also has our
little hello message in there
so kind of these three things are super
handy and I use them tens of times every
day because I work from the command line
a lot and it's actually super handy to
be able to open sublime text or kind of
interact with sublime text directly from
the command line
all right cool so we love the sub well
command now although if you actually go
to your own terminal and try it then it
probably won't work and the reason for
that is while the subol command actually
ships with sublime text the the actual
sublime text
by default it's kind of hard to get to
because by default if you're easy if
you're using sublime text 3 it'll it'll
sit in this location right in your
Applications folder sublime text app
contents shared support bin supple and
that's a mouthful so you know I can run
this and it's actually gonna do the
exact same thing that the sub will
commanded for me before but it kind of
sucks having to type all of that stuff
out so really the best way to to fix
this is by creating a symbolic link for
that command what you can do is create a
symbolic link for that command and I
typically on a Mac you would put that to
user local bin sub or you could also
choose another name like sublime or just
sub or SB I kind of like going with
subbable because that's sort of the
original name for the command so let's
try this and let's hit return boom ok so
you can see here it says the file
already exists well because I went
through that process before but in your
case actually after you've done this you
should be able to just use subl to
interact with sublime text which makes
that whole process just a little bit
easier a little bit easier to remember -
cool so I hope this is gonna save you a
whole bunch of time in your programming
career while you're using sublime text
and stay tuned for more stuff in the
future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
