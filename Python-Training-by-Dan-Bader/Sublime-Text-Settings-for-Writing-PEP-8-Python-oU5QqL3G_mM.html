sublime text tip for Python developers
today I want to show you a setting that
is really helpful if you're writing hep
8 compliant code let's say if you're
contributing to a code base for an open
source project that follows the pet
eight recommendations then this is gonna
be really handy for you so pep eight
makes some recommendations on the
maximum line length for your code namely
they they recommend that for docstrings
you should limit yourself to 72
characters and for any other line of
code regular line of code it's okay to
go up to 79 characters and there's
actually a really helpful feature in
sublime text which is called the rulers
feature you can enable and it will place
these vertical lines here at the line
length that you've specified in the user
preferences so that you will instantly
know when you're approaching that limit
so I have that first ruler here for my
dark strings so I will instantly know
okay you know I'm approaching the line
length better insert a line break here
and then for regular lines of code I
also have the the second ruler which is
gonna tell me hey you're gonna you're
getting close to the 79 character limit
careful or you know you want to
restructure that a bit so I find those
really helpful and another setting that
I've enabled here is sublime text word
wrap feature so what that does is if you
get a line of code that is actually
longer than the word wrap limit which I
set to ad which is one more than the
maximum allowed line length so I don't
you know i don't want to wrap lines that
are shorter than 80 characters so what
happens if I approach that limit is that
sublime text is gonna wrap the line
which means that it appears like there
are actually several lines here now but
you can tell that on the left there are
only there's only one line number four
for this line which means it's it's in
actuality it's actually
it's one giant super long line and it's
not like four different lines so I find
this very handy because that way I can
have multiple editor windows open at the
same time and I can be sure that as long
as my width for that window is longer
than 80 characters or at least 80
characters I'm gonna be able to see all
of the code at once without having to
scroll horizontally because that just
drives me nuts I really like to see
everything at a glance I want to know
what I'm working with
so I find these settings very helpful if
you're working with pep 8 you know if
you're using a modification of pep 8
let's say if you're if you're bumping up
the the line length limit in your team
then of course feel free to tweak that
I've worked on some teams where we used
99 or 109 that's the maximum length and
and that was that was okay too but if
you really want to follow pep eight then
these are the settings that you want and
then you'll end up with a setup like the
one I'm showing you cool so give this a
shot I think it makes life a little bit
easier and I hope that was helpful to
you okay bye now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
