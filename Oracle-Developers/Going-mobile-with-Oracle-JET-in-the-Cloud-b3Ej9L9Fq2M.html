my presentation on going mobile with
Oracle chat in the cloud his
presentation specially recorded for
Oracle code online in December 2017 Who
am I
so my name is Lee boss I work as a
technical director and partner for he
proceed I'm specialized in Oracle ADF
jet math and MCS mobile cloud service
and I've been working with Oracle
technology since 1999 I'm the author of
a book on Oracle mobile application
framework and besides that I'm a
director and Oracle developer champion
so a little bit about in proceed we are
an Oracle Platinum Partner and we have
our headquarters in Luxembourg and we
have local offices in several parts of
the world and our philosophy is that we
work with local teams and global
knowledge so we have teams that know the
local market and we have expert
knowledge in several / offices that is
being shared with our local teams and
that recipe works fine for both proceed
and our customers
so let's look at the agenda we will
start introducing the technologies used
in this presentation so obviously the
public Oracle chat and Oracle mobile
cloud service next I will show you how
to set up your local environment with
the two dates that are available for
that then we go on and develop the
initial app with Oracle yet next
I will show you how to get into that
Oracle mobile cloud and to use Oracle
mobile cloud within your chat mobile app
and finally I will summarize today's
presentation for you so you get a nice
overview of everything that we did so
let's start introducing used
technologies so the a break going to
build today is a simple app that enables
you to login to Oracle mobile cloud
service and there's some fancy UI
widgets and most important one is that
we use Apache Cordova to take pictures
with the camera on the device and that
we upload those pictures to Oracle
mobile cloud service so it's using chat
it's using Cordova it's using mobile
cloud so we're using jet to go to the
cloud mobile cloud service API is the
authentication API so user API actually
and storage API we could use many many
orders but we are limited in time it's
pretty pretty amazing that we can do
this in one hour including explaining
all of this to you guys so introducing
Oracle Java ME shows you that it
consists of several individual
components so the Oracle chat toolkit
comes with its own set of rich UI
components build the mobile support with
our own jQuery for for UI interactions
and it relies on knockout for actually
simplifying the binding of JavaScript
data to UI component and we
yes actually for dependency management
of JavaScript libraries for asynchronous
and for loading of JavaScript and then
finally Cordova for this presentation
for this topic the most important one
which allows you to interact with device
native features to just cameras GPS
address book etc etc now let's take a
look at a particular vine
so from the image you can see the four
four components for Apache curve apps
you see the webview which is the green
box on the lower left you see the web
app you see Cordova plugins and you see
the mobile operating systems so the
webview is actually the piece that runs
your application the entire user
interface the web app contains your code
and that could be obviously CSS
JavaScript and HTML and besides that any
other resource that your app needs let
me see the plugins that's a several
standard code of AB Corp logins and
those provide you access to device
capabilities such as battery
camera and contacts etc so a final part
of our that's called architecture is
Oracle mobile cloud service and raqqa
mobile cloud service is Oracle's mobile
backend as a service nowadays it's
called Oracle mobile cloud enterprise
and it also contains chat pod
functionality but for this presentation
that's out of scope so the way you are
going to use Oracle cloud service
depends on your role in your project if
you're a mobile app developer you could
line up and test resources if you need
them
specific resources for your app and that
could be custom API splat from api's and
you would also use it to get your SDK I
will explain that later if you're a
service developer you could write your
own custom api's with nodejs and
implement those specific to your mobile
app developers needs in mobile cloud
service you will use a mobile backend to
group all that app specific
functionality and could be shared
between apps so typically a mobile
backend is a grouping of api's and/or
resources that an app or a set of app
apps may need that could be custom api's
or for instance if you want to use push
notifications that would also be part of
your mobile backend now let's take a
look on how to set up our local
environment so we can start building the
were called chat mobile app so typically
it's four steps before we can create yet
which first we need to install node if
you don't have that on your machine on
your development machine the next step
would be to install chat and just come
online interface before you can start
actually creating your app you need to
install Cordova because we are going to
build a hybrid mobile app with local
chat so install and no chess is a very
simple simple step you download nodejs
and you install it on your machine I
have a MacBook so its installed on my
Mac next step would be to install Oracle
yet command-line interface via a node
package manager you see the command here
I will run those in a second to get
everything up and running then we will
install Apache Cordova it would
best get the latest version so you're up
to date with everything and again that
is by using the node package manager and
an install command for code over and now
something specific for mobile
development so if you want to use if you
want to build a mobile app you need for
Android you need your in Android
development tools for iOS you need your
iOS development tools for Windows say we
knew you would need to render different
metals and that's a bit can be awkward
because if you run a Windows machine you
cannot run iOS development tools and
vice versa if you run macbook you cannot
run the windows development tools
Android runs on both platforms so I can
do Android development on Mac and on
Windows so if you want to develop a
mobile application for Windows devices
you should run Windows 10 operating
system on on your development machine
otherwise it doesn't work
so as I mentioned before I run a macbook
so I can run Xcode anyway for iOS
development and I have my Android tools
installed so I can do the Android
development
okay now let's first see if you have to
correct node version so we just simply
type node - V and it shows me v9 - the
Rho which is the latest version that you
can download and install so with that
figured out it's now time to get our
chest of our company so for that we use
the node package manager and we say
install and Oracle - old yet CI
and when entering this note will install
the appropriate stuff so there we go it
will take a while but it's not that bad
so just let this running and you can see
what is happening and there we go
Oracle jet version 4.1 or the latest and
greatest is now installed ok with that
running we now continue to Cordova and
you would say and the install
- roba and PM that is OK
there we go Cordova is now updated and
we could see just to make sure that we
have the latest we add latest and I
think we're good
just check that with core - - - version
7 of 1.0 which is just great ok so we
have our environment up and running so
it's time to see how to develop the
initial app so creating it yet hardware
mobile app is very simple with local
chat come online cooling you can use
that for creating building overly and
it's very simple you just open a command
line and you just create with all the
parameters that are available you can do
that with pre-configured layouts and
styling for each and every design
platform and it has iOS Android and
Windows Mobile and you can use templates
such as basic template an after-work
template or navbar template with an app
drawer template we all get a very nice
fighting navigation drawer which is very
common in mobile apps so that's the
template that we will use ok now let's
start and create a jet up with Chad
command-line interface and that's
actually very e so you enter
Rochat relate then you can set a
directory where you want to put that
stuff so I want my head again and I have
to keep it positive
over there yeah that one and I want to
put it in jet for our cup code on line
December
yeah we're going to make a hybrid app
and we need to get it an app ID really
unique give it a name let's move app or
Coco December just anything that you
fancy them you want to give it a
template and as we discussed several
templates available but for this one we
will use the enough draw let's see
finally we want to give a platform and
we can always add extra cat ones later
but for now we will stick with Android
if this Anantha and see what happens
it's processing the template it's adding
the platform Android and white listing
the plugins in a complication ml and I
think and then we are ready to explore
it there we go and here it says on final
an Oracle jet your I've already changed
you new app directory and white which I
build and serve and we will go and try
widget build and serve later now it's
time to go into NetBeans and see what he
had me try ok so let's look at NetBeans
what was just created we can open the
project which would typically be here
see there is chat for : on December the
open it you see it created my my cherub
and you see here view models and the
views which have the same name because
along together so they're about ojs
contains two view model for about at
HTML etc etc third one so this is
created but here for instance the
dashboard HTML is now an empty HTML file
and it has the corresponding dashboard
ojs which for now is also empty it's
good we will add functionality later if
you recall that I mentioned a file
called config dot XML that's right here
and that one contains all kinds of
information regarding the app so also
that we should all Android allowed
intents you can add your additional
plugins if you want to but for now
that's it so just come here and close it
and we will use the command line
interface to run this app in a browser
it's a hybrid mobile app but as long as
we don't use any device specific
functionality so it's just a camera we
can see in the browser of this app works
so in order to run the app we need to
build it first building a hybrid mobile
app you create a package or a deployable
after fact that you can use to deploy to
your device so we are using Android so
if we build on our local chat
command-line interface it will create an
apk for angle so serving is simply by a
chat serve you pick the platform and you
pick the destination as I mentioned you
can do emulator device but also here
it's browser so if you big browser it
runs in a browser
again you can add teams if you need it
and that's one option the live reload
and the life reload if you do that then
you can actually have all the changes
that you do in your development tools
when that means reflected immediately in
the running app first we need to do
Oh jet build and as you can see I know
the root directory of my hat and every
should own jet build and obviously it's
for Android and the rest of the
parameter parameters I just blank out
just go jet build Android and now the
package is created for Android
once that's done here we are caught over
compiled finished build finished we are
ready to see the app running in browser
as I mentioned we can by using any
device native functionality which is
camera so we can understand a browser
just a book if it's able to edit our own
body so for that you know yet so for
Android and the destination in this case
we have to destination equals author and
there we go so go start browser and
there you are so here is in the browser
and obviously this is as a web page a
web page but it our developer tools we
can just pretend as if this essay in XS
6 and we see the dashboard content which
is empty we see the navigation drawer
that James that's not me we cannot get
to insolence we can navigate
profile etc so with that initial app
opening we can now start to add some
real code or validated functionality to
our app so emigrate to invoke that
camera API camera plugin it's not that
difficult it's it's very easy because of
Cordova the Kaurava plugin provides you
a JavaScript interface to interact with
that platform API so that's your
approach we have open the camera
actually very simple
the Kaurava api it's easy to use and as
you can see here i have an for function
take picture and that calls how to
navigate or camera don't care teacher
and that's the core of ID i I have some
arguments like quality and destination
type that make sure that tmh is taking
the way I wanted okay so now it's time
to create a functionality to take a
picture for that we need two things
first the first is JavaScript code to
avoid camera and the second one is
actually a button on our HTML page to
invoke that javascript function so first
we'll create a button so for that we
just remove the hard coded text here and
instead of that we just add a button
that in from the JavaScript function
that takes picture
take Joe and obviously we'll need a
label for the button come on that's like
that
so with the button in place we need to
get our JavaScript function there the
big picture function and that typically
goes to our corresponding incidence to
GIS file so we open it and we need to
find a place which is here and we just
add some JavaScript code I could type it
but I prepare it so you'll have an own
device ready function here in from the
camera so this take picture as the name
obviously because it's take picture so
it's good so that corresponds to
whatever is called from the Putin take
picture EDM folks camera got cab picture
take a picture with the quality of 50
and a destination type file and besides
that it was upload photo and pushes that
convention right to are not observable
array and finally we need to make sure
that our own device ready is available
so
and event listener right here so
we are good today and then finally we
need to make sure that our application
that a mobile app I can use the camera
and then we go back to the config
additional file and right at the bottom
here we will add the camera plugin I
have that on my clipboard so I just copy
and paste it and like this we make sure
the core of a camera plugin is available
to our app we save this and then we make
sure that we can run the app on our
device okay so now the app has
everything it needs to take pictures the
plug-in SDK the code is there but the
thing is that only works on a real
device so what I have here
you withdraw that screen to get my phone
connected to the screen so I can show
the display here first of all we have to
rebuild the app so we're going to do we
have build destination is device the DOS
building the app and after building will
do jet surf Android destination is
device and it will be deployed to the
device
will the successful
even though it's my device starts
flickering in couple of seconds there
goes and it will open the app and there
this let's blow right there so I can
actually navigate to our internals page
we see the button there to take pictures
and if I don't float the button right my
camera and I can take an image of what
you see that's just fine and it's
displayed in the app so he has to prove
look at words we can take picture with
and local chat hybrid mobile app so with
that all up and running and working it's
now time to get into the cloud so that's
very simple actually
everything is simple it's really really
straightforward so if you want your app
to use mobile cloud service we need a
couple of things first of all we need a
mobile backend and we will create that
then we need to register the client
actually the app needs to be registered
with our global cloud service optionally
if you want to add a login page or Lolan
functionality authentication for that
matter you create a user or multiple
users for the app and that's then that's
all in place so the next thing is to
download your SDK that Oracle mobile
cloud service provides for hybrid mobile
apps Apache core vibes you install that
SDK in your in your app and next thing
is to set up a helper class and that
that is actually something that enables
your app to work with our mobile cloud
service in very very easily
so once that is in place you can call
the mobile cloud services API so
platform API and also custom API is very
easy so downloading the MCS Cordova SDK
it's it's a link on our mobile cloud
service and you click that link you go
to the download site and the next step
is to simply download it and add it to
your mobile app here's again it is it's
a couple of steps first you extract the
SDK then you copy the files that you
need to your mobile app to add MCS SDK
files to the bootstrap file and I
finally new configure the app so that it
knows where to where to connect to so it
needs the anonymous key and mobile
backend tidy
to actually work with mobile cloud
service so to get your Oracle mobile
cloud environment up and running
assuming you have an account you go to
cloud with local cone then sign in if
you don't have fun you can always apply
for a free trial but I have fun and I go
here and it goes directly to my identity
domain which is correct and again
and then it shows me my crowd control
Club dashboard I in this one I only have
my mobile environment right and it shows
me what I have available so we have one
service instance and when I go to that
one it shows me directly my personal
environment this is all blah blah we
don't need that so we go directly to our
mobile backends because for a mobile app
you want to create our own mobile
backend that's very easy you go here and
let's call that auto : line December
2017 mobile backend and she MV line
create it creates me a mobile backend
and then it shows me immediately the
settings page for the specific mobile
backend and that settings page is very
important because it contains my mobile
backend ID and also the anonymous key
that we want to use data if we want our
app to access this mobile cloud service
back-end just keep an eye on this and
this is what we need later to make sure
that we get our SDKs for the mobile app
development and for Abby navigate back
to our home applications and then appear
you see SDK downloads and that brings
you to the download side for the SDKs
for mobile app development and that's
what is here download site so a lot of
SDKs for Android for iOS it's in
JavaScript it's for
all over and this is actually the one
that we need so first of all we I have
to accept that license and then you
download it to a location where you want
to actually want to store it so now is
there we go to show it in my finder and
extract is right where it is
so double-click it and have this so it's
it's extracted and if you see what's
there
it contains several files so it has two
MCS OGS Anna minified file and the same
program she has synced OGS and minimize
minimize file and then your Oracle
mobile cloud comfy but yes and I'll
explain to you what all of this mean so
for this application there's only two
files actually relevant it's the MCS
touches which contains the specific
JavaScript functionality to connect our
app to mobile cloud service obviously
the minified file is the one that we
want you is a fickle into production but
for now we just stick with the MCS touch
s then those thing fast not relevant for
this app but those are for
synchronization when you work with
offline data and finally there's the
Oracle mobile cloud config 20s and this
one contains all the information that
your app needs to connect to work on
mobile culture actually to your specific
back-end so what we will do is you will
add MC SDGs and the MC has mendel just
to our chat and
show you how to do that so we need to
put those files in our chat app to read
that we go to our chat app first and in
our source js4 I create two new two new
photos first one will be MCS that's what
sdk files go and then the second one I
call it mobi mobile backend and in that
one I will create app specific
javascript file that contains all the
functionality that I need to connect to
MCS so then those two files copy those
and I put them in my MCS for and then
this one I will copy that and put that
in my mobile phone and what I also do
here so this is just for reference that
contains a lot of information that I can
use in my JavaScript file to interact
with mobile cloud service I'll create a
new file javascript file and I call that
it's a bit simple way and I call that
movie oh Jesus that one will be my entry
to mobile cloud servers so if you go
back now to that beans we will see those
files are all available today we are
here the two MCS and MCS mintages
and here's the mobi and mobile cloud
conflict OGS so this one I'll just empty
it
we put content there that we need later
and for this one this is just my the
file that I'm going to use to enter the
information from mobile cloud service so
first of all I will remove everything
that is not relevant for this app so we
will do no Emma latex in this one we
will have just basically be the basic
authentication and all the rest we don't
need so we move that and I think we cool
so let's just make that a little bit
nicer save it so what you see here is
that you need to enter some of the
information that we see you in our MCS
config in our settings page or mobile
cloud service and I love a mobile pal
service now to get all this information
and copy it in here so this power cloud
service and there's a couple of things
that you see here for instance the
mobile backend tidy that's one that we
need in our config file should we copy
that one go back to NetBeans and use the
mobile backend edit Wikipedia next one
would be our back-end anonymous token
anonymous key which is here simply copy
that
and we stood right here then we have our
base URL the base URL here same again
copy it and paste it yeah
then we need to get our back-end name
obviously we know that it's the local
code online December mobile backend and
that goes here and final thing that we
need is the application and for the
application key we need to go into work
above a cloud service and create a new
application actually a new client so
let's do that so if we go here to
clients we don't have one so your create
one obviously the platform used now is
Android let's make this version one of
the world and then for the package name
is the exact same package name as to be
creating initial app fly this plane
let's make that and my name it's fine
with me so we created and what you see
now is that you get an application key
and this application key is the one that
we need to get to our app so we copy it
and we can baste it
face it here these are all settings that
we need from mobile cloud service in our
app so that's I can name this URL
application key back and tidy and
anonymous token so now we need to make
sure that our app can actually use those
files for the mobile GIS that kept seeds
condom later and MCHS and for that we go
to our meme yes and add those two files
here so we will refer to the MCS one yes
and yes and we will have to move me one
right here
so now the files are available in our
Jetta so for our goal to use mobile
cloud service to store the images that
we take with the camera in our app
there's one tiny little thing that we
need to do and that is go to mobile
cloud service and make sure that we can
actually store those images all MCs
so let's go to MCS and go ahead and fix
that
so for that we need to create a new
collection using the storage API on a
mobile cloud service and that's that's
very simple to create a new connection
call that local code online images
that's actually it collection is there
there's one more thing that we need to
do it says here collection is only
accessible to walls that you grant
relation to so we need to have a user to
authenticate against or mobile cloud
service and a user needs to have a role
that can access this collection so I
already have user roles in this mobile
backend so for a week right I select one
of the roles that I have here and for
that any user that has this role can now
read and write on this collection so I
save that and that should do the trick
next step would be and actually the
final step will be to use this
collection in our mobile app to be able
to upload the images the pictures taken
with yet to work mobile cloud service so
let's get back to NetBeans I can finish
our app it's songbird a lot of code but
it's not that complicated and most of it
is available from the documentation so
I'll show you the code that are prepared
I'm Alex
you testosterone it and it should be
obvious how to do this so these are
conflict oh yes this is actually a file
that we are not going to use except for
the information let me take that and put
that in another file oh just for
preparation the most important one here
is the mobile oh yes
so this file will contain all the
methods that interact with the MCS SDK
so from our app we call out to mobile
OGS and mobility yes interact with the
SDK so I prepare a file I'm going to
take that and copy it into this one we
are take it paste it so what it does is
it will it's a mobile backend so this
phone bill return my mobile backend and
it has several informations one of the
things is the collection name the
collection name Osseo images that's the
same as the collection on on on MCS we
are we going to store images we use that
then we have an init function this one
will prepare our mobile backend the
mobile backend name will Co December
2017 mobile backend basic authentication
so at this point place our app knows how
to authenticate against MCS and as I
explained previously if you want to use
the storage API we need to authenticate
without the authentication we have no
access to it so in here we have an
authenticated function a logout function
the authenticated function attempt
against
a pro text file but actually it's any
file that you can upload has a file name
of payloads and a mime type
so whatever name with whatever payload
and whatever mime type is going to be
uploaded to MCS so we create a new MCS
storage object there and then the next
step is to actually post it and then it
goes to MCS and these are this
functionality to actually make sure the
collection exists on MCS and this one
does the post the only thing missing is
to tell our app how to tattoo MCS and
that's the information that we just have
in this place all the file the conflict
areas and just take this out here copy
it and put it right here so this one is
now our MCS config and it's it's just
containing our back-end ID base URL
application key and the authentication
information so this should do the trick
our app is now able to interact with MCS
to authenticate against MCS and to
upload any kind of file to MCS and store
that in our oshio images collection now
this is all I need for this app but if
you need to have access to other kinds
of api's platform API for MCS or maybe
even custom api's all that access can go
through this mobile J's file
Francis push notifications for
location-based functionality all that
kind of stuff you could use this file
and add your functionality to it but now
let's get back to our app and make sure
that we implement the last two things so
the first one as explained is a
education we need to make sure that a
user can log in to the app or actually
log into mobile cloud service in order
to be able to use the storage API so
let's go and implement that and as I
mentioned the plan is to put that in the
dashboard so first we go to the
dashboard oh yes sir this so here we
will implement some functions to do the
authentication and again instead of
going to type it I will copy that
information from my clipboard so here is
let me just put it in here so we have
observable to figure out if the user is
logged in you have a username you just
use my username passport and besides
that login logout and some callbacks so
and here it's authorized function which
returns
whenever user is authorized on the
mobile backend so authenticate is
username plus passport goes to the mobi
file and authenticate against MCS and
here is the log out one thing that we
need to do is to make sure that we know
Bobby so now we can use the
authentication from our mobile file
against mobile cloud service and the
next step would be to actually call
these functions from Yui so we go to the
dashboard HTML and we add some buttons
here
with logout button and obviously also to
input text one for username and once the
password and I started going to type
here I'll also copy that from my pretty
bad file so here we go let's make them
more clean we have here if the user is
logged in not locked in we will show
username and password and login button
and if it is locked in we only showed
low hard one so I think that should do
the trick for logging in we must see
this and go on to the next step now
we'll add a button to the incidents page
to actually upload our pictures to
mobile cloud service and for that we
simply add a button here maybe some
white space to it and as you can see the
button calls out to upload picture
JavaScript function which we don't have
yet but we will implement it so that a
blue picture goes into incidence to a
genius and I don't have it here yet I'm
not going to type it for you but I
prepared it this teacher
put it here and before I before I
explain it to you I want to make sure
that we have our mobi stuff available
here go and if you can see here this is
your club picture and what we actually
do is we get get a block from the file
from the picture a bitches took and then
after that we don't load that file the
picture array that's that's that's data
the payload this is the format and we
have a callback function so if it is and
gap go from file that's the file path
pair or picture restored it's going to
get that information and upload it to
mobile cloud service let's see so I
think we are good to go now and how demo
it working okay let's see if we can
prove that it works so first I will
build my app one more time and one that
once that is built I will I will serve
it to my device my device is displayed
right here it's a life it's connected
via try that screen and over here you
see the storage collection Osseo images
on mobile cloud service so you can be
interesting if we can make this work
so the app is about to be deployed we go
there it is and I will log in so in
order not to display my password I will
do a little trick here
and then we continue so I type the
password I will login go to the
incidence and take a picture I'll just
take a picture of the screen and you are
seen here there we go
look I think it's fine
one hour but that's good
and then I upload it to the cloud the
fun factor will be now is it in the
cloud storage see you - there we go
modified a few seconds ago so if I click
this one you will see the radio ask me
to download it I save it and I will open
it and you can see it's the exact same
image so it's taken in the app it's
uploaded to mobile cloud service and
it's stored in the collection that is
just great ok so that was a great way to
have to build and it's not time to
summarize so it's as I mentioned Oracle
jet harbor mobile apps they are easy to
create using a jet create for the
scaffolding and you're you ready to get
start with the real development and then
codified that enables you to integrate
with device features such as contacts
cameras and all of these and even or
maybe custom Cordova plugins if you have
any and obviously if you have it set up
properly you have easy integration with
the ROK mobile cloud service for rock
mobile cloud service it's a it's an
backend for all the api's that your app
needs and for other resources such as
storage for users or maybe push benefit
all of these are available all those
platform api is even security according
to me if you have a Roku mobile cloud
service it's it's a great way of
servicing your Oracle hydro mobile apps
and it's it's a gateway to your
enterprise and if you get into whatever
is possible with Oracle mobile cloud
service you will understand that that
connect us to other cloud apps for to
on-premises and price applications will
enable you to build your mobile apps
with very very easy so that enables us
now to get into our question section so
if you have any questions now is the
time please note that once the hour is
over there is no time left for Q&amp;amp;A so
please use the chat to do questions and
otherwise feel free to contact me via
Twitter or direct messages it's ad loot
be luc beyond the score and otherwise
