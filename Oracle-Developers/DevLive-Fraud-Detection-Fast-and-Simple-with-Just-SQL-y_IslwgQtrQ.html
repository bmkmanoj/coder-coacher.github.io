the Oracle code event I'm Bob Rubert
with the Oracle technology Network here
with another interview with one of the
people involved in this event and for
this segment
my guest is Herman bear Herman tell the
folks at home what you do for Oracle
people first of all thanks for inviting
me it's exciting right here for the
folks out there in the wilderness I'm
working at Oracle in the product
management at a database organization
and our organization kind of owns the
upper half of the database the Symantec
database so we are not dealing with
we're and how to store the data but
we're dealing with what we're doing with
the data right it's things like sequel
or parallel execution so so speaking of
sequel your session today is on fraud
detection with just sequel exact so can
just sequel be effective and fraud
detection the answer is that yes okay
and that's the end of the interview okay
quietly we're talking to you well the
thing is when you think of it header and
header detection
first of all let me probably quickly
explain what I mean with per invitation
it is not the normal regular expression
where you look in a string for a veteran
of characters like when you try to find
what my name was with one N or two ends
it had a detection we'll be doing this
sequel is looking after pattern and
streams of events or you know in a more
relational or sequel language in streams
of rows that means it's an intro
analysis where you want to find where
for example the color has changed from
red to yellow to green and then back to
red again that would be a pattern that
you can find in streams of rows when you
say
where you basically track the state of a
problem and coming over to the topic
that I talked about today in salt
detection it is you want to detect a
series of events in that case it was
solved in a financial analysis where you
want to see where someone suspiciously
proved with a minimum distinct number of
small money transfers to arbitrary
accounts to see whether the account is
clean and it's not being watched - then
do one big transaction that's suspicious
activity and then run for your life
right so this is pretty much that's the
that's the fraud detection that we did
within 45 minutes in sequel in a way
where I think everybody in the audience
would be capable of redoing as with
sequel as development language and that
is that is the power of the combining
this kind of complex analysis with a
semantic language like sequel because
you're not interested in how the
processing happens
you only semantically describe what
you're looking after in in a way that I
normally call very often you know from
using our native speakers the baby
English probably what are the reasons
why I'm reasonably good in sequel right
it's close to being this girl know it
but it reads it it's a very intuitive
and simple way of expressing what you're
looking after following a concept you
say okay what is the streams of event
that I'm looking at then you design what
is the pattern that I'm looking for and
then what do I want to get out of it so
you for example in in this case we only
want to get the start and the end of the
suspicious activity or do you want to
have information about every detail
individual transactions so this is all
done very
very flexible difficult on that actually
fits on this little screen and it's
doing readable at the back of the room
your session is 45 minutes long give or
take
what's the one key point that you want
people to remember from all the content
that you present this so give me good
ratings no the one key point so
seriously what's the one key point is
that sequel is a development language
sequel is a data processing language
that unrested is a mistake that people
very often do they say when they hear
database or Oracle they think it's a
data management system more and more the
data management meaning where's the data
are stored and maintained or so it is
the less lesser of the important points
it's the data processing that becomes
important here and and sequel is a
development language that everybody
should take into account when it comes
to set-based processing because it is
it's a very intuitive it's a very simple
yet powerful processing language to do a
lot of things that people cannot even
think of if they if they never engage
with this language so what's on your
calendar are you presenting any other
sessions in the near future yeah they
let you lose again in about a month so
I'm having the honor to go to the Oracle
code event in Toronto as well okay and
after that my calendar is open at the
moment well maybe we can show that up
yeah if you want more information on any
upcoming Oracle code events including
the one in Toronto in April there are
sixteen more events in this series
please visit developer oracle.com slash
code you'll find a complete list of all
upcoming events plus information on how
you can submit session proposals for
these upcoming events stay tuned for
more interviews from Oracle code
Washington DC for the Oracle technology
Network I'm Bob rhubarb thanks for
