humans jsr 310 date and time api's so
this will allow us to have a fluent api
because we don't type very fast our
fingers are sometimes broken it's hard
and it's thread-safe so we won't get
caught by humans running after us while
we're trying to figure out how to how to
do thread locals more typing and the
time zone handling is simplified and
there's a bunch of other benefits i'm
going to talk about it but those those
are our zombie researchers who figured
out this cool date and time stuff you
might you might recognize these guys
from around the conference they're
really smart but they look better as
zombies what do you think yeah and we
don't want to repeat this failure this
is the old date and time ap is when we
tried to coordinate an attack on
December 25th last year so it didn't go
over too well actually we had to use our
future zombies because it turned out
this was in the year 3913 since all the
dates are adjusted to by 1900 so we got
that a little wrong what else is wrong
with this month who said month ok smart
we're not so smart no range checking not
only is the month off the years now off
by one so don't do this fortunately the
new AP is actually have month Constance
use them
the rain checks they throw exceptions if
you have things out of range on integers
they don't have funky differences where
one field starts with one based one
field starts with zero base and it
avoids colossal failures like the
January 25th 3914 zombie invasion I used
my time machine to go in the future and
take this picture but it was a disaster
so a moment of silence for our our
zombie stormtrooper brethren who um who
died in this attack ok so I'm going to
train all of you guys as zombies Plus
Brian on how we can avoid this sort of
thing happening in the future using the
new date and time api's how many folks
have played around with the date and
time api's ok ok kill a little bit so
we're going to use our zombie friend and
and she's going to demonstrate how we
can leverage the date and time ap is to
conquer the human race
okay so first some really basic concepts
local date local time and local day time
are the classes you're going to most use
to represent dates then it simplifies
things because you can simply refer to
things in your local timezone and then
convert them later so about the only
thing you wouldn't want to use these for
is user display or if you're trying to
do like synchronization on servers of
dates or things where you care about
them having things be exactly according
to the epoch that's where you use an
instant these are good for time stamps
or other server calculations since
they're a precise point in time
regardless of time zones and then
periods and durations are also really
useful so I'm going to use these later
on but these allow you to have time
spans or well it's more like um length
of time period is length of time between
few dates duration is actually a length
of time by two instance and the first
thing we need to be able to do is be
able to create some data in time so
these are some common ways that you'll
get new date and time objects so there's
a now operation on local date local time
and local daytime that's a really good
way of getting the current time this
should be used in replacement of
anywhere you would have used like a new
date or a new calendar or any of the old
classes same thing for system dot get
what you might call it current time
Millie's our friends don't use that
there's a bunch of static helper classes
as well which are really good for
creating instances of date they're all
something dot of so you can specify
dates times daytime combinations using
local daytime and there's a whole bunch
of diff
in variations of this based upon how
much of the fields you want to fill out
you can leave fields empty and later on
you can mix in other dates using the the
width operator and temporal adjusters
and then you can also par States using a
format and you can convert between old
data objects in the new data objects so
whenever possible use the new data
objects so those are both anti-patterns
you wouldn't actually want to get a new
date and then convert it to an instant
simply to get the current time you'd
want to use now but if you have classes
or libraries which use the old data
api's you can actually convert between
them okay so we can create dates right
so the first thing we need for our
zombie simulator is a clock so we're
going to have a very simple class clock
timeline and this is going to increment
a you clock in the user interface every
well one millisecond is going to update
to the current time it's going to go
through and update the user interface so
let's let's take a look at our zombie
trainer application okay so like any
good programmer I have all the code for
the entire talk in here and we will not
show you everything just now okay that
looks almost good
maybe two AB you shouldn't do that yeah
and maybe we should do this one
Wow area
okay working zombie trainer again
hopefully and we are burning we don't
like burning and we have a formatted
time as well we don't want to format a
time yet
haha
ok now we're burning with ISO time which
is the default and we've died but as you
can see that is the most hideous clock
in the world I don't think any zombie
could get all those digits out while
grunting so the way we can improve on
this is to use a formatter where we can
specify different formats to improve the
date format and there's a few different
ways which we can do that so there's a
bunch of constants for common for
matters which you might want to use
basic iso iso time i sewed a time I so
weak date etc I believe I so time or
something close to it maybe basic I so
time is the default one that came up you
can also use localized for matters and
these are fairly convenient because
they'll actually give you a format which
is tailored for the locale with an
option of like a short medium long full
size for the date so that way you can
specify about how large you want the
date and then have it be locale
independent there's also string for
matters where you can specify crazy you
know pearl style funky letter dates just
like the old API as well had this for
for matters and the good thing about for
matters anyone remember simpledateformat
what what do you never do is simple date
format
yeah yeah it's like a one-time-use thing
it's you too if you want to you can use
it multiple times if you I think you
have to synchronize on thread on the
thread if you want to it has to be can
only be use from one threat at a time is
the deal so anyway the new ones are
immutable and thread safe they're great
for reuse it will make your life much
much better you won't get weird errors
in your day time due to lack of
synchronization on that and what we've
decided to do for our zombie clock is we
want it as short as possible because we
read very slowly so format style short
and then we can set the format on the
clock and tell exactly when we're going
to expire like that okay and i'm using
the short one here
alright so a little better okay but we
we're still dead it's not good who likes
sunlight you like sunlight Brian human
so sunlight burns I hate sunburn mix
your this kind of issue makes your skin
peel completely off it's very painful so
we need to find out a solution to this
this Sun the Sun is very bad for us you
guys have good nails zombie nails for
clawing and like ripping at people's
heads these are also good for something
else they're very good for for digging
so if we if we knew if we had a way to
compare dates and work with dates then
we would know when it's sunlight out and
we wouldn't be baking and dying in the
Sun right okay so there's a bunch of
really good convenience routines on time
and date is before and is after will let
you compare a couple dates you can also
get the individual fields and do stuff
with them so you can get the the fields
off of a year the fields off of the time
and there's even operations to add dates
and do other things to date so you can
combine those together to you know work
with different dates and then do
comparisons on them so we're going to do
something really simple which is to hide
from the sunlight okay so i've got a a
property here for whether it's night or
not so the reason I'm using this is so
it's observable whenever it's set
tonight it'll automatically update the
our interface and then we can calculate
whether it's night or not there's an
approximation but we're going to we're
going to hide it's 6am this is an
example of the earlier static
constructor using two of the fields and
we're going to wake up and attack the
humans around seven ish maybe a little
sunburn and then but it'll be okay it'll
be getting to to dusk and then you can
see at the end I'm binding whether we're
underground or not to the current time
whether it's day or night
okay so we've got our is night property
and then we're setting the value for
whether it's before six or after seven
and then we're going to check this
inside of our zombie character
okay so we're doing good we are we are
safe we're not going to burn anymore but
I don't think we're chasing any humans
either there's a problem so let's say
let's say we had some humans let's add
some humans in here because we need we
need some people to eat hey Brian we in
honor of Brian we need to we need to
make a brine in the game i think what
color what color is brian's hair
yellowish yellow okay this is brian
no show me the thank you thanks ok now
we've got Brian Brian zombie and we're
going to al these guys into the into the
game as well so let's add our friends
okay so we got our good friends walking
around now and as you can see this is
not very comfortable lots of food lots
of food but we can't eat it but alright
so let's say we're in California now if
we were in Europe it might be time for
for snacking on some humans just about
alright so one of the things you can you
can do in with the API is very easily
ouch don't step on me is you can change
the time zone which you're you're
pulling stuff back in for user interface
and rather than just relying upon
strings you have a new object those own
ID and this allows you to encapsulate
exactly what offset you're talking about
so in this case I'm getting zones for a
specific kind of standard time zone
europe paris there's also a list of
short IDs where you can get back common
abbreviations like PST PST and those
will give you back the appropriate zone
ID and you can also directly do offsets
i believe it goes down to like the
second although most people would
probably only use the hour and the
minute so we can effectively change use
the zone ID and then pass it in most of
the methods we've been using allow you
to directly use this or you can also use
i'll talk about this little bit later
but you can use on the zone daytime and
those objects so daytime now and you can
pass in a zone daytime at zone and this
will give you a zone daytime and then a
clock dot system
and I'm passing the zone ID and this
gives you a clock object something else
which is really good when you're testing
your applications is to use clock this
you can add to your classes via
dependency injection and then when
you're writing unit tests against your
code you can modify which clock you're
using to simulate different scenarios by
changing the application level clock so
it's also a really convenient way for us
to make it night so let's see if we can
get night either doing this so this is
one example right picking a specific
locale and then using the now with the
zone ID I think it's actually preferred
in general to use a clock across your
system if you can and then this way you
can have one clock that you're passing
around to all of your things and then
getting the same time back in production
you'd set it to the the current time or
the system time but during testing this
will let you simulate different
scenarios you can set it to a fixed time
or offset it appropriately
alright so let's try London first maybe
I'll work what is this tell joy
Oh Brian what are your friends doing
that's not fair we can we can't eat
humans I mean we're safe now but we
can't eat humans if we're if we're out
here what do you think should we go to
the church well we have to try it right
I mean and our test zombie she she lives
for for punishment oh okay so not too
good your friends have good defenses in
the church all right and the other way
we could try it is we could actually
instantiate a clock or is the clock one
clock clock clock I will have a whole
bunch of different clocks let me let me
show you a fun clock you'll like this
one if that was right it would be even
more fun
so something else we can do see now
we're walking normal speed but I've
defined a special clock which allows us
to speed up time even faster and you can
actually see the minutes visibly ticking
now and just for kicks
okay now we're going to work going
really fast but this will show you how
futile it is so we're during the daytime
we can't even touch the humans were nice
and happy hidden underground and then
the moment it turns to night they're all
going to hide the little church and
leave this out roaming the roaming
around without any good food 67 all
right so we it's a weed to fix this
problem no good humans and their
churches mmm I think we I think we need
some allies to fight the humans
so we're going to we're going to make
use of temporal adjusters temporal
adjusters are a cool way where you can
take an existing date and then modify
the date you can actually you can use
the temporal adjusters directly by doing
dot and so connected gesture was it do
to do to do I forget the name of the
function and then passing in the date
but the more common way of doing it and
the more kind of idiomatic way is doing
date dot with passing in a temporal
adjuster and then that will modify the
date which you pass in so here are some
really simple examples day of week and
month first day a month first day of
next year last day of month anyone
recognize this slide for before the
presentation and that's an example of
creating a custom temporal adjuster so
this is one which is actually in the JDK
so this is a definition of last day of
month and you can see it's fairly
concise they just used a lambda
expression and they do temporal dot
width give it a day of month and
temporal dot range they have month and
get the maximum and this gets you the
last day of the month and then it blends
it back in and you get the last day of
the month very very convenient temporal
adjuster here is my friday the 13th
temporal adjuster so i put together a
quick temporal adjuster which will first
check to see if we're before after the
13th of the current month and if we're
if we're before it just you know rounds
it up in the current month to 13
otherwise it'll add one to the month and
then get the next 13th on the next month
and then it goes through and checks that
to see if it's a friday and then keep
some incrementing it by one month until
we hit up prior to the 13th so it's
fairly simple there
right there might be like a cool friday
the 13th algorithm which gets you this
more directly but this this works pretty
quickly and will give us friday the 13th
and you know you know what comes out on
friday the 13th right ghouls and goblins
and all of our all of our friends who we
need to fight him
alright so let's let's find our friday
the 13th clock there we go and so this
guy well first off sets it by 12 hours
so it's night and then grabs our friday
the 13th adjuster in the clock and then
here's the same code from the slide for
the actual adjuster uh-huh so fairly
easy you can see my debugging code and
there as well that's wonderful oh and we
need we need some gravestones too we
couldn't do this without some good
tombstones
that was a little too fast all right oh
wait wait wait no no okay the people
disappeared in the church but we're
still we're still in crazy fast time
okay let's um let's turn our speed down
OOP ok back to regular speed okay there
we go so the people they're hiding in
the church but they think they're safe
but we need some friends so since it's
friday the 13th if we step on one of
these guys we get a we get a little
ghoul do you like goals Brian no no we
like ghouls though okay so we got our we
are two ghoul friends alright so i think
i think we need more goals let's try
that again how many goals do you think
we need to kill the humans 20 all right
how about how about I go with like five
because there are 5 units 3 4 5 okay
let's see now it's now at six on one so
we're 6 on 5 I think we're gonna I think
we're going to do a little fair a little
better this time alright so Brian your
comrades they did not fare too well
and we code for brains what should we do
with Brian well I'll be just letting go
all right so thank you Brian and thanks
everyone for attending the zombie time
presentation this is my blog and some
more information about about stuff I do
and I'm doing interviews in the night
hacking area this whole week if you want
to come and drop by and if you're
curious about any of the code i was
showing i haven't done this yet but i'm
going to pop it on github so it's kind
of like fresh off the hacking table but
it will appear and github shortly on any
suggestions on in improvements please
let me know little tweaks or things
which could clean up stuff and better
explain it and let's take some let's
take some questions and i'll let you
guys out of here early so anybody have a
daytime question or why i see an example
of something else which i didn't show
hmm no Brian you've been taking notes
there to report back to your human
friends build-a-bear church alright so
thank you very much and enjoy the job
one conference
