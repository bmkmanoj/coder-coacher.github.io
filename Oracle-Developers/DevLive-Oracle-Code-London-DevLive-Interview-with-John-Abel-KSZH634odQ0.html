Oracle code London
I'm your host Javed Mohammed and we were
very honored to have as our guest today
John Abel who's the head of Oracle cloud
UK yeah hello John thank you very much
for joining us how are you excellent
thank you so we're coming towards the
end of the day for Oracle cloud London
give us your impressions I I think
what's been really good is being and
reconnecting with the developers you
know for me it's one of those things
that I grew up when I started my career
you know working with developer
community
because there's a huge amount of
benefits you get first of all you start
seeing the innovation that's coming out
in the future
mm-hm you start hearing what people are
using for development and how they're
structuring their code their techniques
they're using and also you you get to
understand what the business is
challenging them with to actually answer
business problems because with
everything you you know when you're
dealing with a development community the
the art of the possible what you're
trying to answer is many different
things across the business so it's a
great way to experience I think one of
the things I've surprised me the most is
a the amount of people that attend which
is fantastic
yeah it's like the the keynote
everything it was like full hurry as
well the following such a amount of
people but the biggest thing I think
it's a diversity of discussion what just
like I said about everything that the
business are trying to do there's lots
of different things that are happening
which means this huge amount of
opportunity developers also in the even
in the keynotes we've had people doing
apex docker Java we've had people doing
you know a huge range of different
presentations which him one conference
is really unique when you think we're in
the basement of a Main Street London
building it's fantastic really good
great
so Deepak made several announcements so
in the keynote you know and so someone
being someone who's kind of targeting
the developer community obviously we've
got a great offerings from assassin
power standpoint that was got the you
know their bevels
is just I'm just kind of curious from a
from a UK Ireland Israel is a UK focus
any any particular message you'd like to
share with the developers out there I I
suppose the thing I've said is open your
mind up to what Oracle is now I think
people have got different views of
Oracle it could be the view of how we've
acquired you as a customer through one
of our acquisitions it could be a view
of how we've acquired you through the
maturity of engagement with us Ron let's
say we were a database company I think
what is Oracle now is a very different
beast to what Oracle was when I joined
and I suppose the the developer has to
understand that actually through the
natural acquisitions that we're making
we're probably more now cloud native
than we are historical from when I
joined which means that actually Oracle
can have a lot of conversations and the
biggest benefit we give the developer
not only is we've got a huge amount of
technology they can consume and remember
most the technology we're talking about
is open source but actually we also give
them a route to the enterprise in if you
think about Deepak's
and I know Deepak so well we've he's
brilliant presenter but what we got with
fair metal for the developer is the
ability to have everything can
enterprise needs my availability
security adaptability but also connect
with what the developer needs so the
ability now support Dockers
containerization to have the ability to
support any flavored technology you want
knowing that when you want to go from
unique innovation to scale up you can
scale up without moving platforms
because a lot of developers one of the
challenges I have is breaking into the
scaling market and if you know the
platform's going to scale with you and
another dear friend of mine Gary you
interviewed earlier on commands later
you probably talked about that there
that he doesn't have to worry about the
platform element he's basically buying
an integrated network solution and he
just has to worry about the development
piece his unique IP putting on top of it
and that is a huge advantage that you
know if they can get one thing that I
find and I think you actually touched
upon that is that as much as you know
any new generation technology comes
about whether it be darker whether it be
cloud
the reality of the world is that and
microservices you name it right not
everybody kind of moves then I think one
of the interesting things that article
has to offer is this hybrid cloud model
that some people may choose to stay
on-premise some people may want private
clouds some people made we wait for the
public cloud and any thoughts or
thoughts about that what I see in most
of our customers and CVT ads we have
400,000 customers so we get a good
barometer or going on there's two cliffs
that clear themes that are coming out
one is the modernization theme how do i
modernize the business of the future
that may be modernizing applications it
may be modernizing business process what
we're also seeing is innovation and most
customers realize now in this digital
economy to stay of meaning to your
customers you've got to have a very good
digital experience and that's where the
developer community becomes key to
actually providing that accelerated
benefit to the customers and you know if
you look at what's happening in this
world today to businesses have to think
with this bimodal mindset of saying
modernize on 1/2 2 funds and feed into
innovation again what you think what
Oracle's doing we use the heritage and
our knowledge and experience to allow us
a free to modernize but we also have a
high amount of init of type solutions
and if you lend if you look across I owe
ta I machine learning if you look across
the way we're doing containerization the
way that we're scaling all of these
unique IP and we're very lucky Oracle we
have so many developers under Thomas
Korean that means that we can absolutely
accelerate value to those communities so
when the businesses we need to innovate
they can scale and innovate at speed and
I think that's very unique from a
company right so John little a little
bit before we came on camera we were
just talking about a little bit about my
background I've been ducking around that
different startups that didn't make me
rich or famous you mentioned you've been
at article 24 years yeah yeah so and you
mentioned early on in our conversation
that the article of today's it's not the
article at the pass and people have some
perceptions just kind of stepping back a
little bit from technology and
everything what
kind of the height I mean 24 years you
don't come across too many people with
that kind of longevity yeah what was the
height what was can you probably share
with us a high point in your career that
perhaps some of the folks out there
might find interesting
so and this is a developer audience I'm
here I'll share a few things and they
can all search this on Google so I can
they could look up real time as well
here as though I've had a huge amount of
opportunities at Oracle
I mean Oracle's been you know and I'm
not saying this because I'm an Oracle
employee the the same breadth of
offerings we have as Oracle is the same
breakfast opportunity we have as an
employer which means that you know I've
had the luxury of running open hack so I
remember Larry offers if someone could
break our database I ran that I had to I
was a hacker at one point so I had to
secure Oracle running on that with a
dear friend of mine called Ian Bryson
that was fantastic having and they
didn't break in thank God I'm still here
so I'm very pleased with that but that
was that was a highlight of showing the
power and that was using all open source
with our database that was blending
proprietary with open source the other
one I did was the first electronic
voting system in the UK well though that
was using multi-channel now I'm going to
give you the date so that was I'll give
you the date last so that was
interactive digital TV SMS secure voting
over SMS for a national election Pro
that was web postal voice DTMF touch
phone that was also kiosks and polling
stations okay now this will shock people
because I only realize this the other
day I did that 15 years ago
well 2002 I wish you'd shared some of
their technology with us in stateside
yes yeah well it would have been
different I suppose the one that I I'm
the face much the fondest off which is
really that the era we're getting into
now is the era
I joined Oracle so the era when Oracle
was the most value to the business was
when we connected with a developer and
everything I did back then was what as a
consultant was innovating with the
developer community and we're now and I
think is 24 years later
20 years later we're now back to there
again where the modern eco economy
because of digitization because of new
routes to market means that we're having
to much more connect with the roots that
we grew up with to come to the company
we were back in the last 15 and 10 years
ago and I think it's a pleasure you know
it's a real exciting point again because
the beauty of connecting with developers
is the rawness of the conversation the
rawness in they don't have politics they
don't it's unfiltered yeah it's
unfiltered is you get this brilliant
ability to connect with real-time
innovation but a difference I was
printing for some students recently and
I was taught about machine learning and
I was talking about AI and I grew up
with that and I said the the shock for
you all is I said most the algorithms
you're now getting excited about I said
were invented when I was in the same
seats you're in now I said the biggest
difference between then and now
isn't that the algorithms have changed
deep learning is no different the
ability that you've got that I never had
is the ability to scale if I wanted to
prove artificial intelligence or machine
learning when I was a college I'd have
to find a supercomputer now I ran on a
prime 9 9 5 5 and there was very few
places have that capability now they can
go on to Oracle comm spin up their metal
10,000 cause of compute price that near
enough nothing compared to what I was
having to pay and immediately try this
technology out at scale and that's the
biggest difference I've seen between
when I started and now that actually I
was using C++ and then quickly went into
Java when it was invented but I never
could scale without a huge amount of
barriers being provided for me to jump
through now I can scale without any
barriers there which means that the
innovation acceleration is so much
easier now so I wish I I had mine
my ability then now because it's a
really exciting time Back to the Future
Back to the Future back to coding future
but I really want to thank you for
encapsulating both
I guess the trends in technology as well
as from your personal experience that in
with all of these you know price
performance improvements is really or
the thing that distilled down to at
scale so that the ability to scale is
what it really kind of provides you
going going for a leg absolutely and you
know if anybody who's watching this
wants to connect me on LinkedIn or
Twitter please use me because what I
really what I want to do is change the
mindset of our customers okay because
the biggest challenge in the cloud era
the developer era now is culture
absolutely culture is the number you
know security is the formal number one
block up the the hidden blocker which we
don't dare talk about this culture the
Oracle culture is radically changing
we're changing as a company what we want
to do is just share our excitement with
our customers and future customers and
and actually just think we are
culturally changing and if you think
differently about Oracle try this stuff
out and come to these events you'll have
a you'll have a very different view of
Oracle very different you and I hope you
know people do
okay well John think really and so much
for coming down oh thank you very much
and thank you for tuning in here - the
