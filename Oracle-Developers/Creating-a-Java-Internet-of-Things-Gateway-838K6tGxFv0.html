started start by introducing myself my
name is David Wood I am a software
engineer with eurotech I focused mainly
on ESF which is our software framework
for your tech hardware as well as
everywhere cloud which is uh the your
tech cloud platform I've also been
heavily involved recently with a cura
project which is the open sourcing of
part of ESF through the Eclipse
Foundation to offer a cure to the open
source community so hopefully you guys
have had a chance to talk to the Eclipse
guys may be good by the booth may be
good by the Eurotech booth and hear a
bit about Kiera
if not we'll certainly talk about that
today the goal is to introduce multi
service gateways and some more detail
show how Curos sort of solved some of
the issues with multi service gateways
give you a sort of a simplified real
world example and some code to show you
how to get started with kora and then at
the end certainly have time for Q&amp;amp;A so
that you know creating a java Internet
of Things gateway why do we care like
why do we need it you know if you are
trying to solve this problem you may not
need it if you just have a single sensor
you need to this measuring data you need
to get that data through the cloud to a
single business application maybe you
don't need the complexity of a multi
service gateway but there are issues
here I don't know if anybody wants take
a guess and what the issues might be
anyone well I think an obvious one will
be scalability right I mean one sense
are great but more than one sensor and
you'd be in having problems right you
have several communication buses you
have several different maybe connections
to the Internet you know maybe it's
Wireless maybe it's cellular and how do
you how do you manage all this you know
it's not realistic to buy a different
Gateway for every sensor that you may
have in your in your network
and this is a really only half the
problem right this is only dealing with
the device side you also have to deal
with your business logic so you have
multiple consumers of your data how do
you get the data to to those consumers
it was the rest is it is it WebSocket
and how are you how are you consuming
that data so step one would be to sort
of think capsulate be complexity like
what makes it hard let's sort of
identify that and striked out as much of
that complexity as we can one area was
in the cloud so having a strong cloud
platform that allows you to store your
data access your data control your
devices do all the remote management
that you would need in these types of
sensor networks the other piece would be
on the device side so this is the multi
service gateway like how do you manage
serial connections and I Square C can
bus Modbus as well as connections at the
transport level so you're sending data
to the cloud what happens when your
connection drops and what if you have
really important messages that you need
to get out and you know your connections
coming in and out like how do you manage
all that and this is the solution we're
gonna focus on today is this multi
service gateway and this is exactly
where tora fits in ok so this is a nice
slide I think it shows sort of like the
evolution of where a developer has spent
their time sort of starting with the
days of programming directly against the
Linux and C low-level languages you know
it took a lot of time it wasn't very
portable so you know we introduced Java
job or remove some that a complexity
certainly makes it more portable across
different systems and then on top of
that we can introduce OSGi and OSGi I
don't know how familiar the room is with
OSGi but it offers the ability to
modular eliezer your your applications
so you can have components that you can
drop in you can take out you know
you can update makes application
development development very very fast
because you can reuse reuse your IP on
top of that as where we put Jorah so to
cure uh it's a framework that runs on so
Noah CI framework runs in those giant
framework it allows for service based
development so you develop your services
you offer those services in the OSGi
framework and then you can have
applications consuming those services
which makes it you know easily easily
updatable very modular and very portable
and the end goal is having developers
spending their time where it's important
which is solving a problem not you know
sort of reinventing the wheel every
single time they have to do a
development project so sort of brings us
to to Kira and and and why like why you
know your tech has the solution why did
we decide to work with Eclipse to open
source this to the to the community and
I think from our experience dealing with
customers what we saw was a it was a big
fragmentation and the industry of how
people were solving this problem and we
were seeing those like the same problems
come up over and over again and it was
really sort of hindering the growth of
IOT and the growth of the Internet of
Things so we said okay well let's
contribute to the community let's work
with the clips and get something out
there that will help maybe solve solve
some of these issues so that's what we
did so we started the project June of
2013 roughly where we you know created
the project charter went through all the
steps to get that traded with with
eclipse a short time after we sort of
forked if you will
not really but sort SF to Kira and made
her first commit to eclipse not long
after that we did sort of our incubation
release so when you're in this process
with a clip sure and what they call
incubation where you know it's not
really a mature project you're still
working out some of the not bugs as much
as just making sure you're fitting into
the
a model that's portable across there
their ecosystem and then recently
September of this month of this year we
graduated from incubation and are now
doing our first 1.8 release so this is
actually a big deal within Eclipse and
we're very proud of this and it's
available now so you can go get cura is
1.2 and it was a big milestone for us ok
so this chart shows a overview sort of
the stack of where cure fits in again
you see the you see the linux layer and
the Java and the OSGi and and then cure
and then what is what does PR offer it
offers you know management of things
like your like your network so we all
like network services so you know remove
that complexity of having to like
configure teather net or configure your
Wi-Fi or configure your cellular like we
can handle that for you through our
through our UIs
my name is cloud connectivity and again
I've talked about this it's very
important you know if you're sending
data and awesome something happens and
that data is in that you know that
connections gone especially if you're on
cellular right I mean that can happen
very easily you know what happens you
just stop sending data you know do you
you know what do you do so we offer a
solution for that that uh we'll get into
in more detail in a few slides
supporting different protocols I mean I
think again sensors come in lots of
different forms and you want to be agile
enough that you can move to it from one
sensor to the next so you can do serial
you can do I square C you can do can and
then remote management I mean I think
again these sensors are often revoked
right these are not I'll think I'll be
in your office like you're gonna need to
be able to access them through the cloud
through a nice cloud platform so you can
do updates so you can check your own
check your data and it's a you know a
cohesive solution so it's portable and
again this is with Java Noah's gyre you
get a portability
you don't have to read your application
differently for every single gateway you
may encounter okay and here's you know
sort of a very detailed slide and you
know basically what it's showing is like
the different different sort of
abstraction so if you will within within
the framework so you have your device
abstraction where you know we we
abstract away the serial we have step
distract away the I square see the basic
gateway services such as you know the
watchdog the the database service
network configuration again I think is a
big one I think a lot of people
especially who work in the Linux world
know how important that can be
to have that complexity removed from
your from your application developers
field protocol so I mean they like you
know again canvas Modbus I've been some
proprietary protocols can fit in the
space QR offers you know can and bop us
as part of the that's part of the
download so if you download jorah you
get that for you know it's part of the
package
you know the applications you that you
would write what's kind of on the top of
this so it would be consuming these
services maybe providing your own
services depending on your on your
application remote management again
being able to connect to this device and
get information about this device update
your your applications check on status
of you know various parameters and then
also there are a group of services that
come inside of korah
that you can see over there on the right
side that once you start cura and you
open the web UI these are offered as you
know sort of point-and-click sort of
things that you can control from the web
UI which are really great and we'll see
some of these but things like you know
like the transport layer like the clock
service like how do you how do you sync
your your clock on your system SSL and
if you're if you're doing SSL
connections of to the cloud you know you
can set various parameters here
so a bit about the you know if you are a
developer and you are wanting to to work
with Cora there are a couple of options
we absolutely want you to be a
contributor to the project and that
would be no telling the source code
building the source code and you know
doing the whole nine yards and that is
extremely important and you know we'll
talk about that a bit at the end but you
know going to eclipse.org slash Cora and
checking out how you can contribute is
very very important now there's mailing
lists and all kinds of ways to get
involved there's also an option if you
just need to write your applications
against your right so you can download a
workspace into your into eclipse just a
zip file you you import it you get the
API bundle you get all the jar files you
need we also give you an emulator so you
write your application against the api's
you can test it within your within your
right on your laptop you know your
running OSX or Linux we have emulators
that can run you know write any laptop
so you can see if it's doing what you
expect it to you and then if you're
happy with it you know if you get
through all that and you're you're very
happy with what your application is
doing then we have very simple
mechanisms for you know connecting to
your OS chat framework if you already
have it installed dropping in your
application and having a start so
there's some very neat things and there
are several ways to do that you can do
it directly from eclipse you can also do
it through the web UI if you already
have you are running on your own your
target device and if you are cloud
connected as we'll show today you do
have also the ability to manage these
same services are the same applications
from from the cloud and there's quite a
bit of duplication from what you can do
locally connected to your machine but
you can also do it through the cloud and
that's a very very important piece
okay so so transport so this is very
important and we offer Acura several
options for doing this transport layer
so this is you have data from your
sensor and you want to send it send it
out so the top what we call the data
transport service is pretty pretty
pretty simple it's implementing an MQTT
you make your connection you can publish
you can subscribe you can send your data
you can receive your data it's pretty
straightforward this is if you have seen
Benjamin's Vigilant copies of
presentation of the green house demo
with the clips this is exactly what
they're doing very effective very easy
to use on top of this is the data
service so the data service is actually
going to sort of delegate all the
transport layer functionality to the
data to the transport service but it's
going to offer you a few other options
and it's going to do things like by
buffering messages that need to be sent
and in case your connection goes down so
you're sending messages the connection
drops we're gonna start buffering those
when you get your connects your back
will start sending sending those out a
very important feature this is also
being able to define sort of the you
know importance of those messages so you
can say this message
you know I lose my connection as soon as
to get it back this needs to be the
first one that goes out so we have that
sort of control of you know of
importance of you know if you have super
important messages we know those need to
be scheduled first versus those that
maybe can maybe can wait and another
layer on top of this will be the big
file service this does really some cool
stuff and I think one of the coolest
things is this allows you to use these
same transport mechanisms across
multiple applications on your gateway so
you can write you have multiple
different applications doing very
different things but use these same
transport layers and the cloud service
will actually manage the separation of
of data topics so it won't let you know
you can have the same you know
temperature reading in two different
locations and they won't collide because
we're gonna separate those through the
different applications and we'll I'll
show you some examples of this where
hopefully it'll be a little more make
more sense I we also do some sort of
enhanced serialization to the service so
we use Google protobufs
I don't know familiarity with this
mechanism for like compressing the data
sending it over the wire in a very very
small footprint we can also zip that
data to using gzip and it makes it very
very small if you have large large data
lifecycle messages you know very
important so you know when your windows
your device connect when is your diet
device disconnect it was it did it
disconnect and say that it was
disconnecting in order to just go away
you know you can go to the cloud and log
in and see your device and see what
happened you know what events have
happened you know did it did its tell me
that it was going away did it come back
you know what is what is going on it
does us not just for the device but also
for your applications so you can see
kind of like what what your application
is doing so very very powerful service
I know code it's hard to read on the
slide so I'm gonna try switch over here
to my editor and show you this
okay still hear me okay okay okay so
what this is showing you here is the
well we you know the configurable
configurable component of your ax and
this is sort of the basis of what you
would do if you write application you
would implement this interface and we'll
go to the interface a bit more later but
doing this allows you to expose your
application to the OSGi configuration
admin which allows you to do real-time
updates of your application and it
controls life cycle and has lots of
great management features so most times
when you write an application you would
implement this interface and use this
feature and one of the ways to use this
is by specifying metadata that the
configure will go the configurable
component will will consume and you do
that through XML files this is one here
for what the greenhouse demo again that
Benjamin did that I've sort of extended
and what this is is specifying a warning
level so what I want to say here is that
I have a level that if we fall below
this level I want to trigger some sort
of alarm right now set some default
value to 20 degrees C right so not
really exciting but let's see how this
is actually
well looks like she works so when I do
that you'll notice that my services are
now appearing in in my web UI so this is
Sakura web UI and the green house
publisher service is running and you can
see that now the warning level is
showing up in my in my UI and where this
is really powerful is you don't actually
need a developer to come change the
warning level at this point like you
don't need to know XML you don't need to
know Java you know all you need to know
how to click on that box and change the
value to 25 click apply it you know
alerts the configuration admin within
the OCI it'll update this application
and now you have a new a new warning
level and the same functionality so this
is the actual cura web UI but this same
functionality is available through the
web so you can do this from anywhere and
I believe
right so hopefully can see that okay so
this would be that everywhere cloud
console and this is the demo that I have
running here with the Raspberry Pi hope
I can
so this Raspberry Pi is actually in the
in the exhibition hall but you can see
from here I'm not going to because I
don't want to if they're showing some
money at the mill I don't want to
confuse what they're doing but I could
change this value you know to 25 click
apply and then very shortly they will
start seeing warnings in the exhibition
hall and it's very very cool feature
like I don't need to have the Raspberry
Pi especially located me at all
the network service and again I thought
about this a few times but this is again
showing the raspberry so you're only
seeing the the one he's an interface but
you can imagine a system where you have
make multiple Ethernet wireless cellular
you can configure all that by you know
point-and-click if you will and we do
not only the you know the basic DHCP you
know Wireless options that you can also
do things like setting up your own
access point if you have wireless force
tablet or you can do all your all your
you know modem configuration on the
front end we have the firewall so if you
want to you know do specific rules for
forwarding port forwarding all this can
be managed through through the through
the web UI you know very very important
we internally use this all the time this
was very very important ok so again this
is the demo that mostly was done by
Benjamin he did a great job setting this
up I extended it slightly and I'll show
you kind of where I diverges from what
he was doing but basically this is our
simple system right so very similar to
what we showed on the very first slides
is you have a couple different
communication busses so you have
i-square see you have you know digital
over GPIO with a simple LED a couple of
sensors measuring data connected to a
Raspberry Pi running cura okay maybe
transfer our communication to the web
over mqtt using PAHO which is another
of a source project through eclipse to
that everywhere cloud and from there
everywhere cloud we're gonna do both
rest calls and WebSocket to our business
application so you can see here we have
the multiple communication and the
multiple consumer right we're consuming
data in different ways and we're you
know handling all that through the cloud
and through and through Kiera so in the
application these are some of the
services that we're using
so the cloud client listener so those
listening for you know those listening
for events I'm sorry it's listening for
events like a message arrived being able
to send messages of cloud service which
we've already talked about and I'm
hoping I'll show you in code sort of how
this is working and you know why this is
important so those are both from cura
from the actual application when you
have like the sensor change listener so
the you know obviously the sensor has
done something it needs to let people
know so this is how you consume that
event and the greanhouse service and
this is like the main application that
you'll see is actually providing the the
configure components and these sorts of
things
yes so back to the code and the codes
here mainly so when you download the
slides you can have some reference but I
know it's very hard to see about there
okay so here's the greenhouse puppet sir
as you can see is implementing the
configurable component as that we talked
about earlier it's also implementing the
cloud client listener and the sensor
change listener so very busy class here
one important thing to note is with the
cloud service you know what you do is
you specify an application ID some way
of uniquely identifying this application
with a cura and this is how the cloud
service sort of sections the the topic
space so that knows how to keep the data
separate across your different your
different applications and you can see
here is the warning level that I showed
earlier where you defined that in your
XML so you would we'll see where this
gets brought in in a minute
so yeah this is OSGi so you define your
dependencies one of our dependencies we
set as the cloud service and then once
once this once this bundle activates so
what's this bundle starts it will use
the cloud service to get a new client
which will be all the transport layer
and all the data buffering and all that
based on on the app ID all right so now
you have a client that is unique within
cura that you can send data consume data
and handle your application through that
method you also define the listener
which in this case is in the same class
and of course when you do you activate
you want to let that release that client
here you can say you once we have
detected an event where the connection
is established it we're now connected to
a broker and this is you know all in the
terms of mptp in this case we're just
going to subscribe on hash so we're
gonna get everything all messages that
are coming from this broker
let's get out something interesting
alright so here's the old sensor change
so now this is saying that one of our
sensors on our I square si bus or the
LED has changed its its state in some
way so it's going to notify this well
the first things we do is you'll see
here's our warning level again so we're
bringing in from our properties and this
is from the OSGi configuration admin
we're breaking we're gonna bring in our
properties one of which is the warning
level that we defined we're gonna set up
our topic that we're gonna publish on so
in this case is going to be you know
here we're doing the prefix + censors
and then the how-to slides showing you
for the topic space that we used but it
kind of makes sense right and we're
gonna publish some information about
sensors so we'll call it sensors + the
sensor name is that the LED is the
temperature as a community and what is
it and then we're gonna create our
payload and this is this is gonna be the
actual data that we send on this topic
and then first thing we do is we'll set
the time so we know when this happened
and then we're gonna add a metric and
you can add macaws multiple metrics here
to your to your payload in this case
we're just gonna do value we're gonna
send the value that we got from the
sensor and then you know if it's a
temperature we're gonna check our
warning level and depending on the value
of that we can say okay we'll send then
we needed warned or that we don't need
to warn and again this is just adding
another metric to our mailer
that has
and little further down here's where we
publish so we publish to the topic we
come publish to payload some other
things like us I retain and then this is
our yep so this is our priority so too
is kind of low priority you know zero
one two and this says how important is
this message so if we do if we are
buffering messages for some reason we
will use these values to say you know
this is more important than this so it's
just a way of prioritizing and that's it
and now your application is doing all
this really without knowing a whole lot
about what's going on on the transport
layer
you know is it are you connected are you
not connected where you connect it to it
really doesn't matter and even though
you know this is MPT T but it doesn't
even need to be right I mean this is all
been distracted away and all you are
concerned about is this is the data I'm
sending you less than it
sorry
and bitching women would do this quite a
bit so I'm not gonna spend much time on
this this is the this is the actual
greenhouse service that you would you
would use to sort of interface with your
with your devices so with your sensors
so this is you know and this is using PI
for J and you can see yes so and then
you know pretty pretty straightforward
you know you get it you get an instance
of the factory you define what you're
connecting to it in this case is I
squared C you set your I square C
address of your device here we have two
guys on our I square C bus here's the
GPI control GPIO controller and then
further down you know we're just gonna
we're just gonna start polling and
pretty simple we're just gonna keep
looking keep asking what's your
temperature watch your temperature
what's your community and then it'll
send back data
oh sorry
yeah and then you know then we have sort
of a sort of definition like you know if
humidity or temperature has changed by
some amount of value then we're going to
notify we're gonna say okay we have a
condition that we care about we're gonna
tell our listeners that you need to be
aware and need to send the message out
to out to your business your business
money so pretty straightforward I mean
we didn't have to do any any dealing
with Isis the you know cereal like
banging on cereal like you know we did
this thing this is what we're getting
through yeah this is our data they
listened it out
yeah so here's the thought console again
I showed you this a bit
very neat tool in using the cloud
service allows you to connect to this
and see all of your device information
so you can see any devices that you have
connected not connected sort of they're
their alerts you see your data so you
can get like historical views of your
data you can get through one of the
really cool features is if you have a
whole bunch of devices you know hundreds
of thousands of devices on the right
over there you can see all of the ways
of tagging your devices sorting your
devices you know so if you need to see
all your devices that are in Kansas like
you can tag those and you know through a
couple button clicks you can see all
your devices in their status of what's
going on in Kansas at the and once you
click on a device you know you get all
of the all of the management of the
device that you would get if you were
directly connected to it right so you
can update your applications you can
check them like waiting it was their IP
address what is if you have GPS you know
what is their location you know we have
plate full features don't like you know
being like maps and all kinds of cool
stuff I mean we could definitely do a
whole similar on on February cloud but
very very cool stuff yes
this is an open connection
right so I mean you know in Fiji is a
pretty lightweight protocol I mean it
connects every TCP with actual a PTT
layers pretty pretty lightweight you can
manage that again like if you need to
close your connection you can certainly
do that you know you can from the from
the service you can open your connection
you can close your connection you can
reopen it when you need to so if you're
only sending data you know daily you can
go open your connection send your data
and close it depends on the broker so
yeah well I think this is okay for here
so so this is the demo that I set up and
what you're seeing here so this will be
your business logic right this will be
the consuming of the messages we're
sending out the green boxes are the
white and the green up there is
WebSocket so that's doing direct
connection over WebSocket to the broker
and getting data in real time so as soon
as you know as soon as the server
detects the change it pushes that data
to the client and everybody loves
WebSockets not right there very cool and
the graph on the bottom our API calls so
that's showing two very different ways
of getting data both very important so
the date on the bottom is like more
historical like what's not dated been
for the past day or hour or minute you
can get that either way I don't wanna
mess up the guys in the booth but the
little white icon you can click on it
send the message to your device saying
hey go turn on the LED and it'll turn on
and show a notification that it's owned
and then then you have the little
warning bell that if we drop a lower
temperature you'll get a visual warning
that hey something's going wrong if you
haven't stopped by the ER tech booth you
know definite stop by and we can I can
show you all the inner workings of this
okay so this is the topic space then
again sir you've got depending on your
familiar familiar already with mqtt this
may mean a lot or nothing but basically
what it's showing is how we broke down
the topic space so Java went demo is
like the high level topic separated
between sensors and act and actuator so
are we you know it's a data that we're
reading or something that we need to go
do so that's like a you know sort of
obvious separation of topic space and
then all those sensors you can see that
we have like the temperature the
humidity and the light and through each
of the sensors in the payload what
you'll get is a timestamp so what time
did we take this measurement and and the
value and potential warning but you know
what's important about payload is you
can add here whatever you whatever is
important to you okay there's really I
mean this this is where you can be
creative like GP like GPS coordinates
whatever whatever you want add here can
commute it
and here's a slide we offer this
question a lot is it does Korea have a
commercially supported version and it's
sort of like circular logic Korea came
from ESF which is a commercially
supported product so absolutely yes
es F is Cora plus and some add-on so
there's things that when we release Kura
that we didn't open up to the open
source community so if you go to the
commercial version you get you know
probably most importantly commercial
support so you get your tech supporting
you but then you get some these other
features like Diagnostics VPN is a huge
one being able to put us devices in
different areas of the world on the same
network through your cloud is incredibly
important and very neat we have some
bundles for dual protocols that are a
little bit you know not proprietary but
very specific that we didn't feel like
was necessary at this point for the
open-source community but you would give
those as well just some of our industry
experience you'll get those as well
a device provisioning so the ability to
say here's you know 100 devices that I
don't want active right now but I won't
be able to say all right now you go be
active and go do some work so device
management again extremely important for
scalability
and then the last slide that I have is I
think the message why we have a source
that is that you are very important in
making this successful we know we we at
your tech thought this was important we
saw a issue in the industry and we
thought it important that we attempt to
address it but what's important is
getting feedback and letting us know
what works what doesn't work
contributing again go to yeah a cliff
side work flash bureau a lot of
information there and if you don't see
information there
there are mailing lists and I read every
mail that comes to the mailing list of
feel free let us know stop by our booth
if you haven't Eurotech we have a booth
right across from eclipse so you can do
both great you know the same time we can
see us we're happy to talk to you about
it more detail about ESF about
everywhere cloud about cura
whatever we have quite a few sales guys
and today too so they can go in much
more detail about different offerings
and solutions that they can they can do
so I think with that
I think I am I'm done so definitely
questions awesome so you guys okay yes
probably so the raspberry publishers on
the Raspberry Pi
yes
well so so you have a client right you
have an MQTT client so mqt clients
running on the raspberry that can
publish or subscribe so it's doing so
it's listening for events so it says oh
you know the temperature changed on this
sensor I'm gonna publish the message up
to the cloud on my in the web browser
there's also a client running to
subscribe to two messages so it gets
this new topic and says you know good
display what I've seen
going the other way you like if I click
on the icon in the web browser it's
gonna publish a message that my
raspberry is listening for that will
receive as an event and and go act on
that that answer your question I think
yeah okay okay yeah maybe yes sir and I
can show you the code I'm sure
I mean it works I mean I think you know
sailor is a challenge but it is I think
the the lightweight protocol being so
like lightweight I think it makes it
nice for cellular so you don't have to
worry about you know the data bloat the
connectivity is the thing and that's one
of the things we try to address in the
transport layers so we try to manage
some that for you so like if you're
dropping connections we try to help as
much as we can with buffering and that
sort of thing as far as efficiency I
don't know this is a solution that seems
to work and has worked in industry so
people people yeah and again if you have
these kind of questions certainly we
have cells guys that have been on the
frontlines and can tell you like we've
had customers doing this and probably
the most much more knowledgeable about
that than I would be anybody else
yes yeah sure so over mqtt you can do
SSL so it's just the TCP so you make an
ssl connection and then the include TT
goes through the secure tunnel then
that's that's the main thing and any of
our console is all you know it's your
teacher yeah I think the main point is
that in QT connection is you can do it
over SSL if you if you choose yes well
yes there's an application that runs in
the cloud yeah so there's two there's
two pieces there's a web UI sort of
interface for your gateway so the most
like you would do with like your cable
modem like you you can if you're on the
same network you can log into the IP
address and give a management view of
the console right and then you can
directly manage if you're not on the
same network we also have the cloud
console which is not just your devices
all your devices and you can click on
your device that you want to interest it
in and manage it directly or you can get
a snapshot of your system of your data
usage and all the things you would
expect from her from that sort of
console but yes it's running in the
cloud that is not that would be an
offering from from your type
and akira not it does not really not any
sort of throttling i mean again we have
this sort of like priority scheduling
but not like you know we want to send
they did this rate not really
tax categories
I don't think as part would be part of
cura at this point but yeah yeah
certainly if you want to bring it up on
the message board or on the own Bangla
system we can we can these are these are
the sorts of things we want to get
feedback on anything else great well
thank you guys so much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
