Los Angeles, I'm Bob Rhubart with the
Oracle Developer Community and I'm gonna
let my guest introduce himself.
Hi, my name is Emmanuel Paraskakis.
thank you for having me here, Bob.
Glad to have you! I know you're
presenting a session in, what, an hour or so.
Let's talk a little bit about that.
Your session is called,
and forgive me for looking at my notes,
“Are Your APIS Honest?”
How does the concept of honesty apply to APIs?
So APIs that would lie or that would not
meet users expectations are a big, big
problem today. So if you think about it,
all of our applications that are modern
or mobile use APIs. So they go fetch data
from a server and present it to the user.
If your API is are not working, or if
they're not working as designed, that's
gonna be a problem, because your mobile
app is not gonna work. Your partnership
is going to have problems and your users
won't find the data that
they're looking for.
So one focus of your session is on the
use of open source tools. Talk about some
of the tools that are involved in that.
Sure! Today I'm gonna be talking about
this open source tool that we've had out
there for a while. It’s called Dredd.
You can go find it on github.
It's a node.js application that allows
you to compare an API specification or
how the API should behave with an API
implementation and tell you whether it
passes or fails. And if it fails you may
choose not to deploy that API because it
is gonna lie to your users and it is
gonna break your downstream applications.
APIs are certainly nothing new.
They've been around for quite a while.
But the manner in which APIs are used now,
and the environment in which they are used,
has evolved considerably. What challenges
does that present to developers?
I think the main challenges that we're facing
.
0:02:03.270,0:02:09.509
today compared to, you know, all the times,
are that, first of all, we have way more
APIs than we used to,
and they are way more complex.
And if youwant to take it further, I think we're
relying on them even more so than we used to.
In the old days it used to be
that we had applications and some
developers said, “Oh, we want to automate
things, so we want to get the data
programmatically, we don't want to
enter it manually” So it was just a
convenience. But today, really, it's the
front face of the company, it's the front
face of our partnership, and we just have
way, way more of them than than we used to.
We have microservices, we have the
same APIs in many different versions.
We have public APIs, then we have
internal APIs or private APIs.
So it gets very, very complex to keep them in
control, to keep them consistent, and if
you try to eyeball this, if you try to
look at it and say,”Yeah it kind of looks
right,” you're sure to miss something.
So it's best to rely on automated tools
that can do the job for you.
What other tools would help?
Are ther other open-source tools in particular
that would aid in that effort?
There are a bunch, and most of the tooling centers
around what's called an API specification.
So, again, in the old days
we used to write in the documents how we
thought the API should behave.
And that used to be prose that could be
misinterpreted. But today we have these
domain-specific languages for APIs,
languages that understand how to express
how an API should behave. You can be very precise.
The languages are human writeable,
human readable, for documentation as
well as machine readable, and when the
languages are machine readable, of course,
you can do all kinds of interesting
things, like generate tests generate
documentation, generate prototypes from
them, and that just speeds up the
development process and increases the
collaboration between the API provider
and API consumer.
You've been involved with APIs for a while,
a decade. Oviously things have changed.
We talked about that a little bit at the top.
How do you stay on top of it?
How do you how do you keep your knowledge up?
How do you evolve along with the technology?
So the best way I’ve found
is to listen to our users
and customers and they are users and
customers creating APIs.
In the produce that we brought to Oracle,
Apiary, we have about
325 thousand users that are
registered and are creating some kind of API.
Mayb it's a design, maybe it's an API
that's not going to be produced,
or it's not going to be deployed,
but they are creating something.
and all these folks, of course, come to us for
questions and support and to
showcase their APIs to the world.
So I think that's the best way to
keep on top of these trends that are evolving.
And, of course, events such as this,
which is very developer-oriented.
and then that's exactly our user base. at
At this moment, projecting forward a year,
let's say, what factor or trend do you
think will have the greatest impact on
API development management over the next year?
I think it's going to be all about
automating what we have. We are in an age
of DevOps, we are in an age of
proliferation of complexity, and I think
automation is going to be key the fact
that you can describe an infrastructure
or an environment in a way that can be read by machines.
I think is going to be key.
I think that's going to be the key
development, and if you look a little bit
further, it's going to be understanding
the semantics of APIs so machines can
consume the APIs as well as humans.
Emmanuel, thanks for stopping by.
I know you've got to prep for a session
coming up here in a couple of minutes.
If you're interested in registering for
that Boston event were Emmanuel
will be presenting you can visit

Look for thee vents link. You'll find a complete
schedule of all the upcoming Oracle Code
events and you'll find a lot of content
on APIs and chatbot and microservices
and a ton of other stuff,
created by developers for developers.
That's developers.oracle.com.
Check it out! Thanks for watching!
I'm Bob Rhubart with the Oracle Developer Community.
