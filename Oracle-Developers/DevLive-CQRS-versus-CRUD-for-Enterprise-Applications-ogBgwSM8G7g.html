York City I'm Bob rue Bart with the
Oracle technology Network bringing you
one more interview with one of the
speakers from today's event and that
speaker is Sebastian - nurse' Bastian
tell me what you do and where you doing
I'm a freelancer mostly for Java Java
Enterprise selective base in Germany
Munich so I'm very happy to be here it's
my very first time in New York oh really
- yes it is very first time it's super
exciting and yes I'm going to talk about
a CQRS today it's okay for the
uninitiated what is CQRS
as dqs stands for command and query
responsibility segregation and it's a
way how to model enterprise applications
that are done in a distributed way in a
nutshell it's a consequence of doing
event-driven architecture and event
sourcing so how does this differ from
crud well it differs in the way that you
add that you have to do event sourcing
for it
so you're basically storing atomic
events and you're separating the rights
from the read side which sounds quite
simple and in theory it is but it has a
lot of implications if you do so in the
distributed world what's one thing that
you hope attendees at your session take
away from this particular session so I
want I'm going to first of all give the
impression of the CTO wrestler like what
it does for you and if it's just one
thing to take away that people get aware
of of all these limitations corrupt has
and in the traductor
transactional world and that you should
not do distributed transactions and what
implications it has if you do micro
services like if you just split up your
applications and then afterwards you
start like thinking about it oh well
what implications does it have like for
example most important on my data model
like if I split up the data bases then
they're not supposed to communicate with
each other and then you have to do this
and some
way indus this is what I said it's like
a consequence of doing so splitting up
your applications or doing event
sourcing and then you kind of end up in
these architectures for those who are
more familiar with a crud model yeah
how would you characterize that
transition to a CQRS model that's a good
question I would say and you should
think of the real world like in the real
people who if you for example go to a
store and buy something or go to a
restaurant and order something and these
kind of transactions are also like
distributed it's not in a way that it's
a distributed transactions because you
can't lock the the real word rather than
you have to communicate and collaborate
so it's more like event-driven in the
real world and once you do this
transaction and think about it from a
use case perspective then it's much
easier to say okay it actually makes
sense
to model or replications in a similar
way to get around these problems that
you also would not have in the real
world like you have don't have to see
Buuren thread transactions you have any
speaking engagements on your calendar
coming up in the near future and yeah
actually next week in Germany is there's
going to be Java Lent
okay again that's that's a nice the
developers conference and yeah then I
think one of the next is actually an
Oracle code event again in Toronto oh
yeah yeah I'll be there at sea in April
I think April let's get rolling we see
each other again I'm going to be there
as well
looking forward well thanks for stopping
by to talk to me and if you'd like to
attend an Oracle code event visit
developer oracle.com slash code you'll
find a complete list of the 17 remaining
upcoming Oracle code events plus
information on how you can submit a
session proposal for Oracle code along
with a lot of other great information
and content for developers from the
Oracle technology Network I'm Bob
rugaard thanks for watching and stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
