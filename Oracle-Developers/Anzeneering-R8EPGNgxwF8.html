is it's still potentially an experiment
we've been playing around with this for
a few years now and so far liking what
we're discovering but it's still in the
discovery phase I'd say so let's get
started some of you may know me from
this book I wrote about 10 years ago and
it's now you know basically 10 years
since that time and I'm about overdue
for writing a new book so maybe the new
book will be about on gineering we'll
see at the time Martin Fowler asked me
for if I wanted the book to be in his
series and if you're in the Martin
Fowler series you have to choose a
bridge so I asked my my oldest daughter
you know what bridge to choose and she
said the Golden Gate Bridge so you know
I chose the golden gate bridge now there
it is this is ubiquitous because you're
here in San Francisco I've got to show
this right you know at this point you're
probably worried it's going to be a
really boring talk because here I am
showing the Golden Gate Bridge but
there's a method to my madness okay we
are going to talk about the Golden Gate
Bridge we're going to go back to the
1930s when this is what the Golden Gate
Bridge look like this was the depression
right they were there a building a
bridge and around the depression in the
United States right so it was estimated
to be a 35 million dollar project at the
time safety was not a big concern when
it came to large construction projects
so they would usually have some person
die for every million dollars spent
right one death per million was the
going number at the time so basically
they expected about 35 people to die
during the construction of the Golden
Gate Bridge which was estimated to be
about three and a half to four years
long it was at the time a monumental
achievement a 1.7 miles man and really
incredible
that's what it looked like here now
something amazing happened the chief
architect the chief engineer of this
effort ok basically said he wanted to do
it differently he wanted to be
incredibly safe he thought that safety
would yield better results it would
yield productivity people wouldn't be
afraid for their lives and that they
would actually be on time and on
schedule turns out he was right he was
very right they did some incredible
things they he innovated in so many ways
around safety one of the things he did
was he got them to where you know minor
caps the miners had these helmets but
people working construction sites like
this one wouldn't happen so they they
took a minor happening outfitted it for
for these bridge workers they had them
in harnesses if you weren't wearing your
harness you would be fired if you didn't
follow the safety protocols that they
set up you would be fired on the spot
they even had cream that they put on
your face because of the wind burn you
could get from the wind hitting you they
also had sauerkraut juice for if you
were drunk in the morning you know
hungover you'd have some sauerkraut
juice to revive yourself apparently just
amazing collection of safety practices
and their safety record was phenomenal
absolutely phenomenal on they basically
for three of the three and a half years
there were zero deaths and everything
was on target then they lost someone was
a fortunate accident that happened and
then tragedy happened some piece of
machinery actually collapsed and it took
12 men with it and 10 of them perished
two of them survived so that was towards
the end of the project but overall it
was an incredible achievement now what
do you think it's like working on a
bridge you know that high up this is
when they were constructing the road
portion
what do you think these guys are
thinking here right I've got a little
bit of a more of a close-up would you be
afraid maybe of falling right you could
easily fall through the cracks there
they're still putting the roadway in
place right it's scary but in fact these
people were not afraid why were they not
in fraid this back then in the
depression for this project they spent
130 thousand dollars to build an
enormous net underneath the bridge
gigantic net it actually caught 19
people who accidentally fell they were
called the halfway to hell club because
it saved them and it was incredible so
it was one of the many safety things
that they did probably the most
expensive and the most important so the
bridge has a lot of history behind it
this is in New York City this is the RCA
Building which is now the GE building
you can see sort of Central Park kind of
up there this is I think the 67th floor
and if you read the history of this
picture they say it might have been
posed but the point is look how
dangerous this is right at the time this
was the depression people would take any
job that they could get whether it was
safer unsafe didn't matter so say if he
wasn't a big concern very very different
for the Golden Gate Bridge story now
what about our field is our field safe
are we safe when we build software in
all aspects of the word do you feel
protected when you build software how
many people here are afraid to change
their software or I've ever been afraid
to change software so you've lived in
this sense of fear of your own creation
or if someone else's creation right lots
of fear schedule pressure all kinds of
things
to talk a lot about this today if
there's a spill in your cafeteria or at
some mall you usually see these kinds of
cones right they put them up so no one
slips to routine happens all the time
what about in our world this is a real
exception that was occurring in our
e-learning software okay it's the
screencast download action and we were
getting some exceptions about 237
production exceptions we happen to
notice one day we're in the log files we
started looking at the log files the
production log files right so we said
all right let's go look at the
screencast download action and we looked
at it and a kind of look like this now
this is Java one so a lot of you are
probably experts a job all right so can
you see the problem
dev language could be null okay that
that's true but there's a bigger problem
and I'll give you a hint it's got
nothing to do with the source code it's
got more to do with the tool this
happens to be eclipsed could be IntelliJ
could be another product could be you
know whatever editor you like there's a
problem here you know what the problem
is the problem is that it should look
like this that's what it should look
like why is it that production
exceptions are not visible to me as a
programmer when I'm looking at this code
this is those yellow cones right if a
product manager comes up to me and says
what are you going to finish that
feature if I can't show this I can't say
well actually this is more important
than that feature we think because this
is a giant pool of problems in
production that are happening may be
affecting users who are trying to watch
videos don't you think we should fix
that first before building your fancy
new feature that might not ever get used
why is it that it's 2014 and we still
have an incredible broken feedback loop
here we have production data exceptions
and we don't see it in in our regular
development environment that's crazy it
suggests that we're missing something
around safety yes
yes
sure it could have identified this but
we're you know so you might have seen
you okay so you have a level of safety
that might say don't allow that right in
fact you know this is a code base that's
heavily tested has been test driven so
it's got a large it's got a very high
percentage of good unit tests and
acceptance tests so it's very rare for
us to have any kind of bugs we don't put
a lot of null checks into our code
because of all of our many automated
tests that said you know any kind of
tool that would help us add some defense
to this would be better than what we
have now what I'm saying though is that
it's remarkable to me that a major
source of data that is production
exceptions are not visible to us in our
everyday programming we have to actually
go out and look for it or schedule a
meeting to go look at exceptions or
something whereas if we cared about
safety I think that would be a little
more in our face right so this is just
one example okay but i think it's it's
good to go to why where we are this way
one reason is we're very focused on
deadlines we're very focused on hitting
deadlines we're very focused on you know
pleasing management and as a result you
know we see a lot of suffering misery
fatigue stress maybe even health issues
stuff like that okay it's not even it's
not widely spoken about right but it's
there we know it's there right you've
all experienced death march of some sort
some some insane deadline you had to
reach right I've done it I've spent you
know late nights coding something up and
finishing it and feeling awesome but
then looking back and seeing some
problems in the code so this can be an
issue if it's something that's happening
all the time I have seen people just
really really ineffective because of
this style of programming for too long
right you might sustain it for a little
while but it's not sustainable
we see feature usage being really odd
we're like a large number of the things
we're building or barely ever used are
we protecting our money are we
protecting our time when we do this no
so it's not all about protecting
programmers we also need to protect the
company we need to protect our resources
this does it protect anything we've rare
who how many people here have build
systems that are thoroughly instrumented
where you can report on the usage of
every single feature show of hands so
maybe a few people right but most of us
don't do that we have absolutely no idea
who's even using our software and how
much it's being used we're just guessing
complex SQL you ever seen anything like
this we have one guy in our company
who's good with this these kinds of
joints and I didn't even put one with
left outer join we have one of those too
there's 19 our company who's good at
these things right and therefore we're
fun where we are getting rid of them
we're actually finding we can replace
them with with actual Java code which is
just as fast believe it or not but these
things are a menace because they're just
too complex branching we don't do
branching at our in our shop but many
places we go have horrendous problems
with branching and merging we call it
merge misery the misery of having to
merge every day or every day every
couple weeks or months terrible
situations they run into incredible
amounts of duplication one of one of the
worst was a customer of ours that they
duplicated a 2 million lines of code i
think they duplicated it 28 times and
then changed it for every single product
they put out horrendous we see insane
amounts of complexity this is a 28-page
method i I literally printed it out
rolled it out in the hotel lobby and
took a photo of it just to show it to
everybody including management 28-page
c++ function with a section that they a
state they called unknown and they had
no idea how it got into that state
there's
causing crashes all the time for a
fundamentally critical piece of their
software that was software that all the
other loop systems relied upon this was
what they lived with we had an exception
we had a production failure once so far
in about seven or eight years of our
e-learning site went down never happens
it happened is really really stressful
we'll talk about a little bit later now
this is mr. Paul on you one of the
reasons I'm here talking about onza
nearing today is because of this guy
here Paul O'Neill anyone ever heard of
them yeah no one okay good so Paul
O'Neill was actually the secretary of
the Treasury of the United States of
America in two thousand okay I think he
lasted about a year year and a half and
he butted heads with this mr. Bush and
you know left however this guy ran a
company called Alcoa Alcoa is the
Aluminum Company of America they make
the aluminum in these macbook pros they
make it in the Tesla they make it in the
airplanes that you fly all the time
there aluminum is everywhere okay so
Alcoa Alcoa was a 100 year old company
when Paul O'Neill came to be the CEO so
he came in 1987 the copy starred in 1887
they invented the aluminum smelting
process they became a monopoly in the
1920s and 30s the government had to
break them up a little bit they
struggled and by the 1970s okay they
were struggling they had poor aluminum
quality they had unhappy workers they
had Union problems they had problems
with competition they had a lot of
problems they weren't innovating Alcoa
was not doing well so they basically
invited mr. Paul O'Neill to come in and
be CEO so Paul O'Neill had this concept
he said that in order to be habitually
excellent we must protect people
we must protect people and he did
something unheard of for a CEO he went
to Wall Street and he said well let me
get there before he said that this is
also in tune with what Paul O'Neill says
another guy named Eric Colin ago
Safety's freedom from unacceptable risk
what Paul O'Neill said was that all
anything that can injure any of my
workers that Alcoa is unacceptable it's
completely unacceptable I want to do
better than OSHA standards I want to be
far below OSHA standards OSHA is the
occupational safety and hazard
administration he wanted to do far
better he wanted zero injuries so he
said I intend to make Alcoa the safest
place to work on earth I intend to go
4-0 injuries zero injuries across a
global organization making aluminum
products very very intense goal and he
said this on Wall Street Wall Street
freaked out they said sell the stock
they have hired a madman why is he
talking about worker safety this is
crazy the stock is going to plummet get
rid of it now dump it what happened what
happened was injuries recordable so
recordable is when you have to record
that someone got injured because it's
not like a mosquito bite it's something
that's significant okay total recordable
'he's lost workdays days lost because
you can't come to work you are injured
here's what happened look at that they
just came king steeply down right this
is from 1987 and paul join them to 2000
in two thousand paul became the Treasury
the secretary the US Secretary of
Treasury okay so Paul is going to leave
to go to the White House what do you
think happened after your left
right someone view pointing up right
because he's a visionary leader he's the
kind of guy that can make something
happen but as soon as the leader leaves
but actually he leaves and this happened
Paul O'Neill changed Alcoa fundamentally
to the core it wasn't about him being
the leader anymore he changed the DNA of
Alcoa he changed it so a 100 year old
company became a new thing they became a
powerhouse once again an absolute
industry-wide leader once again okay and
more more data here here's what happened
to profits profits from 87 till I have
up till twenty-twelve just continued to
climb by any measure this is incredibly
good usually these spikes going down our
recessions and now Alcoa is building the
all-aluminum truck the FB ford f-150 was
all aluminum a GM silverado we'll be all
aluminum there now building a big chunk
of the automobile industry it's
incredible okay so insanely cool story
that I could not get out of my head I
kept reading about this and saying he
approached process improvement he
improved the performance problems at
alcoa the innovation problems at alcoa
the Union problems at alcoa by focusing
on safety what are we doing in the
software field she said safety is a
precondition not a priority this is a
very important phrase it's a
precondition when you come to work it's
a precondition that you're going to be
safe
onza I started talking about safety soon
after I've been studying Paul O'Neill
okay I started wondering about safety
and thinking about it I started looking
at it for any place I could look so i
looked at ajilon a lot of the test
driven development and refactoring I
seem to looked at my own book and in my
own book I was saying things like oh the
safe way to refactor here's a safe way
to refactor providing unit tests allows
you to be safe to make changes so safety
was kind of there and safety was there
even in iterative development it's safer
to iterate and learn what you're not
supposed to build faster than building
it and waterfall lots of things were
safe and that safety was kind of this
embedded thing in even in agile but not
really spoken about really not not
explicit so I started making it explicit
I was at one of our clients in the
Midwest they make large large devices
that go around and plant things and they
are very focused on safety for the
people building those tractors but when
I started talking about safety in
software their legal department got
involved said Oh Josh you can't have the
word safety and your speech title what
oh no see safety means something here
for the the workers who build the
hardware stuff not for software like
this is crazy so I you know I basically
got rid of the word safety and went
there and talked all about safety and
then start to hear that they're afraid
of us now they're afraid of us because
we're talking about hazards and injuries
in software development and they are
afraid of being sued so I said you know
this is actually a battle I don't want
to fight so i'm going to not talk about
safety i'm going to use a japanese word
because that's what consultants do
basically we find Japanese terms and we
use them so Kaizen con bond on Zen
seemed like a perfect work right I
actually think it's a beautiful little
word this is on set on Zen means safety
in Japanese safety for all okay it
really tends to mean physical safety
even in Japan so it's not as exactly
what I want it to be but this is what we
do we take a word and we turn it into
what we want it to be so that's several
Japanese folks who said it's okay we're
used to this it's fine go for it take
our word on gineering is basically
people that are doing on set people like
myself and my colleagues and maybe some
of you in the room will become ons and
yours today we'll see we do have a
two-day certified course in this I'm
joking so this is some of the shields
that we're we're talking about an ons an
earring one of them is protecting our
money right another is protecting our
time protecting our information
protecting our reputation protecting our
relationships and our health these are
the six shields of on veneering these
are the things we think are most
valuable to be protecting for ourselves
for the company for our customers for
the shareholders for the entire
ecosystem focusing on protecting these
things so let's go further the Trojans
the Trojans had a certain code of battle
they said you know what you can lose
your your helmet you could lose your
breath your breastplate but don't you
dare lose your shield because your
shield not only protects you it protects
the others it's part of the line and you
would have the review severe
consequences if you lost your shield
Engineering is the practice of
protecting people okay fundamentally
it's about protecting people whether
those people are inside your
organization or outside your
organization using your software using
your products you're protecting people
it's not this this is what we see out
there in the world today you know
helicopter parenting this is over over
protection right you're not getting very
far with this so there's a lot of things
I have to say what this is not in order
to learn what it is ons an earring is
not over protection where you don't
leave your cave and you never try
anything bold but you're safe it's not
that in fact that's one of my daughters
and you know we are perfectly happy with
her trying to climb a tree like that or
climbing a tree and she tends to be
pretty safe but if she falls well okay
she's going to learn when they're
they're safe risks right we don't let an
infant try to walk down steps you know
you have to find manageable risks we say
not taking risks is riskier than playing
it safe right so you could say wow great
you're doing on Zen you're safe but you
don't take any risks no that's fo safety
fake safety you really want genuine
safety so she's model system accidents
this is a James reason he's one of the
leaders in the field of safety the
leaders in the field is safety tend to
look at safety across many industries ok
so this cheese model is the concept that
we have layers of Defense's and
sometimes holes open up in those layers
and when the holes line up you have some
sort of failure okay it's very common
for that to be the way we think about
this so it's called the Swiss cheese
model of system accidents ok back to our
production outage on our e-learning what
happened oh my god this was a horrible
in fact I was at
out in austin texas at the south by
southwest i was playing pool with a
friend of mine i get this frantic call
long story there but bottom line was we
did some from the safety field right
there's something called fault tree
analysis okay it was invented in the 60s
and we built a fall tree and we
ultimately discovered that you know the
reason for this failure was someone had
put the non standard version of java on
a production box how did that happen
well we needed to domesticate that
further at the time I wasn't as mature
as I am today in terms of engineering
but I which meant basically that I kind
of blamed this one person not outwardly
but I was like oh god he did something
again like how could you do that why
can't you take the exact version of Java
on the other servers and put that on
this new server why would you go with a
different version seems crazy but it
happened there was no policy in place to
make sure it happened there were no
automated scripts to produce those those
production machines we have those today
but back then we didn't so this happened
so was this worker who did this
protected right this guy here Todd
Conklin brought an incredible book about
safety it's called pre accident
investigations and he said never place
the worker only one defense away from
failure this is an incredible statement
because if you start to internalize this
you will think about whatever your
workers are doing or whatever you're
doing and try to think about how many
defenses mi away from failure and then
you can start to think about maybe so I
need some more defenses James reason
back to the guy that invented the Swiss
cheese model of accidents right he said
the partnership redeem protein
production and production is never equal
this partnership is never equal right we
want to produce stuff oh but then we
need to protect ourselves more right
look at it this way catastrophes here
bankruptcy is here this is protection
this is production this is a high degree
of protection up here
this is a low degree of protection high
degree of production low degree of
production parody is it is kind of the
middle ground here's what happens in
most companies we say we need some
protection so we start here to add a
sort of a small level of protection
adequate and then over time we forget
that we need to stay protected so we
stopped doing some of the practices and
there's a problem and we say oh god
there was a problem we need more
protection okay let's have more
protection and over time it fades and we
get another problem and then we say oh
this is terrible it's even a bigger
problem than the last one let's let's
really focus on protection and it
continues and then we have even a bigger
problem and this just goes back and
forth like this right but most of the
time it's being sucked down into
production we want to push on production
and we don't tend to focus enough on
protection so this happens all the time
right Jennifer Lawrence's photos being
exposed on iCloud right oops we were
letting people try to log in many many
times without cutting them off oh we
weren't focused on protection we have
really cool devices this is the mixed
message right green Corp Friends of the
environment hahaha right mixed messages
are evil mixed messages in companies
basically create mediocrity mixed
messages manufacture mediocrity and
mistrust you're saying one thing you're
doing the other right you have to get
rid of this one of the guys I've been
learning safety from this is a fellow
not in software field he he runs a
company it helps all kinds of industries
transition to a safety culture he says
OSHA the Occupational Safety and hazard
administration does not go around
counting the number of mixed messages in
a corporation right they count accidents
and things like that they don't count
mixed messages and this is yet a root
cause of a lot of problems safety is the
presence of defense is not the absence
of events Todd Conklin again the
presence of defense is not the absence
of events you got to be focused on your
defenses
are the adequate or not for the given
context now let's think of story here
this guy is operating a bandsaw he just
injured his I see that this is a failure
that just occurred the guy's injured
what happened let's investigate oh well
looks like the goggles are kind of
broken and in disrepair that's why maybe
he's not wearing goggles or maybe
there's no you know common culture to
wear goggles something's up with the
goggles hmm why'd that happen oh oh
there's management what are they doing
maybe they're focused on products
products and profits production maybe
the nut so focused on protection in
essence if we look at an active failure
something that happened to a worker
right on the production line or while
building something it happens so that if
you look at this and say why did this
happen what was the reason behind it
many times there are these latent
conditions there are conditions that
have been having formulating maybe over
the years that ultimately led to the act
of failure so rather than blaming this
worker for not wearing the glasses you
can go deeper and try to find the real
issues leading to this problem now for
our fatal crash we hadn't invested
enough in automated scripts to build
production environments so the guy that
actually triggered the problem it really
wasn't to be blamed it was that there
was a lack of the automation there and a
lack of you know good engineering there
okay an active failure is like a
mosquito right it's really annoying
latent conditions are like the swamp
right the place where the mosquitoes
come from ultimately you have to drain
the swamp if you want to get rid of the
mosquitoes you've gotta focus on the
latent conditions to really make
progress etsy you all heard about see
and she had a site outage they hired a
guy and on his fourth day of the job he
deleted a CSS file that was used for a
IE version of Etsy Internet Explorer
version of Etsy accidentally deleted it
they do continuous deployment tape got
deployed somehow and what happened was
there's an error page that shows up that
also relies on the same CSS file so it
led to an infinite loop the site crashed
what do you think happened to the
engineer what louder fired no he won the
three on sweater award the three armed
sweater award is an award that's handed
out once a year for the most spectacular
failure and people will will basically
reward you thank you for discovering
something that wasn't well defended
people said you know we hadn't ever
thought of this but yeah if that CSS
should never be even used on the on the
error page the error page should come up
no matter what and so let's fix that and
by the way congratulations welcome to
the company the guys still there
perfectly happy no he wasn't fired they
looked at it as a chance to learn not as
a chance to blame this is what we
normally see Blaine doesn't lead
anywhere it maybe feels good but it
doesn't really lead anywhere well it may
lead to people leaving your company
understand failure for what you could
learn not who you can blame really
important point understand failure for
what you can learn not who you can blame
we need to learn we're in the learning
business in software development there's
always something more to learn
especially about our own creations old
view is blaming people disciplining them
Retraining them or firing them that's
the old world the new world is learn
from failure build better defenses
now question for you who makes more
mistakes well led teams with good
relationships or poorly led teams with
poor relationships how many people here
think it's the first one okay how many
people here it's the second one okay
more of you the point right the poorly
led teams with poor relationships should
be making more mistakes right no in fact
it's the well led teams why'd you raise
your head because they have the freedom
to fail because they feel comfortable to
fail they're not hiding their failures
these ones here you're not even going to
know about all the failures and problems
that happen they're way too afraid to
let you know they're psychologically
unsafe okay Amy Edmondson wrote about
this in her book called teaming she said
people are impression managers they
manage their impressions right if I want
you to have a certain impression of me
then I'm going to dress a certain way
and talk a certain way and I'm going to
potentially hide my feelings to manage
the impressions right so these people
are in a meeting here and what do you
think what do you think they're thinking
you might not be able to know they might
not say anything hmmm are you free to
expose relevant thoughts and feelings
sometimes the context won't allow for
that hmm what is she thinking is raising
a dissenting view expected and welcomed
boy if you can't hear dissenting views
then you're working an echo chamber you
don't have the ability to really be good
because you're not inviting alternate
views dissenting views can you have
productive conflicts challenges and
disagreements you need a psychologically
safe environment to allow this how many
people here would say you have a
psychologically safe environment to
allow this kind of thing ok a few hands
great
a lot of us don't can we need to focus
on that because we're missing some of
the best parts of what people bring to
offering you the table when they don't
speak their mind when they don't feel
safe to talk we're missing this if
people are our most important asset if
those people don't really tell us what
they're really thinking we are losing a
big part of the asset is being yourself
encouraged so I want to transition a
little bit really quickly here now into
what some of the things we're doing to
to make improvements at our company let
me check my time ok so this is the
stop-work Authority card we made this
and gave it to everyone in our company
all right I'm holding one up here I
carry it in my wallet it's a card that I
can use to stop any unsafe work that I
see I have the power and authority to do
so every one of the company has that
employees have used this on me I've used
this on employees they've used it on
each other to stop on tape work just
yesterday actually today one of our
instructors in Houston used it on a
student in class I happen to brought a
whole bunch of these if you want one
come up to the come up here after the
talk this is a way to empower people to
start to be able to make a safer
environment ok i once sent a quick email
off to somebody it was kind of too
flippant it wasn't very polite someone
pulled the stopper work Authority card
on me for that I was actually heading to
the airport I was in a rush and I kinda
I should have said it in a much more
gentle way I got the card pulled on me I
learned that day it was wonderful if
that person had never done this I
wouldn't be as good of I wouldn't be as
good of an engineer as I'm aspiring to
be so stop work pathardi very useful
tail boarding chelle boardings a
practice we're doing which is very
helpful before we do any work we
tailboard it Chael boarding is
essentially a practice where you are
about to do some work and you think
about what are the possible hazards what
are the possible risks what can we do to
stay safe
so on our conv on board we have a tail
boarding column everything that passes
into in process has to go to tail
boarding first and as a group we get
together and talk about what are the
possible hazards and risks and how could
we deal with them it's helping us a lot
especially building software for the web
where you're dealing with all kinds of
crazy things and browsers these days and
all kinds of stuff like that very useful
do props we we give these to each other
when people do things that are that are
amazing or good or useful or we thank we
want to thank them we give them props so
it's a product we didn't make it it's
called do props calm and it's a great
way to recognize people for doing
something like great customer service
right or someone just had to fly
somewhere overnight and it was really
hairy and you just you reward them with
a jetsetter reward it makes people feel
better makes people feel you know that
they're being acknowledged for all the
hard work they do so those exceptions
that we're getting the screencast
actioned exceptions we made it a
priority to get rid of them to silence
them and in fact this is looking in a
bunch of exceptions not just the
screencast ones we started paying some
heavy attention to it these were BOTS
sometimes a bot comes along and wreak
some havoc on our site but essentially
it's gone completely quiet now we have
almost total silence we have the
occasional problem but it's it's a blip
tiny little blip compared to what it was
we made it a focus to fundamentally make
that safer we sought we started to do
something called job safety analysis
we're learning from the safety field the
manufacturing field nuclear energy field
all these different fields that care
about safety we're learning from what
that what they do and applying it to our
world job safety analysis says for any
given job you do a safety analysis to
figure out what is the way to be safe
one of the possible hazards and how do
you stay safe doing that job it's much
more elaborate than tail boarding it's
really a focused activity so you're
going to do programming in our shop
here's the job safety analysis for
programming okay we do test-driven
development we run the
test before we check in blah blah blah
all the things that we do to stay safe
we're starting to produce these
documents and they're helping they're
helping the company understand how to
stay safe so I want to talk about Paul
O'Neill's three questions to finish up
here okay Paul has three questions that
he asks that are fundamentally important
to establishing a culture of safety a
culture of ons an earring I'm here they
are so in an organization I believe that
has the potential for greatness done
guarantee it but have the potential for
greatness the people in the organization
can say every day without any
reservation or hesitation a yes to three
questions here are the three questions
I'm treated every day with dignity and
respect by everyone I encounter without
respect to my gender or my nationality
or my race or my educational attainment
or by rank or any other discriminating
qualifier okay how'd we do we did a
survey internally at my company and we
got pretty good score eighty-six percent
so this was a we did this about six
months ago and we just recently did this
I don't have the latest data here but
it's getting better okay how about the
second question things that I need
training education tools encouragement
so that I can make a contribution this
important out that gives meaning to my
life so I'm given the training the tools
of the education that I need to to do my
job in such a way that it has meaning to
my life right it's meaningful come to
work and what the work that I do is
meaningful okay how do we do pretty much
the same kind of number right
so room for improvement third question
the third proposition pretty simple it
says every day I can say someone I care
about and respect noticed i did it in a
word its recognition regular meaningful
sincere recognition not as good on this
one so I've been myself I've been trying
to really focus on this more there's
more do props going out it's a regular
thing for me and again they have to be
sincere they have to be you know
something that's real a real to somebody
and they really care it's not the only
way to show your appreciation for what
someone's doing but it's it's one of the
ways we are a distributed company we
have people all over the world so
sending a do prop is one way we can
interact with them we certainly try to
do things on hangouts and things like
that as well so great I wanted to leave
some time for QA again I just want to
mention that it's it's something this
ons and earring thing something they've
been doing for about a couple years now
I'm seeing wonderful things happen
internally in our company people
speaking up more than they were in the
past we we also did something where we
said you can't be you're not going to be
fired by us if you don't do anything
particularly egregious you know they
started stealing money from our accounts
than maybe we would but there's we're
not going to just let you go because
we're somehow in a slump or something
like that so there are people feel very
very safe in our company okay at the
same time we're focused on helping them
become better and better every day so
questions
yes you were talking about just the
freedom to vocalize share ideas concerns
the experiences that across alcohol to
cultural gap um okay so good question
have we had experience of people
speaking up across the cultural gap
really and specifically India the answer
is really no we had some people from
India with us they're not with us
anymore that was before we started doing
onsen earring but it is still something
that I think could be a very big
challenge in the past we have had folks
folks from India come to the states and
learn how to be a little more assertive
and a little more of you know able to
speak their mind rather than just
agreeing to everything and vice versa so
we've had folks we've sent there to help
them you know be this way because in
this kind of collaborative style of
software development there's really very
little room for just being a guest man
saying yes to everything and not
contributing so I think it is a
challenge and I believe that that's an
area where people needs to just basic
training I mean it's not so easy to
change a culture right saving face in a
and Asian environment is that these are
things you don't just change overnight
but you know you have to work within
your bounds and see what you can do
there yeah how do you feel clear clear
of paralysis again this is not all about
defenses and defenses we're taking risks
every day we are working on new products
all kinds of new things that are
potentially risky but they're safe risks
right it's safe to fail we can we can
work on something we already have ways
of working where for example we'll put
out a report of a product that doesn't
exist yet and say hey para clients what
do you think of this it would this be
the kind of report you'd want now they
say yes then we can go ahead and build
that product and we can sculpt the
product to what their needs are rather
than you know inventing it out of thin
air and giving them something six months
later and they don't want it right so
there's ways to protect ourselves and
our clients in building in taking risks
right so the answer is no we don't
paralysis in fact we see lots of new
energy and you know care going into what
we do other questions yes advice about
the difference between protection or
protection um it's it's basically yes
first off you can run into situations
where someone is getting their self
protected but it's actually harming
others in the company that's a problem
it's personal protection but it's
actually not group protection so in
general just like those shields that the
Trojans are holding we're talking about
group protection here okay so that's
really critical to establishing a
culture of on Zen the over protection if
you do find yourself in paralysis right
where you're actually not trying things
are doing things that could be one
indication in general we haven't really
experienced that as far as I can tell
sometimes we could say we're not taking
enough risks right where we're moving
too slowly we should have tried that
product a year ago why do we wait till
now so there's there's kinds of ways to
learn that way but it's it's you're
never gonna get it perfect right you
learn as you go and in general for most
places I think there's not enough
defenses especially around this
psychological safety stuff that's
critical something that we're really
working hard on for people to feel safe
at work and you know what a lot of times
you carry this home and you start to see
how can I make things safer at home very
common yes so
I think that the ability is it credible
threats and where they're going to come
from it's kind of a skilled yeah so yeah
so good questions you know tail boarding
how do you get good at identifying
possible problems it you know we like to
do it in a mob you know basically i
wouldI would easels here you just talked
about mob programming we do a lot of
bobbing on that tail board we have a
bunch of people together focused on
thinking about what could possibly go
wrong we form a little list of possible
problems talk about it someone can see
it a day later add their bit to it and
you know then there's even a part of the
tailboard where it gets reviewed so
hasn't even gone live yet it's just a
bit of a review so we tend to catch most
su issues of course that some do come up
when they come up you know Paul O'Neill
basically said when they had a problem
in alcoa the one advantage he had was
they would fix it in such a way that it
would never ever happen again they would
focus money and effort in time to make
sure that that problem would never occur
again so we try to be that diligent when
we encounter problems but it's it's an
art and you know you need people with
divergent thoughts to really do a good
job at tail morning if everyone is just
thinking the exact same way you're
probably more open to risks yes
I mean I ultimately what happened with
Alcoa is something I want to explain
what they did start when they started
making a lot of money you know I was
pretty soon after Paul arrived things
started going in an excellent direction
so he instituted something which was
that the lowest paid workers got their
bonuses first the lawyers were going to
kill Paul new they're like you can't do
this he's like I'm going to do it and
we'll see what happens I don't think
anyone's going to really complain fact
it was fine so you know basically group
bonuses bonuses for the whole company
some kind of a bonusing system is what
we do we also apply that as well and
that that's you know people really
appreciate that it's not specifically to
an individual and giving them a bigger
bonus than everyone else we tend to
follow the pattern of everyone gets an
equal percentage of the bonus so other
questions
okay well thank you very much welcome to
a stop work Authority card if you like
and enjoy the rest of Java one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
