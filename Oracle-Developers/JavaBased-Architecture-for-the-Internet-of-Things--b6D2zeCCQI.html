Pierre I'm the
product manager for Oracle's Internet of
Things platform and what I'd like to do
is start this session with about a five
or ten minute overview talk to you a
little bit about what where we left off
a year ago with an Internet of Things
architecture show you how some of that
has evolved at a high level
talk about some of the benefits of what
Oracle and Oracle Java bring to the
Internet of Things
at which point I'll turn it over to
Knoll poor my friend and colleague who
is a architect for our Internet of
Things platform so if you think about
the Internet of Things there are some
very basic requirements that an IOT
solution should fulfill specifically
things like distributed computing bility
building distributed solutions security
identity and user experience being key
elements that really must be reflected
across all elements of that solution all
of the distributed computing in the
world isn't going to help unless you can
turn that data collected into
intelligent and actionable data so what
does that mean for the Internet of
Things well what it means is and you may
have seen this slide a year ago if we
distilled down what it takes to build an
Internet of Things solution looking at
the left-hand side of the slide what you
see is we need to be able to actually
gather an enriched data that means
sampling your environment being able to
control things in the environment and
having aggregated data points where you
can introduce intelligence and begin to
turn raw data and into something that is
actionable it also means that you need
to be able to store and manage that
information as you collect it again
providing value through
computation and begin introducing
business intelligence and if you look on
the right-hand the far right hand side
you finally need to acquire all of that
information into a single location and
be able to organize analyze and
ultimately act on the information
because at that point it is something is
actionable and not just a lot of raw
data points that been running around the
network so a grand slide like this is
nice
it talks about a lot of pieces but how
do you get those pieces to work together
well part of it if you group those six
columns into solution sets on the
left-hand side what you end up with the
ability to build an IOT client where
Java plays in because you can distribute
intelligence you can build applications
and you can actually reuse a lot of
existing code that's already been
developed for enterprise applications
moving to the middle we can build IOT
services or combined together an IOT
server that allows you to begin
aggregating all of the data collected at
those endpoints it's it's the ability to
pull all of that data together and to
begin to organize it that starts to
empower developers to actually build the
solutions that allow you to run an
enterprise based on knowledge not just
based on luck and finally in the right
hand side is the enterprise integration
as Oracle customers you're probably
aware Oracle has been doing business
intelligence and analytics for decades
with so much invested in the backend and
now with the boon of you know exadata
AXA logic and a lot of you know the big
data systems we really have the
capability to turn enormous amounts of
data and use that to feed business
processes and reuse a lot of the tools
and applications that we have built
today
how does Java play in well clearly Java
especially with the introduction of Java
8 and the ability to take a single
programming language and better scale it
across multiple platforms from from
large enterprise applications WebLogic
services and down to Java SE embedded
and ME embedded really pushing logic all
the way from the data center out to the
edge at the client side clearly the ME
NSE embedded platforms give you the
ability to reuse code that's already
been written distributing a lot of the
intelligence that was once locked in the
data center in the IOT server web logic
and coherence build a foundation that
allow us to take the same applications
and scale them across a data center
allowing you to begin small building
your solution out and then scaling as
data streams entered the tens and
hundreds and eventually millions of data
elements and data streams that are
collected what will probably be on a
minute-by-minute basis and then finally
on the right hand side the enterprise
integration at the core of that we have
Oracle's big data offerings the EXA
logic fusion middleware and many of the
existing messaging technologies such as
JMS and oracle service bus so with that
taking a peek at where we've come from a
year ago having just a high-level vision
of some of the elements and the
artifacts that it would take to build a
solution we've taken the existing Oracle
products that we've taken Java the
Oracle database and X illogic as a
foundation for that and put together an
architecture for the Internet of Things
so at this point I'd like to introduce
Knoll poor architect for the Internet of
Things platform to do a bit more of a
deep dive on what it is we've been
thinking about the past year No
thanks peeps so I'm going to take to
what Pete started and go into a more
technical detail so looking at this
diagram here Pete talked about an Oracle
IOT platform well there are two basic
components to that there is a client
platform for building device gateways
and smart devices and then there is a
cloud service though else you put all of
these pieces together so if we look on
this on this overall architecture
diagram here we can see the gateway
platform over on the left hand side so
that gateway is there firstly to allow
you to pull together a lot of disparate
devices that may be talking a lot of
different protocols it's also there is a
place where you can start to deploy
application functionality so that not
everything has to go to a cloud service
before it can be actioned and we we're a
big fan of distributing intelligence
around your IOT solution and you
actually don't want to build a solution
that demands that everything has to go
to a cloud service before you can begin
to use that information we think that
having the ability to deploy
applications out to gateways and devices
and using Java to allow you to do that
to a very disparate set of gateways and
devices allows you to build more robust
or fought more fault tolerant solutions
and to be able to actually deploy a
higher level of an higher level of
intelligence as part of your overall
solution so the device gateway
integrates with the the IOT cloud
service and we're showing a couple of
different ways in which that could that
connection can happen today it's very
important to note though
that the the architecture that we built
here doesn't insist that there is for
example a direct IP connection from the
Gateway to the cloud service we're aware
of a lot of different use cases in which
that would be a bad assumption so we've
we built an architecture that that
doesn't mean we have to make that
assumption
you'll also see that there are some non
Java devices
you know shown in this diagram and we'll
we'll come to those a little bit later
you found at the very bottom the middle
there you'll see some some users some
actual people who are accessing the
cloud service and accessing the you know
the business intelligence and analytics
capabilities of the cloud service over
on the right hand side then we've got a
simplified representation of the cloud
service that shows and I'm going to go
through in more detail exactly what all
these different components actually
bring to the table so we show endpoint
management device management a messaging
proxy we show data storage we show
analytics real-time event processing we
show you the ability to integrate with
with custom applications because we we
can't define ahead of time exactly what
needs to happen to all of the data and
the information that's being generated
as part of your IOT solution so it's
critical that we have the right set of
integration points to allow the the
customer to to build the right solution
around this infrastructure
so just a few quick points about the
about the the client platform here so
it's running on Java embedded of course
so Java ME and SSE embedded it's fully
integrated with the cloud service which
means that it's a fully manageable
client platform we have a very easy easy
to understand application model that any
Java developer will find very easy to
use so that you know you don't have to
learn a whole bunch of stuff before you
can take someone who knows how to
program in Java and begin to make them
productive in this environment obviously
one of the things about about building
software on a device gateway is that
there are lots of different technologies
that are used for connecting devices so
lots of different kinds of device so we
have built a device framework that
allows you to build what we call device
adapters for many different kinds of
protocol and many different kinds of
device so this is the software that
understands how to connect to specific
kinds of devices over specific kinds of
protocol and can actually represent the
resources of those devices to the rest
of your iot platform we have an event so
this is part of the of the the device
platform so that you know applications
and other other pieces of code on on
down on the Gateway can actually see
what's happening in real time and you
can actually pop pass events between
components of your platform in order to
create software components then core
that can cooperate with each other we
have a messaging service which enables
messages with a very flexible data model
to be passed around both within the the
client platform but importantly also up
to the cloud service and I'll talk more
about how that works
what you can do with that later and then
finally we have you know all of the the
client software here is running in
secure sand boxes that are created using
the the job the capabilities of the java
virtual machine so all of the all of the
application code and all the device
adapter code that you have running here
is is running in a secure context which
means that we can always identify the
code that has been this being executed
and that we can strictly control what
what that code will be able to do so
that for example if code you know if you
have an application that wants to
originate a message then the client
platform will always make sure that the
source of that message is tagged so that
we can identify that it came from that
application instance we don't want to be
able to you know applications to be able
to spoof other other applications and
full it freaked us into thinking that
the message came from some other place
the
so moving on to the cloud service I'm
just gonna I'm gonna actually gonna I
got a page of my deck that allow us to
go through each of these areas in a lot
more detail but basically you know so
the cloud service will be hosted on the
Oracle public cloud it provides a whole
bunch of management functionality for
what we call endpoints specific
functionality for managing the devices
in your system provides this messaging
proxy that gives us the connectivity
between devices and the cloud service
and one of the basic things that we do
here is to we expose the resources that
the devices and application instances
represent as restful resources so that
means that they appear to for example an
opponent and enterprise application or
service to be a restful resource that
you can do a get or a put or a post or
you know patch on that doesn't mean that
under the covers there's necessarily any
HTTP going on for example just means
that we are modeling these resources
along along restful lines the cloud
service provides storage of all that all
of the data that's coming from your IRT
network and the ability to query and
retrieve that information we provide the
ability to do real-time analytics and
all that information and to apply
business intelligence to that in order
to help you make you know real business
decisions and extract actual value from
all of the data that you're generating
and to then be able to make decisions
and actually go out and control things
based on the decisions that you're
making then finally we have this thing
that we call the dispatcher framework
which is one of the key integration
points that allows us you know to
provide ways in which your customers can
integrate their own applications and
services with with the the IOT cloud
service in order to benefit from the the
flow of data and the control
all paths that are made possible by the
IOT platform so just want to take one a
couple of seconds and talk about some of
the key challenges that that you know
any any IOT solution faces while I was
tempted to say that the first three
point first three challenges were
security you know we we have thought
very hard about security from from day
one it's it's easy to say but it's not
something that you can you know design a
solution and then just before you
release kind of bold security on to it
up as an afterthought the scale of an
IOT solution is always going to be very
challenging and the there's this you
know different dimensions of scalability
that we have to be able to think about
firstly the device platform needs to be
able to scale down to very small devices
so we can't play traitor platform the
places that requires so many resources
to execute it that we can't fit on on
really quite small devices but then also
it's very easy to see that a cloud
service like this is gonna have to be
able to scale to deal with you know
millions tens of millions hundreds of
millions or even billions of endpoints
so there's a there's a lot of
interesting um you know scaling
challenges both from the very small all
the way through to the to the very large
in in building a solution like this
obviously as as things scaled and the
amount of data that you're dealing with
is going to scale as well so storing
managing data query and make sensible
use of larger large volumes of data is
an interesting challenge and obviously
Oracle has lots of assets that we can
bring to bear on that kind of
and a lot of clever folks that we can
work with inside Oracle to help us
working out good answers to these
problems
performance being able to make real-time
decisions are in on the basis of the the
you know the data that's coming from
devices and applications is gonna be
very really important in a lot of
applications and then finally
integration with the enterprise so one
how do you meet do you know do this so
that you can leverage all the existing
investment that you have but
fundamentally how do you take the data
and the control path that you've created
by it with this IOT platform and allow
you to extract business value for your
business out of out of this technology
because ultimately is that business
value that will actually pay you know
will pay all of our salaries in creating
these solutions and allow us to make a
living
so I want to talk very briefly about
security and I will put in a plug here
for a session that I'm giving later
tonight at 7 o'clock which is
specifically at our IOT security so I'm
not gonna say very much in this session
basically we developed a security model
that ensures that all of the
interactions within the IOT platform are
authenticated and authorized we protect
access to devices and applications we
talked about exposing those things as a
restful resources all of those accesses
are protected so that we can clearly
partition who gets to do what what kinds
of operations on what what kinds of
resources as part of your IOT solution
not only do we need to protect access to
the devices and the applications we also
need to protect access to the data that
is generated by those things so
regardless of where that data is whether
it happens to be stored somewhere
either on the device or inside the cloud
service or whether it's in motion
between in you know any place inside the
network then we must protect access to
that data as much as to the actual
devices and applications themselves so
we provide centrally managed policies
that allow you to configure the
authorization policies for different
kinds of of resource and different kinds
of requests within the system and you'll
Harold
you'll hear a little more about that if
you want to come along to the to the
session later today so a word that
you'll hear me I think I've already used
to at least a couple of times on a word
that you'll hear us use quite a lot and
we're talking about the IOT platform is
the word endpoint so that endpoint is
essentially any participant in the IOT
network that has its own independent
life cycle that needs to be
independently managed so examples of
endpoints are device gateways devices
application instances you know
enterprise applications that are
accessing the IOT cloud service members
endpoints as well there are a lot of
different kinds of entity within the
system that we generically treat as
different kinds of endpoint one of the
reasons that we do that is so that we
can apply a set of uniformed concepts
and policies and constraints and
restrictions that allow us to create a
system that can scale but yet can allow
you to conceptually understand that
system in a way that mere mortals can
Congrats you've configured a system of
hundreds of millions of devices and the
the way in which you've configured the
security model
so endpoint management so I'm now going
to you know run through a high-level
look at the functionality of the cloud
service so endpoint management is about
managing the lifecycle of different
kinds of endpoint within within the
cloud service so onboarding an
enrollment how does an endpoint come
into being how do we actually or you
know authenticate that endpoint and
establish a trust relationship with it
how do we enable or disable endpoints as
necessary and how do we quote delete an
endpoint now I put that in quotes
because we don't actually delete
endpoints as in completely forget they
ever existed
we simply mark it mark the end point as
having been deleted so that we can make
sure that we never you know we don't
reuse that identity we don't read
accident inadvertently reuse any
credentials that were created as part of
that that endpoints identity so the
service maintains an endpoint repository
that's our essentially our identity
store for four endpoints and you know
it's responsible for the creation of
identities for endpoints so creating
identities means that we can then have
ways of authenticating endpoints so we
provide authentication services for
endpoints we provide policy management
and we provide very dynamic and flexible
ways of grouping endpoints so that again
you can start to manage large networks
of endpoints in ways that are
conceptually understandable and where
your your you know ability to understand
things doesn't have to become overly
complex weren't because you're dealing
with very large networks of devices
device management so that this is a
specific portion of the sir
that deals with configuring the well
configuring and unloading software onto
devices so particularly when we're
dealing with Java devices then that
gives us you know great ability to
dynamically change and update the
software install new services new
applications to deploy new new updates
to service in applications so there is a
software artifact repository as part of
the service and the whole lifecycle for
the for the artifacts in that repository
and then we have you know mechanisms for
deploying deploying and updating
software on devices and for updating the
configuration of devices and
configuration parameters for all of the
software that's running on those devices
so I mentioned messaging before we have
a messaging service down on the in the
client platform that integrates with the
messaging proxy within the cloud service
so between those what we've established
is a secure bi-directional
store-and-forward messaging link between
devices and device gateways out in your
device cloud and your and the IOT cloud
service I already mentioned that this is
not not just about HTTP we can be very
very flexible about the actual transport
listen use here and one of the reasons
why we have opted for a store and
forward mechanism here is because
increasingly devices are not always on
and especially as the use of
battery-powered devices grouse one of
the ways in which you know you get to
have devices that run off batteries for
years or rather than weeks is by turning
the radio off for large proportions at a
time and especially with you know
low-power network technology a lot of
effort has gone into making it possible
to to you know turn radios on and off
very very quick conversations and the
latest Bluetooth devices are able to
turn their radio on have a conversation
and turn the radio off again within
three milliseconds and that's how you
get you know weighing scale in your
bathroom that will run for three four
five years of one set of regular
consumer batteries because the thing is
actually not not on the network for
ninety nine point seven percent of the
time so the days of being able to assume
that things are always on you know you
can't build a platform around that
concept anymore so the the messaging
service here it hides these you know
details of routing of you know different
protocols that are being used it hides
you know allows you to uniquely address
devices applications other resources
without having to understand about the
network topology without having to
understand about whether whether the
device really is connected right now and
so on provides secure access so once
again everything that happens is
authenticated and and authorized
provides mechanisms by which you know
you can discover endpoints and the
resources that are associated with those
endpoints so you don't have to have a
lot of a whole lot of a priori
information programmed into your
application you can actually discover
the real configuration in the real world
and work from there
and again all access to everything is
subject to security policy data storage
and retrieval so as we already mentioned
there's a whole lot of data being
generated by devices and applications
one of the reasons why you want to be
able to push applications out to on to
gateways is because you know and we
found this in practice that you know
that the data quality that comes from a
lot of different sensors and so on is
not always uniformly good
so we found
we found a lot of value in being able to
put intelligence down onto the the
device gateway to be able to actually
look at the data that's coming from
something and be able to throw away the
junk and that's extremely even more
important when you're if you're dealing
with such a device that may be connected
over a cellular connection back to your
cloud service there are some very nice
cellular tariffs for IOT around these
days but used to be very sensitive about
data volumes because the typical tariffs
become you know go from being quite
reasonable to being really expensive if
you if you actually exceed your um you
know the data volume that's associated
with your basic tariff so the overage
charges can quickly remove the the value
that you thought you have from your
solution if you're not very careful so
again the ability to put intelligence
out close to the device so that you can
filter the data remove the junk from the
data be able to acts on abnormalities
that you see in that data perhaps very
close to the to where the data is being
generated we think that's extremely
important but equally important is the
ability to ultimately be able to send
for restore and persist and manipulate
all of that data and be able to apply
the tools that allow you to extract
information from from that data whether
that's in real time or in more of a
batch mode sort of a more traditional
business intelligence type application
so we provide firstly integrated into
the service the ability to store all
that data and to scale the storage of
that data as your needs grow we provide
REST API is that allow all of that
stored data to be to be queried and
manipulated and again security just
because we put something into a database
doesn't mean that we can forget then
forget about security so all of the
queries that are you know accessing that
information are all authorized so again
we make sure that at all stages you
customer can understand and control war
entities within their IOT solution have
access to to which devices and in this
case which which pieces of data so let's
talk a bit a little bit about real-time
analytics so the Oracle has a product
called Oracle event processing or OTP
and they are announcing at Oracle
OpenWorld this week and you provide
called stream Explorer OAP is
traditionally been something that a Java
programmer would use to generate and
what's called an event processing
Network what stream Explorer does is to
open up rule the world of real-time
analytics to business users so that you
can without having to write you know be
the kind of person that can write Java
code and have detailed understanding of
data models you can build you know
real-time analytics the ability to
visualize the important features of the
data that's that you're seeing in real
time and to be able to attach workflows
to to that analysis so those workflows
using different Oracle components can be
automatic so that you're you know you
decide that you should take some action
to you know change some aspect of your
of your IT network or user use some kind
of actuator to change some parameter in
the real world based on the patterns
that you're detecting in the data or
obviously you can you know kick off
workflow that actually alerts some some
an actual person that may be sent
there's some decision that needs to be
taken or some action needs to be
authorized or whatever so the this you
know this is a really good example I
think of where we're taking the ability
that we have
to create the client platform to funnel
all this information into a cloud
service but also to combine that with
all of the other things that are achlys
done over the last 3040 years and create
a really valuable platform that allows
you to extract business value from from
this this IOT network not just a whole
lot of data and I this is one of the one
of the pieces of what we're doing that
I'm most looking forward to to demoing
when as soon as we're able to do that
then business intelligence some you know
this is a very another area where Oracle
has a lot of assets that we can apply it
to these kind of problems so again how
do you how do you take all this this
data that you're accumulating and be
able to extract value from it the other
visualize it in different ways so the
folks who need to make decisions can can
use you know the intelligence of being
able to manipulate big data streams to
in order to be able to make those
decisions so we use the we integrate
with the Oracle business intelligence
cloud service and this gives you you
know many many different ways of being
able to visualize your information to be
able to model the data to be able to
drill down into specific aspects of what
you're seeing unto a lot of a lot of
different advanced analytics operations
on the information that you're gathering
in order to really see what's happening
than to see where you need to be taking
action as a business and there's a huge
array of options they have for being
able to visualize the information that
you've got whether it's geographically
in a lot of different graphical ways
they've got great options for dealing
with time-series data and so on so again
this is you know being able to integrate
with with
with services like this makes the
difference between simply being able to
gather data and being able to actually
extract information and take sensible
business decisions based on all of that
information that you're Gary so I talked
about several different ways in which
the information is passed and through
the IOT cloud service can be can be
manipulated visualized acted upon and so
on for any individual solution there are
always going to be other thing other
services other applications that need to
be able to integrate with all of this
data and the the capabilities of your IT
network so we have this thing called the
dispatcher framework which allows you
know information that's passing through
your IOT iat cloud service specifically
through the message proxy to be able to
be dispatched in a secure fashion to
other other back-end services other
applications and so on so again I
mentioned the word security you know
this is another way in which you know
it's another route into the system and
another way of accessing the resources
and the data and again we have to make
sure that we maintain a coherence
security model and we maintain a way in
which you can continue to make strong
statements about which entities have
access to what and which entities are
allowed to do do what operations within
your system so we have a number of
different predefined dispatcher types
and worst-case you can always say you
know create a restful endpoint that you
can simply post information to out of
the IOT cloud service but that all of
you know all the messages that go to a
particular dispatcher instance will
always be authorized so you have
complete control over the security
policy and over what with what
subset of the information that that's
flowing for your service will be
accessible by different dispatchers and
again dispatchers are one example of an
endpoint they're one type of endpoint
that I mentioned earlier and obviously
when you're making outgoing connections
from the cloud service like this then
the ability to to do that over a secured
authenticated connection or to go
without saying but I thought I'd
mentioned it anyway okay so I shoot some
non non Java devices and yes they do
exist I showed some non Java devices on
the architecture diagram at the
beginning of my section and it's
important to say that what what we're
talking about here as Oracle is I like
to say that this the Internet of Things
with Java not just the Internet of Java
things so it's very very important that
we provide ways of integrating devices
and applications into an IOT solution
regardless of whether whether you've
chosen to use Java is your
implementation language so we provide
you know set at rest api is from the
cloud service that firstly allow you to
you can program you know applications
for non java devices to those rest api
is one way of integrating and we also
have situations where we're doing with
folks that they have existing you know
device clouds that are not actually as
capable as as the service that that
Oracle is is offering and therefore we
have REST API is that allow for the
integration of those device clouds into
an Oracle IOT cloud service so again you
can then apply the same level of
security and so on to the interaction
there and again
so you have ways of bill of taking
existing infrastructure and being able
to integrate that into the the Oracle
IOT platform so again we want you to be
able to our customers to be able to use
their existing infrastructure both on
the device side where that exists but
also as well as on the the enterprise
side ok so this is the this is the
mandatory health warning the at the end
of the presentation so please please
bear that in mind and if anyone's got
any questions then we would yeah sure so
just a couple of thoughts that I'd like
to leave you with before we take
questions
oh one of the things that Noll pointed
out was when we started out working on
this we looked at security security and
I think you said security hopefully
today what we've done is we've taken a
vision presented a year ago and tried to
break it down into more concrete this is
how we bring Java and a lot of Oracle's
technologies to bear on the problem but
one of the keys I can't harp on enough
is when you look at solutions today for
the Internet of Things the first part of
that is the Internet and just by the
fact of nature the internet wasn't
created secure didn't it was created to
connect things freely and over the last
20 years plus we've spent a lot of time
trying to figure out how to now secure
that that in itself is one of the
driving reasons why we went back to
first principles and looked at what it
would take to build a secure solution
that used the Internet and I think what
the Oracle team has come up with is
something that they can do just that so
props to Knohl and his team on that note
again I hope we were able to share with
you some things that were we're
interesting with or
kind of direction in this area and what
it is that we're building and I'd like
to take any questions
so I would say there are very large
percentages so the question is how much
how much of this has been built and how
much work is left to be done I would say
there are very large percentages of each
of the three main areas that are up and
running
it can be deployed either on Prem or
incontinent as a cloud service very good
point for those of you saw one of the
keynotes yesterday we did a telematics
demo and actually that was running on on
this framework so that there's a there's
enough that we can demo
so the question is we said that we're
api's for cloud service integration -
just to correct that there there are
api's for a framework that we are
developing they are not yet available
yes
so not all of the device management has
been worked out at this point
actually I'm sorry to repeat that
question the questions were we using
OSGi and and specifically unless unless
you want to offer further comment no so
GI is clearly one you know one one
implementation option on the on the
device side you know obviously we have
you know erekle we have you know Java ME
embedded which you know that that is not
run OSGi and the you know so we have to
have ways of running the the do not
involve err do not need to involve our
STR but OSGi is obviously one one option
that's available on the client side
thank you always pays to go right to the
source I do not have dates for the API
release at this time you're welcome
any other questions no lore I can answer
for you today on that note we'd like to
thank you very much for for your time
