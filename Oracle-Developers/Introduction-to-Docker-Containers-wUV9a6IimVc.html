and management and this this thing I
keep saying like a registry but we're
gonna go over that and talk about what
these different things mean now there
are a couple of things that I will
mention that our roadmap items for
Oracle I will I will point them out if
we get there but they are covered under
our safe harbor just you know for legal
T's and C's but today we're going to
really really look at the history of
containers right and it actually goes
back beyond the last three years or so
with with docker the company we're gonna
look at some of the better use cases for
containers I get asked this question all
the time what's whether good
applications what are good types of
things to do in containers we're gonna
look at some of the basic architecture
and nomenclature so you will walk out of
here and then if I stop you in the
hallway later and say hey what's a
docker image you're gonna be able to
tell me exactly what that is we're gonna
talk about why docker is hot and we're
gonna talk about some of the trends in
the industry and you know I'm just I'll
point to some additional resources and
that type of stuff but let's talk about
the history right because the history is
pretty interesting it it really is all
part of an evolution of a lot of
different things at the same time the
evolution of a development process
everything up into today's modern DevOps
I was on a call with a big company this
morning and you know you would know this
if they're in healthcare and and and
they said we want to get beyond
releasing something on a once a month
once a month basis we want to get down
to maybe even daily or even hourly types
of bills right this whole concept of
micro services that's all part of this
as well you know a lot of people can
misconstrue Micra services and
containers those are two separate things
you can do micro services without
containers containers just make for a
really nice way to package a micro
service and this whole phenomenon called
the cloud right where things are
abstracted and you
use compute network and storage just
like you you're plugging into to the
wall to grab electricity right you
basically rent it and use it and and put
it away when you don't need it but
containers have been around believe it
or not since 1979
they've been evolved in UNIX and and and
Linux more recently and there's probably
even more on top of this as we've moved
forward the important thing is that to
know that this technology called
containerization has is not necessarily
new but what is new is the phenomenon
that the startup company called docker
created the buzz because they created a
technology that was usable by mere
humans prior to the way they packaged it
up you had to have a PhD in something to
really be able to use these types of
technologies they really brought this
type of movement to the masses and
that's the key thing to take away from
this so a lot of people and we'll get
into you know what are all these you
know what is specifically
containerization but I really like to
cover because I was an application
development manager I worked for a
company called Compaq Computer I was
actually in the IT group I was a develop
development manager and director and my
responsibility was although all the
sales and marketing apps that compact
used worldwide right and we did some
crazy stuff and some technologies called
Lotus Notes Oracle database and and
writing front-end client-server
applications this is 20 years ago so
this whole area has changed and and
we're you know as we are moving forward
right so let's talk about some of the
better use cases right and there are
five little blocks here and some of them
in our relate and let me walk through it
so the first is ready to run application
stacks and I think this is one of the
coolest things because for example
if you know if you go out and you look
at some of the docker labs that I've
written I've got a little WordPress
stack WordPress and sequel server right
and if I were to say to anybody in the
room hey go fire up WordPress and put a
database behind it and let me know how
long that takes you and you know it
could take you hours or days to put that
up on some server somewhere and get that
up and running where I can give you this
little what I call a stack it's a docker
compose file and you could run that and
you literally it the containers will be
up in seconds and you will have a ready
to use WordPress application did you
know exactly you know how what what is
but but you did it right these
containers come up they're ready to run
you when you access WordPress you log
into it just like you were logging in on
a server so the ready to run stack is a
really cool concept so this is extended
now today with things called helm charts
which is used in a technology called
kubernetes just stand up a more complex
collection of containers that interact
with each other this whole thing is
pretty cool and you can literally do
this type of stuff now in seconds or
minutes where it may have taken you days
to do these types of stand-up some of
these apps the other thing is new
application development and micro
services how many people heard about 12
factor 12 factor what am I trying to say
12 step refactoring as far as moving
something into a Mike reservist so what
containers are really good for is if you
were to take an application that you
already have and refactor it and rebuild
it and re develop it with containers
that you could do the whole application
or maybe just a section of it and let me
talk to you about that it worked and
this goes hand-in-hand with the front
app front-end app servers on the right
hand side worked with a bang
they were regional bank they had to
compete against the big guys you know
Wells Fargo and Bank of America and
those those types of companies and how
does a regional bank or smaller local
bank compete nowadays they don't compete
by getting you in their branches and
giving you all this wonderful service
right they compete by building the best
mobile and browser-based applications to
do your consumer banking on them you
know with them right and so they took a
legacy application their banking
application and they just containerized
the front end and containerized in the
front end allowed them to increase the
user experience even though all the
transactions were still being done on
the back end through the middleware and
traditional type databases but the front
end experience was based in containers
and they were able to iterate this on
this and get feedback and improve it and
really create a great mobile and browser
experience so those things kind of go
hand in hand
back on the left one time run jobs and
analytics there's a company called SAS
SAS they make a big application for
statistical analysis and they discovered
that you know again you know to take
their app and run it would might take a
couple days to get that set up so
they're starting to put that in a
container a big app like nine gigs in a
container run it the folks can try it
run their analysis spin it up spin it
down take the data and they're done so
one time run jobs analytics great use
case for containers again front-end app
servers again front-end app servers have
the ability you know you you're you're
deploying these behind a load balancer
so you can do these things called canary
deployments and rolling deployments or
maybe you know you're segmenting your
traffic 50% get the new version 50% get
the old version you can test a B test
between them then wall everybody to the
newest version lot of a lot of
innovation with that type of methodology
this whole concept of cattle not pets
right we don't name containers right
like servers we don't care if a
container dies container does work if it
goes away another one takes its place if
we need to scale we just scale if we
need to descale we D scale they're built
to just exist or not exist to do their
work and go away they're ephemeral right
by design they do not retain data you
have to build in data retention
mechanisms in which to pull the data out
right and and persist that but by
themselves they're ephemeral and then
server density right again I'm talking
to this account this morning they were
running docker containers on bare metal
no hypervisor they thought that was
great you know there's a certain company
that a lot of people want to push to the
side first letter of that company is V
right so the idea of running on compute
directly without a hypervisor has a
bunch of of positives including
performance and server density so the
ability to BIM pack into to maximize the
amount of of containers that you're
doing that are doing work given a you
know your compute behind it that's
that's key those are great use cases
right what's not on their database I
don't necessarily think database is a
great use case for containers there are
great database ways to run databases
today
sort of like what virtualization was
right was databases virtualized in the
beginning not necessarily so I think
we'll continue to see the evolution of
containers but maybe using database as a
you know bringing up a dev test
environment and doing some testing and
having a DB running in a test container
you know that might be a good use case
but production I really think you should
that on some kick-ass dedicated platform
for the database my opinion right but
again those things that are ephemeral
come up do work you don't care if they
go away
those are great use cases what this this
is a this is back from 2016 seems like
ancient history is I get almost
embarrassed by putting something up
there with a date to two years ago but
the reason people are using containers
hasn't changed
it's a DevOps story right it's it's a
developers developers developers it does
help you know in migrating to the clouds
one thing that containers are very
portable right so I have a container I
can basically run that container on any
Linux server that's running the docker
engine makes it very portable I don't
have to have all the dependent libraries
that the application needs those are all
built into the container so let's talk
about that architecture and some of
those terms here if I were to compare a
virtual machine to a container those
things are quite different right a
virtual machine again runs on top of a
hypervisor the file has a complete copy
of the guest operating system again
whether that be Windows or Linux or
whatever it's a complete copy of the
guest operating system in there and then
inside a virtual machine you can you can
put your you know your application
libraries and everything you might need
to run an application and you install
the application whereas a container
runs on top of particularly the docker
engine the docker engine provides the
every every Linux server has to have
this docker engine installed for the
container to run and the container
shares the kernel of that Linux
operating system it does not have to
have a full Linux OS built into the
container you just have basically what
what dependencies that the application
needs to run
The Container maybe whatever setup and
and so on and so forth but it shares the
kernel so it's much smaller and it's
much quicker to basically boot or to
come up right so a VM might take a
couple could take a couple minutes to
come up and run all the things that
needs to run a container I've seen
containers come up in in a second you
know they just over there and they're
ready to run and it's an amazing thing
so container basically the takeaways
here or containers are very lightweight
they have only what they need to run the
application it makes it portable I can
run that basically on any Linux server
that's running the docker engine just
the same way each and every time and
then you know I'll preface that with you
know there's a 90 some percent you know
probability or so there are cases where
there are a little bit of dependencies
on some containers but most open-source
containers just you know run them where
you want so the architecture right with
what makes up some of this stuff so if
you're on your laptop and you want to
interface with docker you might use the
docker CLI so you could install docker
on your Mac very very easily you can
install docker in a VM you can install
it in a server but the way that you
connect with it is through a CLI command
line interface known as the docker
client or the docker CLI it's just when
you you know if you if you're at a
command prompt basically or a terminal
window and you and you issue a command
like docker run right the CLI is you
just are communicating with the docker
engine directly through this CLI a
docker file now a docker files like a
recipe and I'll show you example of a of
one of these it's it's a recipe of
instructions on how to assemble a docker
image right so you got this docker file
it's sort of the instructions says do
this do this take this base OS layer on
this app and do this configuration and
then when you run or
run the docker file to create the docker
image write the image then is basically
what when you run the image that the
container is the result of running that
image so the container is the running
instantiation of a docker image docker
images either live locally on your
laptop like you could you could create
them there or you could create them up
on a server right and then if you want
to put them somewhere that's where the
registry comes in
so registry of the place that people can
write images to and the docker hub is
the probably the biggest registry in the
world it's got thousands and thousands
of images images that you can all the
public images you can just go pull down
and run a copy of nginx or Redis or or
whatever image you might want to run but
those images live in registries so just
to be clear docker files is the recipe
you create an image an image is stored
on your laptop you can push that up to a
registry like docker hub once it's on
docker hub you make it public everybody
in the room could share it and run that
container wherever you want to run it
make sense okay so the docker engine the
docker engine is a daemon that runs on
the Linux server and it has all the
knowledge of how to run these containers
and docker the company is and in and is
innovating around some of the things
that you can do here but the docker
engine is the specific things that you
won't you need to run on your server or
your laptop or wherever you're doing
this for the containers to run once it's
installed you run containers all day
long it's a beautiful thing if you come
to the lab later one of the first things
that we're going to do is I'm going to
say what do you have docker installed
the docker engine somewhere is the
exercises that we'll do in the lab we
gotta run them somewhere so there's a
little bit of a
of a hurdle here now getting the
environment set up but we'll we'll talk
about that in the lab and there's a few
options including using some trial
oracle trial VMS and suchlike like that
that you can do
so dr. images docker images is based on
a layered file system when you look at
an image you can see the layers they're
actually you know visible and it has the
software built in that you want to run
with the configuration and whatever OS
stuff that it needs and those layers are
read-only
so if I run a container if I run the
image and run that container you know
whatever if I if I log in let's take
that WordPress example right if I if I
log into WordPress and I write a blog
and that blog some of the information is
saved to the sequel my sequel database
right and I stop those containers that
data is gone unless I persisted out to a
local volume or some other types of
storage so you know images and
containers again are basically read-only
here's a great this this docker file is
just a hello world example it's an
actual docker file from co-worker of
mine by the name of Scott Baldwin it's
out on github you can go to that URL
this this presentation will be available
to you it'll be up on the site so you
can go back and look at this docker file
and you can you can build it the way you
build it is you do over on the right dr.
bill - T hello world and you give it a
tag name we're calling this one dot o
and it'll go with the docker engine
installed it'll build what's on the Left
right which is basically a an engine X
app that when it comes up it says hello
world very complex but yet I'm teasing
about the complexity but it gives you a
good idea of you know a basic docker
file and how that's constructed
and then I mentioned docker hub the
registry I go back to the registry I'm
actually a product manager for the
Oracle cloud infrastructure registry
that will come out a little bit later
this year but a registry is basically a
place to put images nothing more complex
than that and images can live in
repositories or repos and those can be
private or public depending upon how you
set it right and those allow you to
share images and you know I can say
docker hub allows people to share images
with the world if you're working in an
organization or a company obviously you
can you could run your own registry
right and put put things in it run that
on-prem run it in the cloud run it
wherever you want the most important to
walk away thing to walk away with here
is a registry is just simply a place to
put images there's public ones like the
docker hub and and other technologies
like way and and so on and so forth or
you know people spin up their own to the
docker CLI here's a list of not an
inclusive list but a list of sample
commands that you might want to run with
the docker CLI including docker build
what do we use docker build for to take
that docker file and to create an image
docker run runs an image write all these
things allow you to manipulate basically
the docker files in the images and run
those as containers and this is great at
the elemental level so using the docker
CLI to run a container very very easy
everybody in this room could if I gave
you a docker environment you know is it
could be as easy as docker run hello
world and something would happen right
something would happen so for example
eight a very simple docker command as
docker run hello world that will do
something by default it will pull down
the hello
public image off the docker hub and it
will spit out some text in the terminal
window and say hey you've just run your
first container and a bunch of other
stuff and it will run okay
docker run can also be fairly complex
right the bottom example is an example
of an actual private registry right
because a registry can actually be a
running container right that's persisted
the data is persisted and all of that
know-how of how that containers run is
in this is in this command and it relies
on things like certificates why because
it's a it's an actual private registry
that you would use HTTPS or SSL to
connect to you would authenticate to it
you'd push your image to it securely
over SSL it would write that out to a
volume the volumes are down the dash
fees are the are aware the the certs and
the registry images themselves are
stored on the local server volume in
this case but all that stuff all that
intelligence is built into the docker
run command and with the funny thing is
to actually find out how to do that that
that this command took me about three
days but once I did it everybody in this
room could run that command and run it
very very easily which goes back to the
portability thing so again what we're
talking about here is at the elemental
level and I say elemental of I'm talking
about single containers the HelloWorld
container that I'm running here that's
one container the registry I'm running
here is one container how many people
only have one thing running in their
application right it's made up of a
bunch of different things and those
things have to work together I'll go
back to the WordPress example WordPress
is on the right it includes my sequel
and a wordpress container two containers
so we've moved from one to two and now
our complexity level has increased a lot
right in order to run two containers
together I can't use the docker seoi
right I can't necessarily use the docker
engine alone I have to go out and
install another application called
docker compose docker compose then gives
me the ability to run a doctor - compose
yml file the Amal file and to
orchestrate together two containers that
interact with each other and if you ran
what's on the right it'll run it'll spin
up a wordpress instance application
instance it'll spin up a my sequel
database you can connect to it right
through the normal way that you connect
to WordPress you create a login you log
into it you write your first blog to
kill the containers what happens to that
blog anybody disappears disappears
unless unless you have some persistence
in there and you see I wonder if my
little laser is working it's working but
it won't show up over there so you see
in there the where it says volumes and
it says /var dub dub dub HTML that type
of thing there's a there's a volume
statement in each one of those that's
how you persist the data so you I'm
telling the containers to write their
data out both from the my sequel piece
and funny enough WordPress doesn't keep
a lot of the metadata in my sequel part
it actually writes it in into the volume
but anyway that's that's the secret
there so that's two containers so we've
talked about one container
to container but what about three or
more well that's that's where it gets
really interesting so come back to that
quick
so why docker is hot Dockers hot because
it really allows a lot of the evolution
of modern-day computing it's it's great
for devtest
and I say devtest of legacy apps go back
to the concept I said where I could take
give you a stack I can give you a stack
that one that runs WebLogic write a
whole web logic logic cluster I can put
that in containers and I can use that to
test against because I can spin up this
web logic cluster like that two minutes
but pretty much like that do my testing
tear it down so testing of legacy apps
new app development we talked about that
utilizing micro services and such allows
you to do you know this thing called CI
CD continuous integration continuous
delivery of code because I can iterate
on that docker file and make a new image
and and put that out there and test it
and see how that performs versus the the
previous one if it doesn't perform I get
rid of it and go on to the next one it's
a beautiful thing it allows you to adopt
open source yeah that work was up here
today talking about open source we do a
lot of things in open source
we're like a pipe a member of the CNC F
the cloud native computing foundation we
are contributor to the kubernetes
project we've written a lot of open
source you go out on github slash Oracle
it's Chuck full of stuff that we've you
know we've put out there for you to use
freely it's great so it allows you to
utilize a lot of this stuff you know in
our cloud you know as you need and just
you know pay for what you use in the
cloud and then it allows you to move to
micro services and basically cloud or
canal container native applications this
is a new word we moved beyond cloud data
now we're talking about container native
so containers are first you know
priority
type object and then you know developers
care because it gives them innovation
and ability to to iterate on on images
and code and push that freely and IT
cares because the stuff runs the same
way in dev and test as it does in
production allows you to easily move
stuff out into production and you know
the again the guys I talked to today
they were they were rolling monthly
monthly builds right well they know that
adopting this type of process allows
them to be a little bit more flexible
and to push builds much more frequently
ok let's go back and when I use the word
functions here I mean actual things like
you know capabilities right I'm not
talking about there's another type of
functions that's evolved which is part
and parcel with serverless
the lab this afternoon will go into that
functions probably change that word on
the slide because now it's overused hate
overuse words you know tags another
overuse where it has a completely
different connotation in docker as it
does with other things but at the end of
the day the basic docker engine docker
composed gives you the ability to run
one or two containers however we want to
orchestrate a whole application and this
is where the whole orchestration market
has evolved right again I told you I was
part of an acquired company called stack
engine back in 2015 we haven't had a
docker management solution and with gave
you the ability to orchestrate many many
containers and run them together right
that product exists today is oracle
container cloud service classic and now
it's got the classic designation which
means it's a first generation container
management product right we will be
introducing and anticipate the
introduction and this is one of those
safe-harbor things the introduction of a
managed kubernetes service later little
later this year right manage kubernetes
basically means that we
stand up all the hard stuff you just go
use the clusters right and you use
native kubernetes orchestration to
orchestrate the docker containers that
are running in it now doctor had its own
technology this for this called swarm
right and swarm and kubernetes you know
if you look at a horse race they were
running neck-and-neck through what are
we in 2018 now you know 2016 2017 but
really kubernetes is pulled ahead
the majority of organizations now want
to move towards using kubernetes because
it provides a uniform way in which to
tell containers how to run together in a
compute cluster right all it is is a
container all it is it's very
sophisticated software Google developed
it they put it out it's true open source
it's managed by the CNC F is one of
their project like the apache group CNC
F is uh is another group they manage
kubernetes and it is by far the leading
horse in this race as far as
orchestration is it the easiest to use
no it is not is not necessarily easy but
it works once you get your your manifest
these things that that commits think of
remember that docker compose file it was
a yeah Mille file so the way you run
these kubernetes orchestrations is also
through yeah Mille and it's basically a
description of how those containers
should run there's plenty of examples of
those out on the internet but again this
is now gone beyond docker the company
now we're talking about docker the
ecosystem which now includes
orchestration which now includes
kubernetes as the lead character in this
show and this is just after you know
three four years of doing
containerization all of this is evolved
so good stuff here as far as what Oracle
does if you wanted to use docker with
in our cloud on the left is a DIY
approach where you know you can go
install kubernetes there's a over look
it up it's really funny this guy by the
name of Kelsey Hightower did a it's our
own github it's called kubernetes the
hard way tells you exactly how to set up
to burn Etta's and you know it's a step
by step process you can go do that you
could use Oracle Linux which supports
kubernetes as an Orchestrator supports
docker us now 1706 see e-version
natively you can go stand that up you
could use docker swarm out there you
could use maysa out there that's all a
DIY experience or the middle box sort of
the Goldilocks thing right the middle
box is the terraform installer so we
have a OCI OCI stands for oracle cloud
infrastructure terraform installer for
kubernetes is out on github it's open
source you can take it you can
orchestrate a three master redundant in
three ADEs kubernetes cluster and go use
it all in that kubernetes cluster you
can run docker remember docker worker
nodes run in kubernetes clusters and
those are running what the docker engine
right comes back to the elemental factor
of what's running on each of those Linux
servers what does that be bare metal or
VMs we have both of those available in
our cloud and then again safe harbor
replies a little later this year we're
going to have the Oracle cloud
infrastructure container engine for
kubernetes which is the managed service
which means that or quill will spin up
those masters and the Etsy d clusters in
which then you just connect through the
kubernetes CLI known as cube CTL or cube
cuddle to your docker cluster and
utilizing the manifests or helm charts
or whatever launch your containers as
you need orchestrated in
that Fuster taking the hard part out of
spinning up the kubernetes cluster go
back to what I said about Kelsey
Hightower kubernetes is the hard way
this is the easy way it's all spun up
where you all managed that type of thing
so those that's a little bit about what
Oracle is doing in this space again you
know it almost seems like kubernetes now
is out outshining what docker is so now
you guys are thinking well I've been to
this docker 101 session now I gotta go
to kubernetes 101 that's a whole nother
ball wax right I've got something on
that too but more about that later so a
couple additional resources just for fun
I do have a docker lab a full you know
let's say you know nothing well
everything you know about docker
containers let's say you learned in this
room and maybe you knew how to spell it
before you walked in this room and now
you guys want to go try some hands-on
I've got this great lab one github it's
a github slash Oracle I wrote it it's
called docker 0:01
I didn't even approach the 101 I wanted
to make sure that you know a lot of the
information we just covered is in the
first section of this you go in you
verify your thing this afternoon if
you're in the docker and functions lab
you'll be doing sections one or actually
two three and four of this of this lab
here but it's also got you know takes
everything we talked about in this talk
you run a docker compose file you go in
you create a wordpress blog you will
destroy the containers your blog will
disappear you'll go back you'll make the
they can persistent and your blog will
persist
anyway that's good stuff if you do want
to know about our Jen want more about
our Jen one service container cloud
service classic it's also out there you
and if you have one of those trials I
know I heard we're gonna like giving
away free cloud trials you can spin that
on and then there's some great when you
log into it there's some ready-to-run
stacks that you can just deploy
and run with that and then actually
Oracle runs official image repositories
as well so if you want to get an image
for WebLogic or you want to get an image
for the database you can either go to
the doctor store right which is part of
the docker hub or we also run our own
registry called the Oracle container
registry where you can pull down all
those images as well and again that
gives you the ability to quickly spin up
any of the of the things that we've
wrapped in a and as an image that you
can spin up as a container so I just
referenced a couple of those for you
guys and we're at 11:55 which is perfect
and just wanting to maybe see if there
are any questions I may have a hard time
hearing you so speak up let's go with
this guy right here
yeah well within kubernetes there is the
kubernetes dashboard which again
kubernetes is an open source project
they provide a dashboard so there are
some GUI tools there's also technologies
out there that like Rancher for example
which is GUI based so yes there are some
GUI based things for the construction of
containers let's say you don't want to
use docker files to to do this we
actually bought a company called ver
Kurd wer cker and you go to Mercker calm
right now sign up for a free account
they actually their container native you
would build containers with verka and
then push to whatever wherever you want
to run them so that's a that's a pretty
nice you know GUI based thing they also
have a CLI so all those tools are
available good question though right
here sir oh absolutely yes the question
was can you run docker engine on the
virtual machine
absolutely dr engine will run on a
VirtualBox VM and a run on the cloud VM
it'll run on a VMware VM you get into
this thing with Linux and Windows I do
somebody might ask this quote about
Windows right I've actually never seen a
Windows container in the wild never
only in a petri dish 99.9 percent of the
market is Linux absolutely can you
install you know docker on Windows
Server 2016 yes can you install it on
Windows 10 Business Edition or what you
know it's not the Home Edition though
what next one up
ye-yes 16 gigs of ram need to make sure
the virtualization flag is in the bios
things like that but it'll run oh it
took me half a day to get it running on
my Windows 10 machine right but I tried
it it worked
but you know at the end of the day Linux
is the technology here right set it to
the question there is a question here
yes sir so the question is what about
what about if if you're running a
licensed technology in the container
basically the licensing doesn't change
it's very it's it's probably most
similar to how it would be if you were
running in a virtual machine licensing
does not change licensing is the same
it's it's typically based on the cores
underneath and there's this stuff called
hard petitioning and I'm not necessarily
the guy to get into this but
containerization does not give you hard
petitioning it so it follows the same
rules that virtual machines follow was
there another question yes sir oh so the
workshop and and you need to
pre-register for this okay the workshop
is in Santa Anita a and B at 1:45 I'd to
write that down check with some of the
folks at the front desk if not come see
me any other questions great well you've
been a great audio I got one question
yes sir
yes
well basic it boils down to docker by
default you can use dynamic ports so it
pushes all the ports so something if you
had two applications suppose wanted to
use port 80
now docker will will take a dynamic port
which is a 30 mm range port and the
first container will run 32 8 I'm making
these these port numbers off 32 8 72 and
the second container around 32 873 those
will each be mapped to 80 inside the
container but to the outside world you
would come in on 32 8 72 and 873
respectively with regard to the volumes
you would need to write them two
separate places right
yeah you it gets a little tricky with
the volumes it really does so that's an
advanced case but the port allocation is
a beautiful thing and again think of a
bunch of nginx containers behind an
engine X load balancer right those
things will run all day long they'll
they'll bring traffic in they'll pump
out pump the transaction out to
something it's a beautiful use case for
containers yes exactly you would need to
persist the data in the database that's
why I'm saying I mean you probably want
to use a real database on a real
platform I didn't I you if you just want
to bring up Oracle database you can do
that in a in a container and you can use
it to put some test data in there and do
some stuff and then it goes away so as
long as the containers running the data
is persisted but if the container dies
the data unless it's persistent what
yeah oh yeah yes
yes yeah so so the thing is yes you need
to persist the data through mapping into
a volume or an object store or something
okay no there's no magic here something
you need to write the data somewhere for
sure okay guys you've been a great
audience thank you appreciate it
