you on yellow much time to learn more
about financial applications using Java
fix I know it is lunchtime and for
Italians lunch is the the most important
meal of the day so it's still coming
down so my name is katsu
I am the CTO of cellar and today I'm
going to talk to you about how we use
Java graphics I'm going to go through a
few technical things talk about how
seller utilizes Java effects show a few
demos of our applications I've got a
couple of goodies to show you talk about
why design is important for Fergie's and
how we actually package up all this
goodness and secure that to our clients
so who is seller so we're a financial
technology company around the globe
writing writing financial applications
solar was kind of born out of the
frustration of really bad badly created
software of written finance industry
industry for about ten years now and
I've seen it all of pretty much all bad
unfortunately you have systems finance
being a very very big industry it's
there are multiple systems to to satisfy
every single business function you can't
have one system that actually does
everything so generally what people do
is they go off and create a system it
works for itself then they need to
communicate with another doesn't really
work that well that other system doesn't
really speak the language that the other
one does yeah you've got Chinese
speaking English English speaking
Chinese just doesn't work so the whole
point of seller is actually to unify all
of that - to be as so we have a network
of systems of effect whereby you can
perform all your fine
chill trading needs at all built in Java
so this is why we use Java effects we've
used other geese as GUI technologies as
well primarily Java swing but it's
obviously Java swing was made X number
of years ago and Java faces the the new
world so just a quick show of hands who
use this swing right now okay everyone
so you're probably familiar with
something like this thing this is what
we actually built for one of my previous
projects not this exact screen obviously
but something very very similar
it's got no real style such it works
it's functional there's nothing wrong
with it for technology itself I swing
was a as it's still a good technology
but we've moved on with Java fix you've
got well actually I'm not sure if any of
you guys have used synth at all so synth
was a kind of our styling option that
came out in Java 1.5 it was job as a
team to it trying to break away from the
model of having coders write the actual
code to layout your actual panels what
you could do and since it was it was all
XML basis so you can put all your your
panels you can put color schemes in
there all that but we actually tried
that it was actually quite difficult it
took me about 2 months 2 or 3 months to
actually create a look and feel I mean
it sounds ridiculous right to 2 or 3
months just to create a style and that's
where Java fix helps us greatly
so how do we use it it's going to go
through a bit of our architecture as to
how we actually go about laying this all
out together we've got quite a complex
GUI so we like to have things quite
separated quite modular you don't have
code just you know going to lift the
rounds into you've got lift bit of the
system connecting to the right pattern
system we like to have our silos so I've
shown three vertical slices here you've
got the view presentator controller
there is one vertical slice you've got
the view at the top it's fairly
self-explanatory it's got all the your
widgets it's got all your code in there
the presenter underneath is then the the
cut the the controller in a way but it
drives the view so the view is actually
very very done in that sense it knows
how to push stuff up into the Geary's
announce to pull stuff off as well and
you've also got the controller which has
then as you can see connected to the
event bus so what is the event bus the
event bus is something that was created
by google guava if you're familiar with
that particular project library it's a
way for you to our send events from one
end of the sometimes it's a glorified so
glorified was our observer pattern
infect so you can listen upon given bus
you can send objects into the impasse
and what we do is from the controller
/ - presenter as well we can fire events
into the event bus so a simple thing
would be show our screen for example the
first vertical slice will be like I want
to show our screen it will fire an event
into the event bus and the third the
third vertical slice will go I need a
pickup I need to pick that up I need a
short screen
I don't know who wanted me to share the
screen I'll show the screen but I just
need to because I've been told - so by
doing that it means that would greatly
decoupled our code we don't have
presenters linked to the next presenter
we don't have controllers linked to the
next renter it's all done via the Saleem
bus and there's a very very clean
architecture in that sense you could
change one bit of code on the first
vertical slice and won't even affect any
of the others unless if you obviously
change the object that you're singing
through office
so with the observable properties
JavaFX when we first using direct
effects we we moved on to a very very
quickly when JavaFX 1.3 came out we were
excited it was all done in script
mmm could be done better and you know we
came from a swing background wasn't very
tight it didn't seem very type safe or
anything like that but when Oracle and
that's JavaFX 2.0 we're like yes
can't wait this is going to be awesome
so we did actually come out we were
still looking at the features and you
know things like bean validation for
example something that's missing from
swing itself we have to use libraries
like Jacobs so we kind of wrote a very
very simple way of actually validating
classes so there's been essentially an
abstraction layer between our view and
the presenter itself the reason why we
did that is so we don't have the the
view widgets leaking through to our
presenters and by doing that we can
switch out the viewers we're not
necessarily going to change of use but
if you think about things like automated
testing you can quickly run up a
headless client and automatically test
all your presenters and all your
application code without actually we're
running the actual gear itself not 100%
because it's not something like say
webdriver or selenium in the web space
but there are tools out there now that
get help us with us so we're actually
able to do some validation as you can
see everything on the method there
perform validation to perform validation
you've got this group of these validator
fields and these sorts of things these
are these are very very simple wrappers
around the actual underlying value
objects itself so you've got a if you
can imagine a text field inside of that
you've you've got the if XML as Arnon
they're fixed now the Java fixed
observable property we wrap that into
the string validated field and what we
do is we go off
grab the value check to see if it's
valid and if it is or isn't we we set
invalid by virtue of doing that it's
going to link back to the GUI and show
like a red box so it's something very
very easy something something that I
don't think terrific's has at the moment
I know that Java right and there is some
validation in there but I'm not too sure
to exactly which extent and the good
thing about this is with what swing you
you have to fire off table changes if
you if you add new roads that into the
table if you switch out the panel or you
make changes to your containers you can
have to fire repaints refreshes all of
that or swing oh sorry listen if with it
fix ml sorry can start again with chakra
fix there's no need for that because
everything's a listener everything is a
property you can just change it and it
will just automatically changes itself
which is a great thing because then you
don't have to worry about how the GUI
actually reacts another another reason
why this bean abstraction is very very
helpful
so if XML so how does it how does it
help us out so if it's about is the the
synth equivalent of of Java effects it's
the ability to be able to put all your
layout logic put all your styling and
all of that into an if it into an XML
type object
I was type file and have a completely
only Java class that only has things
like what does why happens when you push
a button what happens if someone adds a
new table row so you don't have to you
can completely from the Java code remove
yourself from from where the button sets
how its laid out which container it sets
in all of that the great thing about
this is that allows your developers to
actually focus on the features and
allows your designers to focus on the
actual layout itself
that means that if you can if you can
have these two types of these two
different skill sets in your team you
can do these in parallel you don't have
to do that at same time you don't have
to rely on for example a group bag layer
saying move it a couple of pixels to the
left because I don't really like it
developers not really very interested in
that sort of stuff I know I'm not buying
it but
but yeah so just just to quickly touch
on this some example code don't try and
take this in compile it because I won't
we've got here is a label at the top
when the XML in two different files
you've got the the backing java java
class that sits behind it if they're a
fix if we had a wide screen here you
would actually see the extra java class
thing or it should say if it quite took
it view input but if you've got the ID
the bit label and you've got the bit
label down the bottom so very easily you
can see the abstraction already and it's
very easy for you know from the Java
code to manipulate the label as per even
the properties or you can even do it
directly itself but it separates out the
two types of functionality and it's
great so our CICS architecture that's
the other big feature within Java fix
itself being able to start by a CSS so
Java fix has a route a route style
it's called Caspian orders in and m7 I
think it's called modena
and eight but it interfered what we're
doing here is we're overriding the root
element what we're doing here is we're
actually having a color palette so
someone coming in can quickly go to the
top of the file look at the root node
see the color palette and change it by
doing that you're affecting all the
colors across across the board so from
one the code snippet we've got the two
as you can see by virtue of the
variables that are exactly the same on
the other side and they move over to the
root and to the element styles and then
the third one we've got the actual CSS
classes that we've got that a particular
button may actually use so you from
within the if XML you can just reference
the start the the CSS class and what you
need to do is change the rear element
and
Crysta it all changes another thing that
was quite important to us was as the
user state because our application has
run over mortal potentially multiple
locations for a given user it was very
important to save you state I mean no
one wants to log on to a system or into
a GUI showing just the default layer'
even though I've changed it completely
when I locked out and login so what we
did what we've done because it was not
something that would let us provide a
vibe from Java future as well is be able
to actually persist the information all
this information is it is is saved when
the user logs out so things like
position screens which columns are
showing which windows are open how big
they are a type of thing you don't want
to just come in and go my windows up
here wheels over here and you know move
it spend the next five minutes changing
it back to what you actually had in it
so all that information is loaded so
what we've got is a very simple
interface we also why everyone actually
sit here is we actually use spring to
bootstrap all of our views so our
controllers are in effect that the views
not in a traditional controller sense in
it and in that case so what we do is
when we try and load the user state you
obviously need to have the widget we
actually then push on to the widget and
push the user state into is no point
actually grabbing that and then have no
widget to put it onto so what we've got
is a just a simple callback interface
where we know that the widgets actually
being created everything like that and
then we just say okay if it smell has
been initialized go off and do what you
want to do in this particular case what
we're doing is we're retrieving table
and
and changing or basically putting in the
columns so yeah but it's not all good
like I was saying we we moved to Java 7v
Java C and Java graphics very very early
I think we even did it before it was
part of Java 7 itself so was missing a
lot of widgets primarily the dialogs and
the spinners we had to create these on
our own because we still needed them
which was a bit of a pain but you know
that's that's what happens when you've
got it when you're an early adopter of
Technology but there's a lot of stuff
it's all taken care of within Java rate
using the extra libraries like control
effects and a terrific as well and also
testing tools testing tools were we're
not in the web space we don't have
things like selenium we don't have
webdriver and these these testing tools
like Jimmy effects and test effects are
the ones that we use to help simulate
what a user would actually do themselves
so there's good automated testing is
always good so why is designed and
portent this may look familiar to you
guys so as a kid I used to love eating
chicken nuggets and fries but did I
really like the food
probably not it was okay but what I did
like was the fact that it came in a box
the fact that I had a toy inside the
fact that I could do the activities on
the outside link the dots played noughts
and crosses that sort of stuff so what
was i buying into spying into the
experience itself not the actual content
so we at summer we're not in the food
industry
but we write code and the epic the the
GUI that you create is in effect the
window to your to your system and is the
only thing that the user sees so you're
better off making that look look and
feel as good as as good as it can
as simple as it is as it can be and as
intuitive as it can be as well so what
the developers like myself I think I
think features first design later the
whole I'll get it working first
mentality
I'll get it working I worry about the
GUI later button can do it right there
it doesn't really matter it still it
still pushes it still submits an order
doesn't matter all right
but what people generally do is you know
they get it all working and someone
notices are you finished cool to move on
to the next thing and then what you left
off off with is just to go a half-baked
GUI that is very very functional but it
doesn't look that great so feature is
important but people like looking at
cool things and want to be wowed and
it's that experience that they want so
what's up we've got a design team that
actually uses things traditional
traditional designer type tools like
Photoshop Adobe Illustrator to actually
construct and mock out what a GUI would
look like
then with import that into until you fix
ml and using tools that scene builder to
then create the skeleton of the extra
GUI itself all the while at the same
time developers also writing the
underlying code as well so you can you
get massive efficiency the efficiencies
by doing that because you're not reliant
with Swing you are completely reliant on
developer laying out the GUI itself to
ensure that it worked here you don't
need to
so if I was the design of GUI it'll
probably look like something like this
pretty ugly probably looks only a mother
could love it has no color it's fully
functional as ice as I saying because
I'm a developer but it leads to a bad
user experience it works you can see you
can't but you can't see a
differentiation between the different
parts of the screen you can't see it at
toppers or what is prices you can't
really tell what the bottom is orders
you have to read to understand the
screen colors provide you with a with a
soft functionality of of color
recognition we don't live in or
monochrome life we understand colors red
means stop green means go same on the
trading world and yeah so the levels
design what we start off and off with is
a Caspian base it's no frills or works
well it gets you up and running really
quickly you know if you want to do some
quick prototyping in Java effects
there's no point in thinking about what
it looks like in the Stallions
in the GUI isn't on it you must just use
the base default the second layer is a
pleasant simple layout where we're using
colors but we're not using them
coherently you know we're just using
colors just for the sake of actually
putting colors and they don't really
mean anything you know they don't look
that nice the third layer is they're all
in the all in layer where we're
providing a completely immersive
experience to the user where they where
they look at in a little while this is
this is amazing this looks awesome
you know I really want to use this
so what was the the same bullet so I'll
just quickly brush over this but this is
a tool that was provided by Java by Java
and Java graphics and it allows the
designers to quickly build your GUI up
really really fast so you can drag your
widgets up off on the side drag them
onto your panel lay them up you know
move them around move the couple of
pixels left couple pixels right you can
miss them you can address it you can
basically do everything so you don't
even have to touch if it's an eye at all
there's obviously great because
designers a visual they don't they're
not coders so you know you can probably
teach remix ml but you could probably
teach them using a simpler much much
quickly much much more faster and it'll
be much more fun for them as well
there's also a preview mode where you
can actually apply CSS to it so for
example that we've got the screen down
here on the bottom and the preview
motors up there on the top right so they
can quickly go this color worked and it
looks a bit weird compared to the next
color but the overall undertone to all
of this is the fact that the designer
does not have to actually even pull up
the application to bootstrap the
application to even start it to see what
this screen will look like they can
quickly do it from within same border
not not requiring any sort of
development help or anything like that
to actually have the system start up so
it's really really good they can work
autonomously by themselves as a designer
so there's one of our one of our gi's so
it looks like we've got the black
background which kind of helps you fade
all the colors out fade the the
irrelevant parts of the more irrelevant
parts to the background to let the
colors let the colors in there and the
lightest Hicks to pop up so being a
training application we've got prices
and we've got orders prices are very
important a trader or user would would
be doing something they'll look up and
they'll get them this is the price you
know they need to do that quickly they
don't want to be reading takes they
don't know what's their price am i
buying or sell
you know they want to be really really
quick so there are visual cues to all of
that so cell is is red and bias blue and
we use that same color palette across
the borders you can see on the orders
panel down the bottom all orders table
we're using the exact same colors we try
and keep our color palette very very
very very simplified in the sense that
we don't use many colors at all we don't
want to kaleidoscope of colors we want
just the simple ones now and there's
instant recognition with what it
actually means
biological for all of this it means that
you've got increased usability for the
x-ray application itself and it's nice
to look at and it's fun to use so we've
got a couple of gue couple other goodies
as well they all look quite similar in
their look and feel but they actually
very very different the reason for
consistency is to be able to shorten the
learning curve for a given user you know
when they come in on a user 1 user was
to log in to all three they know where
the logout button is they know where the
login button is they know how to
navigate around the screen or a speaker
on the actual different content that's
actually showing itself a little demo
video for you here hold on let me just
do that stylus oh sorry
No
please credit there you go
go right start on it so this is what am
i doing see the orders down the bottom
you can see the prices at itself you
know what the RHIB means you know where
the blue means already that top it was
probably the most interesting part where
we've got a custom GUI custom widget for
each for each currency pair there we've
got a what looks like a table down the
bottom but it's actually just a nested
vertical box with a whole lot of
horizontal boxes inside of them the
reason for that is because we wanted it
to be fixed so there's no need to have a
table with this as our mathematical
screen once again another custom widget
once again and another vertical box with
a with horizontal boxes inside the
reason for doing that is so you can
actually stylize the actual the actual
table row itself it makes it a little
bit difficult if you're using a table we
want pop-ups here and these were all
clear from ourselves it's custom widget
and also down the bottom we've got the
little spinners they had to be all
custom as well because what what we've
got is we've got shorthand for for our
users so if they want to type in 1 1
million they would just type in 1 in and
will automatically recognize that means
1 million so it makes it very fast very
usable for the actual use for the user
for themselves so there was something
that we had to custom build whoo
so branding this is one of the branded
skins that we give then we have for one
of our clients the reason for this is
why labeling is labeling is very very
important for our for our clients the
ability to take what our our skin and
change the color palette as as you saw
before in the CSS completely change it
given their own brand change the icons
change of colors as you can see apart
from the actual layer itself it looks
like a completely different GUI and you
wouldn't even unknown and as if you had
seen there the original slide on the
original picture that it was it always
out giving ourselves so that is very
important for our clients to be able to
brand it in their own livery brand it
with their own colors and then give it
out to their clients and we allow that
via CSS overrides so we've got
configuration from within the GUI itself
to be able to load in the the default
the default CSS and they be able to
overlay that the override CSS so very
very quickly can you create a look and
feel in days not months that is the most
important thing this is literally just
changing the color palette on the root
node so it's really really fast so and
just start this off here so this is
another one of our goodies we've got the
prices at the top of the foreign
exchange we've got the we've got the
orders down the bottom all these prices
are coming in in real time along with
the orders itself once you in the same
colors are used to provide that
consistency we're using a stack pain
there to to switch out the panel when
someone clicks the button to give them
the user feedback there they have
actually pushed it because the worst
thing is if you want to buy 1 million
you don't want to accidentally bite
Emily because you actually accidentally
pushed it 10 times so this is a feedback
what this is going to show you also is
that when we switch up we're going to
show the themes switching over or
dynamically by themselves there's all
done in the code it is something that is
very important for them because I mean
you can obviously do light and gray as
well
light colors sometimes people don't like
dark colors for example they want light
colors you do the same thing but it's
all done this is an unedited video
there's no push production or whatsoever
on this but you can see that the colors
are raw in their own so packaging we've
written all this great code what do we
do with it how do we get it out to our
customers if you've got a few tools
you've got Web Start you've got Java
graphics packaging you've got App Store
how many of you have used web site to
deploy ads cool right so web site
obviously gives you the ability to do
things like auto update being able to
pull down new versions when you when
you've got a new version up on the
server that's great and order up that's
an massively important feature but one
thing that it doesn't give you is the
fact that you have to install Java
firsthand before you even start the
application to download your jnlp the
user experience does not start from the
time that the log on the logon screen
shows up where you put a username
password the user experience starts when
they download your application from
whatever means and then install it so
Java reflects packaging why don't we use
that there's kind of like a flip side to
web start itself it doesn't require Java
to be installed so it free packages the
Java version strip into the package
where you can just natively install your
application so it behaves like an exe if
you're on Windows or DMZ if you're on
Mac but it doesn't give you things that
auto-update the the one thing that we
want for webs that it's not in there
Jeffrey fixed our App Store seems to
give us both
you get the beginner water update we get
the the single install but for us being
in our industry and finance it doesn't
really work for us because we've got
client specific configuration just for
that particular client so we can't just
take our GUI
and put it up onto the Apple App Store
and let everyone download it because
that would be you know only client
specific well our one specific also
being in finance these compliance issues
and all that stuff and you know
corporate firewalls and and whatnot and
generally people just don't have public
app stores so what do we use we use a
tool called install forge a to show if
you guys have heard of it but it gives
us all of those it's a one-time install
for the users you can download it it's a
dmg if it's on Mac or EC or Windows
downloads it and every time you start it
up you can get it to actually pull the
server for a new version so that's
perfect that's exactly what we want
so that is basically our usage of JavaFX
it's a it's a it's the new tool it's the
tool of the new world these days are
fewer if you think about using a new GUI
you should use you should use Java
graphics instead sorry about swing
that's that's the old stuff move on to
the new it's a great tool to use you
gain much higher teen utilization
because of it you can have your you can
have your designers and developers work
together in unison to ensure that you
have the the fastest output it's more
designer friendly and it's definitely
sellers tool of choice any questions
here in the fun in the interface that
you displayed yep how did you break
apart your individual fxfl sort of views
still look like you know you could have
had perhaps a master with a bunch of
includes for the different views that
you were showing kept to the stock and
what I'm wondering if you just talk
about your approach to sort of modular
modular rising depth views yeah so the
question is how did we actually lay out
our screens they're quite complex and
how do we miss them in a feed from so in
a fix
that's is there clear what we did we
created a little widget so if I was to
switch back quickly to say this one each
one of these squares with the buy and
sell buttons is own widget itself it is
one particular a fixed amount so when we
load it up this is actually at all pain
we just add the whole node the fix and
the the JavaFX node into the tile pain
and it adds it straight away so you
obviously have to read it from disk and
all that stuff and it's not really great
but I mean it's not much of an issue for
us and maybe maybe an issue of you if
you're doing that constantly with all
your you know for example if we would do
the tables were down the bottom you
couldn't do that every single order
coming in because there maybe like 10
per second or you know whatever it is
that's how we kind of let up the sound
see your question yeah yeah go yes why
cut it up this using sweet previously or
was this is Brenda now yes no sorry so
we came from a swing background sorry I
forgot to cover it so when we first
started with Java effects actually we
coated it in a very swing like manner so
we actually put author code into our
view to let us and all that and you know
we got the same user experience as a
developer that we got with swing look at
diaper effect so a while you know we
should maybe try it out try it on a
couple screens see what it's like and
you know we instantly recognized that
there are massive gains to be to be
ahead by using a fix ml straightaway so
that's what we started doing and we
actually move we moved and ported over
all of our pre-existing code that we
that we put in to do the layouts and CSS
styling into a fixed amount and it's
made it so much better
well too difficult because what you see
here is pretty much our application we
don't have listings of screens or
anything we have a few pop-ups that sort
of thing but you know it was fairly
fairly easy it's probably a few days
yeah sorry yes have you got a lot source
calls per day
silver sconce data so what we've
actually got is a cell is just not the
GUI but it's all there's also the silver
portion as well and what we've got
essentially a an asynchronous protocol
that we've developed ourselves to
actually make the cause so when when
someone pushes a button for example to
click on by their order creates an event
into the event bus Bob gets all the way
to the back of the GUI itself and then
we make a nation cannot scroll out and
that's it and then it just returns
straight away so there's no synchronous
calling it in that sense so you got will
built our own family s well not only do
we send information to the survey
asynchronously we also receive
information from the server
asynchronously as well so it brings our
whole protocol based around Google
protobufs and nitty to help us do that
so we rely on RPC frameworks or or
whatnot this we not a not enjoy prefix
we do have iPad apps and we also have
web apps as well so most of our
front-facing user related type gooeys we
all build in Java effects because we
wanted consistency across the board you
know even though you've got something
that looks like this and Java effects
you move to the web platform you've got
a browser window automatically it was a
slightly different feel already you've
got back buttons you've got forward
buttons all that you've got refresh that
sort of stuff so we do have those other
Geary's and they all speak our our
standard protocol that we've gotten back
and as we just described but it is
something that Java is actually really
provides and yeah we'll be looking into
that near future yep
the Christian ones that were using any
swing at all
not everything Java affects our internal
testing tools are all built in Java
effects or obviously all our gears are
there's actually no point because swing
is very it's very similar to Java defect
or vice versa and in that sense you get
a lot you get all the niceties about
yeah things like a fix ml you know CSS
and all that but you can still build it
in a swing like manner so for example
the tables what we do is we create and
we create what is what we call the table
row and it's just really a wrapper
around the underlying data itself but
its primary purpose is to extract the
information from the underlying data and
display that up on to the GUI and stuff
so there's really no need I I don't see
any point and actually moving back yep
so yeah they're not as fully featured is
something like that because you've also
got so I can't quite remember the the
swing library and there's another one
that was built by one of the Google guys
and swing but yeah that definitely not
is fully featured we you can have
filters and channels and all that stuff
being able to pipe things into from one
pipeline into another so they're
definitely nothing like that but we
don't necessarily need that type of
feature per se we do want filtering and
it's all kind of just done manually at
the moment unfortunately but yeah we'll
be pulling that out as we go okay
yes we do know we don't know you don't
unfortunately there's no kind of
cross-pollination in that sense our
gooeys provide a different level of
functionality so our web GUI is a lot
more simple than this so there's not a
lot of functionality that we can
actually pour to such I mean I'm sure
there's little bits and pieces but we
try and just keep that separate we we
like to keep things as modulized as
possible as with the protocol that we're
speaking it's it's language agnostic if
you want to do you can put a dot name
fronting on if you really wanted to the
wolf's chosen to a prefix obviously so
if in terms of a web what we do is we
just take the HTTP calls convert into
our protobufs and it's in the online the
great thing about that is being able to
actually have a single interface into
our server not having to account for web
time to account for this or that it's
all kind of taken care for you as long
as you adhere to that protocol text XML
into one
you want to design
like dragon inside container yeah yeah
so you can you can use imports within
seam border itself and actually pull
your different exit effects and males
together and to create a behemoth of a
of your widget so for example this disk
top this disk top is just a shell really
and then we've got if XML bits and
pieces that we just kind of add in
together so for example that
notification screen there's any fixing
out the orders table
that's another if X in our we've got
each one of these widgets there's
another one you can you can see how this
goes on and on each of XML has their own
presenter not necessarily their own
controller the point about the presenter
is being able to drive the view in that
particular view only if you've got
multiple views for example here we've
got one seemingly repeated groups of
your fixed mail tables for each widget
price which are there each one of those
have ever presented themselves but
behind that because it seems they're
ridiculous to have multiple air
controllers which isn't one that
controller that sits behind all the
vendors delegates the the work from one
presenter to the next yep
so because we started with Java graphics
very very early all of our automated
testing is actually done via a headless
client using via Bennett bean
abstraction because those types of tools
didn't exist when we first started about
two years ago when it first came out so
the the experience is very low in that
sense and we're actually using test test
effects instead for to stay fixed yes
yeah it's okay it's okay I mean is it
something that we've kind of just newly
come into it's not something that will
kind of explore the boundaries of test
effects we've done on a few screens and
the lace and we're going to start and
deport over some of our automated since
it were actually got already itself
good awesome thanks a lot guys hope you
have a good lunch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
