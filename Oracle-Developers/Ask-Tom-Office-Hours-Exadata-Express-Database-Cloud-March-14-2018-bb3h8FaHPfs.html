number two of p.m. office hours for
Exadata Express and schema service my
name is Todd Barker and I am a product
manager in the development team here at
Oracle I bring you greetings from Oracle
headquarters in sunny Redwood Shores
California or maybe not so sunny it's
been raining a little bit here recently
but welcome we're glad to have you
aboard so everyone can see my screen
everyone can hear me I think we're ready
to go quick agenda for today's office
hours I'm going to do a couple of quick
housekeeping items want to do inform you
of some upcoming events these sessions
are not only an opportunity for you to
ask us questions but also for he us here
at Oracle to ask you questions and get
live direct feedback from folks who are
using our cloud services so I do have
one live pull a brief live poll I want
to do I think that'll be pretty quick
and then as we did last time we'll have
a very short structured presentation 10
maybe 15 minutes we're going to demo
something this time that is really
exciting and we have a special guest
from our engineering team here Vlad over
off who has joined us we'll be doing
this demo this is something coming up
soon for apex applications running on
Exadata Express where it's a way that
you can run them on your own domain name
and using your own SSL certificate we
call that a vanity URL so Vlad's gonna
show you what's coming up in that regard
and give you a taste for how to
configure it and use it and then we'll
have plenty of time for Question and
Answer we welcome any questions that you
may have we'll do our best to answer if
we don't know the answer we'll we'll do
our best to point you to another p.m.
office our session where where you could
talk directly to the relevant p.m. but
we're generally pretty good about
answering stuff so we'll we'll have
plenty of time for that all right just
in terms of housekeeping items
they're recording for our last session
has now been posted on oracle deb jim
under ask tom this is the link for it
it's it's also if you go to the page for
this office hours and scroll to the
bottom you'll see a direct link to the
last recording and i believe all the
recordings will just show up there
automatically so keep going to that page
that's the the main page for this
particular series and i think it came
out to about 45 minutes long we had some
good questions last time so some useful
information in that last session also we
have a welcome tour video series on
youtube and i wanted to point that out
well i'll probably point this out pretty
much every time because this is a great
way to jumpstart your experience with
exited Express in particular just go
watch the YouTube video series in a
little less than a hat each video is
less than five minutes long and in a
little less than a half an hour total
you will be an expert with what exadata
Express can provide and the various
things you can do with exit Express so
if you haven't already go take a look at
our welcome to our video series follow
me on Twitter there's a Twitter and I've
been posting to it frequently the last
couple days so a good place for news and
and insights and another good place to
ask questions and sign up for a free
trial Oracle cloud offers us $300
promotional credits free credits that
you can use for any number of our paths
and I asks services including Exadata
Express so go take a look at that sign
up and it's a great way to get your very
own instance and get your hands on it
directly in terms of events we have some
exciting stuff coming up the next few
months of course apex World in the
Netherlands towards the end of this
month our CTO and a chairman of the
board mr. Larry Ellison will be doing a
special event two weeks from yesterday
on March 27th at 12:30 originating from
the Oracle conference center in Redwood
Shores
I think that'll be a really interesting
event he'll be talking all about
autonomous database our new autonomous
data warehouse cloud service that you
may have heard a bit about and so I
think that'll be a great event go take a
look you can get more detail the start
time I hear may bounce around a little
bit I think it's going to be 12:30
Pacific but go take a look at events dot
oracle.com and you can you can get more
information on that so work that in your
calendars I think that'll be a good one
and then of course Kay scope coming up
in June in Orlando so come join us for
Kay scope all right
wanted to do a couple quick live polls
and this this is where you know we get
information from you I floated this at
our last session a little bit but I want
to get some direct feedback on what you
want to get out of this series you know
what would be the most useful to you in
terms of the structure and also the
content and I think rather than doing
zoom live poll here I'm gonna just kind
of do this informally the zoom live fool
doesn't actually show up in the
recording it turns out so I just put the
questions in the slide and I'll have you
kind of shout out you can just say over
audio or mention it over chat if there
is a you know preferred things that you
would like to see out of this series you
know we could do structured p.m.
presentation and demo it's kind of like
we'll be doing some of that today we
could have other guest speakers I've got
a whole group of luminaries in mind that
I would love to have join and present
and participate in some discussion in
this series we could just have
unstructured Q&amp;amp;A time oh you know very
open to just having Q&amp;amp;A time and we
could have time for discussion amongst
yourselves
you know discussion with others on the
call so if you have any preferences in
that regard feel free to shout it out or
say it over chat I've got my chat window
open we'll give you a second to process
that so
for be okay anyone else want to chime in
on that topic okay all right so the next
question is what kind of drill down
topics are of most interest to you to
try and move this window out of the way
there's all kinds of things we could
talk about I get a lot of questions
about pricing and packaging a lot of
questions about comparing schema service
and Exadata Express to two other
services provided by Oracle and two
services provided by competitors you
know we could do comparisons and drill
downs a lot of roadmap questions what do
we have coming up what's coming in the
future customers about questions about
customers how our customer is using this
customer use cases customer references a
whole bunch of development topics trying
to move this window out of the way we
could talk about doing Apex development
on these services sequel and PL sequel
development rest Java nodejs
you know what we're showing the tax day
Express today we're a works great with
nodejs the new node oracle DB driver
version 2 just came out dotnet Python
all kinds of interesting development
things we could drill down on so feel
free to express any preferences in this
regard see if we get any votes I'm going
to pull my chat window back up D and
best practices and target use cases good
okay anyone else okay duly noted thank
you for that feedback all right so now
I've got one more comment here and pull
the chat window back up Oh is in general
less discussed developments sequel and
PL sequel okay
that's good feedback thank you I think
it's yudice thank you for that feedback
we will certainly take that into account
all right so I'm gonna move on now thank
you for your feedback and we're gonna
bridge right into a demo and I'll
introduce blodd Vlad can you give me a
shout out let's make sure your audio is
working hello we hear you great okay
terrific so Vlad is a development
manager here in the Oracle database
engineering team and very involved with
both schema service and exadata Express
he's been working on a really exciting
enhancement we have coming up where you
can you can now take Apex apps running
on exadata Express and run them on your
own domain name and SSL certificate and
kind of create your own vanity URL to
promote a little bit you know promote
yourself a little bit in these apex apps
the same is also true for rest for the
rest interface or interfaces to the
Oracle database those can be over a
domain name and SSL certificate of your
choosing now so I think this is a pretty
cool stuff with that I'm gonna unshare
and turn the time over to Vlad ok flood
take it away excellent we can see your
screen we're good all right
so I'm going to talk about a new feature
that we're working on for exit Express
the features Todd mentioned is the
adding support for vanity URLs or vanity
domain names for hosting your apex apps
and rest services in exit Express so
what is a vanity URL so let's take a
look at an example we start at the exit
Express service console should be
familiar to our existing customers it
helps to control various aspects of the
service and also provides jump links
into your dedicated apex development
environment here I can click a button
this one and I will go into apex
application builder for my exadata
Express instance running Oracle database
12 to 12 release 2 so you may notice
that here in this development
environment my URL that my customers
would see and also my developers would
see look something like this this is not
particular particularly pretty in
production this URL would have Oracle
cloud apps addcom domain name something
like that so it would be better if we
are building our apex applications from
the service since Ted used maybe our own
company domain name for our APIs
applications for example before our
building fxapps maybe an our company
website is WWE ample comm maybe we would
like to use apex example.com for our
apex apps hosted in exit Express or if
we're building rest services maybe we
would like to use API guide example.com
to host those fresh services in exit
Express so how can we do that with exit
Express last year
Oracle launched a new cloud
infrastructure service called allured
balancing cloud service this is
affordable managed software based Lord
balancer is it's fully featured it is
easy to configure using only your
browser so what we can do
we can provision an instance of the load
balancer cloud service in front of exit
Express and this will provide the
support for venti or elles so to better
understand how exactly this would work
let's take a look at the architecture
diagram here's the active architecture
diagram of the solution and for now
let's focus on the right parts of it and
use looking at the blue lines here we
have our exit Express instance under
Oracle cloud ABS com domain name using
this or Oracle cloud apps that call
domain name we can access the service
console this is the one that I just show
you in a minute ago and also this is the
one that we use to run our apex apps and
rest services this is how we connect to
our a kid Express cloud database so what
we can do we can configure an instance
of the load balancing cloud service here
we can define a DNS record in this case
it is my company that example.com that
will point to this load balancer cloud
service and this will create an
alternate path into our exit Express
database so we will be able to access
our exit Express environment using the
original Oracle cloud apps com domain
name we're also using my company that
example.com as well so a couple things
to note about this we of course need to
be in control of our desired domain name
so in this example we need to go to our
preferred DNS provider and create a DNS
record for my company dot example.com
and there's business record we'll points
to our load balancing instance almost
also you will notice that only secure
HTTP access is allowed which means that
we need to obtain a public as a sole
certificate for our desired domain name
we need to go a certificate authority
and purchase or may
you get a free as a social difficut to
make sure that the traffic is encrypted
between Internet clients and our log
balancer service and of course the
connections between load balancer and
x8a Express also will be encrypted so as
a result of this configuration as I said
we will be able to access our exit
Express environment from both the vanity
URL and also the original URL so now
let's take a look at the steps required
to configure our load balancer instance
and we start at the compute console and
the first thing we need to do in the
computer console is to upload our as a
social certificates I already have the
configuration set up so I will just show
you what I've done in the past before
this demo I'm going to the digital
certificates page and the first
certificate that I need to upload is the
server certificate this is a certificate
that I purchased from a certificate
authority for my desired domain name I
use the interface to upload the private
key and also their certificate and the
required certificate chain to the load
balancer environment the second
certificate the dainichi upload is
called the trusted certificate this will
be responsible for encryption traffic
between the log balancer instance and
actually Express this is the public
certificate for the default actually
Express the URL I simply use my browser
to download it and then upload it here
once the certificates are uploaded I'm
going to the load balancer page we have
a few of them defined and this is the
one that I'm going to use once you
create a load balancer instance it will
come with the generated canonical
hostname which looks something like this
I will need to go to my DNS provider and
configure my desired a vanity domain
name to point to this canonical host
name I already done that before this
demo
once the instance is created and we'll
need to define a policy the bolts that
they're willing to define is they
trusted certificate policy this will be
responsible for encryption traffic
between mylord balancer and exit Express
and in the this field I selected the
trusted certificate the digestive fluid
previously after that I will go to the
server pools page and define a server
pool server pool will determine howl or
balancer will treat the traffic that
comes to it and in our case load
balancer will need to wrote the network
traffic to our original exadata Express
instance so here I will provide my
original actually express your L and
port number and finally to tie all this
together I will define a listener so
listener will determine or will dictate
that all incoming traffic from the
Internet
on the HTTP port will be routed securely
to our accredit Express rapoo I also
specified my SSL certificate from my
vanity domain name I specified my
trusted certificate policy to make sure
traffic is encrypted all the way through
and finally in this virtual host field I
entered my desired banty URL or vanity
domain name this is the one that I will
use with activate Express lured balancer
service supports multiple virtual hosts
in this case I'm only interested in one
so this completes the configuration for
the Lord balancer instance so now what
we need to do we need to go back to exit
Express service console and telex it
Express that we would like to use this
vanity URL
back in exit Express service console we
go to the manage page and in the manage
page we have already configured actually
the new item called vanity URL this is a
simple dialog the first thing is they
need to do is of course to type in my
dessert rented euro or vanity domain
name that I just configured in the Lord
balancer the second option that I
decided to do is to specify the default
landing page so then when users type the
vanity URL in their browsers what should
be the default page that will open in
this case I have apex application 100
and I want this to be my default
application and finally we have another
option here where we can decide to
disable access to our apex environment
and rest services using the old original
Oracle cloud Abscam you are L so this
will make sure that access to our x8
Express environment must go through the
vanity URL and through a Lourdes
balancer service only and this is good
because now I can use additional
features in the load balancer service to
further refine what we do how we control
access to our environment for example I
can define an IP whitelist policy in the
load balancer to maybe say that only
users from our office can access this
exit Express environment now I will not
select this feature so once I configured
these parameters I will save this planet
to URL and I'm done so now if I open a
new browser tab and type my vanity URL
in there we can see that my application
100 automatically opens we are using my
desired vanity domain name vampiro right
here and also you notice that the
connection is fully encrypted using my
personal
SSL certificate additionally I can
change the URL slightly to open
application Express builder and we are
here back in apex builder using our
event at the euro and this is of course
the same exit Express environment
running Oracle Database 12c release 2
you will notice though that I didn't
have to login to Apex builder this is
because even though we are using vanity
URL our exit Express instance is still
fully integrated with the cloud identity
management solution so we're using the
existing accounts in single sign-on even
though we are using the vanity URL so
that really concludes my demo in the
future to sound somewhat to summarize in
the future actually Express users will
be able to access their apex apps and
rest services using custom domain name
or what we call vanity URL this
configuration will be possible using the
log balancer infrastructure service from
Oracle and a few settings and exit
Express service console as usual we
cannot give specific timeline for
introduction of this feature all we can
say is until the coming in the next 12
months and thanks very much flood and so
if you could unsure you go back to the
prepared content here a second cheer
stream okay
we're back so that's a great demo thanks
flood let's have a few minutes for
Question and Answer just on this topic
and maybe I'll kick this off mark I
think you have a couple questions
perhaps - Vlad one question for you so
this is great
right the the configuration on the
exudate express side is very simple it's
one dialogue basically the configuration
on the oracle load balancer or side is
you know pretty straightforward and it
gives you a ton of new capability not
only the ability to use your own domain
name and your own certificate but also
the IP whitelisting you know a lot of
good stuff in in this exid Express Plus
load balance or pattern that you've
described here and we're working on this
you know and hoping to Roop to have that
available soon but what if what if for
whatever reason you know I really don't
want to use load balancers to service I
want something like this but for
whatever reason I don't want to have to
have a load balancer as a service
instance on you know on Oracle cloud
classic are there are there ways that a
customer could apply this pattern using
other kind of similar technologies yeah
that's a good question
it will be possible for customers to use
a different solution for what we call
the reverse proxy into the exit Express
environment we're at now focus on
specifically load balancer service
because it is affordable which is fully
managed by Oracle and it is also
possible to collocate that together with
your exit Express environment so it's
available in the same data centers so in
the future we might document additional
alternative solutions but I think the
proposed load balancer configuration
it's probably very good option yep got
it
and that's I think that's an important
point to additional benefit is the
colocation in the same data center
as well whereas if you stood up a cloud
VM and we're installing your own reverse
proxy solution you have to worry about
that yourself
as well in addition to a bunch of other
things so it probably it'll it'll be
possible and that's something we'll
probably want to describe but the
slickest most usable easiest to stand up
solution will be around Oracle's load
balancing service is that safe to say
that's exactly right yes okay all right
so let's pause right there then and
that's pretty much it for the structured
content and demo and so forth and live
polls for today I'm gonna just kind of
throw it open to questions and make sure
I have my chat chat window open or chat
feel free to shout out any questions or
observations / audio or / chat what do
you think any questions for us and by
the way you've got not only the PM but
you've got one of our illustrious
development managers on the line with us
to is so this is a great opportunity for
questions let us know what you think and
if there's anything we can elaborate on
Marc is that something you think you'll
use love to have my own URL for for my
application so looking forward to using
that I'm just trying to think like an
apex we have the ability to publish your
data out as as fast eight the ice would
that work the same way it's not like if
I wanted to make a rest call to to my VP
I said I publish mr. west workshop but I
go to my vanity URL or when I go to the
ocean coffee overdose work they both
work out of the box yeah so that's the
benefit the vanity URL is supported for
both apex applications and also the rest
services whether it's a books based rest
services
or the Oracle res data services there
would be no confusion with like their
certificates coming from one of the
other no it when you access your vanity
URL we will use the you are personal as
a sole certificate that you configured
in the load balancer service if you
decide to use the original Oracle cloud
apps com URL then Oracle's shared
certificate will be used there should be
no confusion no browser warnings
everything should be fine let me let me
elaborate on that a little bit for the
benefit of others others for on the call
so along with XE Express in addition to
the Oracle database Enterprise Edition
plus options and in addition to the
pre-configured application Express or
Apex
you also get a rest data access cluster
that's providing access to your cloud
database over rest it's very easy to
stand up rest endpoints that that allow
folks to drill into your data in
authenticate before you do that so marks
asking for the rest endpoints is does
the similar there's the solution similar
you know does it leverage the same load
balancer same domain name same SSL
certificate and the answer is yes right
if you set this up using Oracle load
balancing service classic you get it not
only for Apex Apps but also for the rest
endpoints is that I get that right glad
yeah okay great so good question kind of
watching the chat here any other
questions
let's see you Judas let's see who else
do you Tim anything we can help you with
all right great well a little we have a
quiet bunch today but that's that's all
right no no worries
and if there are no further questions I
guess we'll wrap it up a little bit
early today this has been recorded and
will be posted so others can go take a
look I'm gonna just close it off I do
have to show one thing I forgot with
these office hours sessions we do talk
roadmap we do talk about forthcoming
things that are not released yet so I
have to show the safe harbor statement
yeah but this is a good opportunity for
us actually to talk roadmap so um think
about it if you like what you saw today
come back with questions next time and
we look for oh wait a minute we have a
question coming through on chat hold on
a sec hey my name is Saravanan I I just
want to know what this you exactly do it
because I saw this I just want to
understand because do can I have any
query can I ask you in the this chair in
this flow during this program or what
exactly is this sorry to ask you this
you understand great yeah we have
welcome aboard one of our new or new
attendees here welcome yeah so this is a
forum where you get direct access to the
product manager and development manager
in this case we have we have a guest
with us today and you can ask questions
about our cloud services including
schema service and Exadata Express if
you have questions about other services
from Oracle cloud I can direct you to
other p.m. office hours from other PMS
here at Oracle that are covering other
topics too so this is something new that
we're doing and it gives you direct
access to us whatever you want if you
have any questions let us know what's on
your mind
well nothing just I just want to
understand because we also like to we
are also looking abelian database cloud
services so I thought okay let me change
that's it so right now I don't have any
queries but I just wanted to know what
exactly you do it thanks for your
information and if you join late this
session it was recorded we did a demo of
configuring vanity URLs in front of
applications running on this service so
the recording will be posted within the
next week you can come back and take a
look at it and please join us next time
we do it every month around this time
the start times and exact dates are
posted on that dev Jim page so just keep
an eye on that or keep an eye on my
tweet and yeah
please join us we're wide open to new
folks participating thank you too much
okay thanks so with that I'm gonna close
it off thanks very much and we'll see
you next month bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
