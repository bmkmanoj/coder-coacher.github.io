most people call me JB I'm a product
manager at Oracle and I primarily focus
on Oracle tools and frameworks that
we've done over the years the JavaScript
frameworks is my specialty at the moment
I've been working with JavaScript since
the late 90s and actually started out
with a thing called active server pages
in the Microsoft world Microsoft ASP and
doing vbscript and javascript in that
world I work for a little startup called
Chile soft and we did Chile soft ASP
that ran after server pages in
non-microsoft web servers and operating
systems so eventually worked our way up
actually it's pretty much sat at the
same desk ever since those days in the
late 90s all the way up to where we are
today 20-some odd years just companies
being bought won over after the other so
today we're going to talk
oh I forgot safe harbor so anything I
say today don't go buy stock based on it
please it's not worth anything
not the stock my conversation in regards
to the stock so today we're going to
talk about enterprise software and what
is and we're going to talk specifically
about client-side JavaScript in the
enterprise workspace today and how does
that actually fit but the question that
comes up when you first start to look at
that is what does enterprise software
even mean in this day and age you know
historically you looked at enterprise
applications and they were these really
extreme scales or you know heavy loads
those types of things if you look at
Wikipedia of course it says the
enterprise software is software that
targets groups or corporations and
meeting those needs instead of an
individual which I guess is more
consumer software and sort of enterprise
software but like I said it also I think
in to some degree hits both of these
with the extreme loads and and being
able to actually scale your software up
to a certain degree when I started kind
of researching to find out what other
people thought these definitions were of
course there's always one cynical
response and I thought this one was
rather interesting basically says it's
complicated enough that we
going to start building consulting
services around it so I hope that's not
what we build when we start building out
enterprise software but some of us I
guess it might might be a good thing the
one thing that is true in this day and
age is that the client and the server
relationships are changing and that's
really what's forcing a lot of changes
in what it is we do with JavaScript on
the client or on the server you know
historically we had the data centers and
the large server farms and so forth and
we we looked at things such as requests
per second and and load you know load
balancing at the at the web tier versus
the data tier versus your application
tier and so forth and and really all
that focus was on trying to scale and
get performant at the data center side
and while that's still there to some
degree the relationship between what the
client can do and what the server does
is really what's what's starting to
change so from the servers that we used
to use we really targeted just desktops
and if you're really lucky you had
something fancy like this but in the
reality you're still just looking at the
monitor you just had a ton of data that
you had to deal with in multiple
monitors but the world today is more
distributed and now we're dealing with
tablets and phones as well as the
desktops and in some cases even watches
and the data can actually run just as
much on these client devices as it does
back on the server so now we start to
look at that relationship of not only
scaling your JavaScript or scaling your
server-side JavaScript which is quite a
few of the sessions today I've talked
about you know scaling up node and
things of that nature but what we're
going to talk about today is more about
scaling up that client-side and
understanding some of the best practices
that we found over the last couple of
years of working with JavaScript for
client-side frameworks themselves so I'm
going to go over a few different tips
and building blocks if you will as we
start to look at building out enterprise
applications and again when we look at
the JavaScript space one of the biggest
things to start with is resist the hype
it's also called don't chase the shiny
object there's always something new
coming out in the JavaScript world I
mean it seems like every week there
some new library or some new thing or
you know some new capability that's
coming around and I got it my app could
do that it would be so cool and and we
all go off and chase it and see what it
is but the reality is there are some
apps that do what they do the way that
they do it for a very good reason and we
probably shouldn't change it air traffic
controllers the day we start landing
planes from phones unrest interfaces
with the server on the backend and the
client on the front end I'm taking the
train I'm sorry that's it's done right
so there are times when you just don't
need to chase that shiny object you need
to stay with those applications they're
there for a reason my buddy that I work
with that does this talk and a few
others over in the European side he's
actually been invited into some air
traffic control towers and these guys
these are dedicated systems to the point
that the engineers that write this
software are actually just sitting a
floor below them they're actually in the
same tower it's customized specifically
for the needs of those areas and they
integrate it so it's a closed network
it's all behind a firewall there's
absolutely no need for this type of a
scenario to go into a client-server
relationship like we're talking about
today and moving to the browser as been
using the browser as a platform even
though they are getting pressured to
change these new artists from some of
their managers and so forth but even
though you wouldn't want to change this
there are things that we want to take a
look at such as maybe extending instead
of replacing so maybe these are those
scenarios where the core business the
core feature of that of that application
stays where it is but all of these new
things that are coming out around it
maybe there's ways to extend that so in
the case of an air traffic controller
for instance maybe the management piece
doesn't need to be so dedicated maybe we
can move those management pieces in the
you know the charts and the graphs and
the reports and things like that over
into a browser platform and keep the
data back on the database or maybe if
there's certain alerts that need to go
out depending on on certain traffic air
traffic or something like that that
needs to go out obviously not critical
alerts
is alert notices on phones aren't
real-time but but we could look at
things that way so look outside that
common I'd say let's look outside the
box but it's such a cliche term these
days but it really is that you're just
looking outside of your normal comfort
zone instead of changing the app look to
actually extend it in certain ways
second tip rediscover HTML so HTML you
know historically when it came out years
ago in HTML 4 which lasted for almost 10
12 years it was it was really put
together just to describe scientific
documents and it served its purpose
really well for what it was doing but we
started seeing all these plethora of
plugins you know the flash plugins and
audio plugins real real audio and all
these other kinds of things that we did
well html5 when it was finally when the
spec was finally released three years
ago it actually was designed to remove
this burden of plugins and give HTML the
power to build applications and run
applications itself and they added in
the multimedia capabilities and
animations and things of that nature we
also have built in a lot of application
features into the spec and we're just
now starting to see browsers pick up on
those and different capabilities that
were in the specification and implement
those specific capabilities the other
thing is they added in a lot of
semantics into html5 so you've got
sections and you've got asides and a few
different other types of semantic areas
that really help you in writing your
software in an accessible way so writing
software that meets people with
disabilities and in this day and age
that's becoming more and more critical
not only just from a legal standpoint
which we now have over 27 countries and
associations across the world that now
require your software to be to meet
certain accessibility guidelines but
it's also just kind of the right thing
to do I mean why would you write
software they can't
used by all of the audience that's out
there if it's an easy thing to do I mean
obviously you know when you're writing
software that's fully accessible and you
say software for all you didn't you
don't mean a two-year-old
but you should be able to take into
account blind or deaf or those types of
scenarios and and color blindness and so
forth within your code it's a fairly
easy thing to do
and it starts with looking at the HTML
so let's take a really quick look at
what I talked and what I'm talking about
when I say the semantic hTML or just the
HTML abilities to do applications so in
this code right here this is just H it's
just straight-up HTML this is an input
with the type of color and below it I've
got a type of date and below that I've
got an input with this new list
capability that was a new attribute in
html5 now all of these actually are just
they're just straight-up HTML there's
nothing behind them and if I run this
you're going to see that this happens to
be in Chrome on Windows but it actually
displays a color picker and I can choose
you know whatever color I want to do and
say ok and it changes to the color the
date pickers you can you can actually
adjust individual day month year or you
can click on it actually gives you a
full calendar this is just straight-up
HTML and it's however the browser vendor
has chosen to actually provide this same
thing with a list view that list
attribute that I was talking about has
type-ahead or filtering built into it if
I hit F in this it comes up and chooses
Firefox or Safari and F I will narrow it
all the way down and I can choose it so
there's these capabilities that are
pretty pretty well defined inside of
these browsers today
now while the downside of this of course
is that each vendor is implementing this
at a different speed in a different pace
so what you see here in chrome is going
to look different in Firefox and it's
going to look even way different in
Microsoft edge or something of that
nature so that's the downside of this
but this is where things are going this
is the direction that we're starting to
go and where HTML them
selves and all these really smart brainy
people that are working on the html5
specification are trying to take us you
can even go down to a range component
that has the ability to set validators
on it so in this case i'm you know i'm
staying 85 is my maximum and i move all
the way down and i go to zero and it
steps in steps of 5 and so forth and the
code for that is very very simple in
that all I'm doing is saying it's a type
of range and min max step and I can set
the default value to it the other stuff
the on change is what I'm just using
straight up JavaScript to update the
little span below it when the text to
change on the value of it it's it's
really simple to be able to do this
stuff in HTML you should take another
look at it where this really starts to
get into more of a standard look and
feel and where it really starts to work
is if you're starting to work on hybrid
mobile applications so if you're going
to take HTML and compile it down to
Android or compile it down to iOS you're
going to get a real iOS look and feel
and you're going to get a real Android
look and feel for these types of inputs
and that's consistent across everything
that you run when you're on those
devices which is nice let's go back to
slides real quick
so next take a look at responsive
designs of CSS and JavaScript for that
matter so in almost any application that
you have out there today you just expect
it to be responsive so responsive design
is just an application that shrinks and
changes and adjusts to the viewport the
view size that you're actually looking
at so most of us that are doing
development we're shrinking our browser
down and we watch the thing reformat in
reshape itself there the real design
behind it the real intent behind it was
of course changing devices going from a
desktop monitor down to a tablet or down
to a phone and traditionally CSS was
what allowed us to do this the
introduction of css3 and moving from
just this basic language that described
the look and feel of your document
moving over into more of a system of
managing the look and feel not just kind
of a language that described it and css3
was a huge update to CSS and only say it
actually broke it down into modular
pieces and different capabilities the
most commonly used and most well known
as media queries and that's what allowed
us to do all of this responsive design
and I'll show in a second how just a
really really basic example of this but
the idea was and the concept was that
you would simply set up these media
queries that said when my screen is a
max width of so many pixels run these
classes and if it's over if it's a min
of this many pixels and a maximum of
that then run these classes and the same
things that were on your screen could
actually adjust in shape depending on
where the what the viewport size was of
your document well that works pretty
well and that's what everybody used for
for quite a few years but the big holy
grail of this was as we started to go
down to phones and our bandwidth started
to change now we're starting to look at
things like I have a really big image
where I've got some sort of a chart and
I shrink this down on to a tablet in a
portrait mode or even even smaller let's
go down to a phone and
I decided well I don't want to have all
that big chart and that big image shown
because it's just not going to look
right on a phone so I hide it so I just
take CSS but display:none on it and hide
it but the reality is just hiding it
didn't change the business logic behind
it so I went from this big app down to a
phone and I hid half the stuff that I
was still making rest calls to bring the
data down or I was still making HTML
calls to bring the data down for the
image so on a going from a desktop where
you're probably on a local area network
or something with good bandwidth down to
a 3G phone your 3G phone just ran like
crazy and I ran really really slow
because it was still loading the data in
the background so the Holy Grail was to
get over to JavaScript and be able to do
responsive JavaScript and be able to
actually adjust the backend as well and
that started to show up about two years
ago and now it's actually used in quite
a few different places but the big
differences here are the show and hide
capabilities just simply hide the Dom
but the Dom stays in the Dom tree it's
still there whereas JavaScript allows
you to actually load or unload that Dom
entirely out so you don't even when
you're when you load up a web page on a
phone and you're not going to use
certain segments don't even have it in
the Dom tree don't even try and load it
and it really is great for
high-performance
types of applications now there's two
different libraries that I talk about on
here one is response
Jas was one of the first ones to do this
a little bit after that there was one
that came out from a company called ZURB
and they produce a UI framework called
foundation anybody ever heard of
foundation out there it's actually a
fantastic framework it's really really
nice and they have a thing called
interchange and that allows you to do
all this JavaScript stuff as well
and so now you can you can actually
adjust on the back end in your business
logic you can turn around and adjust
based on viewport sizes you could even
for instance let's say you have a big
table or a big chart
and you're pulling down a fairly large
chunk of json data from a rest enter end
point and that's on your desktop and you
go down to a phone well you're only
displaying maybe you're going from a
table down to a ListView and you're only
displaying a lot smaller amount of
information on that page for that
ListView and then you're going to click
on it and go down to a detail and get
more information there so it's a
different layout and different paradigm
so using responsive JavaScript not only
can you change the Dom side of it but
you could turn around and make a
different rest endpoint call and bring
down a lighter load of JSON from that a
different rest endpoint as well again
higher performance on a lower bandwidth
so let's take a really quick look at an
example of what I'm talking about here
so in the same code a little bit further
down we have the scenario here where
we've got two images and I'm going to go
right back to my Javas for the chair so
in this case I have okay there's my two
images so they're both shown and if I
look at the HTML that's written for
these there's just this div and then
inside of there is two different images
and what I've done is I've set them 200
by 200
this one's called image a and you'll see
in my CSS I've just set this up to say
media query max with 760 67 pixels so if
if anything is smaller than that
then set it display done and anything
else it's going to be the normal display
so that would that will end up hiding it
and you'll notice that if I go back to
my JavaScript or my browser really quick
if I shrink this thing down at some
point it all disappears so they're both
disappearing which is what they're
supposed to do and you'll notice in the
HTML one is just sitting this image a
the other one's actually wrapped with
this particular little thing of knockout
code and it says if medium screen
then render this so in the case of most
media queries it's this size or up
unless you say otherwise so in this
particular case it's medium on up and
where that is defined where that medium
is is actually in my code behind the
scenes of this I'm setting up this
little variable this knockout variable
called medium screen and it's it's a
knockout utility that sets up these
media queries based on my CSS this
happens to be done inside of the Oracle
jet framework and I'll talk about that a
little bit more later in the talk but it
does exactly the same thing it's based
off the media queries you can define
these different sizes and so forth and
you can set up a small a medium a large
and so forth or medium only or small
only and those types of things and then
use those variables throughout your code
both on the client or on the on the view
side and on the view model side so in
this case if I take a look at my HTML
over here really quick so I'm going to
grab I'm going to inspect this one here
so here's this is my Dom tree over here
on this left-hand side and this is in
the Dom I actually have this image a and
image B they're both loaded in the Dom
as they're being shown here and so
that's that's a physical representation
of the actual running Dom versus what's
in my code and if I shrink this down
until they hide and I come back to look
at that Dom you notice image B is
completely gone it's not even in the Dom
anymore but image a is still there so
again this is that example of where it's
just simply hit display:none so CSS is
hiding it but it's still in the Dom it's
still getting loaded if you bought this
up on a phone it would still load all of
that Dom or download all of that down
and put it into your phone now one image
isn't that big of a deal right I mean
these are all miniscule examples that
I'm showing here but let's think about
scale if we're talking about enterprise
applications now you may have entire
segments of your app that's inside of a
div that you decide just to display or
just to say display:none and drop
that out when it shows up on a phone
that maybe a hundred or two hundred
lines of code maybe two or three
different rest calls all that kind of
stuff and just doing display:none is
going to kill you you need to find a
better way of taking that code in and
out so my next tip frameworks versus
libraries so there are so many job
options coming out in the JavaScript
ecosystem like I said at the beginning
they change weekly and not only are
there new things coming out it's
whatever is the cool thing of them all I
mean you know it's like one week there's
one library that does a specific task
and then two months later a new library
comes up that does the exact same task
it just does it in a more cool way you
know and and so everybody just starts to
find all these things that are kind of
chasing along and you need to really
think of if I'm building an enterprise
application my enterprise application
takes six months just to write the base
code of it and six months is actually
pretty quick for an enterprise grade
application you're already outdated and
you haven't even released your product
yet so staying on that bleeding edge
isn't something you can really do very
cleanly in an enterprise space stay on
the leading edge maybe but stepping that
little bit further is going to be
dangerous and so you want to find that
way of staying on that bleeped on that
leading edge without dropping over to
the bleeding edge and there are a couple
of different ways to look at that so as
we talked about there's just libraries
after libraries after libraries
everything's coming up in different ways
and even on the back end when it comes
to maintaining these applications after
the fact these are just you know these
are testing frameworks and project
runners and all these other kinds of
things that are also out there that you
have to think about scaffolding
generators and so forth so one of the
ways to look at this is to say okay if
I'm going to look at individual
libraries and look at all the different
things that are going on out there it
might be a lot easier to break these
down into different purpose
look at the actual purpose of the
library and find the best to breed in
those purpose sections or in those those
capabilities so you look at full
full-blown app frameworks of course
angular just drops to you know pops to
the top of mind backbone view ember all
these different ones that are out there
react of course modular systems you get
requirejs and web packs the the new one
or pretty new one that's out there right
now build systems this was the funny one
I mean we talked about grunt and we
talked about libraries you know coming
and going in favor
well grunt was the big kid on the block
just two and a half three years ago and
it was you know that was where
everything was all the extensions all
the plugins - it had the largest number
of them and then gulp came out and gulp
was oh this is the best thing ever it
does the exact same as grunt but it does
it in a streams format instead of having
to do it the way you do it now and it's
going to be great well that lasted about
a year and then all of a sudden brunch
came out you know and it's like oh come
on you know settle on something so it's
really hard sometimes to find what that
best thing is and sometimes it's better
to find that best thing for your needs
that has a good community around it or
has a good ecosystem around it that you
know you're going to be able to stay on
it for a little while doesn't mean you
don't keep looking at that future thing
you do because there will be a time when
what you're on you need to move off of
especially in the JavaScript world I
mean we're talking the difference
between moving every month versus moving
every year that kind of thing or maybe
every two years so and then on the
testing framework of course we've got
you know protractor Jasmine queue unit
karma is really cool if you want to take
a look at that action I actually do like
karma what it really comes down to is
two different ways of looking at these
setups one is a framework approach
framework is an all-in-one
all-or-nothing type of environment ember
angular these really jump out as
probably the big boys of the block out
their angular of course you know it's
Google and so it's got all the marketing
power behind it as well as it's a good
framework
but it's all it's all what you want to
do it's angular and it's Google's way of
doing it so if you buy into angular you
buy into the angular way of doing things
if you want to write angular code you
have to learn the angular way of doing
things and that's fine I'm not going to
say it's right or wrong in this scenario
but you have to understand you're buying
into that if something new comes along
and it turns out it is something that
you really want to go to you're going to
wait for angular to pick it up or for
Google to put it into angular that's one
of the downsides of the framework so if
you choose a frame where if you've got
to choose something that's really well
maintained and has a good company behind
it such as angular or something of that
nature on the flip side you've got this
library approach so finding atomic
pieces looking at libraries for specific
needs you know find a router library
find a binding layer that you like find
a UI layer that you like maybe even
break down the UI layer into a couple of
smaller types of things and then find if
they all work or not now this has a
little bit more overhead and setting it
up in the initial set up because it's
definitely going to take more time to
find if these things all work together
properly and what versions will work and
so forth but once you have this set up
and you have a set that you like you're
much more well set up or weld in
inline-four picking up those changes
that might be coming along in certain
areas routing for instance Crossroads
was was the routing library for a long
time and so and crossroads was based on
you know the ability to shove things
into a hash system it didn't work with
html5 history well in html5 history API
came out you had to add in extra plugins
to work with crossroads and so a lot of
people say well maybe there's something
better out there and there's became this
new library called Durand all I'm derned
all did beautiful things with routing it
really was very nice and if you had done
things in a proper way or in a way of
not a proper way but in a way of
selecting libraries you could have just
taken out your your routing module and
and dirndl is a new routing module
believe it or not most of your routing
libraries actually come very very
similar configurations and it's not that
big of a deal to push and pull route in
libraries in and out other things may be
more difficult but routing is a good
example and that's actually an
interesting one because angular when
angular went from angular 1 to angular 2
they actually hired the guy that wrote
dirndl to come and implement angular 2
OS outing layer and lasted for months
and they left and went back and started
working on during the whole again so
which brings us over to tip number five
modularity there is absolutely no way in
the world that you can write an
enterprise-grade application without
considering modularity just the just the
fact that you will have more than one
developer working on the same
application forces you to look heavily
at modularity whether it's the view side
of it where you're working on a single
page application and you're now looking
at being able to someone have someon
work at the frame someone work on
multiple pages and have them all load in
in some modular way you can break out
your engineering team and have them work
on different pages without a release
certain sections of the code without
checking code in over the top of
themselves and stepping on each other
just that module if module is a ssin of
the view side will save you a lot of
heartache and headache however on the
server side as well or the business
logic side I should say on the server
side but on the business logic side it
also makes sense if you can build
yourself into modules and someone builds
an authentication module someone builds
a you know a rested data service module
and things of that nature then you can
reuse those pieces throughout your code
in different places and this is an
age-old thing I mean it as far as
modular code and building dll's back in
the Windows days or you know building
jars and in the Java side of things and
so like that mod module module is a ssin
of your code is not new and so but it
has to be done even on the client side
in order to really read
use your code properly and when it's
done properly it's pretty dang amazing
as to how beautiful some things can be I
don't know how many people are aware of
these trends that there are actually a
huge glut of excess cargo containers
around the world no I thought they just
got reused but apparently they have a
shelf life and when they stop being of
quality for being used as cargo
containers they sit in these yards and
stack up and stack up what architects
have now come around and started
building homes out of cargo containers
all of these that you see here actually
out of cargo containers reused cargo
containers pretty amazing stuff and
these are just some of the more
beautiful ones there's definitely some
more utilitarian ones where they're
actually starting to make them you know
in big cities for small rooms and things
like that
but it's really cool what you can do
when you think about things in a modular
way again looking at some of the
libraries out there that will help you
work with modules and this is mainly on
the on the on the business side on your
JavaScript side requirejs is probably
the old man of the block it's been out
there for quite some time it introduces
an architecture called AMD which is an
asynchronous module definition web packs
one of the newer ones it's out there it
does some really beautiful things both
requirejs and web pack have the ability
not only to manage the loading of
modules during runtime but they also
have the ability to package your product
at Build time so taking your JavaScript
and minifying it down or taking multiple
JavaScript files and packaging them
together into a single library and
things of that nature
they both do them really well I'm not
going to cover browserify it basically
does the same thing as web pack but a
little bit different and then echo
script so we always want I said I said
earlier we were talked about being on
that on that leading edge versus the
bleeding edge
well ECMO script is the specification
this is what you're looking at when
you're trying to see what's coming next
and like anything in the world there's
the reference implementation or the spec
that comes out first and then all the
vendors have to
come in over the over time and es2015 or
es6 actually came out in 2015 and it's
just now starting to get really brought
online by vendors and supported by
vendors in the browser space they're
already working on ES 7 so if you mean I
don't know what there is past the
bleeding edge maybe the shark edge I
don't know but that's es 7 out there you
know they don't even have things but
some people are trying to put them into
their apps the one thing that I wanted
to mention about es6 though is es6
introduces a module capability and you
can actually build modules in es6 and
it's a really nice system and allows you
to build things up but the thing you
have to watch out for is the module
loader that came out with es6 as well
called system j/s or some people call it
JSP m for javascript package manager the
Eknath script specification team when
they wrote es6 and decided to publish it
they actually punted on the loading
being asynchronous they couldn't get it
to work properly and they needed to get
the specification out so they punted and
they threw it over the wall and they
actually gave it to the html5
specification team to figure it out so
the modular loaders in es6 today are
synchronous so here is this one of those
things of going back to tip 1 don't go
chasing the shiny object and resist the
hype everybody wants you to go to es6
modules everybody wants you to use es6
es6 module loaders and get all this you
know be out here on this bleeding edge
well the fact is if you've got an
enterprise app that's loading hundreds
if not thousands of different libraries
across hundreds of pages you just
serialized your application and instead
of being able to load all these files
dynamically and lazy loading in the
background in an asynchronous way you
just push everything into a serial
serial loading that's going to hit
that's going to hit you on performance
so these are the things you have to
really kind of watch for as you start to
move to that new latest and greatest
thing there are some great things going
on there but it's not asynchronous and
every rest call you make everything you
do from this client side they're all
asynchronous so why would you make
purposely make your code
synchrony on serialized so requirejs is
fully synchronous webpack is 90 percent
asynchronous there are some things that
it doesn't do it cannot load
asynchronously load resources at runtime
so you need to watch out for that there
are some different libraries that you
can package into it to make it work some
plugins that actually some of the Oracle
teams have written to make it work but
right now requirejs is still the one
that does it all right now so tip number
six abstraction of over JavaScript so
this is something I think a little bit
that Crockford this morning talked about
Douglass talked about in that there are
a lot of different developers out there
that are coming to JavaScript from
something else those of us have been in
JavaScript since the beginning where we
kind of sit there and scratch your head
is going why would you do this but I get
it I just you know I I don't always
understand it but I understand why I
guess these people want this but it
really comes down to what's easiest for
your development team right what makes
your team comfortable when you're trying
to get this large picture of this
enterprise application put together and
in the case of abstractions we have
these different languages that are there
like CoffeeScript and typescript and
things like that and they add strong
typing to a JavaScript language so
developers coming over from Java for
instance are used to typed languages you
know an INT isn't in to string as a
string and things like that where in
JavaScript things just kind of coerce
them as they go through and those of us
that have been doing javascript for like
why would you change that but the Java
guys get freaked out by it and and so
that's why you start to see some of
these different libraries coming in and
they end up compiling down or
transpiling they call it down to actual
JavaScript in the end but the while
you're writing the code it actually has
the ability to be more strongly typed
and then on top of that because you know
the types you can write better tooling
on top of it and you can have Co
it knows this is supposed to be a string
and that's a you know you made it an N
tour that supposed to be a number versus
something else so it supposedly there
are arguments on either side I don't
know intelligently enough which one is
true or not or if either of them are
true there are arguments on both sides
that they say typed languages have fewer
bugs and then there are people that have
arguments out there there's a more
really recent study that came out last
month out of Stanford actually I think
of a Stanford that said that's a bunch
of hooey and they proved it with a bunch
of charts and so now the typed languages
don't necessarily have fewer bugs they
just have different bugs so so pure
script type script CoffeeScript flow is
the new kid on the block those are all
languages across there above
abstractions above JavaScript sass and
less are abstractions above CSS they're
what they call pre-compile and pre
compiler CSS pre compilers they actually
do a little bit more they actually bring
language capabilities to CSS that
doesn't exist by itself so CSS itself is
a cascading style sheet it's just it's
text the e right and the last thing in
wins and and there are certain syntaxes
that you follow sass unless have a
really strange history and all you can
go read up on it on Wikipedia but it's
less or less was created first and in a
certain for no sass was actually created
first in a certain format and then less
came along and built on top of sass to
make it the next best thing and then
sass came and said oh we'll change our C
syntax to F CSS and we'll build off the
top of less and make ourselves even
better and so they've gone back and
forth over the years sass is kind of
winning out things right now but they're
both actually really nice and they do
with the same thing they bring in things
like conditionals so now you can write
CSS with if statements and and loops and
things of that nature and you can do
calculated with math so you can do
calculated variables on color scheme so
you can say put in this color and then
generate these five extra variables as
gradients of that
one color those types of things so
that's what sass and less allow you to
do in CSS preprocessors in the end they
just generate straight-up CSS but they
actually produce more code than what you
actually write and they also allow you
to break things down into modules again
modules again so that when you have this
enterprise-grade application if you were
in one CSS file it could be thousands or
tens of thousands of lines of CSS and
using sass unless you can break it up
into small pieces and n called mix-ins
and you can write your code and then put
it all back together at compile time in
the end it's just trying to find a way
to see the better see the picture more
clearly it's just trying to find a way
of providing a way for people to get to
JavaScript to get to CSS and build the
code in a more clear way so final step
take a look at the corporate frameworks
that are out there Microsoft's been
doing great things in the open-source
world forever and especially with
developer tools we all know they've got
great developer programs and they're
doing some really neat stuff now IBM IBM
is one of the original founders of dojo
which was one of the original JavaScript
frameworks now they're doing mostly
angular stuff these days but dojo still
around Salesforce they have lightning
components in their lightning system
it's kind of a more proprietary thing
but it is based off of an open source
library or framework that they pushed
out si P did si P open UI v and they
push that to the Apache foundation not
too long ago and ing did this really
cool thing where they created a UI
component layer over the top of angular
and they push it out called spectacular
and they push it out to open source
about three and a half years ago yeah
about three and a half years ago now it
hasn't been touched in a year and a half
unfortunately they haven't had a single
commit into the repository in about a
year and a half so it's not doing too
well right now
PayPal has cracking j/s which is a
fantastic back-end framework and it's
all open source it's based on node and
Express and then of course Oracle has
its own tool kit as well
and I'm going to show you a little bit
about Oracle jet and what it
and y-you should probably take a little
you know take a look at that so Oracle
jet jet stands for javascript extension
toolkit and if you've been in a few
different talks today with Apex and a
few others you've heard about jet being
used by a few of these different
products we created it about three years
ago and we've been using it for our own
cloud products and that's that's how
we've been building things up it's a
modular system it's built on those
open-source libraries and then jet
brings in other things around it basic
components set of course everybody has
that but we also have a very large
advanced data visualization set that's
what you've seen inside of products like
apex and so forth this happens to be a
collage of different screens off of bi
data visual visual analyzer on cloud
service this is part of the enterprise
cloud service if you go up on Oracle
today this is also enterprise this is a
back of visual analyzer again really
quick this is apex so if you go out and
you get apex 5.1 today it comes with
Oracle jet all of its data visualization
all its charts graphs gauges all kind of
stuff all provided by jet we also just
really quickly on that last one also
Solaris which Solaris isn't used by a
lot of people still but the Solaris
operating system the latest version of
their web admin console uses is
completely written in jet and use this
jet for its real-time charts and graphs
so real-time CPU utilization and
monitoring real-time hardware
temperatures and memory utilization
things like that at 20 frames per second
is streaming across live with all the
little charts just like you'd see on
Windows if you brought up your
performance monitor and stuff that's
what it's all using jet accessibility is
built in every single UI component is
fully accessible meets full I can't
lawyers or freaking right now if they
said fully accessible fully meets the
accessibility guidelines and we're very
very proud of what we've done I do
believe as open source frameworks go
we're most success
one out there 28 languages that includes
English 27 languages in English 190 plus
locales those languages include Hebrew
and Arabic so we're fully right to left
by the bi-directional language as well
so if you change the language over to
Arabic all of our UI widgets flipped for
you automatically all the CSS changes
and so forth it's mobile ready so every
single UI component that we have is
touch enabled and gesture enabled no
matter because even desktops today are
touching and gesture not just phones we
produce native themes for iOS Android
and Windows
typical mobile paradigms the drawers
pull the Refresh pull the Refresh is
actually implemented as just a drop
region so you could actually put
pull-to-refresh on anything like just a
div in your any element and then the
callback function is what gets called
whenever so you say what it does when
you pull down on it
same thing with swipe to reveal
everything is just a callback function
you define what it does in the end our
ListView has sticky headers as you
scroll up it'll you know keep the header
we've got an indexer that's actually a
separate module that you attach in two
different data sources so it works great
on something like a ListView but it
would also work on other other tree
types of things pull through a lazy
loading so not only is it just lazy
loading as you're swiping down to the
little animations at the bottom are all
specific to the platform that they're on
so that one I think is iOS and there's
Android and there's Windows same thing
with animations on drills so you're
drilling down and animates
these are all just typical things you
would expect to find in mobile type
stuff it's fully open source so we
actually sit out on github under Oracle
we were open sourced under the universal
permissive license which is even more
permissive than MIT it's about one step
away from being open a public domain and
and I get people all the time that look
at it and it's like one paragraph and
they read through they're like okay this
is from Oracle where's page three four
five seven you know but it's one
paragraph it's really open source
you can learn more about us Oracle jet
